2018-12-03,"Theresa May has been warned she risks creating a ""constitutional crisis"" if the government fails to release the full legal advice it has received on the Brexit agreement thrashed out by the prime minister in Brussels.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-facing-house-of-commons-battle-over-release-of-brexit-legal-advice-11570416,"It follows a report the prime minister's Brexit negotiator told her the Irish border backstop arrangement within her agreement with the EU represents a ""bad outcome"" for the UK. In a letter to Theresa May, as seen by the Daily Telegraph, Olly Robbins warned the backstop - aimed at avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland - would mean the imposition of regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The prime minister's chief Brexit adviser said: ""We should not forget that the backstop world, even with a UK-EU customs union, is a bad outcome with regulatory controls needed somewhere between GB and NI, serious and visible frictions and process between GB and the EU, and no security co-operation provided for."" The top civil servant, who took on responsibility for negotiations with Brussels earlier this year, is also reported to have used the 19 October letter to tell Mrs May there is no legal ""guarantee"" the UK will be able to escape the backstop arrangement, if it comes into force. Mrs May hopes the UK will agree a trade deal with the EU before the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020 in order to avert falling into the backstop, or even extend the transition period if negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship drag on beyond that date. However, the backstop provision has been included in the UK's withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy in case either of those scenarios don't happen. The magic number the PM needs in order to win the crucial Commons vote on 11 December is 320 The emergence of Mr Robbins' letter to the prime minister, said to have been leaked by a ""concerned"" minister, has further fuelled demands for the government to release the full legal advice on Mrs May's Brexit deal. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will address MPs on Monday, but the government have promised only to release a ""full reasoned political statement"" on the legal advice. This is despite the House of Commons last month backing a motion to ensure the government would be required to lay before parliament ""any legal advice in full"", including that of Mr Cox's. Tory MP and former Brexit minister David Jones said: ""At this crucial moment in the Brexit process, it is essential that parliament should be as fully informed as possible on the legal issues surrounding the deal. ""These include, among others, the role of the European Court of Justice, the justiciability of the 'best endeavours' provision and whether it is possible to withdraw from the backstop without the consent of the EU."" Opposition parties are threatening to launch contempt of parliament proceedings against ministers over the issue. Labour's shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti told Sky News: ""If the government does not comply with the order the House of Commons passed on 13 November, that would be a very serious matter indeed - almost a constitutional crisis."" Even the DUP - which props up the minority Conservative government at Westminster - is said to be ready to help prompt contempt proceedings together with Labour, which would pile yet more pressure upon the prime minister with little more than a week to go before parliament votes on the deal she struck last month. Further criticism of Mrs May's deal was likely to come after the BrexitCentral website published an assessment by House of Commons legal officials which reportedly states a UK-EU customs union, as part of the backstop, would be ""a practical barrier to the UK entering separate trade agreements on goods with third countries"". US President Donald Trump recently criticised the prime minister's deal for hampering the possibility of a US-UK trade agreement. Mrs May will make her own statement to MPs on Monday following last week's G20 summit. Home Secretary Sajid Javid dismissed reports the government could pull a vote on the Brexit deal, scheduled for 11 December, amid expectations it will be rejected by MPs. He told the BBC: ""I don't think there is any chance of pulling the vote... I just don't see that happening."" Mr Javid also admitted it is ""very unlikely"" the government's plan for a post-Brexit immigration system will be published before the House of Commons vote. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News it is ""inevitable"" Labour would try to oust Mrs May if she loses the vote, which will come two days after the prime minister is due to take part in a TV debate with Jeremy Corbyn. There is still disagreement over the format of the programme, with the Labour leader indicating that he will only go with the Conservatives' preference for a BBC debate if it is a straight head-to-head. The BBC wants leaders to take questions from a wider panel and Downing Street has accused Mr Corbyn of ""running scared"" by so far refusing to sign up. Neither of the BBC or ITV proposals have proved popular with other parties, with Sir Vince Cable accusing both of excluding other viewpoints. In a letter to Sky, the BBC and ITV, the Liberal Democrat leader said: ""The principal alternative to the withdrawal agreement is for the UK to remain as a full and influential member of the European Union."" Leading Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, have also written to broadcasters to criticise the planned debate. They claim neither Mrs May nor Mr Corbyn, who both backed Remain at the 2016 EU referendum, ""can be said by any interpretation of their positions to be backing a plan that will deliver on the mandate of the 17.4million who voted Leave"". Their letter adds the views of Leave supporters ""will be nowhere represented in this prime time debate"". There will also be no room on the debate podium for SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who is travelling south to London on Monday in a bid to persuade MPs to try and secure an extension to Article 50. However, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said on Sunday he believed the government could still win the parliamentary vote next week. Mr Gove, one of the leaders of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, urged fellow Brexiteers to back the agreement warning the alternative was ""no deal or no Brexit"". He said that if the government lost the vote there was a ""real risk"" there could be a majority in the Commons for a second referendum."

Two of the birds' bodies have been examined by the RSPCA - and X-ray images revealed one of the mute swans was ""peppered with bullets"". Dave Grant, an RSPCA inspector, said: ""It's absolutely disgusting that someone would purposefully target and kill these beautiful birds, and it's heartbreaking that an entire family has been wiped out in this cruel incident."" Kent Police was called to the scene in Benenden last Sunday, and officers are assisting the RSPCA with their investigation into the attack. The RSPCA received 884 reports of air gun attacks on animals across England and Wales last year - including 51 calls from Kent. Wild birds, wild animals and cats are most likely to be injured by air guns, and the organisation is demanding regulation on the weapons be tightened. :: Anyone with information about the shooting is being asked to contact the RSPCA's appeal line on 0300 123 8018.

Lieutenant General Patrick Sanders will become commander joint forces command and Vice Admiral Timothy Fraser has been promoted to vice chief of the defence staff. The four roles are the most senior in the military below the chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nick Carter. The appointments were approved by the Queen and announced by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. Confirming the news, Mr Williamson said: ""Forward-looking and keen to modernise the Armed Forces, these are the transformational leaders we need in these challenging times. ""The appointment of a new generation of commanders will ensure that Britain remains ready to face the threats of tomorrow and continues to be a major player on the world stage."" General Mark Carlton-Smith remains the head of the army, having only recently taken over. The four new appointments will take up their posts next year, at a time when the RAF is still fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The number of British troops stationed in Afghanistan has also recently increased and Russia remains a growing threat in eastern Europe. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The chiefs of the RAF and Royal Navy might also be heading towards a showdown over future orders of the F35 stealth fighter jet, with Sky News having reported last week that there was internal friction because the RAF wanted to order a version of the jet that could not fly from the new aircraft carriers. One source told Sky News: ""This will completely undermine the whole carrier programme. ""There is no operational reason whatsoever for the RAF to have the A (land-based) variant (of the F-35). If it can't fly from an aircraft carrier, it shouldn't be purchased."""

Her death is not being treated as suspicious and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed. A spokesman for British Transport Police said: ""We were called at around 10.10pm following a report a woman had received serious head injuries while travelling on a train between Bath and Keynsham. ""Officers from British Transport Police attended along with colleagues from Avon and Somerset Police and South Western Ambulance Service, but despite their best efforts the woman died at the scene.

2018-12-03,British Cycling has introduced a new mandatory cardiac screening policy as awareness grows of the risks faced by sportspeople.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/cyclists-to-have-heart-scans-amid-cardiac-arrest-fears-11569599,"Every rider, from academy to elite level, will have an annual electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart scan to determine if they are at increased risk of suffering sudden cardiac arrest. In some cases athletes could be advised to retire if it is determined they would risk death by continuing to compete. Some experts think athletes are three times more likely than non-athletes to suffer sudden cardiac arrest. The FA, Lawn Tennis Association and Rugby Football Union already routinely scan their professional athletes but there is an increasing push for this protocol to be rolled out across sport. The screening at British Cycling is being carried out and paid for by a team from Liverpool John Moores University as part of their research into cardiac health among athletic people. Professor John Somauroo, a sport and exercise cardiologist, said: ""We know there are high profile athletes having cardiac arrests. ""But equally unfortunately there are about current thinking around 12 young athletes between the ages of 14 and 35 per week dropping dead in Britain. ""And in fact that's relatively old data and the newer data suggests that it's at least 20 young people if not even higher that are having those events per week."" He added: ""If you were to have a bus load of kids crashing into a low bridge every week and half the children were killed. ""They'd do something about the bridges or the bus routes."" This week, Northampton Town footballer Leon Barnett was forced to retire after his heart rate reached 300 beats per minute during a match. He told Sky News he felt fortunate to have had the issue identified and avert potentially devastating consequences. ""I'm a very positive person and I always think it could have been worse,"" he said, adding: ""I'm grateful that I'm still here talking and able to spend time with my family and friends."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The scan lasts for about 40 minutes and British Cycling's head of medical services Nigel Jones said all the riders had welcomed the new policy. ""In very rare instances, athletes will have a problem with their heart that we pick up on in screening and our job then is to have an informed discussion with that athlete about what potentially the risks of them continuing in elite sport are,"" he said."

After the couple lost the ring in Times Square on Friday night, they sought help from the police. Initially, officers were unable to find it, and the couple left without leaving contact information. But after further searches the next morning, officers discovered the ring and cleaned it up. Following an appeal on social media, they managed to contact John and Daniella. ""Case closed,"" officers posted, along with a picture of the couple, adding: ""Thank you, Twitter. Love, John, Daniella, and the NYPD. ""We're making arrangements to get them their ring back. Congratulations!"" ""It's just been absolutely crazy,"" Daniella told Sky News. ""I can't believe they've found the ring! It's incredible."" We would like to thank everyone who shared this story! The (now) happy couple is back in their home country, but thanks to your retweets they heard we were looking for them! We’re making arrangements to get them their ring back. Congratulations! https://t.co/rXHxxkwClm John said his ""street cred is definitely absolutely shot"". He added: ""Our friends are all talking about it on WhatsApp. They spotted the NYPD Twitter post first and said, 'Is that you guys? What happened?' That's how we found out."" The couple were in New York for their 10-year anniversary. John had been carrying the ring around with him as they took in the sights, ""constantly tapping my jacket pocket just to make sure it was still there"". He said: ""We went all over the place - the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, Central Park - everything was just so busy, there were so many people everywhere and I was trying to find that right moment, you know? The couple that lost their engagement ring in Time Square on Friday night has been found. A special thank you to #NYPD ESU Det. Bucchignano & Glacken for their extra effort, they returned the next morning & were able to recover the💍 in a subway grading. Congrats  & Best of Luck! pic.twitter.com/ShUnJTYuB9 ""Then on Friday we went back to Central Park. Daniella was running and jumping through the leaves, and that's when I proposed. She'd only had the ring a matter of hours and then it was gone. ""On Saturday morning we couldn't bring ourselves to walk back past that drain. We just said, 'We're not ready for that yet.'"" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Daniella said: ""We thought - we can't tell anyone what happened! We can't tell our family, although we can tell them now it's been found."" The officers ""will definitely be getting a mention at the wedding"", John said. ""We cannot thank the people of New York or the police enough."""
2018-12-03,"Dozens of current and former Ted Baker employees have accused the fashion brand's founder of implementing a regime of ""forced hugs"" and harassment.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/ted-baker-employees-complain-of-founders-awkward-hugging-policy-11569607,"More than 60 people have reportedly come forward to launch an online petition detailing employees' alleged experiences with Ray Kelvin, 62, calling for the company to end its ""awkward hugging policy"". The complainants claim Kelvin would give unwanted hugs, shoulder massages and kisses on the back of their ears at the firm's London head office. The petition, which is understood to be backed by almost 200 current or former employees, said the ""inappropriate"" forced hugging was ""part of a culture that allows harassment to go unchallenged"". It called for ""a way of reporting harassment to an independent, external body"" and claimed ""HR has done nothing with the reports of harassment"". ""Directors who abuse their power should be held to account,"" the employees added. ""Harassment at Ted Baker is well documented but wilfully ignored by those in charge. ""It's time to break the silence."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The petition website purported to quote several unnamed current and former employees detailing their experiences. ""The CEO always wants a hug from every member of the staff,"" said one. ""It's very uncomfortable and unnecessary, a simple handshake can be okay. He has kissed the back of the ears of some of the people that work there too."" Another said: ""I've seen the CEO ask young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears."" A third added: ""Forced hugs and kisses. Invitations to star in porn movies with Ray [the CEO] in the middle of the office in front of everyone."" Ted Baker said it would make sure an independent investigation was carried out. In a statement, it said: ""While the claims made are entirely at odds with the values of our business and those of our CEO, we take them very seriously. ""Ray greets many people he meets with a hug - be it a shareholder, investor, supplier, partner, customer or colleague. ""Hugs have become part of Ted Baker's culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon."""

In his second major speech since becoming head of the Secret Intelligence Service four years ago, Mr Younger urged ""Russia or any other state intent on subverting our way of life not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities, or those of our allies"". He described how MI6 helped expose the perpetrators said to be behind the Salisbury nerve agent attack and how it helped co-ordinate the expulsion of Russian diplomats. He also told students that Britain is ""well-equipped"" to counter those who launch attacks on Britain in ways that fall short of traditional warfare, such as cyber attacks and the spreading of disinformation. He said: ""The degree of interconnectedness between nations, people and systems today, the ubiquitous nature of information and the exponential pace of technological change, are making the work dramatically more complicated."" He added: ""The era of the fourth industrial revolution calls for a fourth generation of espionage: fusing our traditional human skills with accelerated innovation, new partnerships and a mindset that mobilises diversity and empowers the young."" Mr Younger also highlighted the strengthening of security ties in Europe ahead of Brexit and spoke about how working with other intelligence services had disrupted ""multiple"" planned attacks by Islamic State overseas. And in a direct appeal to students, Mr Younger called for the need for diversity in MI6. ""I want to speak to young people who have never seen themselves in MI6,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter where you are from. If you want to make a difference and you think you might have what it takes, then the chances are that you do have what it takes, and we hope you will step forward."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Mr Younger also addressed the release of British academic Matthew Hedges after he was charged with spying and jailed in the UAE. The UK rejects the claims made against him. He said: ""We're delighted to see him back in the UK but we're perplexed by what happened and I genuinely don't know how our Emirati partners came to the conclusion they did. There are some frank discussions ahead."" Commenting on the fight against Islamic State, he confirmed that foreigners working for the British government had lost their lives keeping the UK safe. ""We have asked our agents - the people who agree to work for MI6 - to do extraordinary things and run great risks,"" he said. ""And I will not hide from you that some have paid the ultimate price. Our country and our allies owe them a debt they can never truly know and never fully repay."""

In an Instagram post telling customers ""this.is.not.a.joke"", the cafe - which uses avocados in some of its most popular dishes - said the demand for the fashionable ""superfood"" was driving criminal cartels in Mexico. Wild Strawberry, which reportedly serves up 1,000 avocados a week, said it ""thought long and hard"" but wanted to keep its focus on locally sourced ingredients while addressing the issue of food miles and sustainability.  Dear customers, we have some news for you. As of today, we will no longer be serving avocado in the yurt. This.is.not.a.joke. 🥑 Controversial? Absolutely...We’re as acquainted as the next person to our weekly intake of smashed avocado toast but this is something we have thought long and hard about. Let us explain... 🥑🥑 1. Seasonality. Locally sourced ingredients have been woven into our identity from day one. Whether it’s our home grown courgettes, apples or pumpkins, our menu flexes with the seasons as we let the produce of the Chilterns and surrounding areas inspire and inform our recipes. All our meat is sourced within 25 miles, we use local yoghurt, eggs, Chiltern rapeseed oil, to name but a few. There will always be exceptions, we do not claim never to use a pinch of an Indian spice, a drizzle of Italian olive oil, or a crumble of Greek feta. These are all beautiful things and arguably there is not a local alternative, nor would we want one. Our cooking is inspired by many of the cuisines of the world and it would be contrite to think it should be any other way. However, the sheer quantity in which avos were being consumed was making us feel uneasy as they were so at odds with our local ethos. We believe in this and want to truly practise what we preach. 🥑🥑🥑 2. Food miles. it doesn’t take a genius to work out that food tastes better when it hasn’t been flown 5000 miles. But more importantly, at a time when climate change concerns have never been more real, transporting ingredients in fuel guzzling planes from Central and South America, Africa and beyond just to satisfy our whim for the latest food trend, when we have a plentiful supply of perfectly delicious, nutritious food on our doorstep is just plain wrong. 🥑🥑🥑🥑 3. Sustainability. The Western world’s obsession with avocado has been placing unprecedented demand on avocado farmers, pushing up prices to the point where there are even reports of Mexican drug cartels controlling lucrative exports. Forests are being thinned out to make way for avocado plantations. Intensive farming on this scale contributes to greenhouse emmisions by its very nature & places pressure on local water supplies. A post shared by  Wild Strawberry Cafe (@wildstrawb_cafe) on Nov 26, 2018 at 10:15pm PST It said: ""At a time when climate change concerns have never been more real, transporting ingredients in fuel guzzling planes from Central and South America, Africa and beyond just to satisfy our whim for the latest food trend, when we have a plentiful supply of perfectly delicious, nutritious food on our doorstep, is just plain wrong.""

""Forests are being thinned out to make way for avocado plantations. Intensive farming on this scale contributes to greenhouse emissions by its very nature and places pressure on local water supplies."" In 2016, Greenpeace Mexico said people were likely to suffer too due to the ""high use of agricultural chemicals and the large volumes of wood needed to pack and ship avocados"". According to a 2012 report by Mario Tapia Vargas, a researcher at Mexico's National Institute for Forestry, Farming and Fisheries Research, avocado production in Michoacan tripled and exports rose tenfold between 2001 and 2010. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The research suggested it caused a loss of forest land of about 690 hectares (1,700 acres) a year between 2000 and 2010. Wild Strawberry owner Katy Brill told the Mail on Sunday that the move could turn out to be ""the worst business decision I have ever made"" but said her customers supported her decision. She has now replaced avocados with sauteed garlic mushrooms. Others to drop avocados include the Wildflower restaurant in south London and the Tincan Coffee cafe in Bristol, which replaced the item with pea guacamole."

The London mayor is due to meet Home Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday to discuss police funding for 2019-20, but as it stands the Met is required to make a further £335 million worth of savings by 2022, the mayor's office said. Mr Khan said that was £10m more than previous forecasts suggested, even though the latest calculations took into account plans to increase the policing element of council tax in the capital by 5.1% - or £12 per household. That would raise an extra £49m, which is enough to employ 800 officers, although it falls well short of the £104m bill - equivalent to more than 1,700 officers - to be commanded by a 2020 increase to the annual pension bill at Scotland Yard. Mr Khan said if the Met was made to cut its budget further, it would make it far more difficult to combat a sharp rise in violent crime recorded in London this year. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""The causes of violent crime are extremely complex, but there is no doubt it has been made far worse by huge government cuts to the police and youth services,"" he said. ""Even the home secretary has finally admitted that the Met won't be able to tackle violent crime without more funding from the government. Now we urgently need to see action to avoid officer numbers falling even further. ""Government cuts have led to London losing 3,000 police officers and more than 3,000 PCSOs and 5,000 police staff and I'm genuinely concerned about how we keep Londoners safe with officer numbers as low as 26,800. ""Ministers need to reverse the £1 billion savings forced on the Met and reverse their cuts on youth services and other preventative services so that we can keep our city safe."" Sky News reported last week that police forces across England and Wales could see a £600m funding boost from April 2019, with the home secretary having cut a deal with Chancellor Philip Hammond and James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, to double the amount that local authorities can add to council tax bills for policing. Mr Khan dismissed the figure as insufficient to cope with the upsurge in violence on the streets, which is believed to have resulted in well in excess of 100 murders in London so far this year."
2018-12-03,"Parents should not expect schools alone to tackle problems including knife crime, obesity and toilet training, the chief schools inspector is expected to say.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/parents-should-not-abdicate-responsibilities-ofsted-chief-11569429,"While delivering her annual Ofsted report on Tuesday, Amanda Spielman will say that schools cannot be a ""panacea"" to all ""societal ills"". She believes that expectations on schools to solve such problems risks distracting teachers from their core purpose - of teaching children. She will urge health professionals, parents and safeguarding partners to all play a role in protecting, educating and preparing children for adult life. ""Our education and care services don't exist in isolation from the local areas they serve,"" Ms Spielman is expected to say. ""They are and should be a central part of our communities. But being part of a community means being very clear what your responsibilities are, and what issues, however worthy, can only be tackled beyond the school, college or nursery gates."" Ms Spielman will argue that a range of partners and agencies should work together to tackle the rising problem of knife crime. ""Most of our schools are safe, and we fully support measures, including zero tolerance policies on the carrying of knives, to keep them that way,"" she will say. ""But beyond that, while schools can play a role in educating young people about the danger of knives, they cannot be a panacea for this particular societal ill."" Ms Spielman will highlight that almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese by the start of primary school, rising to over a third by the time they leave Year 6. According to Ofsted research, there is ""no discernible link"" between school interventions and obesity rates. ""It is an issue which sits largely beyond the school gates,"" Ms Spielman will say. ""Yes, schools can and should teach children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise in line with their core purpose; their PE lessons should get them out of breath. ""But beyond that, schools cannot take over the role of health professionals - and above all parents. ""The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents should not abdicate their responsibility here."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? In a further challenge to parents, Ms Spielman will say there is growing evidence of children arriving at reception unable to use a toilet. ""This is difficult for teachers, disruptive for other children and has a terrible social impact on the children affected. This is wrong,"" she will say.

New MS Society research released on Monday to coincide with the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, claims that three in five people with MS feel lonely because of their condition - 12 times the figure in the general population (5%). A total of 58% say they feel isolated because of MS, and more than 40% say they have felt both. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Ed Holloway, MS Society director of services and support, said: ""Anybody can be lonely, but we know from our research that loneliness is an issue which disproportionately affects people living with MS. ""The MS Society offers a whole host of support, including a free helpline, information and grants. Our local groups are based all around the UK, and provide friendship, social events and support to those affected by the condition. ""To think 60% of people with MS are lonely is shocking and we hope to encourage people to get in touch with us and join the fantastic community that's out there."" Dee Dee Morgan is one of more than 100,000 people in the UK with MS. A hundred more are diagnosed every week. Living alone in London, and with mobility issues, she knows all too well how the illness can take its toll mentally as well as physically, and how easy it is to lose touch with society. ""MS can be very lonely,"" she says. ""Before MS, a lot of my social life was linked to work, so when I had to stop working that was a big loss. I got more free time but a lot of that was spent stuck in the house. My family aren't round the corner, and they've all got busy lives so it's not easy to drop everything. I have a carer who comes regularly and a few close friends, but don't often want to go out, so unless people come to visit me I spend a lot of time by myself."" Along with a TV and online campaign, the MS Society have commissioned a photography exhibition, in partnership with Mumford and Sons bassist Ted Dwane, whose mother Sarah has MS. They hope the exhibition, called The MS Connection, will give an insight into the lives of those with the disease. Dwane says: ""Mum was diagnosed at around the time I started touring, and my sister moved to Australia. It was a period of huge change for my parents and we weren't there for them in the way we wanted to be. I'm still away a lot, but back then it was especially hard because my parents were just coming to terms with the diagnosis. ""Having the right support can change everything, and ultimately both my sister and I made a conscious decision to move back closer to home. A lot of people with MS simply don't have that network, and can end up feeling totally left out of society."" :: The exhibition is on at The Sidings in Southwark, London, and is expected to go on a tour of galleries around the country next year."
2018-12-03,"Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has urged the public to remain vigilant following claims a Russian journalist was monitored for ""suspicious behaviour"" near a British military base.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/warning-after-russian-journalist-monitored-for-suspicious-behaviour-near-uk-military-base-11569451,"The minister's warning comes after a man was reportedly seen repeatedly going past the 77th Brigade's barracks in Hermitage, Berkshire. He is said to have been recorded by security cameras and was allegedly filming close to the base's perimeter fence, according to the Mail on Sunday. ""We take the security of our bases and personnel incredibly seriously,"" said Mr Williamson. ""If a member of the public sees anyone acting suspiciously in or around a military base it should be reported to the police as a matter of urgency."" The reports follow increasing tensions between London and Moscow over the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury earlier this year. The UK accused Russia's GRU military intelligence agency of being behind the attack, while Moscow repeatedly rejected the claims. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? General Mark Carleton-Smith, the new head of the British Army, issued a warning last month, saying Russia posed a greater threat to national security than terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State. The 77th Brigade, modelled on the specialist Chindits unit which fought in Burma during the Second World War, was set up in 2015 consisting of soldiers with propaganda, political activism and social media skills. When it was set up, the army said the unit was created ""to draw together a host of existing and developing capabilities essential to meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare"". It added: ""It recognises that the actions of others in a modern battlefield can be affected in ways that are not necessarily violent."""

""It's not a humanitarian crisis, it's an epidemic now,"" founder and Everton fan Dave Kelly told Sky News. ""We don't want to be doing this but it just keeps getting worse. Personally I believe it is the government's responsibility to look after its citizens, not football fans."" Liverpool fan and co-founder Ian Byrne said: ""People are slipping through the gaps. All this is is a sticking plaster but we are doing what we can. ""The rollout of Universal Credit is a political decision out of our hands at the moment, but we will rally against it because it is no good for our communities."" He added: ""A lot of the politicians are burying their heads in the sand."" Sky News obtains data revealing a stark increase in Universal Credit claimants struggling to pay for housing and food The full rollout of Universal Credit - the new system which is designed to simplify the benefits system - starts this Wednesday for many parts of Liverpool, which means some families will go through the changeover during the Christmas period. Under current waiting times, if people are moved on to the new system this week, they may not get their first Universal Credit payment until the New Year. At the Charles Thompson Mission in Birkenhead, they have helped the very poorest in society for the past 130 years. They too have seen an increase in the numbers using their centre, where people can access a hot meal, get a wash, a haircut or just support and advice. Dan, in his late 50s, told Sky News his problems with Universal Credit started when the murder of a neighbour meant he missed two appointments. His payments were then stopped and he was thrown out of his flat. He now has nowhere to live and has to scavenge through charity shop bins. ""I lost my flat and I lost all hope then,"" he said, ""We are going back to the 70s, we really are, I remember me mam going through all the power strikes and that - that's the atmosphere we are getting again. ""It is going up in flames. The whole system is - for the poor. It's keeping us down."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Dave Fitzpatrick, who runs Sunday morning sessions at the centre in Birkenhead, told Sky News: ""I had a primary school teacher who has two kids herself knock on my door just yesterday asking for help. ""We have plenty of money to build nuclear submarines, to put royal weddings on, but we don't have the ability to make sure people are looked after. In 2018 that's a disgrace."" A spokesperson from the Department of Work and Pensions said: ""The reasons for people using food banks are complex, and it would be wrong to link a rise to any one cause. ""No one should have to face hardship with Universal Credit and we have made up to 100% advances available from day one. ""For families that need extra support we are spending £90 billion a year on working-age welfare."" The department added that it had recently announced a ""£39m partnership with Citizens Advice to support vulnerable people to make and manage their Universal Credit claim"". New work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, has vowed to listen and learn from experts, and to ensure that Universal Credit is part of a ""fair, compassionate and efficient welfare system""."
2018-12-03,"You don't hear much about data in the Brexit debates, but, for the government, it's a crucial factor in the UK's ongoing relationship with the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/the-brexit-culture-wars-have-come-to-tech-11568221,"In her Mansion House address in March, Theresa May made it one of her five tests for a future trading relationship. ""The free flow of data is also critical for both sides in any modern trading relationship,"" she said, announcing her determination to secure a deal that keeps data flowing after the UK leaves the EU. Back then, the UK was determined to have its own special deal, which went far beyond the standard arrangement known in the jargon as data adequacy. Since that time, horizons have narrowed. In Mrs May’s deal, the EU has committed to grant the UK adequacy status by the end of 2020 ""if the applicable conditions are met"". The government was so proud of this achievement, it made it the second item in its political declaration on 22 November 2018. The trouble - as the wording suggests - is that the UK is dependent on the EU's assessment of its data protection and data security practices. That's why, when I asked Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, about the arrangement, he couldn't give a guarantee. ""We are waiting for their assessment but we have every reason to expect that we will be found adequate,"" he told me. Mr Wright was visiting a co-working space, attempting to reassure the tech sector that the prime minister’s Brexit deal answered their concerns. ""On some of the most important concerns that businesses in the tech sector have got this deal answers those,"" he said. ""I think people are starting to recognise that that’s reassuring and the alternatives are far, far worse."" It was a tough crowd for Mr Wright. This week, almost 2,500 tech investors and entrepreneurs signed a Best for Britain and Tech for UK letter calling for a People's Vote - including the CEO of the co-working space Mr Wright was visiting. ""There are some people who want to see if we can reverse the decision, because obviously that would be ideal, and they should push for it,"" Natasha Guerra told me. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The Tech for UK letter is part of a growing movement within the tech sector, placing itself in opposition to the dominant lobby group, TechUK. ""Anyone claiming out there that they're the voice of tech aren't,"" said Reshma Sohoni, co-founder of Seedcamp. ""They might be the voice of IT, or big companies, but it's not tech."" Could the newly-awakened movement succeed? With nine in 10 startups dying before they ever get funding, the entrepreneurs say they're used to impossible odds. ""That’s what startups do, try and break things,"" Ms Guerra said. That is, if Brexit doesn't break the tech scene first. One thing's for sure: after years of dodging political controversies, the Brexit culture wars have come to tech."

2018-12-03,The biggest mystery as we fly back from an intriguing G20 summit in Argentina is why Theresa May's team seem so zen about a coming heavy defeat in the most important Commons vote in a generation. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/pms-team-zen-as-they-face-heavy-defeat-on-brexit-11569370,"She is on a raft heading at speed off the political equivalent of this nation's Iguazu Falls. ""There's no plan B, there really isn't,"" some of her team say. And she almost confirms the same in interviews, saying she has seen no alternative. Asked by the travelling media what her legacy would be if she was forced out in the next few weeks, she engaged with the question, sounded defiant, but mentioned nothing beyond April. ""There is a lot more for me still to do, not least delivering on Brexit and being the prime minister that does take the United Kingdom out of the European Union."" Despite some ostensibly supportive words from the prime ministers of Japan and Australia, praising her resolve, and warning Britain to avoid ""no deal"", the news at home got worse: :: Sam Gyimah's resignation was brutally timed and executed, robs the PM of another vote, and now means there is a team of smart, skilled, motivated young ex-ministers with the bit between their teeth on pausing Brexit, and pushing a new exit referendum. :: Sky News' story that even a large proportion - at least a third, and perhaps half of the MPs she has appointed as personal prime ministerial trade envoys for these post-Brexit trade deals - will vote against her deal. :: And three envoys told Sky News that preparations for talks in April were thrown into disarray by her withdrawal deal. There were also concerns that her plans to maintain free-flowing trade with Europe would limit the ability to include goods in new third-party trade deals. When I asked her about whether she had the scope to do proper trade deals with goods included in an interview on Friday, she fudged the issue. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? When I asked her again if she had really been talking with world leaders at the G20 about trade deals involving goods (deals that would surely be incompatible with the customs union backstop) she seemed to say something new. She said a Chequers-style arrangement would allow us to join the new Trans Pacific Partnership but then added ""don't forget that what's important about world trade is that trade and the future of trade is about more than goods"". This was a heavy hint that her plan would be for restricted trade deals, albeit covering the bulk of our economy - the services sector, but not goods. Why? Because of alignment with the EU in goods to keep the Irish border open, and frictionless free trade in manufacturing industry parts. Some clarity on the trade-offs, at last. All this amid the threat of a giant trade war between the US and China - big enough but not the issue of the day for a prime minister now heading back to Britain to the start of the meaningful vote debate. Awaiting her are huge and historic parliamentary decisions with numbers even more difficult now than when she arrived at the summit two days ago. And it is uncertain if those numbers will even stay the same during her 13-hour flight home."

2018-12-03,The Favourite lived up to its name by scooping a record 10 honours at the 21st annual British Independent Film Awards (BIFA).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181203084317/https://news.sky.com/story/the-favourite-dominates-with-10-gongs-at-the-british-independent-film-awards-11570391,"Olivia Colman claimed the best actress gong, while Rachel Weisz took best supporting actress in the female-focused costume drama based on the court of Queen Anne. Colman maintained her perfect record of winning at BIFA every time she has been nominated, making this her fourth trophy in a row. Her prize was awarded to her by actor Josh O'Conner, who will play Prince Charles opposite her Queen Elizabeth in the next series of The Crown. Colman later joked that you simply cannot compare the two Queens, and also accepted Weisz's statue on her behalf, taking a cardboard cut-out of the actress's face up on stage with her. The stunt mirrored Weisz's acceptance speech at last week's Gotham Independent Film awards in New York, where she took masks of her two female co-stars to collect the award for best ensemble performance. Speaking about the timely nature of a film with all-female leads, Colman said it was just chance that it followed the Me Too movement, as it had been in development for years. As to whether Me Too still has work to do, she told Sky News: ""Are we all equal yet? Is pay equal yet? So of course it's all still in the running. Until all the things are the same, it's still in the running."" Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos won best director for the film, which also won best screenplay and best independent film at the glittering ceremony in Old Billingsgate in east London. The movie had won its first five BIFA craft awards earlier this month. Away from The Favourite, the film American Animals took home two awards, with director Bart Layton taking home debut screenwriter award. Layton, who previously won best debut director at the BIFAs for The Imposter, told Sky News: ""You win that and people say, 'We're expecting great things from you', which is great, but then you hope you'll prove that faith in you. ""So when you get something like this, I guess it feels good, because I feel like I must have got something right."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Joe Cole, who won best actor for his role as an English boxer in a Thai prison in A Prayer Before Dawn, told Sky News he trained a lot for the physical film, admitting ""I spent a lot of time getting beaten up by various Thai guys every day."" Jessie Buckley, who took home the most promising newcomer award for film Beast, said she was so excited she wanted to ""take all her clothes off and run around the room just to find out if it's really happened"". However, she said the award wouldn't be going to her head as being ""the youngest of five siblings, being from the mountains and having good people around"" means she stays fully grounded. Describing showbiz as ""a crazy industry where you can get swamped by stuff"", she said she would ""absolutely not"" consider moving to Hollywood. Dame Judi Dench collected the Richard Harris Award for her outstanding contributions as a British film actor. The 81-year-old joked with Sky News that she was planning on putting the award in front of her Oscar at home. Talking about her previous film roles, she admitted she hadn't realised at the time how ahead of the game the role of M in James Bond was. Flanked by Cary Fukunaga - who will direct the next Bond movie - she explained that the MI6 boss was very special to her. She said: ""In a way, I thought it was a joke when I was asked to do it. My husband, who was alive at the time, said you've got to do it because I've got to live with a Bond woman. Oh, I had the most glorious time."" Dame Judi also said that despite an illustrious career spanning more than 60 years, the nerves still kicked in when it came to collecting prizes. Describing it as ""a nightmare"", she said: ""People say you must be very at ease making speech, but that's not my job. My job is pretending to be someone else and trying to deliver someone else's lines."" Star Wars actress Felicity Jones was handed the other special gong of the night - the Variety Award, which recognises Britons who have made an impact overseas. The 35-year-old joked that ""global impact"" sounded worryingly like global warming, saying she had spent weeks getting her head around exactly what she was being honoured for."

The NHS is not funding the treatment, so she is having to pay £2,500 for three months' treatment herself. She hopes that if she can show it is helping her chronic pain, it could ""open the floodgates"" for the government to decide to pay for the treatment for herself and others. ""In terms of money this is going to cost me everything I have, so two and a half grand for three months' supply,"" she said in a Facebook video. ""The reason I'm putting this on the line is I feel this is a route to getting an NHS prescription."" The drug is having to be imported from the Netherlands and Ms Barton is unsure when she will be able to collect her medication - which consists of two flower-based cannabis products. She will take a gramme of each product every day. Ms Barton said doctors need clearer guidelines on when and how they can prescribe the drug, and she is also worried a ""two-tier system"" will emerge where people who cannot afford to pay for the treatment have to continue buying it illegally. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""I shouldn't realistically have to pay this amount of money,"" she said. ""It's going to last me three months and then I'm back in the same situation... I will be back to being a criminal unless i can convince the NHS specialist to rewrite the prescription."" Talking to Sky News last month, she described how she has previously had to go out ""in agony in the dark"" to buy the drug from strangers. Ms Barton said the high cost of the drug is down to the cost of importing it and that the cannabis flower itself - produced by Dutch company Bedrocan - only costs around six euro a gramme. Doctors got permission to prescribe cannabis products on 1 November after a summer of campaigning by parents including Charlotte Caldwell, whose son Billy has severe epilepsy. She went to Canada to procure the cannabis oil she says controls his seizures, but was not allowed to bring it back into the UK. Her fight to keep the drug led to a policy review by Home Secretary Sajid Javid who brought in the law change after advice from experts on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and the UK's chief medical adviser. The new guidelines say doctors should only prescribe cannabis-based medicine if other options have been exhausted, for conditions including rare childhood epilepsy and multiple sclerosis as well as to help deal with nausea from chemotherapy drugs."

Mr Corbyn has said he will go with the Tory preference for a BBC debate if it is a straight head-to-head after previously indicating a preference for a similar ITV proposal. But the BBC offer also involves leaders taking questions from a wider panel and a Number 10 spokesman said they are sticking with that plan. ""A week ago, the PM challenged Jeremy Corbyn to a head-to-head debate. He accepted,"" the spokesman said. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""Since then, in order to accommodate his confected demands, we've moved our preferred day, accommodated the addition of social media questions at Labour's request, and agreed there should be maximum head-to-head time, while still including voices from employers and civil society in the debate. ""But if Jeremy Corbyn doesn't agree to what's now on the table - a debate on prime time with the prime minister - the public will rightly conclude he's running scared. So let's get on with it."" Labour, however, says it is the PM who is trying to avoid confrontation. ""As she did during the general election campaign, Theresa May is running away from the scrutiny of a real head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn,"" a spokesman said. ""Why else would she not accept ITV's offer of a straightforward head-to-head debate, as Jeremy has done? ""Instead, her team are playing games and prefer the BBC's offer, which would provide less debating time and risk a confusing mish-mash for the viewing public."" Sky News has been campaigning for leaders debates to become a regular fixture of election time and a petition supporting the move has more than 106,000 signatures. Leading Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, have written to Sky, the BBC and ITV to criticise the planned debate. They claim neither Mrs May nor Mr Corbyn, who both backed Remain at the 2016 EU referendum, ""can be said by any interpretation of their positions to be backing a plan that will deliver on the mandate of the 17.4million who voted Leave"". Their letter adds the views of Leave supporters ""will be nowhere represented in this prime time debate"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also opposes the proposal for the discussion on the basis that Remainers are being excluded.

Sir Martin told Sky's Ian King he was sad about his acrimonious exit from the company after its board launched a probe into an allegation of improper personal conduct. But he said he did not feel wounded by lurid coverage of the episode, adding that an investigation had found ""nothing material"" and that he was a ""good leaver"" from the company. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Sir Martin also offered his thoughts on Brexit. The businessman, a Remain supporter who backs a second referendum, warned that major investment decisions would not be made amid the current uncertainty. He felt that Theresa May's deal was ""not the right way"", adding: ""I find it a little bit ironic that we're being told to take this deal because there's nothing else on offer. ""We should take the very best deal we can possibly negotiate, not the only one that we were able to negotiate."" But he said the view in the City was that the deal could pass the House of Commons on a second attempt - with ""modifications"". Sir Martin also explained why, at 73, he had no plans to stop working. ""I can't see myself retiring to the beach or the golf course,"" said Sir Martin. ""I think golf is for old men. I really want to remain active."" Sir Martin likened his departure from WPP to being ""ejected or electrocuted"" and said it ""hasn't been an easy six months"" as he builds his new business. Since his departure, his new venture S4 Capital has bought Dutch digital agency MediaMonks and this week agreed to acquire San Francisco-based programmatic ad firm MightyHive in a $150m (£118m) deal. He described the venture as a ""peanut"" which has now ""morphed into a coconut"" with the latest deal. Sir Martin said he was now ""three quarters or seven eighths"" through the process of building up the business, telling Sky News: ""The train set is almost complete."" He said he was ""sad about it"" when asked about his exit from WPP - in which he remains a major shareholder - and noted that it had just seen ""another lurch downward"" in its share price. Sir Martin suggested that his new venture, with revenues of $150m, could hardly be compared with WPP's $20bn (£15.7bn) - though he admitted that they ""do collide"" and had done so over both his acquisitions. ""I guess it's 2-0 halfway through the first-half of the match,"" he said. ""It's not personal… if ever there was a revenge element to it, the challenge is to build the new age, new era model that will be successful."""

After being voted down, the six-page document, a letter written to Mrs May on 13 November, was released shortly after 11.30am on Wednesday. Its warnings seem to be far starker than the 43-page ""summary"" seen earlier this week.

In a letter to the secretary of state Amber Rudd MP, he said: ""We have families experiencing poverty on an unprecedented scale and now facing further avoidable hardship in the run up to Christmas. ""I have now been informed that job centres across Liverpool are advancing payments to my constituents to obtain provisional driving licences for the purposes of identification and then deducting the cost from their benefits. ""Constituents are also having to pay for postal orders, passport photographs and postage, just to obtain provisional licences."" He explained that the DVLA says there is a five-week wait for provisional licences, and highlighted the delays before the first proper payments are made when someone is transferred on to Universal Credit. The controversial new single benefit is designed to simplify the system and is being rolled out in many parts of Liverpool this week. Mr Carden added: ""Continuing with this roll-out will leave many of the most vulnerable families in Liverpool Walton destitute by Christmas and I am therefore asking you to intervene as a matter of urgency."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? In response to the letter a DWP spokeswoman told Sky News: ""Having ID is not a requirement for those making a Universal Credit claim but it does make the process easier. ""If customers don't have any ID we can reimburse the cost if they choose to apply for a passport, driving licence or long birth certificates."" The department spokeswoman was unable to confirm if job centres had told people the costs of a provisional licence would be deducted from future benefits payments but said people should not be out of pocket. The DWP has also vowed to improve the support available to Universal Credit claimants."
2018-12-05,Scores of suspected members of Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia have been arrested in coordinated raids across Europe.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/mafia-raids-across-europe-target-ndrangheta-group-11572142,"Police swooped just a day after the alleged ""godfather"" of the Sicilian mafia was arrested, along with 45 other suspected mobsters. Early-morning raids took place in Italy, the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, as well as in Belgium and the Netherlands. Authorities said at least 84 people had been arrested, including 41 in Italy. The suspected mafioso are believed to be involved in cocaine trafficking, money laundering, violence and bribery, said Eurojust, the EU agency that coordinates cross-border crime fighting. Dutch chief public prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said police had seized about two million euros, as well as drugs including ecstasy and cocaine. Germany's Der Spiegel said 65 premises were being searched, including restaurants, apartments and offices, while Belgian media reported that arrests there were concentrated in eastern Limburg province. The raids are the culmination of an investigation codenamed Pollino, that started in 2016. European police agency Europol called it a ""decisive hit against one of the most powerful Italian criminal networks in the world"". The 'Ndrangheta - whose heartland is the southern Calabria region - is one of the three main mafia groups in Italy, along with the Sicilian mafia and the Camorra. It is the only mafia organisation operating on all continents, say prosecutors, and is believed to now be the most influential Italian organised-crime group. Despite the arrests, Italy's anti-mafia prosecutor, Federico Cafiero De Raho, said the damage to the group would be minimal. Speaking in The Hague, he said they ""are nothing for 'Ndrangheta. There are thousands of people who should be arrested and billions of euros that should be seized"". More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? On Tuesday, the man accused of being the head of the Sicilian mafia, Settimo Mineo, an 80-year-old jeweller, was pictured being led away as police on the Italian island scooped up dozens of other suspected mafia members. The country's deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, said the arrests were ""one of the biggest blows inflicted on the mafia by the state"". He added: ""Mineo had been elected 'heir' of Toto Riina [former Cosa Nostra boss] after his death. There is no more room for this type of scum in Italy."" Interior minister Matteo Salvini called the arrests ""extraordinary"" and tweeted that the police had ""dismantled the new 'dome' of the Cosa Nostra""."

2018-12-05,MPs have released documents relating to Facebook which suggest the company deliberately suffocated rivals with its business practices.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-release-secret-documents-showing-facebook-targeted-rivals-11572335,"The documents also suggest that Facebook collected user data without those users' knowledge. The chair of the committee investigating fake news, Damian Collins MP, tweeted: ""We don't feel we have had straight answers from Facebook... which is why we're releasing the documents."" The committee left an empty chair for the social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg when he refused to appear at an evidence session in Westminster last week. Not all of the documents seized by the committee have been published. I believe there is considerable public interest in releasing these documents. They raise important questions about how Facebook treats users data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market. The documents were seized in November in an unusually aggressive step by the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee. They were reportedly taken using a little-used legal power when the boss of US software company Six4Three - which is involved in court action against Facebook in the US - came to the UK on a business trip. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The release covers 250 pages including the MPs' summary and exhibits including emails from figures including Mark Zuckerberg and internal Facebook documents. According to Mr Collins' note, Facebook used analytics software to ""conduct global surveys of the usage of mobile apps by customers... apparently without their knowledge"". Facebook is accused of using this data to assess ""not just how many people had downloaded apps, but how often they used them. This knowledge helped them to decide which companies to acquire, and which to treat as a threat."" Mr Collins wrote: ""The files show evidence of Facebook taking aggressive positions against apps, with the consequence that denying them access to data led to the failure of that business."" The documents show an email sent to Mr Zuckerberg about short-form video app Vine in 2013. The email asked whether or not Facebook should shut down the access of Vine - which is owned by rival social media firm Twitter - to Facebook friends data. Mr Zuckerberg replied: ""Yup, go for it."" Mr Collins further alleged that Facebook maintained ""whitelisting agreements"" which gave select companies preferential access to valuable user data. The documents show Lyft, Netflix and Airbnb all being whitelisted. Mr Collins wrote: ""It is not clear that there was any user consent for this, nor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted or not."" The claim about whitelisting echoes the accusation made by Six4Three, from whom the documents were seized. Six4Three is currently attempting to enter these documents as evidence in its US lawsuit with Facebook. A Facebook spokesperson said: ""As we've said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context. ""We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends' data with developers. ""Like any business we had many internal conversations about the various ways we build a sustainable business model for our platform. But the facts are clear: we never sold people's data."" Neither the documents nor Mr Collins' note referenced his claim that a Facebook engineer alerted the company to the fact that three billion data points had been accessed from Russian IP addresses in 2014, as revealed during a committee hearing last week. At the time, a Facebook spokesperson said the source of the data access was ""not from Russia"", adding: ""We also determined the volume of actual calls to be around six million and that the suggestion of 'billions' was inaccurate."""

2018-12-05,It is now clear that the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave the prime minister some stark warnings about what she was signing up to in the EU withdrawal agreement.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/publishing-brexit-legal-advice-was-definitely-not-in-the-pms-interest-11572364,"His actual advice was much more negative than what was presented to MPs earlier in the week. Dated 13 November, the letter warns that the UK could remain in a customs union ""indefinitely"" amid ""repeating rounds of negotiations"". This is in contrast to the emphasis he placed on the arrangement's likelihood of being ""temporary"" in the 43-page document published on Monday for MPs to read. The letter is just six pages long. It is therefore rather baffling as to why the summary of his advice to MPs was 43 pages and included other aspects of the deal such as EU jurisdiction and the budget. Both Downing Street and DExEU (the Department for Exiting the European Union) say this single letter, which focuses on the Irish backstop, is the sum total of his written advice to Number 10 on the withdrawal bill. Aspects of his letter have done nothing to quell anger with the government from the DUP. The attorney general says that under this arrangement, Northern Ireland would be in a full customs union with the EU while the rest of the UK has a slightly different arrangement and this would lead to a ""declaration process"" at the border between the UK and the EU. Mr Cox adds: ""GB is essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB to NI."" DUP leader in the Commons Nigel Dodds describes this as ""devastating"". It is a step away from Theresa May's promise that there would be no border down the Irish Sea. In a statement about the withdrawal agreement in the Commons on 26 November - 13 days after receiving her letter from Mr Cox - Mrs May said: ""It meets our commitment to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - and also no customs border in the Irish Sea - in the event that the future relationship is not ready by the end of the implementation period."" But the scenario could get even worse from a DUP perspective. Mr Cox points out in paragraph 26 that under the withdrawal agreement the backstop protocol could be removed ""in part"" - and that the EU might argue this should be used to remove the UK from the customs union arrangement while keeping Northern Ireland fully in it. He warns: ""GB elements of the customs union fall away, leaving only NI in the EU customs territory."" Once described as ""the backstop to the backstop"", this scenario has been ruled out by the prime minister, and yet here is her attorney general warning that she has by no means seen off the threat. Mr Cox goes onto say the arbitration panel of five lawyers set up to decide on such a dispute might not be prepared to make such a ""political"" judgement. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Despite telling MPs in his summary of the legal advice published Monday that the backstop was designed to be temporary, the tone of the legal advice to the prime minister is very different. Here the attorney general is unambiguous about the potentially binding nature of the agreement. He tells Mrs May: ""Despite the statements in the protocol that it is not intended to be permanent and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took place, in whole or in part as set out therein. ""Further, the withdrawal agreement cannot provide a legal means of compelling the EU to conclude such an arrangement."" He goes on to warn: ""There is a real risk that the United Kingdom might become subject to protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations."" Mr Cox had argued that it was not in the public interest for this letter to be released. That is debatable. What's clear is it was definitely not in the prime minister's interest."

It is understood the man was waiting to pick up a pupil. ""The thoughts and prayers of the principal and all the staff are with our pupil and his family at this very sad time,"" St Mary's Grammar School said in a statement. ""Ensuring that all pupils got home safely was our absolute focus following this tragic incident."" A man in his 40s wearing a high-visibility vest, which had the word ""Security"" on the back, is being sought by detectives. Paramilitary style shootings remain a common occurrence in Northern Ireland - 20 years after the Good Friday agreement put an end to much of the violence in the country. Police have not ruled out the possibility of dissident republican involvement. Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts said: ""This man is believed to be in his 40s and was sitting in his car when he was approached by a lone gunman who shot him several times, including at least once in the head. ""This is an absolutely disgraceful and reckless act for which there can be no justification whatsoever, the act was carried out in the immediate vicinity of three schools where there were large numbers of pupils at the time and it is entirely possible that we could have had a seriously injured or dead child or children as a result of this terrible act."" Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood, of the SDLP, said it was ""absolutely sickening"" that the gun was fired in an area close to a primary and secondary school. He added: ""A number of pupils witnessed this fatality and are understandably very disturbed and frightened after this reckless act occurred nearby the school gates. ""There is absolutely no place for this in 2018; this madness belongs in the past and we cannot allow it to once again become our normality."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you?  Some children were so frightened that they were unable to make their way up the road and had to received assistance from youth workers. The school announced that it would be closed following the incident and said it would be offering counselling services to pupils. A tall metal curtain has now been erected at the scene."
2018-12-05,"Global carbon emissions are expected to rise this year to reach an all-time high, according to research released at the United Nations climate conference. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/global-carbon-emissions-expected-to-reach-all-time-high-11572339,"Scientists at the University of East Anglia and the Global Carbon Project say carbon dioxide pollution is likely to hit 37.1 billion tonnes by the end of 2018, up 2.7% on last year. It is the second year in a row that carbon emissions have increased, after three years of little or no growth. Lead researcher Professor Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, told Sky News that coal is the main cause of the rise. ""The science is clear,"" she said. ""To stop global warming the emissions of CO2 need to go down to zero. ""The faster they go down to zero the lower the risk to populations around the world. Moving out of coal has got to be a massive priority."" Scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned this year that carbon emissions need to be cut by 50% in 12 years to stand any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Any warmer and the planet's climate would become dangerously unstable. ""We are a long way from this and much more needs to be done because if countries stick to the commitments they have already made (to cut carbon emissions) we are on track to see 3C of global warming,"" Professor Le Quéré said. China remains the biggest carbon polluter, accounting for 27% of the global total, the analysis shows. The US produces 15% of the total, and the European Union takes third place accounting for 10%. The data was published in the journals Nature, Earth System Science Data and Environmental Research Letters. More than 100 leaders of political, civil and business sectors have signed a commentary on the research in Nature. Christiana Figueres, one of the co-authors and the former UN climate chief who led the Paris summit said: ""Global CO2 emissions must start to fall from 2020 if we are to meet the temperature goals of the Paris agreement, but this is within our grasp. ""We have already achieved things that seemed unimaginable just a decade ago."" The research offers a glimmer of hope. China is rapidly moving towards clean energy, with wind and solar growing 25% a year. That is partly because of technological advances and partly rising demand is reducing production costs. Robert Cyglicki, director of Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe, said: ""The economic and technological drivers are in favour of renewable resources. ""We see electricity prices from solar and wind are cheaper than coal. ""So it's a very strong signal coming from the markets, but also from the business circles. We are ready for the transformation."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? There is a deep irony that the UN climate conference is being held in Katowice, Poland's capital of coal. Around 80% of the country's electricity is generated in coal-fired power stations. Under the Polish government's energy forecast, coal would still generate 60% of its electricity in 2040. It insists that a combination of new clean coal power stations and expansion of forests can clean up the energy sector. But environmental group dismiss that claim, warning that tree planting must not be seen as a ""get-out-of-jail-free"" card."

He told the BBC at the weekend that there had been disappointment in Westminster about delays affecting London's £15bn Crossrail project, which he has chaired since 2009. The east-west railway was due to open this month but its launch has been pushed back until at least autumn next year due to delays in completing infrastructure and testing. Its budget was raised from £14.8bn to £15.4bn in July due to ""cost pressures"" - and in October the mayor of London was offered a £350m loan to cover costs caused by delays to the project. The departure of Crossrail chief executive Simon Wright was announced last month. Sir Terry became chairman of HS2 in August but there has been growing speculation that the high-speed railway will exceed its £55.7bn budget. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Sir Terry has been an integral part of Crossrail for almost a decade and I would like to thank him for his dedication and the expertise he brought to the role. ""I am also grateful to him for his work as chair of HS2 Ltd."" Allan Cook, former boss of engineering firm Cobham, has been appointed as the new chair of HS2, the DfT said.

Sky News has obtained exclusive access to people involved in this ruthless trade, from wholesalers to drugs mules. Our investigation demonstrates how this brutal business is contributing to the rise in knife crime across the UK. We started out in a ""trap house"" in north London. This is where drugs are prepared, sold and taken. Criminals exploit children as young as 12 to transport drugs between counties across the UK Here, a drug wholesaler brandishing a Rambo knife boasted that the weapon was ""just something I give to the kids who go out for me"". With money and drugs strewn across the table, his colleague explained: ""There's always problems with other dealers - so you've got to sort out your problem. ""You give the kids a weapon. They go up there and they do it. Once you've sorted out one or two problems, they tend not to come to you."" As we interviewed them, the two dealers sold crack cocaine to a 42-year-old addict - Mark Page. He said he spent all the money he had on drugs. ""Once I start I can't stop,"" he told us. Then one of the dealers gave a detailed account of how gangs within the capital are seeking out more rural markets. He said: ""Most of our business is outside of London. Me and my buddy go somewhere and find a crackhead. I'll give them some rock (crack cocaine) for their numbers, their friends. ""Once an area is established, I'll get the kids to go out there for me."" The children are paid £300 or £400 a week and age between 12 and 16. ""The younger the better,"" said one dealer, adding: ""They need money, mummy and daddy ain't got no money. So they come to uncle."" He offers an induction week for his new recruits, which he called ""boot camp"". The county line itself is a phone line, controlled by the dealer, which is sometimes given to the runner who the addicts can contact for a delivery. The wholesaler in north London said he operates ""like a pharmacy where you can get anything"". But he had a chilling warning for anyone trying to break in to his market area. He said: ""It doesn't matter who you are. If you come and step on my toes and violate our business, you're going to get shot, stabbed in the face. ""If you're a little boy or a grown man. Anyone can get it. You step on my toes you're f**ked."" This is a classic county lines operation, which police say has now become a problem in every single police force in the country and has exploded in the last five years. Sources have told Sky News that the police are expected to announce that the number of known county lines have increased by a third to 2,000. It is estimated each line can make thousands of pounds daily, creating a combined industry of £3 million a day. Some 58 vulnerable people who had been caught up in the gangs, including children, were rescued during the week-long operation Sky News can reveal that in a two-week operation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and UK police forces, more than 500 suspects have been arrested, 78 weapons seized, and 95 drug lines destroyed. More than 250 people involved in the running of drugs for the gangs have been safeguarded, including children. The violent nature of those at the centre of these operations, and the extent to which they are expanding, is at least part of the explanation for the worrying increase in knife crime across the UK. Vince O'Brien, head of drugs operations at the NCA, told Sky News: ""Clearly high levels of violence are a concern. When people get drawn into criminal gangs, then the way in which those gangs resolve the disputes between them is with violence and that's certainly part of the problem. ""One of the issues with the serious violence is violent competition between drugs gangs and stabbings, acid attacks and shootings can be part of that competition as they look to take over the market and that can be a real concern."" Zakaria Mohammed admitted running a drugs supply chain and trafficking two boys and a girl to deal on his behalf in Lincoln The former drugs lead at the NCA, Tony Saggers, has become the leading expert in this area and now advises local police forces. He said: ""County lines has become the expansion of London, in terms of the violence and knife crime and the young people involved. If you deal drugs somewhere else you cause agitation and potential violence. ""Because you are expanding a workforce and the geography of your operation - you need more people involved. You can no longer run around a London borough with six people involved if you are covering six counties and a dozen towns. ""That's where the children come in."" These wider markets are further from the reach of the metropolitan dealers who are controlling them and this brings greater levels of violence in order to maintain that control. Sky News spoke to a teenager who has been running a county line ever since being taken into care at the age of 14. The girl - known as Sarah - said she sold class A drugs such as heroin and crack and that the dealers are getting more violent and using ""guns, knives and acid"" to keep a grip on their business. On one occasion, Sarah was punished with a stabbing because her shipment was stolen from her. Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield told Sky News she was probably set up to make her feel indebted to the gang. She said this was becoming a common tactic. ""The kids who are the collateral, these aren't huge 17-year-olds with great physical presence and imposing characters, these are often small, vulnerable children who look quite meek, don't have much confidence,"" she said. ""But they are being exploited, frightened, and groomed, and also huge levels of physical violence held over them to do what they do. Most kids involved are scared stiff."" Sky News travelled with a 47-year-old woman who was a drug mule to Southend. She said she was frightened to go to the police or stop doing what she was doing, but hated being part of the drug dealing network. Upon arrival in the seaside town, Sky News spoke to several young people who said they have been approached by dealers from London asking them to get involved. They said the town had changed for the worse as a result and no longer felt safe. Kofi, 17, admitted he sometimes carried a knife. ""The town centre is such a dangerous place - I don't feel safe,"" he said. ""In a place like this, without a weapon you don't feel safe. There have been times when I've felt like I've had to."" The NCA's Vince O'Brien told Sky News county lines had been a real challenge to cope with. He said: ""The response to county lines is a complicated one. It's about the demand for drugs and it's about the way people are moving around the country. ""The Home Office has funded a new county lines coordination centre where the NCA is working with local police forces to coordinate the national effort to respond to it, to build up an intelligence picture and to understand how we can respond most effectively."" more than 90,000 people have signed the petition - have you?"
2018-12-05,"The UK could be stuck in ""repeated rounds of negotiations"" to leave the EU for years with no lawful power to exit, according to the government's legal advice.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-could-be-stuck-in-brexit-negotiations-for-years-legal-advice-warns-11572416,"A six-page document analysing the implications of Theresa May's deal warned the mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland returning could remain indefinitely. It was written by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and sent to Theresa May on 13 November, but only published on Wednesday after wrangling between MPs and the government. MPs had been left reeling by news they would only be given a 43-page summary document - and subsequently found the government in contempt of parliament for trying to keep the full advice out of the public domain. Following a trio of defeats in the Commons on Tuesday, the document was released minutes after Prime Minister's Questions began. Theresa May was switfly tackled by the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who accused of ""concealing the facts on her Brexit deal"". Mrs May rejected the claim, insisting the document contained the same information as a shortened statement by Mr Cox earlier this week. But the assurances failed to appease her government partners, with the Democratic Unionist Party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds describing the revelations for Northern Ireland as ""devastating"". He said the legal advice made it clear that the proposed backstop arrangement was ""unacceptable"" and must be defeated. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer also said that full legal advice, which runs to 33 paragraphs, revealed ""the central weaknesses in the government's deal"". In the document, Mr Cox wrote that the backstop protocol ""does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK-wide customs union without a subsequent agreement"". He said that would remain the case ""even if parties are still negotiating many years later and even if the parties believe that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement"". And in a segment that caused the most fear among MPs, the attorney general warned: ""The [backstop] would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part."" Mr Cox also warned ministers that Britain would essentially become a third country when importing goods to Northern Ireland and would become subject to additional border checks.   Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrats' spokesperson for Brexit, said such extra checks would have a huge impact on British business. He told Sky News: ""We are talking about British businesses having to complete customs checks for goods going to Northern Ireland. ""Brexit now comes with a huge impact, possibly of the break up of the United Kingdom. These arguments are now being made with rather more evidence than before the vote."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, said the government had previously refused to publish the full legal advice on the Brexit deal as a ""point of principle"". She told Sky News: ""There are conflicting constitutional principles here. Of course the House of Commons has the right... to require papers. ""But there's a really important constitutional principle whereby law officers give confidential, frank advice to government ministers. ""It's very existence isn't normally published, let alone the advice itself. ""Now, following the vote [on Tuesday]... the problem in future will be law officers will think twice about the type of advice they give to government. ""And the government will have to think very carefully about what sort of advice they ask for, for fear that the House of Commons might again in future ask for it to be fully disclosed."" Despite concerns about the ramifications of releasing the full legal advice, Mr Cox described his decision to make it available to MPs as ""exceptional"" - and said it did not set a precedent for the future. He said the use of the arcane parliamentary procedure to force the release of the document created ""constitutional tensions"" which ""are not themselves conducive to the proper conduct of public affairs"". The future of the DUP's alliance with the government does appear more clear. The pro-Brexit European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs met on Wednesday evening - and a source in the room said they were told the DUP will drop support for Mrs May if her Brexit deal gets through the Commons on 11 December. However, if the deal fails, the party plan to back her government in a confidence vote. This would scupper Labour's chances of forcing a general election if the deal does sink next week - as it is expected to. MPs spent the rest of Wednesday discussing the divorce deal - with three more days of debate before a so-called ""meaningful vote"" on 11 December."

2018-12-05,A pharmacist who strangled his wife so he could start a new life with his boyfriend has been jailed for at least 30 years,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/mitesh-patel-pharmacist-who-murdered-wife-jailed-for-30-years-11572248,"Mitesh Patel intended to move to Australia with a £2m life insurance payout. The 37-year-old injected his wife Jessica with insulin before strangling her with a Tesco bag at their Middlesbrough home - an attack he had plotted for years. He then staged a break-in to make it look like she had been killed by an intruder. Patel was found guilty on Tuesday at Teesside Crown Court. Jurors heard that the couple had been running a successful pharmacy together but their marriage had been unhappy. Patel had been seeking sex with men through the Grindr dating app and was planning to follow his boyfriend and ""soulmate"" to Australia. The jury heard that Patel had searched ""I need to kill my wife"", ""insulin overdose"", ""plot to kill my wife, do I need a co-conspirator?"", ""hiring hitman UK"" and ""how much methadone will kill you?"" on the internet over several years. After staging the break-in, Patel dialled 999 and said: ""Oh hiya, I think we've been burgled and my wife's been attacked."" During the call, despite knowing she was long dead, Patel implored her: ""No, Jess, come on baby, wake up."" During cross-examination, Patel said he had not tried CPR because he lost his ""bearings"" and panicked. Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, replied: ""And you weren't going to waste your time trying to revive the dead, were you?"" Police had also searched Patel's laptop bag after his wife's death and found syringes prepared with insulin. One was empty. In what is thought to be a legal first, detectives also used the iPhone health app to view the movements of Patel and his wife and to expose his lies. Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, had earlier told the jury that Patel stood to profit from his wife's death to the tune of £2m. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? He added: ""He was planning to use that money to start a new life in Australia shared with the person he really loved... another man named Dr Amit Patel."" The two had messaged while the Patels were on holiday in the Canaries only days before the murder. He had asked Dr Patel: ""You know this plan, do you think we will succeed?"" Dr Patel replied: ""Only you know the answer."" Ahead of Wednesday's sentencing, the victim's younger sister, Divya, made a statement in which she said Patel had ""mercilessly ignored her attempts to fight for her own life as he ended it"". She also addressed her brother-in-law in the dock. She told him: ""We do not just pray, we know, she will be free from you for ever. As will she rest in heaven, you will rot in hell."" She added: ""Everything he has done has been purely for selfish reasons. ""He could've divorced her, taken everything he wanted - he did not need to take her life, he had no right to take this evil, cruel and malicious step."""

Speaking in front of a crowd of RAF personnel and soldiers from the 2 Mercian Regiment, Prince William said: ""As we approach Christmas, Catherine and I feel strongly that praise for your work and recognition of your sacrifices is exactly what is due to you all. ""From my time in uniform, we both know a bit of what it feels like to balance your work commitments with your family life. ""You all put duty first. And so do your families, some of whom we had the chance to meet yesterday at a party at Kensington Palace. ""We know this isn't easy for you or for your wives, husbands, children, and friends back in the UK. On behalf of everyone back home, we would like to say thank you."" After attending the Queen's diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace last night, the couple flew out of RAF Brize Norton early this morning. They spent three hours at RAF Akrotiri meeting personnel and handing out presents. William and Kate were delivering cards and gifts from back home after they hosted a party at Kensington Palace yesterday for children and partners of some of those based in Cyprus. Families from RAF Marham and RAF Coningsby were invited to the palace for party games and Christmas activities. Speaking at the event, Kate said she could understand what it is like to see your loved one go away to do the job they trained for, after seeing Prince William deployed to the Falklands to fly a search and rescue helicopter - but she also admitted she couldn't imagine what it would be like to have a loved one away at Christmas. They met personnel from 11 and 31 Squadrons, operating Typhoon and Tornado aircraft, who have been flying missions in support of Operation SHADER, the UK's contribution to the ongoing campaign against Isis in Syria and Iraq. They also met personnel from the lead infantry company of 2 Mercians, who have recently been supporting Op TORAL in Afghanistan. Squadron leader Sarah Waghorn, a senior engineering officer with 11 Squadron, was one of those to get presents from home from Prince William. Talking about spending time away from her family at Christmas, she said: ""It's emotional, I think it's easier for us out here because we just muck in together. Whereas for the families at home, there's that empty chair around the table at Christmas Day where we're normally sat."" Staff sergeant David Blayney, from the Cyprus Operational Support Unit, was in the crowds with his family waiting for the Duke and Duchess. He is grateful that he will be with family this Christmas, saying: ""This year I was away for seven months on operations before moving here, so it's nice just to be back together again."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? By making the short visit to RAF Akrotiri, the couple hope to highlight the contribution and sacrifices personnel and their families make throughout the year but especially when they are separated at Christmas. About 11,000 military personnel from all three services will be deployed on operations over Christmas. A large portion of them have children who will have a parent away over the festive period. Their visit comes after weeks of stories about tensions within the royal family, especially between Meghan and Kate. It's understood that both the Sussexes and the Cambridges will be at Sandringham for the traditional royal family Christmas festivities."

Bill Farnsworth, the racecourse's general manager, said: ""Our thoughts are with the owners, trainers and stable staff of these horses."" He added the ground conditions and weather ""were ideal for racing but until we have further information it would be wrong to speculate"". Inspectors are due at the racecourse in the coming days and some of the horses are also being sent for post-mortems. Robin Mounsey, BHA head of media, added: ""The incidents at Musselburgh were extremely distressing for everyone involved in the sport, not least for the owners of the horses and the trainers and stable staff who cared for them through their lives."" As the sport's independent regulator, the BHA said it ""obviously treat issues such as this very seriously"". According to charity Animal Aid, the winner of the day's first race Kensukes Kingdom was badly lame at the finish and was later destroyed. As the afternoon progressed a further three horses died in the space of 90 minutes. Smart Ruler was seen to suddenly drop away from the other runners and collapse. Sierra Oscar was seen to pull up with a broken leg, and was also destroyed. Leather Belly was running on the final bend of the race when he also broke a leg during his second race. A total of 182 horses have died this year across in the UK - all as a result of racing. Claire Bass, Humane Society International UK executive director: ""The latest tragedy in Musselburgh that saw four horses lose their lives in just one day has surely got to signal that we need to radically reassess what we subject animals to for our entertainment. ""Horse racing isn't simply about a harmless flutter, it so often means pushing horses to the very edge of their endurance and beyond, on courses where they can have catastrophic accidents resulting in lethal injury. ""It's time we stopped exploiting animals like this for our own amusement. There are plenty of other sports to bet on that don't involve animals being whipped, breaking their bones or being shot."" Animal Aid is calling for investigations to be carried out by an independent organisation."

Police say she went missing in Sydney's northern beaches in 1982 and her body has never been recovered. An inquest in 2003 found that Dawson, a former teacher, started an affair with a 16-year-old student who moved in with him days before his wife went missing. He denies killing the mother-of-two and claims she had left the home to get some time to herself. She was aged 33 at the time. The Teacher's Pet - the podcast made by journalists from The Australian newspaper - details a troubled marriage leading up to the disappearance and scrutinises the police response to it. According to the newspaper, 27 million people have listened to the podcast worldwide. Police have been under fire over their handling of the case. Mick Fuller, the New South Wales police commissioner, recently apologised for police failings on the case during the 1980s. He said detectives had revisited the case three years ago and a ""fresh brief"" of evidence led to the arrest. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Mr Fuller said: ""That information enabled New South Wales Police to get an arrest warrant for a 70-year-old man currently living in Queensland."" He said media reports had contributed to officers gaining additional statements relating to the disappearance. The police chief added: ""What is important to me was justice for Lynette Dawson and her family, and today is an important step forward in that."" Police said Dawson was due to be extradited from Queensland to New South Wales, where he would be charged with homicide."

Detectives say the 43-year-old died instantly as a result of the gangland-style attack. Mr Donegan was sat in his Porsche at the time of the shooting, with teachers subsequently shielding the car from the hundreds of pupils who were leaving St Mary's Grammar School at the time. Footage released by the police shows a man in a high-visibility vest walking near the school - and investigators believe he concealed a gun in a bag he was carrying over his shoulder. Detective Chief Inspector Pete Montgomery said ricocheting bullets could have easily resulted in children being killed. He added: ""Children who moments before were no doubt enjoying Christmas activities in class, maybe practising for their Christmas concert or school nativity, will no longer be dreaming about Santa or presents. ""Instead they will be having nightmares about a murder in broad daylight outside their school. A place which should be a safe haven to learn and grow. ""The gunman walked past these children and fired a weapon eight times. ""It is utter madness as any one of these bullets could have ricocheted, and having been at the scene I cannot emphasise enough that it is sheer luck I am not investigating multiple fatalities."" He has appealed to anyone who saw the gunman to contact the police. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Paramilitary style shootings remain a common occurrence in Northern Ireland - 20 years after the Good Friday agreement put an end to much of the violence in the country. Police have not ruled out the possibility of dissident republican involvement. One mother who fled after seeing the gunman said her seven-year-old son was left traumatised. She told Q Radio: ""I heard about six or seven gunshots and then I heard someone screaming, my son saw it, he was able to tell me he saw a man up ahead with a hi-vis vest on, and his hood up and carrying a bag. ""He was still standing there at the time so I just turned with him (her son) and ran up the street."""

Video on social media showed supporters of both clubs trading blows in the streets before kick-off and the hostilities continued inside the ground, which hosted a total attendance of around 8,000. Staffordshire Police said ""considerable damage"" was caused to sections of the away stand, with seats, toilets and windows all broken. More than 150 officers were deployed and they used public order tactics in a bid to restore peace, but were targeted with coins and flares thrown from the terraces in response. Chief Superintendent Wayne Jones said it had been a ""challenging"" night and condemned the ""despicable behaviour"" shown by a ""large number of fans"". ""We are taking this very seriously and I expect there to be more arrests in the coming days as we examine CCTV coverage and gather evidence of the crimes committed,"" he continued. ""My officers have shown bravery and dedication tonight and the support from stewards and partners has been first class in ensuring that those intent on fighting each other were unable to do so. ""This kind of behaviour is not acceptable and I would like to reassure you that we will do all we can to bring those responsible to justice."" Pubs in Burslem - one of the six towns making up Stoke-on-Trent - had to close early as a result of the clashes, with some of the troublemakers having converged on the town centre after the game. It ended 4-0 to Port Vale, although the violence will likely outlast the result in the memories of those who were there. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Port Vale supporters' club chairman Mark Porter told Stoke On Trent Live: ""It was absolutely appalling. Some of the away fans clearly came simply to cause trouble. They were throwing bottles, lighters, coins, seats - you name it. ""Dozens of seats have been wrecked. They are an absolute disgrace to their club and should be banned."" Stoke have not yet commented on the unsightly scenes, which have so far seen 11 people arrested for a mix of public order and violence offences. Police said they age between 18 and 61 and are all from the north of Staffordshire."
2018-12-05,The debate over Theresa May's Brexit deal will resume in the Commons today after MPs mauled her plans on Tuesday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/in-contempt-pm-suffers-three-major-setbacks-as-brexit-debate-begins-11571879,"The prime minister suffered several major setbacks in a historic day for Brexit, as the biggest test of her divorce deal looms. Tumultuous events in London and Luxembourg saw: :: Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clash in the first day of a five-day debate that will either see the PM's Brexit deal accepted or rejected :: Government ministers found in ""contempt of parliament"" for the first time in history :: Powers wrestled out of Mrs May's hands if her Brexit deal is defeated on 11 December :: The BBC scrap a TV leaders' debate due to be held on Sunday :: A top EU law officer suggests the UK can stop Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50. Tuesday in the Commons was supposed to be the prime minister's showpiece - what all events since the 2016 referendum had been leading up to. Early in the morning, Downing Street trailed Mrs May's speech in advance, a declaration that MPs must accept her divorce deal with Brussels - words intended to make Tuesday's newspaper front pages. But a joint bid by six political parties, including Labour and the government's confidence and supply partners the DUP, saw all that off. They wanted to hold ministers in ""contempt of parliament"" for refusing to release the full legal advice offered on the Brexit divorce deal. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Despite a vote last month ordering it be published, the attorney general had refused to comply because it was not in the ""public interest"". The government tried to get round that by adding an amendment that kicked the decision into the long grass by referring it to a committee. But the amendment lost by 311 votes to 307 - with Tory MPs Peter Bone and Philip Hollobone joining opposition parties. With sharp gasps of breath heard through the chamber when the result emerged, more Tory MPs gave up and let the next crucial vote pass. For the first time in history, MPs found the government in contempt of parliament by 311 votes to 293. In response, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom promised that the legal advice would be published in full on Wednesday. But this was not the final significant defeat Mrs May faced, as one of her own backbenchers proposed a change to the fate of Brexit if the deal falls. Dominic Grieve, a pro-Europe Tory who served as attorney general for four years, got his amendment passed to let MPs have more of a say on Brexit plans if the prime minister's deal is defeated in parliament next Tuesday. Some 25 Conservative MPs flocked to back it, including Mrs May's close friend and former deputy Damian Green. The last time a government lost three Commons votes in a row was in 1978, according to Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary University. Moments after the trio of defeats, the prime minister took to the despatch box to open five days of debate on the final Brexit deal. She declared that the argument over Brexit had ""gone on long enough"" and that ""life depends on compromise"". Mrs May insisted the backstop that prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland after December 2020 was ""not a trick"" and that Brussels ""won't want us in there indefinitely"". She admitted her deal was not ""perfect"", but warned those planning to vote against it would ""put this country on course for no deal"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit back by calling the withdrawal agreement a ""leap in the dark"" that ""takes us no closer to understanding what the future of this country post-Brexit looks like"". He added that ""if the government can't govern... then the great British tradition is those governments resign"". Other fiery interventions saw the DUP welcome another general election and Boris Johnson vow to vote against the ""paint and plaster pseudo Brexit [where] beneath the camouflage we find the same old EU institutions"". The high-stakes debate will continue on Wednesday, Thursday, next Monday and then culminate with votes on six amendments and the final motion next Tuesday. Hopes of a face-to-face TV debate between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn on the deal were also dashed, as the BBC announced it was withdrawing its offer to host it. The prime minister had agreed to the corporation's format, but Mr Corbyn favours ITV's. Downing Street said it ""remains committed to holding a debate"" - but there are no further details of if that will happen.

The mysterious dark substances are not covered by the existing mathematical model of the universe - known as LambdaCDM - but they are known to exist because of their gravitational effects. Now scientists have proposed a new model which unifies dark energy and dark matter into a single phenomenon - a fluid which possesses ""negative mass"". Dr James Farnes, who led the team at Oxford's e-Research Centre, said: ""We now think that both dark matter and dark energy can be unified into a fluid which possesses a type of 'negative gravity'.

2018-12-05,The British student jailed for allegedly spying in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) says his interrogators asked him to become a double agent and steal government secrets during his five-month detention in an Abu Dhabi jail.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181205224221/https://news.sky.com/story/matthew-hedges-was-asked-to-become-a-double-agent-during-detention-in-uae-11571902,"Matthew Hedges, 31, was arrested at Dubai Airport on 5 May and last month was handed a life sentence after the state released a video of him purportedly confessing to being a member of MI6. He returned to the UK last week thanks to a successful campaign by his wife Daniela Tejada for the UK government to intervene, which saw Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt help secure a presidential pardon. In his first interview since being freed, Mr Hedges told The Times that while behind bars he was repeatedly asked to work for the UAE and ""steal information from the Foreign Office"". He said the interrogations he was subjected to would sometimes go on for up to 15 hours, during which he was threatened with rendition to an overseas military base, where he would be beaten. The Durham University PhD student also told the newspaper that he was often forced to stand in ankle cuffs for days on end and was also given dangerous levels of medication that forced him to go ""cold turkey"". He said his treatment ""felt like torture"" - but still had no clue as to why he had been targeted by the UAE and questioned whether the UK government should still consider the kingdom as an ally. He advised Downing Street to ""assess its values"", adding: ""Is it putting trade, is it putting finance, is it putting anything else over the values it stands for?"" Mr Hedges, a Middle Eastern studies specialist, added that he did not believe the research he was carrying out in the country for his thesis was the reason for his arrest. He said he thought he had been followed throughout his trip and that his phone had been bugged. Despite being thankful for the eventual intervention by Mr Hunt, Mr Hedges said the Foreign Office had not debriefed him on his ordeal since returning to the UK. Mr Hunt tweeted last week: ""Fantastic news about Matthew Hedges. Although we didn't agree with charges we are grateful to UAE govt for resolving issue speedily."" His release came after Ms Tejada told Sky News she was ""hopeful"" a plea for clemency to the UAE would secure his release, even though he had been handed a life sentence.

2018-12-06,"The helicopter crash which killed the chairman of Leicester City and four other people was caused by a pin that had come loose in the tail rotor control mechanism, a report has revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/investigators-reveal-cause-of-leicester-city-helicopter-crash-11573217,"The Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that the pin had become disconnected, resulting in the helicopter becoming unstable and preventing the pilot from controlling it. Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, two of his staff Nursara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, pilot Eric Swaffer and Mr Swaffer's girlfriend Izabela Roza Lechowicz were killed when the aircraft crashed into a car park close to the King Power stadium on 27 October. Investigators found the pilot's pedals became disconnected from the tail rotor and caused the aircraft to make an uncontrollable right turn before it spun and fell, hitting the ground in a ball of flames. The pedals and tail rotor are linked by a mechanism which failed after parts of it had become disconnected and there was a ""build-up of black grease"" on one component. Leicester City's owner, two of his staff members and two pilots were in the helicopter when it went down, killing all on board The failure led to the pitch of the tail rotor blades being changed ""until they reached the physical limit of their travel"", investigators said. The report said: ""The initiating cause and exact sequence of the failure that resulted in the loss of tail rotor control is being investigated as a priority."" ""The tail rotor actuator control shaft became disconnected from the actuator lever mechanism,"" it added. ""The disconnection stopped the feedback mechanism for the tail rotor actuator from operating and the tail rotor actuator from responding to yaw control inputs."" This loss of the feedback mechanism meant the yaw stops were ineffective and the tail rotor actuator was able to continue changing the pitch of the tail rotor blades ""until they reached the physical limit of their travel"". ""This resulted in an uncontrollable right yaw."" It went on: ""Sufficient force and torque had been applied to the castellated nut on the actuator end of the control shaft to friction weld it to the pin carrier and to shear the installed split pin. ""Whilst the shaft was rotating and a yaw control input was applied, the shaft 'unscrewed' from the nut, disconnecting the shaft from the actuator level mechanism, and causing the nut to become welded to the pin carrier."" It added: ""The threaded portion of the control shaft, at the actuator end, was inside the outer shaft and contained the remains of the split pin. The top and bottom of the split pin had been sheared off in rotation."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you?"

2018-12-06,Police in Northern Ireland have released footage of a gunman moments before he killed a man who was waiting to pick up his son from school.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/gunman-who-shot-man-dead-outside-a-school-captured-on-cctv-11572523,"Jim Donegan, a married father of two, was shot several times - once in the head - in front of scores of terrified children as they left school in west Belfast. Detectives say the 43-year-old died instantly as a result of the gangland-style attack. Mr Donegan sat in his Porsche at the time of the shooting, with teachers subsequently shielding the car from the hundreds of pupils who were leaving St Mary's Grammar School at the time. Footage released by the police shows a man in a high-visibility vest walking near the school - and investigators believe he concealed a gun in a bag he was carrying over his shoulder. Detective Chief Inspector Pete Montgomery said ricocheting bullets could have easily resulted in children being killed. He added: ""Children who moments before were no doubt enjoying Christmas activities in class, maybe practising for their Christmas concert or school nativity, will no longer be dreaming about Santa or presents. ""Instead they will be having nightmares about a murder in broad daylight outside their school. A place which should be a safe haven to learn and grow. ""The gunman walked past these children and fired a weapon eight times. ""It is utter madness as any one of these bullets could have ricocheted, and having been at the scene I cannot emphasise enough that it is sheer luck I am not investigating multiple fatalities."" He has appealed to anyone who saw the gunman to contact the police. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Paramilitary style shootings remain a common occurrence in Northern Ireland - 20 years after the Good Friday agreement put an end to much of the violence in the country. Police have not ruled out the possibility of dissident republican involvement. One mother who fled after seeing the gunman said her seven-year-old son was left traumatised. She told Q Radio: ""I heard about six or seven gunshots and then I heard someone screaming, my son saw it, he was able to tell me he saw a man up ahead with a hi-vis vest on, and his hood up and carrying a bag. ""He was still standing there at the time so I just turned with him (her son) and ran up the street."""
2018-12-06,Patients who believe they have been poisoned by a heavy metal administered in some MRI scans are calling on the NHS to change its safety advice.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/mri-patients-claim-they-were-poisoned-by-toxic-metal-used-to-boost-scans-11573298,"Sky News has spoken to a number of patients who believe that gadolinium, a rare-earth metal used to improve the quality of images in around 30% of MRI scans, has had devastating consequences for their health. They say they can trace symptoms including debilitating pain, chronic fatigue and involuntary muscle twitching to being given gadolinium injections before diagnostic scans. Patients are calling for more information to be included on consent forms, bringing the UK into line with the US where there is growing concern over the use of gadolinium. Gadolinium is highly toxic in ""free"" form, but when used in scanning it is administered in an intravenously injected liquid designed to make it safe. In these ""contrast agents"" (GdCAs) the gadolinium is bound to other molecules, a process known as chelation, to ensure it passes out of the body via the kidneys in the patient's urine. There is evidence however that some gadolinium is retained in the body, where it can be deposited in bone, tissue and the brain. Gadolinium is not considered safe for use in patients with impaired kidney function, in whom it has been linked to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a condition that affects the eyes, skin, joints and internal organs. Patients here and in the US believe that adverse effects are not limited to those with poor renal function, but this is disputed by UK regulators. Dr Catriona Walsh told Sky News the impact was so debilitating she was forced to leave her role as a consultant paediatrician in Belfast. She said: ""It was awful. For six months I felt like I was circling a drain, very anxious about my future because with my medical background I knew that free gadolinium is very, very toxic and can come away, so you have free gadolinium causing havoc in your system.""   Dr Walsh says gadolinium contrast agents should not have been granted licences without more research. She said: ""Gadolinium contrast agents are compounds that contain a very toxic heavy metal paired with a rather untested drug with variable stability, with somewhat unknown clinical benefits. ""Before even considering a licence, I would have insisted that the drug companies produce much better studies on both the acute and long-term toxic effects."" Richard, a patient who has asked us not to use his full name, says he was hospitalised for several weeks following an MRI scan with symptoms including twitching muscles, pain and exhaustion. Doctors were uncertain as to what was causing his symptoms, offering a number of diagnosis before concluding it was likely he had motor neurone disease, a terminal condition. His wife, who was pregnant with the couple's first child, was told it was likely that he would die. Richard said: ""I was lying in a hospital bed, my muscles literally firing away like anything, bed-bound and with very limited mobility. ""I had fibromyalgia thrown at me, ME, which is chronic fatigue syndrome, and then the presumption was that it was motor neurone disease. ""I had MND written above my bed and my wife had nurses crying next to her."" Subsequent urine tests show Richard had extremely high levels of gadolinium. He believes patients deserve to be told more about the chemical. ""The NHS has a duty to tell people that this stuff retains in the system. We know it causes a very serious condition in NSF, so people should at the very least be informed."" Currently scanning consent forms do not inform patients that gadolinium can be retained, and the NHS does not recognise ""gadolinium deposition disease"", a description being used in the US, as a condition. Last year the Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) withdrew licences for a number of gadolinium contrast agents following a review that acknowledged data on the long-term effects on patients are ""very limited"". The MHRA concluded that while there is no evidence that gadolinium deposition causes harm, they ordered manufacturers to measure patient tissue for deposition, and advised that it should only be used when ""essential"" to improve imaging, and at ""the lowest effective dose"". More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you?  Dr Giles Roditi, a consultant radiologist and spokesman for the Royal College of Radiologists, said the benefits of accurate MRI scanning far outweighed the small risk of an adverse reaction. He said: ""The risks from gadolinium contrast as long as we are giving them to the right patient for the right indication are very, very low, and you have to balance the risks of not knowing the diagnosis you have come to find out against the risk of not having the scan at all."" An MHRA spokesperson said: ""Although no harmful effects have been attributed to gadolinium retention in the body, as a precaution the licences for three GdCAs were suspended, and the use of the remaining GdCAs was restricted. ""GdCAs should be used only when diagnostic information is essential and cannot be obtained with an MRI scan alone, and should be used at the lowest effective dose. When used in this way their benefits outweigh their risks in patients without kidney complaints."""

But Mr Batten told Sky News his former colleague was merely ""looking for an excuse"" to leave UKIP after Mr Farage ""failed dismally"" to bring a vote of no confidence against him. He said: ""Nigel obviously hasn't read the manifesto that we published in September because there aren't any anti-Muslim policies in there and there wouldn't be because we're not anti-Muslim. ""I think this is just sour grapes, he's been looking for an excuse to walk away for two years and now he's found it."" Mr Batten also revealed Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, would be advising him on prisons. His appointment comes after the former EDL leader was released from prison in August after the Court of Appeal quashed a contempt of court finding made at Leeds Crown Court. The case has been referred to the attorney general. Mr Batten said: ""He's told me already about how they're run - the prisoners run the prisons, they're run by prison gangs, drugs are rife in prisons. ""Prison officers are bribed to bring in telephones and drugs. ""He [Robinson] wasn't in solitary confinement, people were talking to him through the bars, telling him they were going to kill him, which is why he couldn't eat the food that was served to him."" Mr Batten said he liked to get advice ""first hand from people at the front line"". Turning to Brexit, the UKIP leader called on parliament to ""dump the deal"" presented by Theresa May. He said: ""We're not leaving, we're going to continue under this transition period, the so-called backstop that we can't get out of because we can't have a unilateral right of withdrawal. ""We're going to continue paying them lots of money, we're going to continue with open borders and the whole thing has been concocted so the political establishment can say it's far too difficult we can't leave so we have to stay in."" Asked if Brexiteers would be falling into a trap if they voted against the deal, risking no Brexit at all, Mr Batten replied by asking: ""What is the point in voting for something when you haven't really left anyway?"" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? He then outlined his vision for how the break from the European bloc should unfold. ""What I've been advocating for 25 years - long before Nigel Farage got on the bandwagon by the way - was unilateral unconditional withdrawal whereby parliament takes control of the process,"" he said. ""So it repeals the 1972 European Communities Act as the first step, tells the European Union 'we've just left but don't worry because all EU derived law remains in place but we're going to start amending and repealing and we'll tell you how it's going to work' in a cooperative and friendly spirit."" He said he thought the economy would ""boom"" and the UK would make ""enormous savings""."

Duckenfield's lawyer, Ben Myers QC, applied to stay the prosecution at Preston Crown Court, but judge Sir Peter Openshaw refused. The 73-year-old is due to stand trial on 14 January alongside Sheffield Wednesday's former secretary, Graham Mackrell, who is charged with health and safety offences. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The fans died after a crush in the terraces in the Leppings Lane end of the ground as Liverpool played Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup semi-final. There cannot currently be a prosecution over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died nearly four years after his injuries were caused. Earlier this year, the Crown Prosecution Service successfully lifted the bar, imposed in 2000, on further action against Duckenfield. Two retired police officers Donald Denton, 80, and Alan Foster, 71, and retired solicitor Peter Metcalf, 68, will also go on trial in September 2019, charged with doing acts intended to pervert the course of justice."

Fender was shortlisted alongside Mahalia and Lewis Capaldi, and it seems it is taking him some time to get used to being announced as the winner. Speaking to Sky News, there are a lot of mentions of it being ""totally mad"" and ""weird"", and that he's not quite sure ""how this all happened"". ""If I say 'genuinely overwhelmed' one more time I'm going to slap myself,"" he says. ""We didn't even expect to get nominated. Then they told us that we'd won, which is ridiculous, so ridiculous."" How did he celebrate when he found out? ""We were in a taxi driving back to my manager's house [when I found out]. I was driving past my old school, which was very strange, and the label rang, and he put them on loudspeaker and then he was just like, you've got it mate, you've got it. I just started screaming. I was punching all the seats in the taxi going completely mad. ""Then I went back to my manager's house and got absolutely smashed."" The annual Critics' Choice gong is seen as a real predictor of the future stars of British music. To be part of a select group with the likes of Adele and the other previous winners - which also includes Jessie J, Emeli Sande, Tom Odell, James Bay, Jack Garratt, Rag 'n' Bone Man and last year's recipient, Jorja Smith - is ""pretty crazy"", he says. ""They're all pop giants, massive singers. Adele and Sam Smith are like A grade, top-of-the-top vocalists. Plus, I'm alternative guitar, alt-rock guitar music, and I don't think that's been in the Critics' Choice yet so it's quite refreshing I think to be given this. ""I'm very, very humbled; to be given that platform, to be put on that stage, it's such a huge thing. I really don't know how it's happened. It's mad, totally mad."" Fender's candid lyrics tell stories of social and generational significance, drawn from his experiences growing up in the North East. He released his first single, Play God, in March 2017 - which ended up garnering him a high-profile fan in Elton John, who championed him on his Apple Music Beats 1 Radio show, Elton John's Rocket Hour. ""Nobody knew who we were and he'd heard Play God, my first single,"" says Fender. ""Elton John, he's a legend, one of the most influential artists of his time and it's just absolutely incredible. ""My mam remembers the first time she heard Elton John. My mam and dad are in their 60s, so they grew up in the '70s when Elton was at his prime, so it's a very, very surreal experience for me. ""He Facetimed us, and it was like, 'what the hell?' He was just so wonderfully complimentary about everything that I've done and was really supportive."" While Fender says he tries not to listen too much to other people's opinions, good or bad, when it comes to Elton John, he's happy to take them on board. ""I think the bigger this gets, the more negative and positive stuff you get,"" he says. ""I think the most important thing is you've got to switch off because there'll always be people saying you're brilliant and there'll always be people saying you're rubbish. The reality is, none of it matters because it's all opinion. ""You shouldn't listen to either of them. If you start believing in your own hype, you'll become an a******* and start writing rubbish songs, and if you start thinking that you're rubbish constantly you'll not want to do it anymore. ""But when Elton John says that you're good, I'm like, all right, I'll believe him because he's Elton John. It is really kind of reassuring that someone like that likes your stuff. It's nuts."" After months of gigging, Fender signed to Polydor in the summer and is now working on his debut album. ""That's the most important thing. I need to make sure that all the songs I put on it are something I'm really proud of. I write all my own songs, so if it goes wrong, I don't co-write anything, it's all going to fall on me."" Gigging has been ""relentless"", he says, but worth it, and he's enjoying every second. He might be Sam Fender, solo artist, but it is always ""we"" and ""us"" when he talks about his shows, and winning the award, too. ""I've got a band that I tour with and they're not session musicians, they're my friends,"" he says. ""My guitarist is my best mate. I've been in a band with them for the last year and we've just done hundreds of shows… ""I feel like we've not been shy of work, we really went for it. It nearly killed us… there's been sometimes getting to the end of tours and… my larynx feels like it's going to come out my throat. ""It's been a crazy, crazy year. I released my first single a year and a half ago and now this. It's just… what the hell's going on? It's proper mad."" Fender's music comes from the heart, and it resonates with fans. Dead Boys, a song from his debut EP of the same name, is about male suicide, and has taken on new meaning as a springboard for discussions about mental health. ""It's a song about my mate who took his life and I wrote it purely as a reaction to that. I didn't know whether to release it for a long time as I was scared that it would be seen as capitalising on a tragedy, and it's not been like that at all, it's been wonderful. ""There's been a lot of people talking about it, talking about male suicide, and it's inadvertently become this sort of anthem for mental health, which I'm really surprised and proud of. ""I think it's good that it's raised this conversation and… there's been people who have said it's helped them in some way. That's something I never expected but it's done it's job, I think. That's more than I ever could have hoped it could have done. It came from a real place."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Fender says he is incredibly proud when he hears how his music has connected with fans. ""People come up and they've got these really emotional stories about how the music's connected with them and… ""Okay, I'm never going to be one of those people who overestimates the clout of their job. Musicians, we're not doctors, we're not saving people's lives, we're not going out and changing the world, we're not coming up with cancer cures, we're not any of that. ""They're the real heroes of the world… but you have these little moments where a song connects with a kid or with somebody, it doesn't matter whether it's a kid or an adult, and they go, 'it helped us'. ""When you feel that weight it adds clout to the job that I never expected would be there and it's a wonderful experience. It's beautiful to be a part of that. ""To share a common conversation with a bunch of people in a room - something that I wrote hungover in my boxers - and there's a bunch of kids or a room full of people just singing and feeling united about something, it's nice."" So, Elton John, Polydor, Brits Critics' Choice - what's next? ""I would like to release the best album I possibly could and I would love to - never ever, it's never going to happen, I know it won't happen - but I would love to sing on a Kendrick Lamar track, or something ridiculous like that."" He motions towards the ceiling. ""That would be 'up there' goals."" He's also a huge Bruce Springsteen fan - but isn't sure he could handle coming face to face with The Boss. ""I would cry if I met Bruce Springsteen, man. I don't think I'd be able to handle it. So no, I couldn't do it. Stay away, Bruce - unless you want to see us crying."" :: The Brit Awards 2019 will be broadcast live on Wednesday 20 February"

In a letter to the secretary of state Amber Rudd MP, he said: ""We have families experiencing poverty on an unprecedented scale and now facing further avoidable hardship in the run up to Christmas. ""I have now been informed that job centres across Liverpool are advancing payments to my constituents to obtain provisional driving licences for the purposes of identification and then deducting the cost from their benefits. ""Constituents are also having to pay for postal orders, passport photographs and postage, just to obtain provisional licences."" He explained that the DVLA says there is a five-week wait for provisional licences, and highlighted the delays before the first proper payments are made when someone is transferred on to Universal Credit. The controversial new single benefit is designed to simplify the system and is being rolled out in many parts of Liverpool this week. Mr Carden added: ""Continuing with this roll-out will leave many of the most vulnerable families in Liverpool Walton destitute by Christmas and I am therefore asking you to intervene as a matter of urgency."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? In response to the letter a DWP spokeswoman told Sky News: ""Having ID is not a requirement for those making a Universal Credit claim but it does make the process easier. ""If customers don't have any ID we can reimburse the cost if they choose to apply for a passport, driving licence or long birth certificates."" The DWP has also vowed to improve the support available to Universal Credit claimants."

Retesting of more than 10,500 cases opened since 2014 began after allegations that scientists at RTS had manipulated forensics data.

2018-12-06,Two former Tesco directors have hit out at the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after being formally cleared of fraud and false accounting in relation to a £250m overstatement of profits by the chain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/ex-tesco-directors-cleared-over-250m-profit-scandal-11573089,"Chris Bush, the chain's ex-UK managing director, and former food commercial director John Scouler, denied the charges. They were accused of being aware that income was being wrongly included in the company's financial records to meet targets and bolster the company's financial position. The issue came to public attention in September 2014 when the UK's largest retailer told the City that financial statements issued the previous month had overstated profits by about a quarter of a billion pounds. The trial, at Southwark Crown Court, was formally halted on Thursday after the jury was informed that the judge had thrown out the case and that the decision had been upheld at the Court of Appeal. Trial judge, Sir John Royce, told the court: ""I concluded that, in certain crucial areas, one in particular, that the prosecution's case was so weak that it should not be left for a jury's consideration."" He added that the ""real weakness"" was the question of proving knowledge. During the trial, the jury was told the case was a retrial, and that a third man, former UK finance director Carl Rogberg, is charged with identical offences but is not currently well enough to stand trial. A decision is now due to be made by the SFO in relation to its case against Mr Rogberg following the acquittals of Mr Scouler and Mr Bush. The latest legal development came to light 20 months after Tesco reached a so-called Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the SFO in connection with the profit overstatement, which saw the company take a fine and agree to compensate shareholders without addressing the issue liability. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? In a statement, Mr Bush said: ""While I am delighted that my innocence has finally been established, it is troubling that Mr Scouler and I were ever charged. ""Put simply, these charges should never have been brought, and serious questions should be asked about the way in which the SFO has conducted this investigation. ""In my view, the SFO wholly failed to investigate this case thoroughly, independently or fairly from the outset."" Richard Sallybanks, a partner at BCL Solicitors who represented Mr Scouler, said: ""We have long argued that the SFO's prosecution of Mr Scouler was fundamentally flawed, that he should not have been charged and that the SFO should not have proceeded with this trial. ""Mr Scouler has maintained since the outset of this investigation that he was not guilty of fraud and false accounting, and those close to him always knew that to be the case."""
2018-12-06,"Theresa May is under pressure from loyalist MPs to delay a vote on her Brexit deal, amid fears it could be ""heavily"" rejected.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/delay-brexit-vote-to-avoid-heavy-defeat-pm-urged-11573601,"The prime minister was urged to postpone the crucial vote next Tuesday, as about 90 Conservatives are expected to rebel. It came as supportive MPs suggested that details surrounding the Northern Irish backstop be changed - in the hope they would help the deal pass in parliament. Meanwhile, prospects of a showdown between Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were dashed as ITV withdrew its offer to host a televised debate. The countdown is ticking closer to Tuesday's ""meaningful vote"" on the Brexit deal, with MPs completing their third day in five to debate it. But the lack of wavering backbenchers coming out in Mrs May's favour seemed to rattle her supporters. Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the influential 1922 committee of Tory MPs, said most people wanted to ""see this process moving forward"". But he admitted: ""I don't think there's any point in ploughing ahead and losing the vote heavily."" The DUP's Ian Paisley also quipped that ""nothing so concentrates the mind like a hanging"", warning that ""the gallows are being built"". He asked International Trade Secretary Liam Fox about reports that ministers were considering postponing the vote, or if ""the government [is] fixed on walking towards those gallows"". Dr Fox insisted the Brexit deal offered a ""balanced and reasonable approach"". He added: ""Of course [the government] will want to look for ways to give reassurance."" Sky News understands Mrs May would struggle to delay the vote because the debate leading up to it has already started - meaning she would need to win another vote adding an amendment to push it back. A Sky source also said the cabinet agreed the vote could not be lost by 200 votes, but that they did not agree to back delaying it at a meeting on Thursday afternoon. In a bid to assuage Tory Brexiteers, loyalist MPs published a plan to decrease the chances of the UK falling into the backstop. The backstop has created so many rebels because it would see some customs treated differently in Northern Ireland as in Great Britain. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Led by Hugo Swire, the plan would give MPs the chance to vote to extend the transition period at the end of 2022 - rather than falling into the backstop. Asked by Sky News if Downing Street had had a hand in its drafting, one of the plan's backers said: ""There are probably several cooks involved in the broth."" The amendment will have to be selected as part of six by the Commons speaker on Tuesday morning if it is to be debated. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has ruled out voting for Mrs May's deal, said it was ""simply not possible"". He insisted that, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, a joint committee would ultimately make that decision. It was also rejected by Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, which is propping up Mrs May's government. ""Domestic legislative tinkering won't cut it,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""The legally binding international withdrawal treaty would remain fundamentally flawed as evidenced by the attorney general's legal advice."""
2018-12-06,"Drugs runners are operating 2,000 ""county lines"" routes from big cities into smaller towns and the countryside, according to new figures obtained by Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/line-18-3-million-per-day-county-lines-drugs-business-fuelling-knife-crime-11566109,"We can also reveal that the business is worth over £3 million a day. Sky News has obtained exclusive access to people involved in this ruthless trade, from wholesalers to drugs mules. Our investigation demonstrates how this brutal business is contributing to the rise in knife crime across the UK. We started out in a ""trap house"" in north London. This is where drugs are prepared, sold and taken. Criminals exploit children as young as 12 to transport drugs between counties across the UK Here, a drug wholesaler brandishing a Rambo knife boasted that the weapon was ""just something I give to the kids who go out for me"". With money and drugs strewn across the table, his colleague explained: ""There's always problems with other dealers - so you've got to sort out your problem. ""You give the kids a weapon. They go up there and they do it. Once you've sorted out one or two problems, they tend not to come to you."" As we interviewed them, the two dealers sold crack cocaine to a 42-year-old addict - Mark Page. He said he spent all the money he had on drugs. ""Once I start I can't stop,"" he told us. Then one of the dealers gave a detailed account of how gangs within the capital are seeking out more rural markets. He said: ""Most of our business is outside of London. Me and my buddy go somewhere and find a crackhead. I'll give them some rock (crack cocaine) for their numbers, their friends. ""Once an area is established, I'll get the kids to go out there for me."" The children are paid £300 or £400 a week and age between 12 and 16. ""The younger the better,"" said one dealer, adding: ""They need money, mummy and daddy ain't got no money. So they come to uncle."" He offers an induction week for his new recruits, which he called ""boot camp"". The county line itself is a phone line, controlled by the dealer, which is sometimes given to the runner who the addicts can contact for a delivery. The wholesaler in north London said he operates ""like a pharmacy where you can get anything"". But he had a chilling warning for anyone trying to break in to his market area. He said: ""It doesn't matter who you are. If you come and step on my toes and violate our business, you're going to get shot, stabbed in the face. ""If you're a little boy or a grown man. Anyone can get it. You step on my toes you're f**ked."" This is a classic county lines operation, which police say has now become a problem in every single police force in the country and has exploded in the last five years. Sources have told Sky News that the police are expected to announce that the number of known county lines have increased by a third to 2,000. It is estimated each line can make thousands of pounds daily, creating a combined industry of £3 million a day. Some 58 vulnerable people who had been caught up in the gangs, including children, were rescued during the week-long operation Sky News can reveal that in a two-week operation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and UK police forces, more than 500 suspects have been arrested, 78 weapons seized, and 95 drug lines destroyed. More than 250 people involved in the running of drugs for the gangs have been safeguarded, including children. The violent nature of those at the centre of these operations, and the extent to which they are expanding, is at least part of the explanation for the worrying increase in knife crime across the UK. Vince O'Brien, head of drugs operations at the NCA, told Sky News: ""Clearly high levels of violence are a concern. When people get drawn into criminal gangs, then the way in which those gangs resolve the disputes between them is with violence and that's certainly part of the problem. ""One of the issues with the serious violence is violent competition between drugs gangs and stabbings, acid attacks and shootings can be part of that competition as they look to take over the market and that can be a real concern."" Zakaria Mohammed admitted running a drugs supply chain and trafficking two boys and a girl to deal on his behalf in Lincoln The former drugs lead at the NCA, Tony Saggers, has become the leading expert in this area and now advises local police forces. He said: ""County lines has become the expansion of London, in terms of the violence and knife crime and the young people involved. If you deal drugs somewhere else you cause agitation and potential violence. ""Because you are expanding a workforce and the geography of your operation - you need more people involved. You can no longer run around a London borough with six people involved if you are covering six counties and a dozen towns. ""That's where the children come in."" These wider markets are further from the reach of the metropolitan dealers who are controlling them and this brings greater levels of violence in order to maintain that control. Sky News spoke to a teenager who has been running a county line ever since being taken into care at the age of 14. The girl - known as Sarah - said she sold class A drugs such as heroin and crack and that the dealers are getting more violent and using ""guns, knives and acid"" to keep a grip on their business. On one occasion, Sarah was punished with a stabbing because her shipment was stolen from her. Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield told Sky News she was probably set up to make her feel indebted to the gang. She said this was becoming a common tactic. ""The kids who are the collateral, these aren't huge 17-year-olds with great physical presence and imposing characters, these are often small, vulnerable children who look quite meek, don't have much confidence,"" she said. ""But they are being exploited, frightened, and groomed, and also huge levels of physical violence held over them to do what they do. Most kids involved are scared stiff."" Sky News travelled with a 47-year-old woman who was a drug mule to Southend. She said she was frightened to go to the police or stop doing what she was doing, but hated being part of the drug dealing network. Upon arrival in the seaside town, Sky News spoke to several young people who said they have been approached by dealers from London asking them to get involved. They said the town had changed for the worse as a result and no longer felt safe. Kofi, 17, admitted he sometimes carried a knife. ""The town centre is such a dangerous place - I don't feel safe,"" he said. ""In a place like this, without a weapon you don't feel safe. There have been times when I've felt like I've had to."" The NCA's Vince O'Brien told Sky News county lines had been a real challenge to cope with. He said: ""The response to county lines is a complicated one. It's about the demand for drugs and it's about the way people are moving around the country. ""The Home Office has funded a new county lines coordination centre where the NCA is working with local police forces to coordinate the national effort to respond to it, to build up an intelligence picture and to understand how we can respond most effectively."" more than 90,000 people have signed the petition - have you?"

The 42-year-old, from Eltham in southeast London, had initially denied the charges - but he changed his plea after the prosecution opened the case against him. His brother Neil has already been jailed for more than six years over the scheme. Jamie Acourt had spent more than two years on the run until he was arrested in May, and was living in Spain under the alias Simon Alfonzo. He was detained by armed officers as he left a gym in Barcelona, and extradited back to the UK. Prosecutors believe the brothers were ringleaders of the plot - and claim they enlisted family members to transport drugs between London and the North East of England. Both men were arrested after Stephen Lawrence, a black 18-year-old, was stabbed by a gang of white men in 1993 - however, they have always denied being involved in the fatal attack. Jurors were informed of the historic allegation against Jamie Acourt but warned they should consider him solely on the trial's evidence. Prosecutors had accused Acourt of conspiracy to supply a Class B drug between January 2014 and February 2016, but he changed his plea on the basis that it was agreed he was only involved from January 2014 to May 2015. A total of seven men have now been convicted or found guilty over the conspiracy, which involved dozens of 600-mile round trips from London to South Shields - driving up drugs and bringing back cash. Jamie Acourt will be sentenced for the drugs charge on Friday. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you?"

2018-12-06,Fast-track visas for foreign investors spending millions of pounds in the UK will be suspended in a crackdown on money laundering.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/golden-visas-for-super-rich-foreign-investors-suspended-in-crime-crackdown-11572894,"The Home Office said it was pausing Tier 1 investor visas, dubbed ""golden visas"", from midnight on Friday as it attempts to tackle serious organised crime. They will be reinstated once toughened measures have been put in place, ministers said. Tier 1 visas were introduced in 2008 to attract non-EU citizens to invest millions of pounds into the UK, with more than 1,000 granted in the year ending September 2018. An investment of £2m or more could secure a visa and indefinite leave to remain after five years. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club and friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, withdrew his golden visa application earlier this year as relations between the two countries went south over the Salisbury spy poisoning. Golden visa applicants could apply three months before arriving in the UK and would get a decision within three weeks, having paid a £1,623 fee. For those wanting an even speedier Tier 1 investor visa, they could pay £12,733. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said: ""The UK will always be open to legitimate and genuine investors who are committed to helping our economy and businesses grow. ""However, I have been clear that we will not tolerate people who do not play by the rules and seek to abuse the system. ""That is why I am bringing forward these new measures which will make sure that only genuine investors, who intend to support UK businesses, can benefit from our immigration system."" Golden visas have been widely condemned by those who believe they leave the UK open to corruption or stolen funds being laundered through the UK from Russia, China and the Middle East. The Home Office said changes would include applicants having to provide comprehensive audits of all their financial and business interests. Audits would have to be carried out by regulated UK auditing firms separate from any qualifying investments or the visa application. Those applying will also have to prove they have had control of the £2m for at least two years. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Reforms will also aim to increase the benefits to UK companies by excluding investment in government bonds and strengthening the rules to ensure investments are made in active and trading UK companies. It will also be possible for pooled investments, supported by the government, to back projects with a clear economic benefit to the UK, such as supporting small and medium enterprises. The changes are part of wider reforms to the visa system, which also include replacing the Tier 1 Graduate and Entrepreneur visa routes with a Start-up visa, announced in June, and the Innovator visa route."

The payments were for royalties from books Mr Johnson has written and payments from The Daily Telegraph for his weekly column. They date back to September 2017 until 1 October 2018 and the longest delay was 11 weeks, while the shortest was a week. Kathryn Stone, parliamentary commissioner for standards, said the late declarations ""suggested a lack of attention to, or regard for, the House's requirements"" and the breach was ""neither inadvertent or minor"" - as Mr Johnson had claimed. The standards committee decided that an apology by Mr Johnson to the Commons on a ""point of order"" was an appropriate sanction. Mr Johnson stood up in the middle of a debate on Brexit to say he was ""very sorry"" the payments were declared late and that he ""fully accepts"" the delay breached parliament's rules. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? A report into his earnings revealed the Uxbridge MP expects to be paid £22,916 a month by The Daily Telegraph for four articles, which take him a total of 10 hours. He entered into the Telegraph contract, which lasts for a year until July 2019, two days after quitting as foreign secretary on 9 July this year. His first payment from the newspaper was received on 13 August but was not registered until 17 September. The MP has written 11 books, translated into several languages, and receives royalties worth thousands of pounds each month. Mr Johnson's largest royalty payment listed in the report was £15,372 on 29 September last year. He failed to declare it until 20 December 2017. Ms Stone added: ""Having made five late registrations in December 2017, Mr Johnson did not take steps to avoid a recurrence until I initiated an inquiry in October 2018. ""The steps Mr Johnson has since taken appear sufficient to avoid a recurrence and he has expressed a willingness to adopt additional measures if they prove necessary."""
2018-12-06,"The UK could be stuck in ""repeated rounds of negotiations"" to leave the EU for years with no lawful power to exit, according to the government's legal advice.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181207031409/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-could-be-stuck-in-brexit-negotiations-for-years-legal-advice-warns-11572416,"A six-page document analysing the implications of Theresa May's deal warned the mechanism to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland returning could remain indefinitely. It was written by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and sent to Theresa May on 13 November, but only published on Wednesday after wrangling between MPs and the government. MPs had been left reeling by news they would only be given a 43-page summary document - and subsequently found the government in contempt of parliament for trying to keep the full advice out of the public domain. Following a trio of defeats in the Commons on Tuesday, the document was released minutes after Prime Minister's Questions began. Theresa May was swiftly tackled by the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who accused of ""concealing the facts on her Brexit deal"". Mrs May rejected the claim, insisting the document contained the same information as a shortened statement by Mr Cox earlier this week. But the assurances failed to appease her government partners, with the Democratic Unionist Party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds describing the revelations for Northern Ireland as ""devastating"". He said the legal advice made it clear that the proposed backstop arrangement was ""unacceptable"" and must be defeated. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer also said that full legal advice, which runs to 33 paragraphs, revealed ""the central weaknesses in the government's deal"". In the document, Mr Cox wrote that the backstop protocol ""does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK-wide customs union without a subsequent agreement"". He said that would remain the case ""even if parties are still negotiating many years later and even if the parties believe that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement"". And in a segment that caused the most fear among MPs, the attorney general warned: ""The [backstop] would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part."" Mr Cox also warned ministers that Britain would essentially become a third country when importing goods to Northern Ireland and would become subject to additional border checks.   Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrats' spokesperson for Brexit, said such extra checks would have a huge impact on British business. He told Sky News: ""We are talking about British businesses having to complete customs checks for goods going to Northern Ireland. ""Brexit now comes with a huge impact, possibly of the break up of the United Kingdom. These arguments are now being made with rather more evidence than before the vote."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, said the government had previously refused to publish the full legal advice on the Brexit deal as a ""point of principle"". She told Sky News: ""There are conflicting constitutional principles here. Of course the House of Commons has the right... to require papers. ""But there's a really important constitutional principle whereby law officers give confidential, frank advice to government ministers. ""It's very existence isn't normally published, let alone the advice itself. ""Now, following the vote [on Tuesday]... the problem in future will be law officers will think twice about the type of advice they give to government. ""And the government will have to think very carefully about what sort of advice they ask for, for fear that the House of Commons might again in future ask for it to be fully disclosed."" Despite concerns about the ramifications of releasing the full legal advice, Mr Cox described his decision to make it available to MPs as ""exceptional"" - and said it did not set a precedent for the future. He said the use of the arcane parliamentary procedure to force the release of the document created ""constitutional tensions"" which ""are not themselves conducive to the proper conduct of public affairs"". The future of the DUP's alliance with the government does appear more clear. The pro-Brexit European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs met on Wednesday evening - and a source in the room said they were told the DUP will drop support for Mrs May if her Brexit deal gets through the Commons on 11 December. However, if the deal fails, the party plan to back her government in a confidence vote. This would scupper Labour's chances of forcing a general election if the deal does sink next week - as it is expected to. MPs spent the rest of Wednesday discussing the divorce deal - with three more days of debate before a so-called ""meaningful vote"" on 11 December."

The body of the 41st president will lie in repose through the night ahead of his funeral on Thursday, with locals passing by to pay their respects. Before his body was flown to his home state, mourners lined the streets of the nation's capital, watching the journey that slowed past the White House, where he lived for four years. It continued to Washington's National Cathedral for a service attended by the current and past presidents and first ladies. Body language analysis went into overdrive as Donald Trump and his wife Melania joined Barack and Michelle Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton on the front pew. With strained civility, the Trumps and Obamas shook hands while Hillary Clinton maintained a forward gaze. This was an occasion bigger than the grievances and tensions that couldn't quite be disguised. George Bush Jr broke the ice by slipping a sweet to Michelle Obama - a jovial echo of his same gesture at Senator John McCain's funeral in September - it's becoming something of a tradition for the two friends. The choreographed spectacle of a state funeral felt apt for a rich life encompassing the highest levels of American public service - a life that ended only months after that of his great love Barbara. Presidential biographer Jon Meacham gave a touching eulogy: ""In this work, he had the most wonderful of allies in Barbara Pierce Bush, his wife of 73 years. He called her 'Bar', 'the Silver Fox' and, when the situation warranted, 'the Enforcer'. ""He was the only boy she ever kissed. Her children, Mrs Bush liked to say, always wanted to throw up when they heard that."" The main eulogy - fell to his son, former president George W Bush, who described his last call to his father. ""Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. ""The guy who answered the phone said, 'I think he can hear you, but hasn't said anything most of the day.' ""I said, 'Dad, I love you, and you've been a wonderful father.' And the last words he would ever say on earth were, 'I love you, too.'"" To laughter, he said: ""To us, he was close to perfect. But, not totally perfect. His short game was lousy. He wasn't exactly Fred Astaire on the dance floor. ""The man couldn't stomach vegetables, especially broccoli. And by the way, he passed these genetic defects along to us."" But humour gave way to grief as the former president broke down in tears recalling ""the best father a son or daughter could have"". People did not agree with Bush Sr's every policy - but few argued with the dignified and respectful way he carried out his presidency. His death is also being mourned as the passing of an era of civility."

She was lying in fourth place in the Golden Globe Race when 60-knot winds and ""massive seas"" damaged her Rustler 36 yacht DHL Starlight on Wednesday. She said she was ""thrown across the cabin and was knocked out for a while"". Goodall, from Falmouth in Cornwall, tweeted the boat was ""unbelievably roly"" and she was ""totally and utterly gutted"". She later added: ""This motion is just horrible! Clinging on in my bunk."" ""In need of a good cuppa tea! But sadly no cooker."" A distress signal from her yacht was first picked up by the Falmouth coastguard. They alerted race control and the Chilean maritime search and rescue authorities who are responsible for that sector of the Pacific. The authorities have contacted a ship 480 miles south-west of Goodall's position and asked for help. The crew expects to reach the area on Friday. Goodall has been contacted on her emergency satellite phone by race officials who said she was ""safe and secure onboard"". She said: ""I have been dismasted. Thought I had holed the hull because the boat filled with water, but the hull is not holed. The hull is OK. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""The boat is destroyed. I can't make up a jury rig. The only thing left is the hull and deck which remain intact. ""We were pitchpoled [rolled end over end] and I was thrown across the cabin and knocked out for a while."" Goodall is the youngest and only female competitor taking part in the non-stop around the world yacht race, which sees competitors sail single-handedly, abandoning any form of modern technology or satellite navigation equipment. Competitors set off from France on 1 July and it is expected to take around nine months to complete. The last time the race took place was in 1968. Sir Robin Knox Johnston was the only person to finish back then. Eighteen sailors took part in this year's 30,000-mile race. But more than half of the competitors have now dropped out, with many being dismasted."

His brother, Gary John McNeish, posted on Facebook: ""This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, is tell you my brother Pete Shelley had a heart attack this morning and passed away."" The band also confirmed his death on their official Twitter page. ""It's with great sadness that we confirm the death of Pete Shelley, one of the UK's most influential and prolific songwriters and co-founder of the seminal original punk band Buzzcocks,"" the post read. In another tweet, the band said: ""Pete's music has inspired generations of musicians over a career that spanned five decades and with his band and as a solo artist, he was held in the highest regard by the music industry and by his fans around the world."" Fans and friends are paying tribute to the late singer on social media. Singer Tim Burgess tweeted: ""Farewell Pete Shelley. The first album I ever owned was Love Bites By Buzzcocks."" One fan wrote: ""The world is sad enough right now without the loss of Pete Shelley. Gone way too soon"". Another fan, named Doug Shaw, tweeted: ""Sad to learn of the death of Pete Shelley, The Buzzcocks were one of my favourite punk bands. Loved their ability to write excellent short sharp singles."" Singer Tracey Thorn, formerly of Everything But The Girl, said: ""Oh God but I loved Buzzcocks. And Pete Shelley was an amazing songwriter. 'But after all life's only death's recompense.' RIP"". Shelley, real name Peter Campbell McNeish, was born in Leigh, a town in Greater Manchester. The band, which he formed with Howard Devoto, debuted in 1976 when they opened for the Sex Pistols in Manchester. Buzzcocks released their first EP, Spiral Scratch, on their own independent label in 1977. When Devoto left the band shortly afterwards, Shelley took over as lead vocalist and chief songwriter. Shelley went onto release music as a solo artist in the 1980s and played with various musicians during his career, including The Invisible Girls. His best known singles include Homosapien, Telephone Operator and Do Anything. Shelley briefly reunited with Devoto to make the LP Buzzkunst, released in 2002."

It would mean any live broadcast which begins before the watershed will not contain betting adverts. The move comes amid fears advertising during live sport is fuelling an explosion in underage gambling addicts. The proposals, which have been put forward by the Remote Gambling Association, are yet to be fully agreed. Sources at two of the betting companies concerned told Sky News they were having legal meetings about the prospective changes on Thursday. It is expected they will be rubber stamped next week following a meeting of the five major gambling industry associations. The number of children with a gambling problem has quadrupled in two years, the Gambling Commission says A Gambling Commission spokesperson said: ""We understand that options for enhancing the Gambling Industry Code for Socially Responsible Advertising are currently under review. ""We would welcome any steps to address public concerns about gambling advertising. ""Last month we brought together senior leaders from over 100 gambling companies to look at how they can work together to make gambling fairer and safer, including considering the approach they take to advertising. ""We look forward to hearing about the industry's plans."" The gambling industry spent £1.5bn on marketing last year, prompting fears about the impact the advertising has on children. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? A Gambling Commission report released last month indicated that 55,000 children aged 11 to 16 could be officially categorised as problem gamblers. The changes could lead to a sustained push to limit betting advertisements in other areas of sport including on shirts and billboards. Currently 60% of Premier League and Championship football clubs have betting companies as shirt sponsors."

He also revealed he had done consultancy work for the UAE in the past, and was one of the authors of a national security strategy for the country. He said: ""So on one hand I was getting paid by the UAE to undertake this, yet a few years later I was arrested for doing something very similar."" When he pointed this out to his interrogators, he said they were ""confused and thought MI6 had infiltrated this process somehow and were trying to dictate their security strategy"". In reply, he told them they had got the ""wrong end of the stick"". He also mentioned that his wife was a Colombian national, to which his questioners replied: ""Well how can you be in MI6 and have a foreign wife?"" He said he ""just sat there with my mouth open, thinking, that's kind of the point here"". Mr Hedges was arrested at Dubai Airport on 5 May. Last month he was given a life sentence after the UAE released a video of him purportedly confessing to being a member of MI6. He told Sky News he confessed ""for the sole reason that I was under severe duress"", and ""felt I couldn't take it anymore"". Asked if he was spying for anyone, he said: ""No, not in the slightest."" Now back in the UK after being pardoned, he said the UAE should face ""repercussions"" for the way it had treated him. Asked what may have made the authorities there interested in him, he said: ""Paranoia - to a degree."" He added: ""I still honestly don't know. And looking back on it, many people don't know. It is confusing. ""The evidence put against me was unclear, it was unjustified, and to many people it's not laughable but it's weak."" He added: ""They used my masters dissertation from eight, nine years ago against me, they used part of my PhD thesis which is completely sourced, as any academic work would be, so I really don't understand, I really don't know what's happened."" The line of questioning used against him ""wasn't singular"", but on ""multiple avenues, all of which I could answer"". Once in court, a lawyer he had met only once before ""successfully had the charges reduced from holding secretive information, to holding sensitive information"", he explained, adding: ""So even the courts acknowledged that was the case."" His objective now is to clear his name. A crowdfunding page has been set up to ""help cover at least some of the legal costs"". More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Mr Hedges has previously said his interrogators asked him to become a double agent and steal information from the Foreign Office. He chose to spend 23 hours a day in darkness because the fluorescent light bulbs in his cell caused migraines, he told The Times. The 31-year-old also said he was forced to stand for whole days in ankle cuffs and was interrogated for up to 15 hours at a time, having panic attacks for two or three days in a row. He returned to the UK last week thanks to a successful campaign by his wife Daniela Tejada for the UK government to intervene, which saw Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt help secure a presidential pardon."

They did not vote to jeopardise care for society's most vulnerable or to risk our children's education. The threats of a no-deal Brexit are very real."" He also urged the county's MPs to insist that the government rules out the risk of a no-deal Brexit immediately. Kent Council said the impacts of a ""no-deal"" scenario are dependent on further planning assumptions provided by the government and the future UK-EU relationship. It said any long-term costs of any ""new norm"" arising from the change to border arrangements, such as infrastructure and staffing, will need to be identified. The report notes that it is dependent on the government to provide appropriate funding in the situation of a no-deal Brexit, as well as further information and advice on issues including traffic disruption. Howome EU nations have prepared more effectively than the UK Faisal Islam, Sky's political editor, said that a no-deal would be ""a moment when the most efficient, forward-thinking, and prepared will make bets on the future, and the winners will take all"".

Part of the site is a platform which was built thousands of years ago by residents to preserve a hoof print of prehistoric cattle known as aurochs. But Highways England engineers are accused of damaging it by drilling a hole 3.5m (11.5ft) deep through the platform to monitor water levels ahead of the construction of a 1.8-mile tunnel past Stonehenge. The water levels are being monitored due to fears that remains preserved in the waterlogged ground could be damaged if the tunnel goes ahead.

He also struggled to cope with the loss of his brother George in 2012. Lawyers representing his family said the father-of-three killed himself after trying to get help from mental health professionals for two months. The Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has written to his family apologising for the ""failings in the care he received"" before his death. Mr Knight's three children have been awarded the financial settlement to be split between them after lawyers brought a civil action against the trust in the High Court. Mr Knight's mother, Angie Aleksejuk, 55, from Stafford, said: ""I wish that just one person had thought differently in the period leading up to Aidan's death, as if they had he may still be here. ""He ticked all the boxes of being at risk - a former serviceman, under 30, he had lost his brother, lived alone and he even presented himself to A&E - but he slipped through the net. ""What happened has devastated our family. This was never about getting compensation but getting the trust to apologise for their failings in Aidan's care."" Mr Knight joined the army aged 17 and within two years was on a six-month tour of duty in Iraq. He left after five years and died in a park in Crawley, West Sussex, in April 2015 - the day before what would have been his brother's birthday. A coroner concluded his death was a suicide and a serious incident mental health review admitted the trust should have done more for Mr Knight. Between 2014 and 2015, Mr Knight took an overdose in the first of four bids to end his life. Despite assessments by police and NHS psychiatrists recording that he had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he was not considered high risk enough to be admitted to hospital. But he went to accident and emergency at East Surrey Hospital on 5 March 2015. A psychiatric nurse diagnosed PTSD symptoms and five days later the community mental health team assessed him. It was not until 26 March that his referral to a mental health practitioner was confirmed. During that time his GP prescribed him anti-depressants for his erratic behaviour. But his mental health practitioner was on holiday until 8 April and he was not reassigned to another case worker. His body was found that day. More than 115,000 have signed the petition - have you? Ms Aleksejuk added: ""There were a number of missed opportunities to save him and it just feels like nobody listened to him. ""I'm realistic enough to realise that even if people had listened to him he may still have done what he did, but we will never know. ""I wouldn't want anybody to go through what we have as living through this has been like torture and has scarred us all.""

Criminals exploit children as young as 12 to transport drugs between counties across the UK Here, a drug wholesaler brandishing a Rambo knife boasted that the weapon was ""just something I give to the kids who go out for me"". With money and drugs strewn across the table, his colleague explained: ""There's always problems with other dealers - so you've got to sort out your problem. ""You give the kids a weapon. They go up there and they do it. Once you've sorted out one or two problems, they tend not to come to you."" As we interviewed them, the two dealers sold crack cocaine to a 42-year-old addict - Mark Page. He said he spent all the money he had on drugs. ""Once I start I can't stop,"" he told us. Then one of the dealers gave a detailed account of how gangs within the capital are seeking out more rural markets. He said: ""Most of our business is outside of London. Me and my buddy go somewhere and find a crackhead. I'll give them some rock (crack cocaine) for their numbers, their friends. ""Once an area is established, I'll get the kids to go out there for me."" The children are paid £300 or £400 a week and age between 12 and 16. ""The younger the better,"" said one dealer, adding: ""They need money, mummy and daddy ain't got no money. So they come to uncle."" He offers an induction week for his new recruits, which he called ""boot camp"". The county line itself is a phone line, controlled by the dealer, which is sometimes given to the runner who the addicts can contact for a delivery. The wholesaler in north London said he operates ""like a pharmacy where you can get anything"". But he had a chilling warning for anyone trying to break in to his market area. He said: ""It doesn't matter who you are. If you come and step on my toes and violate our business, you're going to get shot, stabbed in the face. ""If you're a little boy or a grown man. Anyone can get it. You step on my toes you're f**ked."" This is a classic county lines operation, which police say has now become a problem in every single police force in the country and has exploded in the last five years. Sources have told Sky News that the police are expected to announce that the number of known county lines have increased by a third to 2,000. It is estimated each line can make thousands of pounds daily, creating a combined industry of £3 million a day. Some 58 vulnerable people who had been caught up in the gangs, including children, were rescued during the week-long operation Sky News can reveal that in a two-week operation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and UK police forces, more than 500 suspects have been arrested, 78 weapons seized, and 95 drug lines destroyed. More than 250 people involved in the running of drugs for the gangs have been safeguarded, including children. The violent nature of those at the centre of these operations, and the extent to which they are expanding, is at least part of the explanation for the worrying increase in knife crime across the UK. Vince O'Brien, head of drugs operations at the NCA, told Sky News: ""Clearly high levels of violence are a concern. When people get drawn into criminal gangs, then the way in which those gangs resolve the disputes between them is with violence and that's certainly part of the problem. ""One of the issues with the serious violence is violent competition between drugs gangs and stabbings, acid attacks and shootings can be part of that competition as they look to take over the market and that can be a real concern."" Zakaria Mohammed admitted running a drugs supply chain and trafficking two boys and a girl to deal on his behalf in Lincoln The former drugs lead at the NCA, Tony Saggers, has become the leading expert in this area and now advises local police forces. He said: ""County lines has become the expansion of London, in terms of the violence and knife crime and the young people involved. If you deal drugs somewhere else you cause agitation and potential violence. ""Because you are expanding a workforce and the geography of your operation - you need more people involved. You can no longer run around a London borough with six people involved if you are covering six counties and a dozen towns. ""That's where the children come in."" These wider markets are further from the reach of the metropolitan dealers who are controlling them and this brings greater levels of violence in order to maintain that control. Sky News spoke to a teenager who has been running a county line ever since being taken into care at the age of 14. The girl - known as Sarah - said she sold class A drugs such as heroin and crack and that the dealers are getting more violent and using ""guns, knives and acid"" to keep a grip on their business. On one occasion, Sarah was punished with a stabbing because her shipment was stolen from her. Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield told Sky News she was probably set up to make her feel indebted to the gang. She said this was becoming a common tactic. ""The kids who are the collateral, these aren't huge 17-year-olds with great physical presence and imposing characters, these are often small, vulnerable children who look quite meek, don't have much confidence,"" she said. ""But they are being exploited, frightened, and groomed, and also huge levels of physical violence held over them to do what they do. Most kids involved are scared stiff."" Sky News travelled with a 47-year-old woman who was a drug mule to Southend. She said she was frightened to go to the police or stop doing what she was doing, but hated being part of the drug dealing network. Upon arrival in the seaside town, Sky News spoke to several young people who said they have been approached by dealers from London asking them to get involved. They said the town had changed for the worse as a result and no longer felt safe. Kofi, 17, admitted he sometimes carried a knife. ""The town centre is such a dangerous place - I don't feel safe,"" he said. ""In a place like this, without a weapon you don't feel safe. There have been times when I've felt like I've had to."" The NCA's Vince O'Brien told Sky News county lines had been a real challenge to cope with. He said: ""The response to county lines is a complicated one. It's about the demand for drugs and it's about the way people are moving around the country. ""The Home Office has funded a new county lines coordination centre where the NCA is working with local police forces to coordinate the national effort to respond to it, to build up an intelligence picture and to understand how we can respond most effectively."" more than 90,000 people have signed the petition - have you?"
2018-12-09,A competition with a mission to inspire the next generation of cyber security experts will open on Monday... and it's just for girls.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181209221456/https://news.sky.com/story/national-cyber-security-centre-aims-to-inspire-next-generation-of-female-code-breakers-11575858,"The contest is run by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to encourage 12 and 13-year-old girls to get involved in code-cracking and problem-solving, in the hope they chose computer science for GCSE and go on to do further qualifications in the subject. The problem is, only 11% of the global cyber workforce are women - something the deputy director of the NCSC Chris Ensor says is ""not good enough"". He said: ""Often we talk about boys, girls, male, female, but ultimately we want people across the spectrum working in this space who will bring different things. ""They might have the same technical skills but they look at things in a different way, approach problems in a different way, they will do teamwork in a different way and that's what brings the magic. ""That's what helps us solve so many different problems."" The concept of the competition is definitely working at the Piggott School in Berkshire. Four girls made up the winning team for 2018, beating 4,500 other students from across the UK, and it has inspired many of the new Year 8 pupils to follow in their footsteps. But it has not gone down well with everyone. Pat Bhattacharya, head of science at the school, said: ""It's a little bit tricky telling the boys it's not for them and I asked them why they thought it was just for girls and everybody knew the answer... It's to encourage girls to address the gender imbalance."" As a computer programmer before she became a teacher, she knows how male-dominated an environment it can be. Zara Pristov-King, who was part of the winning team, said: ""It definitely raised awareness. ""I decided to take the subject because of the competition and I may be taking it for A-level."" Teammate Jess Peck described the experience of winning as ""amazing"". She said: ""I think it's really important to spread the word and competitions like this really open up opportunities."" More than 115,000 have signed the petition - have you? The NCSC, which is part of the government intelligence organisation GCHQ, also has a scheme of student bursaries and courses to help even up the gender split. The first round of the CyberFirst Girls Competition 2019 is all online and entries open on Monday. The finals are due to be held for the top 10 teams in Edinburgh in March. But if the first two years of the contest are anything to go by, it has already proved a victory for the competition's organisers."

2018-12-09,"It is meant to be a watershed week; the moment when Theresa May - after two years of negotiating in Brussels, Westminster and within her own cabinet - asks parliament to back her Brexit deal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181209221456/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-could-still-press-pause-on-brexit-meaningful-vote-11576712,"But just hours from the planned meaningful vote it is far from clear whether it will go ahead at all, in the face of what is looking like a catastrophic defeat that threatens to bring down her premiership - and her government too. Senior sources have told me that the vote is going ahead ""as it stands"" but say in reality the prime minister and her chief whip have not made the decision yet as to whether to postpone vote or not. I'm told her inner circle are likely to make the final decision on Monday night after the fourth day of debate on her Brexit deal in the Commons. There are various options that the prime minister's team are weighing up as we go into a critical week for Mrs May - and for the country too. :: May battles to keep Brexit deal alive as opponents circle The first question they are surely asking is how big will the defeat be and what could then flow from a hundred-plus rebellion on the Tory benches? A catastrophic defeat will undoubtedly plunge her premiership, already hanging by a thread, into a full-blown crisis. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could seize on the mayhem and table a motion of no confidence in her government as early as Tuesday night. Leave victory has been 'squandered by cowards', say donors It is hard to see how Labour could actually get such a vote across the line given it would rely on the DUP voting with republican Corbyn over unionist May. But there is a very slim chance of a defeat - and that could bring about a Labour/SNP minority government by Christmas, although some Labour sources tell me its more likely that Mr Corbyn will table a censure motion instead. This is designed to express in the strongest possible terms disapproval in the prime minister or in her government. The DUP are far likelier to go for this - perhaps hoping to help oust Mrs May as Conservative leader - then move with Labour to bring the Tory government down. Jeremy Corbyn reaches out to the DUP and says Labour is 'ready to step in and negotiate seriously' to find an alternative Brexit deal A huge defeat could also, from her own party, precipitate a confidence vote in her leadership. There has already been one failed coup in the last month, but some in the party feel that a resounding defeat on her landmark policy has to result in her departure as PM and would-be successors - Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey - were lining up this weekend to offer their own Brexiteer pitch to the party as they circle the prime minister. But Mrs May also has to consider what might happen with both her DUP and Brexiteer colleagues on Tuesday if she did - against the odds - win the vote, points out one senior source. Brexiteers might be so furious that they would trigger a confidence ballot anyway, while the DUP might be so furious that they do back Mr Corbyn to bring her down. After all, her confidence and supply partners have made it clear they cannot support the government if the Brexit deal goes through as it stands. That means Mrs May must find more concessions if she wants to remain in No 10. Which brings me neatly to No 10's Plan B. And that isn't whether to back a Norway style Brexit or pivoting to a second referendum - yet. It is rather what Mrs May could try to do in the coming days to win over support for her deeply unpopular deal. White paper, common rulebook, facilitated customs arrangement... what do all the terms likely to be used in Brexit proposals actually mean? One option is - as her Brexiteers and the DUP keep telling her - to return to Brussels to seek more concessions. A source tells me Mrs May could postpone the deal and return ahead of the European Council summit on Thursday for emergency talks with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker. ""It's not impossible she will go early to try and negotiate ahead of the council,"" said one figure, pointing out that colleagues who have publicly opposed the deal need something to help them climb back down the ladder This could be a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit clause. Both will be supremely difficult to negotiate. Another option might be to use parliamentary procedure to avoid a crushing defeat. MPs will vote on up to six amendments to the meaningful vote before Mrs May's plan is voted on and a couple of them - if selected by the Speaker - could kill off the prime minister's motion. The one to watch is an amendment laid by the chair of the Brexit select committee, Hilary Benn. He has drafted an amendment that blocks both a no-deal Brexit and kills off Mrs May's motion. If passed, it would stop the meaningful vote even taking place and has the advantage of avoiding an enormous defeat, as it would be Remainers such as former attorney general Dominic Grieve who might vote for this rather than the Brexiteers. The scale of her defeat could fall back from 100 plus to under 20. But it does kill off her deal, which is something she will not want to happen. With options like these, it might be better to press pause and there have been a couple of clues in the past week that No 10 is laying the ground for a dignified retreat.   One came on Thursday when the submarine-like Sir Graham Brady, chair of the powerful 1922 backbench committee, surfaced to urge the prime minister to delay the deal, saying ""most of us would like to see an agreement being reached"" but that this would require more time. The other clue was the collapse of the much-vaunted TV debate between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn, originally scheduled for Sunday night. Called off after the two party leaders disagreed on the format and channel for the head-to-head, it also means Mrs May hasn't nailed her colours to the mast with the public should she decide to pull the vote at the 11th hour. There is perhaps one thing her team are sure of as they enter into uncharted political and constitutional waters this week - those around her remain convinced the prime minister will not resign, no matter what. Of course, MPs may try this week to take that decision out of her hands, all the more reason to avoid a crushing - perhaps fatal - parliamentary defeat."

Police in New Zealand revealed on Sunday they had found a body which they believe to be his sibling in woodland on the outskirts of Auckland. It comes as a 26-year-old man has appeared in the city's district court accused of murdering Ms Millane. He is alleged to have carried out the killing between 1-2 December and his home address is listed as the hotel where the British woman was last seen alive. Officers identified a countryside road on the outskirts of Auckland as a ""location of interest"". Scenic Drive is roughly 15 miles from the CityLife hotel where Ms Millane was last seen on 1 December. Detective Inspector Scott Beard said the body was found in a bush about 10 metres off the road during a scene examination. He told reporters on Sunday: ""A short time ago we located a body that we believe to be Grace. ""Based on the evidence we have gathered in the past few days we expect that this is Grace. ""This is an unbearable time for the Millane family and our hearts go out to them."" He added that Ms Millane's family had been informed. Detectives have released images of a red Toyota Corolla hatchback and have asked anyone who saw the vehicle on Monday 3 December between 6.30am and 9.30am to contact them. The car was rented in central Auckland on Sunday. Ms Millane, from Wickford in Essex, graduated from the University of Lincoln in September and was on a year-long around-the-world trip. She arrived in New Zealand from Peru on 20 November. The graduate was last seen with a ""male companion"" at a hotel in Auckland at 9:41pm on Saturday 1 December. Her father David has described her as a ""lovely, outgoing, fun-loving, family-orientated daughter"" who had been in regular contact before she disappeared. Ms Millane is known to have used the Tinder dating app while she was in New Zealand. Police said there was no suggestion Ms Millane previously knew the man she was seen entering the hotel with, but would not speculate on how they met. She was staying at the Base Backpackers hostel in central Auckland before she went missing. Investigators announced on Friday they were treating Ms Millane's disappearance as murder, having previously expressed ""grave fears"" for her safety."
2018-12-09,England footballer Raheem Sterling has responded on social media after an alleged racist attack on him at Chelsea on Saturday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181209221456/https://news.sky.com/story/raheem-sterling-responds-after-alleged-racial-attack-at-chelsea-11576020,"As Chelsea and the Metropolitan Police investigate footage of football fans shouting at the Manchester City forward, Sterling said it was time to have his point heard. And he accused newspapers of ""fuelling racism"". Posting pictures on Instagram of two newspaper headlines about young footballers buying houses, Sterling said the language used in the story about the black player was negative while the one about the white player was positive. ""Good morning,"" the footballer wrote, ""I am not normally the person to talk a lot but when I think I need my point to be heard I will speak up."" Sterling refers to the incident on Saturday during the first half of the match at Stamford Bridge, saying ""as you can see by my reaction I just had to laugh because I don't expect no better"". More than 115,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

""I think this is unacceptable,"" he wrote, adding that both players were innocent but the ""young black kid is looked at in a bad light"" which ""fuel(s) racism and aggressive behaviour"". He concluded: ""So for all the newspapers that don't understand why people are racist in this day and age all I have to say is have a second thought about fair publicity and give all players an equal chance."" Twitter users highlighted Saturday's first-half incident when a Chelsea supporter appeared to abuse Sterling, which was also tweeted by pundit and former England striker Ian Wright, who said ""the bad old days are back"". Gary Lineker, who called the footage ""despicable"", praised Sterling for his post, saying it was ""brave and right"" that the player spoke out, while Rio Ferdinand tweeted: ""Are we going to continue to allow this type of racist behaviour go on??? All for kicking a ball!"" The journalist who wrote the story on Adarabioyo's house purchase has clarified his reasons for covering the story, adding that ""reporters don't do headlines"". The story was done at a time when BT had a documentary on teenage footballers earning millions. It was topical and there was a huge debate about it. The same day there was at least an hour segment about it on Talksport. The original story, which I followed up, appeared in The Sun https://t.co/ailPWiJdJ2 Anthony Joseph tweeted: ""Sterling raises some very valid points that the media need to listen to. I can only explain the story I wrote - it was topical and not based on race. I know for some that won't be enough..."" Lord Ouseley, chair of Kick It Out which campaigns for equality in football, has called on the game's leaders to address the incident at Stamford Bridge and the issues raised by Sterling on Sunday. He wrote: ""What happened at Chelsea shows what is still going on in football. ""Where is (Premier League executive chairman) Richard Scudamore, where is (Football Association chairman) Greg Clarke, where is Chelsea's chairman (Bruce Buck) - they should have been talking out last night and it has to be dealt with at the top. ""We do not have any leadership at the top of the game to speak out, they rely on Kick It Out."" The FA released a statement saying: ""We take all allegations of discrimination extremely seriously and will work with the clubs and the relevant authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with appropriately. ""We strongly condemn all forms of discrimination and encourage all fans and participants who believe that they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report it through the appropriate channels: The FA, our County FAs or our partners Kick It Out."" The Metropolitan Police have confirmed to Sky News that they are investigating claims that some of the abuse was racially motivated.  Good morning I just want to say , I am not normally the person to talk a lot but when I think I need my point to heard I will speak up. Regarding what was said at the Chelsea game as you can see by my reaction I just had to laugh because I don’t expect no better. For example you have two young players starting out there careers both play for the same team, both have done the right thing. Which is buy a new house for there mothers who have put in a lot of time and love into helping them get where they are, but look how the news papers get there message across for the young black player and then for the young white payer. I think this in unacceptable both innocent have not done a thing wrong but just by the way it has been worded. This young black kid is looked at in a bad light. Which helps fuel racism an aggressive behaviour, so for all the news papers that don’t understand why people are racist in this day and age all i have to say is have a second thought about fair publicity an give all players an equal chance.

2018-12-09,David Davis says Theresa May will lose Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal and be forced to return to Brussels for further talks until she gets an acceptable agreement.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181209221456/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-will-lose-brexit-vote-and-be-forced-to-go-back-to-eu-says-david-davis-11574971,"Speaking to Sky News, the former Brexit secretary said the deal would be rejected because it meant Britain would become a ""rule-taker"". His comments came as Tory MP Will Quince quit the government over Mrs May's deal, and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd warned of ""chaos"" if it is voted down. Mr Davis said: ""I don't think [Mrs May] win. ""I think that the deal will be rejected because it's seen by everybody to leave us as rule-takers, to leave us as a subordinate and not actually answer the questions or meet the promises either in our manifesto or in the referendum. ""I think she'll go back to the EU, I think they will talk to her. Hopefully they will have substantive talks, we have lots of ideas of the sorts of things they could do to improve were we are now. ""The outcome of that is that she'll have to come back to parliament again and hopefully this time with a deal we will accept."" Resigning from his role as ministerial aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Mr Quince said he could not accept the deal as it stands. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said: ""Unless the backstop is addressed to include either an end date or a unilateral exit mechanism, I cannot support it and so am resigning from the government as a Parliamentary Private Secretary"". Earlier, Ms Rudd warned that ""anything could happen"" if the UK-EU agreement is turned down, ""most of which they won't want to happen"". MPs needed to consider if they preferred the alternatives, including the softer Brexit Norway-style option or another referendum that risked reversing the 2016 result, said Ms Rudd. She acknowledged Tuesday's vote was ""going to be difficult"", but was adamant Mrs May would remain as prime minister even if her government was defeated, insisting ""she will see us through this"". What you need to know about the PM's deal The Conservative frontbencher also took a swipe at colleagues rumoured to be plotting leadership bids behind the scenes, arguing a contest would ""add another layer of difficulty"" to an already challenging situation and be ""a real mistake"". Ms Rudd became the first cabinet minister to publicly discuss a ""Plan B"" if Mrs May's deal was rejected. The Remain-supporting frontbencher said a so-called Norway-plus model was a ""plausible"" alternative. This option would be particularly unpalatable to Brexit backers as it would see the UK remain closely tied to the EU, inside both the single market and a customs union. Supporting the withdrawal agreement secured by the PM, Ms Rudd said: ""I think this is the right deal for the country. ""I think it will get through but I know it's going to be difficult, because of people are still declaring against it."" She added: ""The point about me discussing other alternatives is to remind people that it is all very well saying, 'I don't like this about the agreement or I don't like that about the agreement.' ""What happens if it's voted down? Anything could happen. There's lots of different things that could happen, most of which they won't want to happen. So when they think about this deal they need to weigh up the alternatives as well."" Ms Rudd argued there was ""a lot of support"" for the Norway-plus model in the Commons and a ""certain amount of support"" for a people's vote. She said: ""People should think very clearly if they are not going to vote for the Government's withdrawal agreement whether they would actually prefer those alternatives.   ""The withdrawal agreement we have will deliver the stability that we want, that our businesses need, the investment that we want."" On the Tory leader's future if the agreement was voted down, Ms Rudd said: ""Theresa May is a prime minister who will stay through this. I am absolutely convinced. I know that she will see us through this."" And in a warning to colleagues mulling a challenge for the top job, she said: ""We are in difficult times at the moment to add another layer of difficulty by having those sort of conversations would be a real mistake and would not be in the national interest. ""Nobody knows what happens next and that chaos needs to be avoided."" Her comments came as critics said Mrs May could be forced to stand down if her deal was defeated. Eurosceptic former party leader Iain Duncan Smith cautioned against the PM and her cabinet deciding to ""brazen it out"", saying such an approach would be a ""disaster"".

It came as Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the crunch vote would go ahead on Tuesday, amid reports it could be pulled to spare the government a large loss. Sky News estimates around 100 Tory MPs are set to reject the deal. The paper has softened its tone since its change of editor The split could have deeper implications after Brexit is settled, former attorney-general Dominic Grieve also warned. ""There is a risk that the party will split and cannot continue in its current form,"" he told Sky News. And Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the government's confidence-and-supply partners the Democratic Unionist Party, warned Mrs May couldn't ""count on our support"" indefinitely. Westminster is gearing up for Tuesday's ""meaningful vote"" - the climax of 18 months' of negotiations with Brussels. Leave victory has been 'squandered by cowards', say donors Mrs May signed off a deal with the EU last month, but must now win the support of MPs. The prime minister spoke to European Council president Donald Tusk on Sunday, who tweeted that it ""will be an important week for the fate of #Brexit"". Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, told Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday there should be a general election if Mrs May loses Tuesday's vote. ""Our preferred option, very, very strongly, is that we refresh the parliament. ""Though we are ready to form a minority government should that be necessary - and it could happen on Wednesday morning - and to begin to reset the negotiation and take the country forward in a much better direction."" More than 115,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Mr Kwarteng was upbeat about the government's chances, telling Sky News they had a ""good shot at winning"" because ""the deal is a strong deal"". Meanwhile, Esther McVey, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson failed to guarantee that they would not challenge Mrs May should she lose the vote. In her first broadcast interview since quitting as work and pensions secretary last month over the government's handling of Brexit, Ms McVey told Sophy Ridge: ""If people asked me of course you'd give it serious concern."" Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest he had already been offering jobs in a future administration to fellow Tories. But when asked to give an ""absolute, categorical promise"" that he would not stand against the prime minister, Mr Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I will give you an absolute, categorical promise that I will continue to advocate what I think is the most sensible plan."" Asked by Sophy Ridge if he had leadership ambitions, former Brexit secretary Mr Raab replied: ""I've always said I wouldn't rule it out."" Rival protests took place in London on Sunday in the run-up to Tuesday's vote. Three were arrested at a ""Brexit betrayal"" march featuring controversial activist Tommy Robinson, while counter-protests were held by anti-fascist groups."

The 45-year-old was affected by the same nerve agent that was used to target ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Mr Rowley and his partner Dawn Sturgess, 44, fell ill in the nearby town of Amesbury months after the Skripals were targeted. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. Timeline: How the Wiltshire novichok poisonings unfolded Britain has accused Russia of carrying out the poisoning of the Skripals, who both survived. Moscow has also been blamed for the death of Ms Sturgess and the poisoning of Mr Rowley, who are believed to have come into contact with novichok discarded by the Skripals' attackers. British police named Russian nationals Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Borishov as the perpetrators. Mr Rowley told the Sunday Mirror: ""I may be out of hospital but I don't feel safe. ""I'm terrified about the future. ""Doctors simply don't know what the long-term effects could be. ""The worst thing has been the fear over my sight. ""I'm struggling to see properly and to walk. ""I'm one of only a handful in the world to have survived novichok, so it's untrod territory. ""I feel like a guinea pig. I don't know what's going to happen from one day to the next."" He added: ""I'm still worried the novichok could kill me if I get any sort of virus again - it's on my mind all the time. ""I'm dreading getting a cold. ""When I got out of hospital the first time I was pleased. ""But it may have been too soon because a few weeks later I was back - blind and unable to use my left arm with meningitis. ""I remember losing all balance and suffering tunnel vision. ""Doctors told me I'd suffered numerous strokes and I needed heart treatment and a pacemaker. It's all to do with the novichok.""

If the authorities offered me help I would take it. I feel let down."" Mr Rowley added: ""I don't think I'll be alive in 10 years. It has been horrendous."" :: Salisbury's £500k rebrand after nerve agent poisonings Police have said they do not believe that Mr Rowley or his partner were deliberately targeted, rather that they were affected because of the ""recklessness in which such a toxic nerve agent was disposed of"". Borishov, one of the men suspected of poisoning the Skripals, was later revealed to be a Russian military intelligence service colonel. His real name is Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga. Petrov was later revealed to be a Russian doctor named Alexander Yevgenyevich Mishkin."

When officers gained access to the house they found Mark Boyce, Patrick Casey, Seth Lee and a 16-year-old boy pretending to be asleep alongside a large amount of stolen jewellery. Although they were found sharing two beds, they denied knowing each other or having any involvement in the burglary. Lee, 19, was sentenced to three years and four months in prison at Luton Crown Court. Casey, 19, was handed a two-year jail term, while Boyce, also 19, was sentenced to one year and 10 months. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Boyce received a shorter sentence because he decided to return a watch stolen in the burglary and brought it to the court. The 16-year-old, who has not been named, will be sentenced at a later date. Detective Constable Andrew Boston said: ""This was one of the more unusual cover stories for a group of burglars that I've encountered, but unfortunately for them our officers didn't buy it. ""The property recovered in the bedrooms where we found the offenders was identified as having been stolen from another house in the nearby neighbourhood. ""This allowed us to build a strong case against the offenders, who brazenly attempted to deny their involvement in this burglary. ""Hopefully this will serve as a warning to others who think they are above the law - we are committed to catching anyone who looks to profit from other people's misery."""

Ms Gaylord fled when the fire broke out on 8 November and ruined the town of 27,000. An animal rescuer who responded to Ms Gaylord's request to check on Madison first spotted the male Anatolian shepherd mix several days later. Shayla Sullivan said the outdoor guard dog was apprehensive and kept his distance. Ms Sullivan left food and water for him regularly until Ms Gaylord got back on Wednesday. She also helped locate Madison's brother Miguel, another Anatolian shepherd mix that was taken to a shelter 85 miles away. ""If (the evacuees) can't be there I'm going to be and I'm not going to give up on their animal until they can get back in,"" Ms Sullivan said. The dogs reunited on Friday when Ms Gaylord came back to the property with Miguel and brought Madison his favourite treat - a box of Wheat Thin crackers. Ms Gaylord told news station ABC10 she could not ask for a better animal. ""Imagine the loyalty of hanging in in the worst of circumstances and being here waiting,"" she said. ""Their instinctual job is to watch the flocks and we're part of them,"" Ms Gaylord said about her dogs. ""It's a comforting feeling."""

He had just spent six years and eight months inside - here and at another of Yaroslavl's insalubrious jails. The prison guards don't want us to film. Not missing a beat, Mr Makarov thrusts his mobile phone camera in their faces and demands to know what their problem is. He won't let up. Eventually they leave. It's plucky from a man who 18 months earlier was lying handcuffed to a table, stripped from the waist down with a roomful of guards taking turns to beat him. ""They punched me on my feet, in my face, choked me with a towel, they poured water into my mouth so that I suffocated. I died four times because of that and they brought me back to life four times,"" he says. They didn't beat the spirit out of him. We know all this because there's a video. Torture in Russian jails is nothing new. Seeing the brutal evidence of it is. It is a hard watch. Mr Makarov's telling of it is unpleasant enough but he doesn't describe how he yelled. His case caused a public outcry but only because the video was leaked - the publicity shaming Russia's prisons service into carrying out nationwide inspections and prosecuting the guards involved. Thirteen of the guards now sit behind bars awaiting trial. Another is under house arrest. Mr Makarov points out their windows. ""I hope, I deeply hope that these sadists are punished,"" he says. Mr Makarov's lawyer, Irina Biryukova, from the human rights group Public Verdict, had been busy long before the video came out. She had complained to prison authorities that Mr Makarov and others were being beaten. She had brought their case to the European Court of Human Rights which had ordered authorities to look into it. The video was leaked one year later. Only then was there a response. It's thrown the spotlight on a culture of torture and abuse in Russia's jails. Ms Biryukova says the publicity from the video has emboldened others to speak out. He said: ""We're receiving a very big number of reports from convicted people from other prisons from all over Russia. ""We started to work with them. This shows us that people stopped being scared and began to talk about the problem of torture."" This Monday is Human Rights Day. It marks 70 years since the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It comes at a time when Russia is threatening to leave the Council of Europe, and if it does, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR has long been a final recourse for Russian citizens and one that has repeatedly held the state to account for human rights abuses. Most recently the court ordered Moscow to pay opposition politician Alexey Navalny a £25,000 fine for his repeated detentions. More than 115,000 people have signed our petition - have you? At a Moscow conference to mark the anniversary, Russia's human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskolkova was hosting her Eurasian counterparts. It's a mark of where Russia's focus lies. ""Sharing human rights best practice"" was the name given to the event. From Iran to Kazakhstan, the line-up of attendees were not known for their stellar human rights records. Ms Moskolkova told us she would regret any departure from the ECHR. ""The Council of Europe without Russia is not a complete organisation,"" she says. ""The same I believe for Russia. Without international human rights bodies, that would be a step back."" What is surprising about Mr Makarov's case, though, is the fact that the pressure came from within. A video that was leaked by an insider and brought to the attention of an independent media outlet had the power to initiate a shift. The trial hasn't started yet but Ms Biryukova thinks the chances of justice being served are high because of the publicity. Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service has now documented a further 168 violations in prisons and detention facilities across the country and says those involved will face disciplinary charges. Whether they will follow through on each and every case is another story but it is a start. There is little to celebrate in the battle against abuse in Russia's jails; this is a small but significant victory."

It was the second year of the mass sleep-out after the first one in Edinburgh last year, which raised more than £4m. Participants contributed at least £100 each to take part. Before bedding down on plastic sheeting, concerts were laid on at the different venues by acts including Lulu, KT Tunstall and Amy McDonald. Tunstall told the crowd in Dundee's Slessor Gardens on Saturday night: ""We see it every day - people who haven't had the opportunity they hoped they'd have, and they've ended up in a really difficult situation. ""One thing I always hear is that homeless people feel like people can't see them. ""It's fantastic that we're showing solidarity tonight and we do see them, and we do want to help. Thank you for being involved. I'm so proud to be part of Social Bite tonight."" Organisers hailed the event as the world's biggest sleep-out. More than 115,000 have signed the petition - have you?

""This is a night that we collectively gave a voice to the people who have never had one - and the event will have the very direct impact of helping 830 people off the streets in Scotland. ""There are 11,000 homeless households in Scotland. When I think about all of the amazing different people, sleeping out throughout Scotland tonight, the one thing that strikes me is that homelessness isn't insurmountable.

The video, which has been posted on social media, shows her telling a student to ""take a seat"", before she starts singing the US national anthem loudly as she snips off locks of his hair and casually tosses them behind her. She then says ""Next... I'm not done... next..."", snips her scissors in the air, before pointing at another student. The teacher walks up to a teenage girl as someone in the room says ""No, Miss G"". She then grabs her hair and lifts the scissors into the air while youngsters run for the exit. Some are heard screaming as she continues to sing the anthem at the top of her voice. Sky News has seen the video but has decided not to show it over concerns for the welfare of those shown. Eric Thiessen, the principal of University Preparatory High School, Visalia, told local paper the Visalia Times Delta ""all students are safe"" but directed further questions to the local authority. Mrs Gieszinger has been charged with six misdemeanour offences, including false imprisonment and cruelty to a child, according to US news channel ABC 30. Some students and former students suggested her behaviour was out of character. One, who Sky News is not naming, told the Times Delta: ""When everything was going on I was terrified, and I so badly wanted to blame her. I was scared she was going to come back. ""What she did to my classmates and I is inexcusable. I am not trying to make excuses for her, I simply ask everyone to reconsider how they view her. ""She is a loving and kind lady. She is usually all smiles and laughs. This is not the Miss G. we know and love."" Another former student on Reddit, who called themselves TheOfficialPope, said he saw her in Los Angeles the week before when she was behaving in an odd manner. A number of other unnamed students told ABC 30 that the 52-year-old teacher had shown other examples of ""mental instability"" and a psychologist told the station that she showed signs of having a ""psychotic episode or a manic episode where a person's sense of reality is compromised"". Mrs Gieszinger's husband said he could not explain why she had behaved the way she did. He told ABC 30: ""It's a shock to me, that's out of her character. She doesn't do stuff like that. It's not her. It's not who she is. So I don't know what was going on with her. I don't have any clue as to why she did that."" When she was released from jail, she covered her face but was seen crying by ABC 30 reporters, and refused to comment. Some students criticised the school for not acting on previous concerns expressed by youngsters at the school. Tulare County's education department released a statement on Thursday saying the teacher would not be returning to her classroom at the school, where she has worked since August of this year. ABC 30 reported the statement as saying on Thursday: ""The staff at University Preparatory High School and the administration at the Tulare County Office of Education are deeply concerned for the students who were subjected to the disturbing behaviour in Margaret Gieszinger's class yesterday morning. ""We take very seriously the safety of the students in classrooms and on the COS campus. We move decisively when questions of inappropriate and unprofessional conduct are brought to the attention of UPHS administration. ""In this instance, we promptly removed Ms Gieszinger from her classroom and worked closely with the COS Police Department."" Counsellors have been made available to the students affected."

They say the song should be three minutes 57 seconds long, and be 114 beats per minute (BPM). It should also be sung by a 27-year-old artist. Researchers found most number ones are ballads, the majority were covers, and nearly all were about something other than Christmas. More than 115,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Always On My Mind, by the Pet Shop Boys, is not only the ideal length and key exactly, but is also a cover of Elvis' 1972 hit. However, it's slightly too fast, at 125 BPM. The Pet Shop Boys had an average age of 31.5 the year it hit number one, in 1987. Boney M's Mary's Boy Child was a close second, with a tempo of 113 bpm, a length of four minutes two seconds and a key of F, two semitones lower than G. Mariah Carey's classic All I Want For Christmas Is You is four minutes and one second long, 150 BPM, and she was aged 24 when it came out.

Heavier rain, stronger winds and possibly hill snow by Thursday."" It added: ""Thursday and Friday look set to be wet and windy in the North West, and colder and drier in the far east.

However, the end of the week looks more unsettled with the potential for some very wet and windy weather. Some snow is possible in northern parts, mainly over high ground. ""Warnings could be needed for wind, rain or snow - best keep an eye on the Met Office warnings if planning on travelling later in the week."" According to the Met Office, the last official white Christmas was recorded in 2010, when there was widespread snow in Northern Ireland, Scotland, parts of Wales, the Midlands, the North East and South West. Forecasters can only accurately predict what the weather will be like on Christmas Day up to five days beforehand. The Sky News weather team said there was some indication it will be cold on 25 December but that it was far too early to say if it will snow. The UK has already seen its fair share of extreme weather this year, with the ""Beast from the East"" in February and March delaying spring and bringing Arctic conditions, and the scorching heatwave which broke records through June and July."

""When I found out I was being offered an MBE in the Queen's birthday honours, my initial reaction was - no way,"" she said. The artist said her grandmother, Millie, had travelled to England in the 1950s as part of the Windrush generation, and that the investiture invitation had coincided with the scandal that emerged earlier this year. She said she changed her mind, ""not because I want to be part of the establishment, or had suddenly stopped caring about the damaging legacy of empire and colonialism, or that it was suddenly all okay, but because I wanted to honour my grandparents, and all of their generation, and the extraordinary sacrifices they made"". Elworthy, who has lived in the UK for 12 years, said it was ""humbling"" to be recognised for his contribution to cricket after receiving an MBE. The 53-year-old, who is managing director of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, due to be held in England and Wales next year, said: ""I'm amazed actually, it's the most incredible feeling and a fantastic day.

But when asked by US District Judge Tanya Chutkan if her mind was clear as she prepared to enter her guilty plea, she replied: ""Absolutely"". Prosecutors have said she was helped in her work by the Russian official and two US citizens. Her lawyers previously named the Russian as Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia's central bank. Prosecutors said that one of the two Americans was Paul Erickson, a conservative activist who was dating her. The long-term aim was to sway US policy towards Russia, they said. Among evidence uncovered by the US was contact information for people suspected of being employed by Russia's Federal Security Services and notes referring to a potential job offer from the agency. Butina will remain in jail until she is sentenced. The maximum penalty for conspiracy is five years but her lawyer, Robert Driscoll, estimated she could face up to six months in prison. Butina, a pro-gun activist, was arrested on 15 July. The US Justice Department said Butina entered the US on a student visa without officially disclosing the fact that she was acting as an agent of Russian government, as required by law. Her work as an agent took place from ""as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017"", the department said earlier this year. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? But her lawyer had claimed she was just a student interested in relations between Russia and the US and that her mundane networking had been criminalised. Russia had described the case against her as ""fabricated"" and on Tuesday, as it became clear Butina would enter a guilty plea, Russia's president Vladimir Putin said: ""She risks 15 years in jail. For what? ""I asked all the heads of our intelligence services what is going on - nobody knows anything about her."" Reacting to news of Butina's plea on Thursday, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the Russian state Duma's foreign affairs committee said she had fallen victim to ""political inquisition"". He said: ""They broke her down. Anyone would break down in circumstances like that."" Butina's case is not related to the investigation led by former FBI chief Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the US presidential election. But she is the first Russian to be convicted of attempting to sway US policy in a time period that includes Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Mr Trump has denied any collusion with Moscow and Russia has denied meddling in US politics."
2018-12-11,"A director of one of England's best-performing hospitals has said he is ""nervous"" about winter, despite planning more extensively than ever.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/even-top-nhs-trusts-are-nervous-about-winter-11580100,"West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust is rated ""outstanding"" and is in the top 15 hospitals in the country when judged against a key A&E performance target, seeing close to 95% of patients within four hours. Sky News spent two days at the hospital speaking to doctors, patients and administrators, as well as GPs and ambulance staff. We found that even after months of planning and greater co-operation with other services and social care than ever, winter still brings major challenges, and a sense of trepidation among staff working harder than ever to keep up with rising demand. The hospital occupies ageing real estate on the edge of the market town of Bury St Edmunds. It has an emergency department that was built in 1974 to see 30,000 patients a year but today has to cope with 70,000. Pressure on the hospital is largely determined by the impact of winter on an ageing population. The county has the second-oldest demographic in the country, with one in five people aged over 65, a proportion forecast to increase to one-in-four by 2021 and one-in-three by 2037. Winter brings an increase in respiratory illness and cardiac issues, and many patients have more than one serious condition. ""We're nervous,"" says medical director Dr Nick Jenkins, during one of his regular consultant shifts in the emergency department. ""I can't believe there is anyone working in the NHS who isn't nervous about winter. ""We are prepared, we are as well prepared as we have ever been. We have got plans in place for extra beds to be available, we have got as many nurses and doctors as we can recruit, but that's a real challenge. ""We will never have the number of nurses in our hospital for this winter that we need, but we will be working really hard to keep the patients that we have got safe, and the planning that's gone into it will, we hope, pay off."" More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The hospital is predicting an increase in admissions of at least 4%, and preparations for this year include spending £13m on a new Acute Assessment Unit, designed and built in 11 months and intended to divert patients away from the bottleneck of the emergency department, as well as dealing with referrals from local GPs. Chief executive Steve Dunn said planning began before last winter had even finished. ""We were rated outstanding last January but we didn't feel outstanding, so we started planning for this year. We have built the acute assessment unit in time for winter. ""We are also running services in the community, including a ward in a care home. Now we have to staff that extra capacity, but if we can't find the staff to run it safely we won't open that capacity, and that will put pressure on us, but we will have to do our best."" The apprehension at West Suffolk is echoed nationwide by a chorus of health experts and representative bodies who have warned that this winter may be the worst-ever in the modern NHS. Performance figures and situation reports released this week reveal a system already under huge strain and close to capacity. Bed occupancy in the first week of December was 94.2 % across England, close to last winter's post-Christmas peak of 95%, and a third of trusts were at 97%. There were 97,500 ambulance arrivals at hospitals during the week, more than any other week last winter bar Christmas week, and 11% of them suffered handover delays of more than half an hour, with 2,000 delayed for more than an hour. And monthly figures for November showed while hospitals were dealing with 1,000 more people every day within the four-hour A&E target than last year, the proportion of the total attendances seen in that time fell to 87.6%, down on last year and well short of the 95% national target. The NHS Confederation called the figures ""deeply troubling"", while NHS Providers' chief executive Chris Hopson said ""the reality is that trusts can't keep up with three per cent increases in year-on-year attendances""."
2018-12-11,Sports Direct has reported a 27% fall in half-year profits as it counted the cost of swallowing up failed department store chain House of Fraser.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/sports-direct-counts-cost-of-house-of-fraser-rescue-11579415,"The retailer, controlled by tycoon Mike Ashley, said House of Fraser had notched up a loss of £31.5m since it was acquired in August for £90m. The group also injected £70m into the department store's supply chain and Mr Ashley admitted that he faced ""significant challenges"" turning around its fortunes. Shares fell 9%. Sports Direct reported underlying pre-tax profits of £64.4m for the six months to 28 October, down from £88m a year ago. Mr Ashley said that, stripping out House of Fraser, the group was on course to grow full-year earnings in line with target but that including the department store chain it was set to be behind last year's result. The Sports Direct chief executive said: ""I have made my views clear that I believe the previous House of Fraser senior management team traded the business whilst it was insolvent for a long time. ""This means we have significant challenges ahead in turning House of Fraser around. ""However, I genuinely believe we have acquired a fantastic opportunity and with the efforts of Sports Direct and House of Fraser teams, and the support of the brands, local councils and landlords, we can turn House of Fraser into the Harrods of the high street."" The company said that it had ""spent the post acquisition period working with staff, suppliers, concessionaires and landlords to create a viable business"". Sports Direct bought 169-year-old House of Fraser out of administration in August and Mr Ashley said he aimed to keep 80% of its 59 stores open - though has since said that to do so would be a ""godlike"" feat. It means that thousands of jobs remain in doubt as the billionaire tycoon seeks to persuade landlords to slash store rents so that he can keep them open. Sports Direct has already said it is to shut four stores at shopping centres in Essex, Gateshead, Norwich and Nottingham after failed talks with their owner, the property group Intu. Meanwhile suppliers, pensioners and customers have been left out of pocket as the administration process meant the business was picked up free of liabilities for its new owners. Earlier this month, Mr Ashley told Sky News that House of Fraser could be merged or ""should at least work very closely together"" with rival Debenhams, a company in which Sports Direct owns a 30% stake. But there was no mention of that suggestion in the latest statement. Sports Direct, which also owns overseas operations and a range of other brands including ""premium lifestyle"" chain Flannels and cycling specialist Evans, still makes most of its revenues from its UK sports retail business. Sales from this division were little changed at £1.12bn with in-store purchases lower partly ""due to the pressure on the high street"" while web sales were higher. Mr Ashley recently told MPs that the traditional high street faced extinction in the face of competition from internet retail, unless radical action was taken to save it - and in a recent, combative committee hearing, he warned: ""I'm not Father Christmas."" He said the latest half-year performance was ""impressive in the context of the current struggles in the high street"". Chairman David Daly said there were ""short-term challenges ahead, not least as a result of the current level of political uncertainty surrounding Brexit""."
2018-12-11,"Theresa May has appealed for EU leaders' help to get her Brexit deal through parliament, and pitched a plan to make it happen.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/ireland-goes-over-mays-head-and-appeals-directly-to-mps-on-brexit-11580093,"Sky News understands the prime minister proposed placating Tory Brexiteers' fears about the Irish backstop - but not by putting an end date on it. She suggested to EU27 leaders at the winter summit in Brussels that they enshrine a start date for the UK's future relationship - after the transition period ends in 2020. Mrs May told the politicians she ""firmly belives"" her Brexit deal can get through parliament if they ""work together intensively"" to ""get this deal over the line"". Sky sources inside the leaders' meeting say there was sympathy towards the prime minister after her tough day facing a confidence vote on Wednesday. They were friendly, but not much is expected from today's talks, another source said. The premiers moved on to discuss Mrs May's proposal over dinner, while she dined at the ambassador's residence. After a pre-summit meeting with Mrs May, Irish PM Leo Varadkar said that it could be up to British MPs to seek an extension of revocation of article 50 to avoid a no deal. Mr Varadkar noted parliament should use their ""gift"" to prevent a 'no deal' divorce, suggesting there was ""no majority"" for Mrs May's plan. He said parliament could delay or scrap Brexit if the UK stays on course to crash out on 29 March 2019 without Downing Street having secured ratification of Mrs May's agreement. The plea came as EU leaders gathered over dinner in Brussels, clouded by uncertainty. *** NEW: Taoiseach appeals over head of Government directly to UK Parliament telling me on @skynews “it is within gift of Govt and UK Parliament to take the threat of No Deal off the table... by revoking Article 50 or seeking an extension of A50”. pic.twitter.com/Y1aTmDHKzt Mrs May has spent the day in the Belgian capital, fresh from surviving a confidence vote with backing from two-thirds of her MPs. She had promised to get legal assurances that the Irish ""backstop"" will not last indefinitely, but at the start of the day she warned not to expect an ""immediate breakthrough"". That fear is a central plank of her own party's critics - and led to her pulling a vote in the Commons that she was expected to lose significantly. She met Mr Varadkar for a pre-summit sit-down to pitch ideas for placating her Brexiteer backbenchers. The Taoiseach claimed that some ideas ""made sense"" but others were ""difficult"". Immediately after the discussion he told Sky News: ""Let's not forget, ultimately, it is within the gift of the UK government and the UK Parliament to take the threat of no deal off the table... to revoke Article 50... or to seek an extension of Article 50."" He added: ""It seems to me there is a majority in Westminster in favour of the proposition 'there shouldn't be no deal'. ""But there doesn't seem to be a majority in favour of any particular deal."" Have you signed our petition? Mr Varadkar did maintain his ""preferred"" option was to ratify the deal already agreed between the UK and the EU. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the comments proved ""the trap the prime minister is in is getting tighter"". Sky News' Europe correspondent Mark Stone said: ""This is a very interesting development... We've not heard this in such direct terms from another EU leader, appearing to go over the head of the British government and appealing to parliament."" He added that Mr Varadkar is ""very, very worried"", adding that there will be no resolution to the backstop this side of Christmas"". More EU leaders also swooped in early to rule out any changes to the legally-binding Brexit divorce deal. European Parliament President Antonio Tajani declared he was happy to discuss any concerns, but vowed ""not to make further concessions"" or change the ""legal content"". Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic also told Sky News he ""hoped to find a solution"" but that it would be political - not legal. A joke tweeted by the Lithuanian leader cut through, a little blunter: ""#Brexit Christmas wish: Finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver,"" she wrote. #Brexit Christmas wish: finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver pic.twitter.com/lJziZsahry Sky's political editor Faisal Islam said: ""The PM has come to Brussels to convey to some sceptical Europeans that she can still get this deal through parliament, despite the 117 that voted no confidence in her. ""This, to me, displays that some EU leaders at least, are still not convinced that she has the numbers and if she doesn't, that is why they're floating the ideas around Article 50 delay or revocation. ""That doesn't seem to me to be a great sign for the PM as she explains the next stage of the process to EU leaders right now."" Despite the pressure mounting on Mrs May from Brussels, it was a public admission she greeted reporters with that relaxed tensions back home. ""The next general election is in 2022 and I think it is right that another party leader takes us into that general election,"" she said. It was an assurance first given to Conservative MPs on Wednesday night in a bid to save her job by winning a confidence vote. Under the rules, she cannot be challenged by a confidence vote again for 12 months. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has tweeted: ""It's clear that after Theresa May went back to Brussels today that there'll be no changes to her botched Brexit deal. ""There must be no more delays or attempts to run down the clock to deny Parliament alternative options. ""There's no time to waste and Parliament must take back control."""

Overall, 7,318 people were flagged up and referred to the Prevent programme. That overall figure marks a 20% rise on the 6,093 people referred to prevent the year before. Of the 7,318 individuals referred in 2017/18: :: 3,096 (42%) left the process requiring no further action; :: 2,902 (40%) left the process and were signposted to alternative services. :: 1,314 (18%) were deemed suitable, through preliminary assessment, to be discussed by a panel at the Channel programme, which provides support at an early stage to people who are identified as being vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism.

2018-12-11,"NHS hospitals in England were close to capacity in the first week of December, with 94.2% of beds across the country occupied, close to last winter's peak of more than 95%.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-hospitals-close-to-capacity-in-first-week-of-december-11579659,"Bed capacity is a key indicator of how the hospital system is coping with increased winter demand, and the high level of bed occupancy so early in the season will add to concerns that this winter may be just as pressured as last year. The figures will be particularly alarming as the weather has thus far been relatively mild and there is no sign of a flu outbreak on the scale that caused such difficulty for the system a year ago. NHS England says bed occupancy should not exceed 92% while health experts including the Royal College of Emergency Medicine say anything above 85% can compromise patient safety. The bed occupancy figures were contained in the first weekly winter situation report from NHS England, which tracks demand at hospital trusts across the country. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The figures also showed that 10,700 ambulances, more than 11%, experienced delays of more than 30 minutes in completing the handover of patients at hospital. Almost 2,000 of these were delays of more than an hour. Monthly statistics for A&E performance in November showed a decline against the same period last year. Just over two million patients attended A&E during the month, with 87.6% treated, admitted or discharged within four hours, down 1.2% on the same month last year and well short of the target of 95%, which has not been hit nationally for more than three years. NHS England said that because of the increase in attendances more patients were being seen within four hours, but acknowledged demand was placing the system under strain. ""NHS staff continue to work hard to deal with increased demand across the board, seeing 1,000 more people within four hours in A&E every day in November compared to last year. ""A growing proportion of people are getting same day emergency care which prevents the need for an overnight stay and hospitals have freed up an additional 742 beds, by working closely with councils to help more people return home with the right care in place."" Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures were ""hugely concerning"". ""Winter is only just beginning for our NHS and these are hugely concerning figures that don't bode well for the difficult weeks ahead. ""While government remains paralysed by Brexit infighting, the NHS is struggling as a result of years of underfunding, cuts and staffing shortages. Rather than their self-interest, Tory ministers must start prioritising patients' interests by outlining proposals for the NHS this winter. ""It would be totally unforgivable if patients suffered another winter crisis like the ones we've seen in recent years."""

Although they have yet to be formally briefed on the CMA's conclusions, senior figures in the profession have learned in recent days about its main recommendations, which nonetheless remain subject to change ahead of an announcement early next week. The review was launched at the behest of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in the wake of anger about the role of auditors in major corporate scandals at BHS and Carillion. Accountants have also faced probes into their work on the books of companies such as BT Group, the Co-operative Bank, Ted Baker and Patisserie Holdings. One audit sector source said the imposition of a cap on the number of large listed companies that the big four can audit, the adoption of a joint audit model for large listed companies and new steps to improve the accountability of companies' boardroom audit committees - including giving regulators jurisdiction over them - were all expected to form part of the CMA's proposals. An adviser to one big four firm said on Thursday that the CMA may yet leave open the fallback option of a wholesale break-up, which has been lobbied fiercely against by the sector's biggest players. However, they added that the regulator appeared to have been convinced by the industry's argument that a full structural split between audit and non-audit businesses would be impractical on a UK-only basis. The big four operate on a global basis, and most of the FTSE-350 companies whose accounts they oversee are multinational in nature. Instead, the CMA is likely to recommend a less radical separation that would leave the firms intact but could nevertheless lead to the creation‎ of separate boards of directors for the audit practices of the major accountancy firms. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? This could be presented as a form of 'ring-fencing' that the CMA's chairman, Lord Tyrie, was instrumental in pushing through in Britain's banking industry following the 2008 financial crisis. The CMA's findings were submitted to the government in recent days, with their implementation a matter for ministers to decide on. Although the inquiry will stop short of the most draconian reforms, they would, if adopted, have significant implications for the audit profession's leading quartet. The adoption of joint or shared audits, a system used widely in France, would mean a firm from outside the big four being required to work alongside one of the quartet on the accounts of large companies. It was unclear this weekend at what level any market share cap on the big four firms might be set, and whether it would be framed as an individual or collective limit on the number of FTSE-100 companies they can audit. The initial conclusions of the CMA market study will appear alongside those of an inquiry by Sir John Kingman, the former Treasury mandarin, into the role and remit of the under-fire Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Sources said that Sir John's work had concluded that the audit regulator should be reconfigured as a statutory body holding stronger powers, potentially including a formal mandate to ensure the sector's competitiveness. His report, which was also ordered by Greg Clark, the Business Secretary,‎ is thought likely to bring companies, as well as auditors and qualified accountants, under the FRC's supervisory scrutiny, making it more straightforward to pursue enforcement action in the event of misconduct. A person close to Sir John said he had concluded that the FRC was ""not fit for purpose"" and required a radical overhaul of its role, remit and leadership. Sir John and a supporting panel of industry figures are also said to have decided that supervision of actuaries should in future be overseen by the Prudential Regulation Authority rather than the FRC. In the announcement of the CMA's review of the audit market, Lord Tyrie said: ""If the many critics of the audit process are right, it is not just the companies which buy audits that lose out; it is the millions of people dependent on savings, pension funds and other investments in those companies whose audits may be defective."" Closer scrutiny of the audit sector has already prompted‎ Deloitte and KPMG to say that they will cease undertaking non-audit work for the FTSE-350 companies whose accounts they supervise. As the auditor to Carillion, KPMG is facing scrutiny for its oversight of the construction giant, which went bust in January with debts of more than £5bn. KPMG, whose chairman, Bill Michael, described the sector as ""an oligopoly"" earlier this year, earned roughly £1.5m annually as Carillion's auditor, with significant sums earned in addition from non-audit work. At the retailer BHS, PwC was found by the FRC to have failed to conduct sufficient oversight of its accounts at a time when it was earning significant sums from non-audit work. The FRC said recently that it was engaged in a separate piece of work that would decide ""whether further actions are needed to prevent auditor independence being compromised, including whether all consulting work for bodies they audit should be banned"". The big four have already braced themselves for substantial structural change, with executives preparing for formal ring-fencing between audit and non-audit services as a potential outcome from the CMA probe. The provisional findings of the reviews will come as Stephen Haddrill, the FRC's chief executive, prepares to step down next year. A CMA spokesperson said: ""Our investigation is ongoing. Any reporting ahead of the publication of our provisional findings is speculation."" The FRC and BEIS did not respond to requests for comment, while none of the big four firms contacted by Sky News would comment."
2018-12-11,"A policeman has been jailed for 25 years for a series of sexual offences against young girls, including the rape of a 13-year-old.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/policeman-jailed-for-raping-girl-13-in-his-car-and-filming-it-11579621,"Ian Naude, who was described in court as a ""very dangerous man indeed"", had attacked his rape victim three days after visiting her house to investigate a domestic incident. He picked her up when her mother was out and drove her down a country lane before raping her on the back seat of his car. The father of one, who filmed the offence on his mobile phone, denied raping his victim - telling the jury the sex was consensual and she ""seemed to be enjoying it"". The footage was played to the jury at his trial in November. The judge at Liverpool Crown Court described the police officer as a ""cold, uncaring and cruel paedophile"" who was willing to stoop as low as blackmail towards young, vulnerable teenage girls. Naude had managed to join the Cheshire Constabulary three months after he had been named as a suspect in a rape investigation by a neighbouring force. After being accused of raping the 13-year-old girl it was discovered that he was also under investigation for child sex offences by two forces - Staffordshire and West Mercia. During his trial it was revealed that he had been copied into an email outlining details of his forthcoming arrest. Naude was able to delete more than 750 images from his phone and conceal another mobile phone and a laptop in a field in Market Drayton. Cheshire Police described the email as ""an administrative error"". The former soldier had posed as a 15-year-old boy on social media in order to groom underage girls. He encouraged them to send sexually explicit photographs of themselves. In impact statements to court victims described how the offences had changed their lives. One said she felt she had let her family down. Others were said by their parents to have become withdrawn and some to have self-harmed. One mother said: ""I keep thinking I didn't keep my daughter safe enough. Sometimes I break down and cry. I feel I have lost trust in the police."" In a statement to the court, one father said: ""I want to wrap her in cotton wool and never let her out of my sight again. If you can't trust a police officer who can you trust?"" Parents in the public gallery at Liverpool Crown Court wept as sentencing was passed. The court heard that Naude had downloaded images of children being sexually abused by men. One of the victims was as young as 18 months old. Naude bowed his head throughout the hearing but showed no emotion as he was sentenced. The judge Clement Goldstone said: ""You joined the police not as you maintain to help society but in the hope thereby that you could be given access to young vulnerable girls. Girls who needed and were entitled to expect your protection. ""I am well persuaded that you did not have any inkling of the extent of your perversion or the psychological harm and damage that you have caused by your conduct. ""You crossed pretty well every boundary known to man and then some."" Detective Inspector Kate Tomlinson, senior investigating officer, said outside court that Naude is a ""sexual predator of the most evil kind"" who ""betrayed the very people he swore to protect"", acknowledging the ""incredible bravery"" the victims have shown."
2018-12-11,"A project to rebuild the EastEnders set is expected to go £27m over budget, raising concerns over whether licence fee payers' money is being spent wisely.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/whodunnit-mps-ask-why-new-eastenders-set-is-27m-over-budget-11579646,"The project was originally estimated to come in at £59m and was due to be completed by August this year, but is now set to be finished two-and-a-half years late at a cost of £86m. Overoptimism on costs, lack of expertise and construction delays have been blamed in a National Audit Office (NAO) report. It concluded that the BBC - funded mainly by the £150.50 annual licence fee - could not provide value on the wider project that aims to improve Elstree studios, where the soap is filmed. Meg Hillier MP, chairwoman of the committee of public accounts, said: ""It is critical, given the BBC's funding pressures, that every pound of licence fee payers' money is spent effectively. ""It is concerning that the BBC has been unable to keep to budget and time on this project again, given my committee had already heard about the need to revise its scope in 2016."" The famous EastEnders set will be rebuilt and extended using real brickwork rather than facades. It was only intended to be used for two years but has now been in action for 34, leading to health and safety problems and continued refurbishment. The decaying set also means the programme cannot be filmed in high definition. The project at Elstree was expected to save the BBC about £500,000 a year as part of the corporation's goal of slashing hundreds of millions of pounds in spending. The BBC said in a statement: ""The set of EastEnders was built in 1984 and only intended for use for two years. Over 30 years later, the show remains one of the BBC's flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose. ""The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London. ""It's a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre, but like any building work of this scale there have been challenges on the way, including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site. ""As the NAO recognises, we've already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny."""

Minister of the interior Christophe Castaner said the the 29-year-old was killed in the Neudorf-Meinau area of the city after a police operation was launched at around 9pm local time on Thursday. Three police officers had stumbled across a man they had believed was Chekatt and when they went to arrest him he turned to fire on them, Mr Castaner said. The officers had then shot and killed him. A French official was earlier quoted by the Associated Press as saying the suspect had been armed with a pistol and a knife. Earlier, witnesses reported ""at least three"" gunshots were heard in the district and a police helicopter was seen hovering overhead. The area had been cordoned off by police earlier in the day by members of France's elite RAID force as part of a search by more than 700 police officers. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Asked if police had been told to capture the killer dead or alive, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux earlier told France's CNews: ""It doesn't matter. The best thing would be to find him as quickly as possible."" Chekatt had 27 convictions in France, Germany and Switzerland, and is believed to have been radicalised while in jail. He was also one of 25,000 people on the ""S file"" security risk - reserved for people suspected of extremism - and had been monitored since 2015. Five people have already been arrested as part of the manhunt, including Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers. The latest person was described as a member of his ""entourage"". Three people were killed in the market attack, including a Thai tourist named by the embassy in Paris as Anupong Suebsamarn, 45. The other victims were not named but French media said one is a 52-year-old Strasbourg man who was killed while leaving a restaurant. Prosecutor Remy Heitz confirmed on Wednesday that one victim had been left brain dead. Three of the injured have left hospital and three others are fighting for their lives, French media said on Thursday night. A Strasbourg mosque posted on Facebook earlier to say one of its members was in a coma after being hit in the head. Grande Mosquee Eyyub Sultan de Strasbourg named the man as ""Brother Kamal"", who worked as a mechanic. Italian radio journalist Antonio Megalizzi, 28, was also reported to be among those in critical condition after taking a bullet to the head. Chekatt had yelled ""Allahu Akbar"" before opening fire at the Christmas market and police are treating it as a terrorist incident. Chekatt was shot in the arm during a gunfight with police but managed to escape in a taxi, boasting of the attack to the driver, who was forced to drop him in another part of the city. During an operation to try to arrest Chekatt on Tuesday morning, hours before the attack, officers found a grenade, rifle and four knives."

Health experts say a main meal should contain no more than 600 calories but the study found the average dish served in chain restaurants contained 1,033 calories. Meanwhile, meals served by fast food outlets such as McDonald's, Wimpy and Burger King contained an average of 751 calories. KFC was the worst takeaway offender, serving an average of 987 calories a meal. The most calorie-packed dishes were served by Hungry Horse, which averaged 1,358 calories, and Stone House, which averaged 1,275 calories. Harvester clocked up 1,166 calories, JD Wetherspoon 1,119 and Nandos 1,019. Researchers looked at more than 13,500 meals on the menus of 21 sit-down restaurants and six fast food chains. Using online company information on the number of calories, only one in 10 meals was classed as healthy - with a calorie count below the 600 recommended by Public Health England. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Author Dr Eric Robinson, lead researcher from the University of Liverpool, said the results were ""shocking"" but probably underestimated the calories consumed in restaurants because the research did not include drinks, starters or desserts. He explained: ""We don't know about energy intake but 'plate clearing' is a common behaviour. ""Our analysis did not include drinks, starters, desserts or side orders."" The government is currently looking at proposals to introduce mandatory labelling in restaurants, takeaways and cafes. It comes as the number of morbidly obese people in England, Scotland and Wales is set to double over the next 20 years, according to a study in the summer. Morbid obesity - the most extreme form of obesity - is understood to be linked to heightened risk of chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, mental illness and some cancers."
2018-12-11,Virgin Galactic has successfully launched a tourism rocket ship into space for the first time - with Sir Richard Branson hoping  a commercial flight will take place by March 2019.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/virgin-galactic-successfully-launches-tourism-rocket-ship-into-space-for-first-time-11580034,"The Virgin Space Ship (VSS) Unity took off from the Mojave test centre in California and climbed 51 miles (82km) before beginning its descent early on Thursday. The company considers the altitude to be the boundary of space, which contradicts a long-held view that it is reached at 62 miles (100km). Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides noted that recent research favours the lower altitude. And just after the successful return to Earth, Richard Branson told Sky News: ""After 14 hard years, to have taken Virgin Galactic into space has been a momentous, historic occasion."" VSS Unity was released from carrier aircraft WhiteKnightTwo, which ignited its rocket engine and released the plane at an altitude of around eight miles. Two test pilots Mark ""Forger"" Stucky and former NASA astronaut Rick ""CJ"" Sturckow then hurtled the craft upward and out of sight. The rocket plane re-entered the atmosphere at 2.5 times the speed of sound and landed a few minutes later. Virgin's billionaire founder Sir Richard cried, high-fived and hugged spectators, as hundreds of the firm's employees and family members watched the launch. One of the pilots handed Sir Richard a small Earth stress ball when the two hugged after the space ship landed safely following about an hour's journey. He said: ""The now-astronauts, who were pilots before, had this incredible experience, being in space... and had the ride of a lifetime."" The billionaire said he aimed for a commercial space flight with passengers, including himself, as early as March next year. He said: ""Today we have shown Virgin Galactic can open space to the world."" Sir Richard added: ""Space is Virgin territory!"" And he later told Sky News that while he is ""wary about making predictions"" he hopes to go into space himself in the coming months and then, ""the moment we can say every box is ticked"" and the journey is safe, the flight will be open to the paying public. Mission official Enrico Palermo said: ""We made it to space!"" Have you signed our petition? Sir Richard is battling other billionaire-backed ventures to offer space flights to tourists, including one from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. The VSS Unity is a SpaceShipTwo air-launched rocket plane that has been designed specifically for commercial use. The successful flight is significant progress toward the start of commercial flights that Virgin Galactic promised more than a decade ago. Virgin Galactic's first experimental spacecraft broke apart during a 2014 test flight and killed the co-pilot. More than 600 people have committed up to $250,000 (roughly £198,000) for rides that include several minutes of weightlessness and a view of the Earth far below."

The decision by Conservative whips to restore Mr Griffiths to the party, as well as two other suspended MPs, was condemned by opposition MPs as a ""betrayal of women"". The row continued on Thursday, when Labour's Jess Phillips asked whether ""political power or tackling victims of sexual harassment and abuse"" mattered more to senior Tories. She also used business questions in the House of Commons to share what she said were some of the 2,000 messages Mr Griffiths sent to two women over a 21 day period. Mrs Phillips said: ""She's so cute. So sweet. I can't wait to beat her,"" adding: ""Can she take a beating?"" She continued: ""Those are not my words, but the words of Andrew Griffiths while barraging two of his female constituents with thousands of sexual text messages."" Mrs Phillips claimed both Mr Griffiths and fellow MP Charlie Elphicke, who has seen ""serious allegations"" referred to police, had the Tory whip restored ""without any due process"". Directing her questions at Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, Mrs Phillips asked: ""What message does this send about how any process in this place can ever be trusted? ""I ask the leader of the house to answer that question and also to tell me what matters more - political power or tackling victims of sexual harassment and abuse?"" Ms Leadsom has led efforts to respond to a bullying and harassment scandal that has engulfed Westminster in recent months. She used her reply to reveal she was not consulted on the decision to restore the Tory whip to three suspended MPs on Wednesday. ""I am absolutely committed to changing the culture of this place and to seeing that everybody here is treated with dignity and respect,"" she said. ""There has been a process that has been undertaken. It has been a decision by the chief whip. It is not something I have been privy to. ""But I absolutely assure all members that the independent complaints procedure, which is not involved with any party political processes whatever, was established and designed to enable everybody who works in or visits this place to take any complaints that they have to an independent place for proper investigation and proper sanction to be applied."" Speaking to Sky News later on Thursday, Mrs Phillips said: ""I'm not surprised, I'm grossly disappointed that Theresa May who - when the whole Westminster sexual harassment scandal started - promised that she would make sure that it came out of being about party politics, about power and patronage. ""And, as soon as she needed power and patronage, she undid that. So she lied to all of those women who came forward."" Have you signed our petition? Last month, Mr Griffiths was informed he would be facing no further action as a result of a Conservative Party investigation due to the state of his mental health, although - at that stage - the Tory whip remained withdrawn from him. The Burton MP had previously revealed how he was on the ""verge of suicide"" following the emergence of his text messages, prompting him to spend a month in hospital. He described how decades of mental health battles - following his being abused as a child - led to his ""breakdown"". Sky News has contacted Mr Griffiths' office following Mrs Phillips' comments. On Wednesday, Mr Elphicke tweeted: ""Important for my constituents to know that, 13 months after having it withdrawn, I have been given back the Conservative whip. ""I remain as confident as I always have been of clearing my name and will continue to work as hard for Dover & Deal as I always have done."" A spokesman for the Conservative Party said: ""They were elected as Conservatives. ""The restoration of the whip had been under consideration for some time, and the chief whip decided that in the circumstances of a leadership confidence ballot, it was right they have the whip restored to be able to vote in that."""
2018-12-11,"Drugs runners are operating 2,000 ""county lines"" routes from big cities into smaller towns and the countryside, according to new figures obtained by Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/line-18-3-million-per-day-county-lines-drugs-business-fuelling-knife-crime-11566109,"We can also reveal that the business is worth over £3 million a day. Sky News has obtained exclusive access to people involved in this ruthless trade, from wholesalers to drugs mules. Our investigation demonstrates how this brutal business is contributing to the rise in knife crime across the UK. We started out in a ""trap house"" in north London. This is where drugs are prepared, sold and taken. Criminals exploit children as young as 12 to transport drugs between counties across the UK Here, a drug wholesaler brandishing a Rambo knife boasted that the weapon was ""just something I give to the kids who go out for me"". With money and drugs strewn across the table, his colleague explained: ""There's always problems with other dealers - so you've got to sort out your problem. ""You give the kids a weapon. They go up there and they do it. Once you've sorted out one or two problems, they tend not to come to you."" As we interviewed them, the two dealers sold crack cocaine to a 42-year-old addict - Mark Page. He said he spent all the money he had on drugs. ""Once I start I can't stop,"" he told us. Then one of the dealers gave a detailed account of how gangs within the capital are seeking out more rural markets. He said: ""Most of our business is outside of London. Me and my buddy go somewhere and find a crackhead. I'll give them some rock (crack cocaine) for their numbers, their friends. ""Once an area is established, I'll get the kids to go out there for me."" The children are paid £300 or £400 a week and age between 12 and 16. ""The younger the better,"" said one dealer, adding: ""They need money, mummy and daddy ain't got no money. So they come to uncle."" He offers an induction week for his new recruits, which he called ""boot camp"". The county line itself is a phone line, controlled by the dealer, which is sometimes given to the runner who the addicts can contact for a delivery. The wholesaler in north London said he operates ""like a pharmacy where you can get anything"". But he had a chilling warning for anyone trying to break in to his market area. He said: ""It doesn't matter who you are. If you come and step on my toes and violate our business, you're going to get shot, stabbed in the face. ""If you're a little boy or a grown man. Anyone can get it. You step on my toes you're f**ked."" This is a classic county lines operation, which police say has now become a problem in every single police force in the country and has exploded in the last five years. Sources have told Sky News that the police are expected to announce that the number of known county lines have increased by a third to 2,000. It is estimated each line can make thousands of pounds daily, creating a combined industry of £3 million a day. Some 58 vulnerable people who had been caught up in the gangs, including children, were rescued during the week-long operation Sky News can reveal that in a two-week operation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and UK police forces, more than 500 suspects have been arrested, 78 weapons seized, and 95 drug lines destroyed. More than 250 people involved in the running of drugs for the gangs have been safeguarded, including children. The violent nature of those at the centre of these operations, and the extent to which they are expanding, is at least part of the explanation for the worrying increase in knife crime across the UK. Vince O'Brien, head of drugs operations at the NCA, told Sky News: ""Clearly high levels of violence are a concern. When people get drawn into criminal gangs, then the way in which those gangs resolve the disputes between them is with violence and that's certainly part of the problem. ""One of the issues with the serious violence is violent competition between drugs gangs and stabbings, acid attacks and shootings can be part of that competition as they look to take over the market and that can be a real concern."" Zakaria Mohammed admitted running a drugs supply chain and trafficking two boys and a girl to deal on his behalf in Lincoln The former drugs lead at the NCA, Tony Saggers, has become the leading expert in this area and now advises local police forces. He said: ""County lines has become the expansion of London, in terms of the violence and knife crime and the young people involved. If you deal drugs somewhere else you cause agitation and potential violence. ""Because you are expanding a workforce and the geography of your operation - you need more people involved. You can no longer run around a London borough with six people involved if you are covering six counties and a dozen towns. ""That's where the children come in."" These wider markets are further from the reach of the metropolitan dealers who are controlling them and this brings greater levels of violence in order to maintain that control. Sky News spoke to a teenager who has been running a county line ever since being taken into care at the age of 14. The girl - known as Sarah - said she sold class A drugs such as heroin and crack and that the dealers are getting more violent and using ""guns, knives and acid"" to keep a grip on their business. On one occasion, Sarah was punished with a stabbing because her shipment was stolen from her. Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield told Sky News she was probably set up to make her feel indebted to the gang. She said this was becoming a common tactic. ""The kids who are the collateral, these aren't huge 17-year-olds with great physical presence and imposing characters, these are often small, vulnerable children who look quite meek, don't have much confidence,"" she said. ""But they are being exploited, frightened, and groomed, and also huge levels of physical violence held over them to do what they do. Most kids involved are scared stiff."" Sky News travelled with a 47-year-old woman who was a drug mule to Southend. She said she was frightened to go to the police or stop doing what she was doing, but hated being part of the drug dealing network. Upon arrival in the seaside town, Sky News spoke to several young people who said they have been approached by dealers from London asking them to get involved. They said the town had changed for the worse as a result and no longer felt safe. Kofi, 17, admitted he sometimes carried a knife. ""The town centre is such a dangerous place - I don't feel safe,"" he said. ""In a place like this, without a weapon you don't feel safe. There have been times when I've felt like I've had to."" The NCA's Vince O'Brien told Sky News county lines had been a real challenge to cope with. He said: ""The response to county lines is a complicated one.

2018-12-11,Gambling companies have agreed to what is effectively a ban on betting advertisements during live sport. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/gambling-companies-agree-to-ban-on-betting-ads-on-tv-during-live-sport-11579737,"The Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) has now confirmed the ""whistle to whistle"" ban, which will begin in 2019. It has been decided no betting adverts will now be shown during live sport coverage before 9pm in the UK. The new rules will apply from five minutes before the event begins until five minutes after it finishes and are expected to begin around July next year. John Hagan, chair of IGRG, said: ""We believe that this is itself a watershed moment as we strive to provide the ever, safer gambling environment which gambling consumers and the wider public expect. ""Today the gambling industry is responding positively to public concerns about the amount of gambling advertising on television before the watershed."" The number of children with a gambling problem has quadrupled in two years, the Gambling Commission says The ban will not apply to horse racing and greyhound racing because of the commercial importance of the betting industry to their viability. The gambling industry was under pressure to curb the amount of advertising in live sport as the number of problem gamblers continues to rise. A Gambling Commission report released last month indicated that 55,000 children aged 11 to 16 could be officially categorised as problem gamblers and there were fears TV advertising was fuelling the increase. Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, said the ban is a ""welcome move"". He added: ""I am pleased that the sector is stepping up and responding to public concerns. Have you signed our petition? ""It is vital children and vulnerable people are protected from the threat of gambling-related harm. Companies must be socially responsible."" The changes could lead to a sustained push to limit betting advertisements in other areas of sport including on shirts and billboards. Currently 60% of Premier League and Championship football clubs have betting companies as shirt sponsors."
2018-12-11,"Like a zombie, Theresa May staggers on. Whatever is thrown at her, nothing can bring her down.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-zombie-prime-minister-staggers-on-towards-her-eventual-downfall-11579018,"But neither can she regain her strength. As she stumbles towards her eventual destruction, is she taking the country with her? She has overcome and survived the latest challenge but the prime minister immediately now faces an even bigger one. Had she lost the vote of confidence she would have arrived at the EU summit, politically speaking, as the equivalent of the walking dead. She has been spared that ordeal but may still be buried by events. Mrs May has seen off the confidence vote but must now achieve the seemingly impossible - she must secure concessions from EU leaders to change the withdrawal agreement. Without them, the deal she has negotiated with the EU is dead on arrival whenever it is put before the Commons. Worse than that, without those concessions the DUP says it will end their support for the prime minister. The confidence and supply agreement has kept her in power since the election. If that happens she will have kept her grip on her party only to lose control of the Commons and government. And the brutal truth is, barring a miracle, those concessions will not be forthcoming. Yes, EU officials are past masters at reframing agreements to sweeten the pill for voters back home, finessing deals to get them past sceptics. But no, they are not going to renegotiate this agreement. The Irish backstop - as it is known - is a vital insurance policy, says the EU. Without it - Ireland, the Irish border and the Good Friday Agreement are in peril. British critics say it consigns the UK to the customs union and a state of vassalage in perpetuity. Mrs May has tried to bridge that chasm by asking for assurances its use will only be temporary. But as one diplomat put it to me, what use is an insurance policy if you can just wait till it expires. She and her diplomats have tried every which way to square that circle and have failed. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Her strategy now may well be simply to run out the clock. Secure in the leadership of her party, at least, she may wait until the 11th hour before putting the agreement to the vote in parliament hoping the stakes will then be so high, MPs will hold their noses and support it. Or they may not. Divisions in the Conservative Party, already on the verge of civil war have been exacerbated by the last 24 hours. Brexiteers are furious they have been branded extremists by Chancellor Philip Hammond. Their opposition to the withdrawal agreement has now become adamantine. The zombie prime minister emerges from the Westminster furnace now to be tested again in Brussels. Can she survive her next ordeal?"
2018-12-11,Two suspected migrants are in a critical condition after their boat got into difficulty trying to cross the Channel.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/two-migrants-in-critical-condition-after-rescue-11579929,"The boat was discovered by the French navy in the early hours of Thursday. It was around six miles north of Cap Gris-Nez, the part of France that is closest to England. The two migrants were airlifted from the boat with severe hypothermia and taken to hospital in Boulogne, the French coastguard said. Eight others were taken to Calais and their boat was towed back by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. A fisherman working in the Channel told Sky News that the boat had been stolen. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The coastguard said the vessel and those on board had been in a ""perilous situation"". They added that those planning to cross the Channel by sea should be aware it is ""one of the busiest areas in the world and, therefore, dangerous for human life""."
2018-12-11,The result of this secret ballot may well sway the course of history. By backing Theresa May her MPs are probably defining Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181213222001/https://news.sky.com/story/victory-for-survivor-may-but-her-resilience-may-not-be-enough-in-brexit-battle-11579072,"The prime minister has by no means achieved clear waters to a Brexit deal - but had she lost this vote, it was likely the Conservative Party would have taken a very different course that could have either drastically reshaped the withdrawal deal, or left us with no deal. Instead, this failed coup by the Brexit wing of the party has weakened their position. With the prospect of a leadership challenge deferred for another year, Mrs May has more freedom. She could, for example, threaten her rebels that without their backing she would have to lean towards a softer Brexit- something that could gain support from opposition MPs. She could also threaten them with a ""people's vote"". Ultimately, this result means she's more likely to get her deal through parliament. But she's still got a mountain to climb. Some MPs have already insisted that this doesn't mean they will fall into line. Andrea Jenkyns, Tory MP for Morley Outwood, told Sky News: ""I'm a democrat so I'll respect the decision but if Theresa May brings the same deal back to parliament I will still vote it down. ""She needs to go back to the drawing board. She's never ever put our country first in these negotiations."" The no confidence vote itself has once again exposed the division within the Conservative Party over the EU, but a leadership contest would have amplified it. It's argued a stronger leader might have emerged, but it is hard to see how that person could have avoided revoking or trying to extend Article 50 in order to have time to pull together a new cabinet, a new negotiating team and new strategy towards dealing with the EU. The prime minister has been given a lifeline by prominent Brexit supporters such as Michael Gove. The man she once told to go away and learn about loyalty is now the most significant advocate of her withdrawal deal. Earlier outside parliament, Mr Gove was confronted by a Remain campaigner dressed as Father Christmas who told him: ""You're not getting any presents this year."" Wrong - he's bound to get one from the prime minister. But his mission, along with the rest of the government, is to convince Conservative MPs, and the crucial 10 DUP members of parliament, that the withdrawal agreement is the best and only way forward. To do this Mrs May now needs some Christmas cheer from the European Union. On Thursday, she heads to Brussels for the European Council summit and she needs concessions on the controversial backstop. Even this might not be enough. Many of her MPs are demanding that the divorce bill is linked to EU cooperation on a future free trade arrangement. The prime minister has promised parliament will get a vote before 21 January 2019. But she could still lose and Labour might still challenge the government with a vote of no confidence to try to force a general election. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? With this in mind, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told Sky News: ""I hope my colleagues will take a careful look at who's leading us, what the choices are and what the alternative is if they don't support it. ""I mean, quite frankly, it would be ironic if it was the Brexiteers that stopped us leaving the European Union."" Many feel the prime minister's festive mission is still hanging by a thread. Remain-supporting Tory MP Anna Soubry said: ""She needs to change course. She needs to bring the vote back before we rise for Christmas, and when it fails as it will fail, she needs to do the only thing she can do to get out of this unholy mess - and that's to take it back to the British people and have a people's vote."" The 650 MPs will still decide the outcome. Nothing from the last 24 hours has transformed the deal that would have been rejected this week if MPs had been allowed to vote. While Mrs May has once again shown that she's a survivor, resilience might not be enough to achieve a deal by the deadline of 29 March."

The Met Office said the worst of the storm's impact had passed overnight, with milder conditions expected on Sunday. But police forces across the country were left dealing with numerous reports of collisions triggered by the conditions. Multiple crashes were reported between junctions 15 and 17 of the M74 in southern Scotland. Police in Dumfries tweeted: ""Road described as very icy with multiple vehicles crashed. It appears the freezing rain may have arrived on the motorway."" Traffic Scotland warned drivers of heavy snow causing delays on the A9 between Perth and Aviemore. The A84 was said to be ""impassable"" in both directions north of Callander due to heavy snowfall. Between 40 to 50cm of snow fell in the central highlands, the Met Office said. It warned that melting snow and incoming rain due on Monday could create a risk of ""localised flooding"". :: UK weather - The latest Sky News forecast Thanks to Leeds Bradford @LBIAirport for this photo of the freezing rain that has formed an icy glaze over parts of the airport #icy #StormDeirdre pic.twitter.com/irZGy48a5K Snow falling on A93 at Glenshee.

Storm Deirdre's arrival was also a blow to retailers on what should been a major pre-Christmas shopping day. Saturday footfall across UK high streets was down by 9.1% by 3pm, retail intelligence firm Springboard reported. Simon Partridge, a meterologist at the Met Office, said on Saturday evening: ""The majority of the rain and the snow has cleared into the North Sea. ""We've had a number of roads that have been closed due to ice and blocked by vehicles that have slid out of control."" He added: ""It doesn't seem that anything too bad has occurred from what we are aware of, hopefully the message got through to the right people at the right time."" He said the weather warnings had been reduced across the country, with only one amber warning of snow in central Scotland still in place. Mr Partridge said wind speeds reached more than 70mph off the Welsh coast. He said skies would start to clear on Sunday, but cold temperatures meant ice patches would remain. People could expect ""milder conditions"" with lighter winds and ""temperatures returning closer to normal for the time of year"". More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The cold weather is being triggered by an active low-pressure system moving in from the Atlantic.

Both are undergoing changes to create a route that means drivers will no longer have to stop to pay, just as thousands of people prepare to travel home for the festive period. Hannah Milliner, general manager for the bridges at Highways England, said: ""Work is needed to make sure that drivers can safely travel across the bridges without stopping to pay a toll, or waiting for a barrier to be raised. ""The weekend we have chosen avoids peak period traffic and also means that the work will be complete so that drivers can make journeys free of charge over the festive period. ""We would like to thank drivers in advance for their patience while we carry out this work and to ask them to plan ahead for any journeys they are considering."" The Prince of Wales Bridge will reopen on Monday with three flowing lanes, although they will be narrowed with a reduced speed limit of 50mph for safety reasons. On Wednesday, the Severn Bridge will reopen with two free flowing lanes, again narrowed with a 50mph limit. Highways England plans to carry out further work on the bridges in 2019 to return both routes to a three lane motorway with the usual 70mph speed limit. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Monday will be the first day since 1966 that a fee has not been required to journey over the original Severn Crossing, while the Prince of Wales Bridge has also required a toll since it opened in 1996.

Prime Minister Theresa May and the Queen had agreed on the title to recognise Charles' 70th birthday year and 60 years since he became the Prince of Wales. An estimated 25 million car journeys are made across the River Severn between England and Wales every year using the two bridges, costing motorists in cars and minibuses £5.60. Drivers in vans up to 3.5 tonnes, double-cab pick-ups and small buses with up to 17 seats are charged £11.20, while goods vehicles, lorries over 3.5 tonnes and buses with more than 17 seats pay £16.70."

2018-12-15,"Theresa May, fresh from surviving a Tory confidence vote, has returned from Brussels to fervent chatter of a potential second referendum on Brexit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/how-could-a-second-brexit-referendum-happen-11581494,"We take a look at whether a second vote could happen and how. Leavers and Remainers have stepped up talk of a potential second Brexit referendum :: What do the bookies think? The Oddschecker website shows the odds on a second referendum are shortening among major bookmakers. The odds are now close, with Skybet putting it at 4/6 that there won't be another vote and 5/4 that there will be. :: What would a second vote look like? Campaigners, led by Labour's Chuka Umunna but with support from MPs across parliament, have been calling for a ""people's vote"". This vote would, broadly, ask the general public if they want to accept or reject the final Brexit deal, in favour of either remaining or proceeding with a ""no-deal"" scenario. :: ""No-deal"", backstop, Article 50?: Brexit jargon explained Civil servants have reportedly explored options of a second referendum, separate from the suggestions put forward by the official People's Vote campaign. :: What is the prime minister's position? Mrs May has repeatedly said she will not entertain the idea of a second vote, saying to do so would be a ""betrayal"" of the British public's vote back in June 2016. But despite winning a confidence vote earlier this week, Mrs May's standing is not robust. With just over a third of her own MPs signalling they have lost confidence in her, Mrs May has publicly conceded that she will not stand as leader at the next general election. :: Is there enough support in the Commons? Since the beginning of the Brexit process, the majority of MPs have been at odds with the Brexit-voting public. After the vote, many MPs said they would support the will of the people and, against their own Remainer beliefs, would work towards a deal to see the UK leave the EU. But an increasing number say that while the public voted to leave the EU, they didn't vote to do so at ""any cost"". They say the deal secured by Mrs May would not have been wholly palatable to Leave voters in 2016. It has been widely reported that there is a Commons majority for a second referendum or a people's vote, but the Commons' position on the deal will only be officially known when the parliamentary vote is held. This looks set to take place in January, after Mrs May decided to delay the vote earlier this month when it became obvious it would lose. The former PM says both the EU and the UK would benefit from extending Article 50 to allow for another vote on Brexit :: If the PM doesn't want it, how could the vote happen? Mrs May has a small majority in parliament thanks to support from the DUP. If rebel Tories and the DUP (who made a deal to support the Conservatives) team up with other parties in the Commons, her majority could be lost and her power would be limited. This means, for example, an amendment could be made to the parliamentary vote to require a public vote on the deal. :: What about among the general public? More than half of Britons are now against Brexit and support a second EU referendum, a Sky Data poll found in mid-November. Just one in seven Britons think the draft Brexit deal proposed by Theresa May is better than either a no-deal Brexit or remaining in the EU. A YouGov poll, around the same time, found 42% Britons oppose Mrs May's deal, 39% said they didn't know and only 19% said they were in favour. :: Even if a second vote is called, haven't we triggered Article 50? In theory, when Mrs May triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017, she started the countdown for Britain to leave the EU after two years. It had been thought this was irreversible, but the EU’s top court has ruled the UK can revoke Article 50 and halt Brexit without the permission of other member states. :: How would a vote impact the current Article 50 timeline? Most likely, the timeline would be paused or extended to allow for a vote. Brussels has signalled an extension would likely be accepted. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? :: What would the question on the ballot look like? It depends. Options put forward by the People's Vote outline a number of different formats. A simple Yes/No option would be to ask whether the public wants to accept or reject the deal. If a rejection is voted for, it would be entirely up to the government to decide next steps. More complex ballot papers could offer different scenarios, for example: :: Deal or Remain? :: Deal or no-deal? :: No-deal or Remain? Or it could be tiered, and ask: :: Accept or reject the deal? If rejected, Remain or no-deal? :: Leave or Remain? If Leave, deal or no-deal? A second referendum not affiliated with the People's Vote could look similar, or could simply ask whether Article 50 should be revoked. If this was voted for, in theory the last two years of work would be dropped and the UK would return to its pre-Brexit days. It is unlikely that any ballot would propose options that are not currently on the table with the EU, such as a different deal proposal. :: Who will decide the wording? Parliament. The Electoral Commission, by law, can give advice and test the potential question but is not the ultimate authority on the matter. :: Who would be able to vote? A debate around allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote this time has been rumbling on in the background. It would be up to parliament."
2018-12-15,"Latvia has raised concerns with Britain over what one diplomat described as ""hardcore propaganda"" against the UK and its allies aired by two Russian-language television channels that are registered in London.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-using-hardcore-propaganda-against-uk-warns-top-diplomat-11582753,"A letter seen by Sky News from the Latvian foreign ministry to Sir Alan Duncan, a foreign office minister, alleges ""malicious"" reporting by NTV Mir and Ren TV - which broadcast into the Baltic states - in their coverage of the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, is investigating NTV Mir Baltic over a news programme transmitted on 2 and 3 April, almost exactly a month after the attempted assassination of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. It is understood that the Latvian side had expected the inquiry to have been concluded by the end of October, but Ofcom has yet to publish its findings. Baiba Braze, the Latvian ambassador to the UK, said what she regards as disinformation put out by the channels makes the Kremlin-funded broadcaster RT look mild. ""For us Russia Today seems just like little flowers. It is not so bad,"" she said in an interview, using RT's former name. ""These TV channels, these Russian language TV channels that are broadcast into our country they are really hard-core propaganda. It is not the soft western type of Russia Today. That is why Britain should care."" NTV Mir and Ren TV are able to transmit programmes from Russia within the European Union thanks to Ofcom licences held by Baltic Media Alliance Ltd, a company registered to an address in central London. Margus Merima, chief executive officer of Baltic Media Alliance Ltd, rejected the ambassador's allegations. He said the company is a commercial entity with no ties to the Russian state and the main focus of the two TV channels is entertainment and culture. ""We respectfully disagree with Ms Braze,"" Mr Merima said in an emailed response to questions. ""Although we are pleased Ms Braze is our loyal viewer it is not our aim to please Ms Braze or anyone else in [the] Latvian establishment. Freedom of speech includes right to different opinions, not only those of Ms Braze."" The letter sent to Sir Duncan, dated 21 May, from Zanda Kalnina-Lukasevica, parliamentary secretary at Latvia's ministry of foreign affairs, included a list of examples of Russian television programmes that contain alleged Russian disinformation. On the list was a show from the Russian broadcaster NTV, which appeared to dismiss British claims that Russia was behind the Salisbury poisoning. It was also aired on NTV Mir Baltic in Latvia, according to Latvian sources. The letter was written to raise concerns about the channels ahead of Latvia's general election in October. Separately, the East StratCom Task Force, a European Union unit that exposes anti-Western disinformation in the media, has flagged up content by NTV including a piece from September alleging Russia-phobia and the presence of Nazis in the Baltic states. Russians were urged to stop visiting a seaside resort called Palanga in Lithuania and another seaside resort in Latvia. NTV Mir Baltic has fallen foul of Ofcom's rules on due accuracy and due impartiality in the past. It was found in breach for a November 2016 news item about parades in Latvia to commemorate a 1919 victory by Latvian freedom fighters over Russian and German forces. Ms Braze said the regulator was more aware about the dangers posed to Western democracies by Russian disinformation - designed to exploit divisions in a country as part of an unconventional form of warfare - and is improving its ability to respond. But the ambassador said she feels more could be done. ""We bear the consequences which is not really a fair proportion or situation, is it?"" she said, explaining that Latvia's broadcasting regulator has no power over channels licensed outside the country even if their content can be viewed inside. She also said this left a weak spot in the UK's response to Russian hostility. For example, efforts to expose subversive attacks by the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency accused of carrying out the Salisbury poisoning, could be undermined by pro-Kremlin broadcasters rubbishing the UK government's actions. Ms Braze said she would like Ofcom investigations to be completed faster and for there to be greater penalties for broadcasters found in breach. She also suggested the regulator adopts a more pro-active approach, by monitoring the Russian language content of the stations it licences as well as responding to complaints. An Ofcom spokesman said the regulator does launch investigations based on its own concerns. He also defended the length of time it was taking to investigate the NTV Mir Baltic broadcasts on Salisbury because of the complexity of the cases and the need for fairness. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The spokesman said: ""We work closely with authorities in Latvia, and other EU countries, to share information on content that may raise concerns. ""We recently held a constructive meeting with the Latvian Ambassador, and we are aware of her concerns about NTV Mir and REN TV. ""All Ofcom licensed channels must comply with our broadcasting rules, which include strict requirements around due accuracy and due impartiality. If a broadcaster breaks our rules, we take robust action."""
2018-12-15,"Dr Nick Jenkins, medical director at West Suffolk Hospital, says he tries to plan for ""all eventualities"" when predicting demand for beds during the peak winter months.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/flu-epidemic-would-have-significant-consequences-for-nhs-this-winter-11580595,"But here he explains why despite best efforts to predict patient numbers, there is still ""nervousness"" about the prospect of something like a flu epidemic - which he says would be a serious challenge. Hospitals are brilliant places to be if you are sick, but they are dangerous places to be if you don't need to be there. It is easier in hospital to become confused and disorientated and easier to catch something, but it is often easier to get better more quickly in your home, unless you need hospital-level treatment. That's why we work really hard to support patients to get back home - but for that to work everything has to be in place to flow patients from ambulance to A&E to a bed. People think emergency work is unpredictable, but actually it isn't. We have predictors based on data we have collected and built and I could tell you fairly accurately how many people will come in tomorrow, and how many of those will likely need to stay overnight with us. What I can't tell you is precisely which of our teams they will need to be looked after by. All those predictable elements allow us to work out how many beds and how many staff we will need. We know we need more staff and beds in winter. We have an escalation ward which is closed in summer and has been reopened for winter. We also plan for surge capacity for when we are really busy. At our hospital we have opened a new acute assessment unit, giving us somewhere separate to assess emergency patients that need observation, diagnosis and treatment but that don't need major emergency department care. Wherever possible we treat them the same day so they can return home, or if they need ongoing care in hospital we transfer them to the right specialist care for their needs. However much planning and preparation we do for winter there has to be a nervousness around what we do if things are worse than we predict. We have tried to plan for all eventualities but say there's a flu epidemic in the UK, we know that would have significant consequences and be difficult for the NHS to manage. That's why flu vaccination is so important for staff and vulnerable patients. Have you signed our petition? An epidemic would increase the number of patients but would also decrease the number of staff, both because some would get ill and because some would have to stay off work to look after ill family members. Our bed modelling suggests we should be able to gain some breathing space sometime in March. It does vary from year to year, and there have been some days in summer that feel like the winter pressure we are used to. Although demand for our services is continuously high, we hope at least to be able to get our escalation ward closed in time for summer."
2018-12-15,There was plenty of distracting detail in this summit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/the-eu-has-a-simple-message-on-the-brexit-deal-like-it-or-lump-it-11581044,"A spat about the word ""nebulous"" and a tense Juncker-May encounter played out for the cameras. But in terms of substance? This summit added up to one simple message from the EU: The deal is the deal. It is what it is. Like it or lump it and accept the consequences. May came here hoping to be thrown a bone - some diplomatic slack she could take home with her to persuade MPs to drag her deal across the line. There was, according to some reports, a draft conclusion agreed between the EU and the UK giving the PM some politically comforting words. They would have included a promise to carry on working towards assurances on the agreement. And there would be an acknowledgement that no one believes the use of the Irish border backstop is a ""desirable outcome"". But those lines, innocuous as they were, were ripped out, according to some reports because the Dutch, French and Belgians feared they would only encourage the Brexiteers to ask for more. Others claim the final conclusions were hardened because the prime minister did an appalling job persuading European leaders she had a plan to get them all out of the unholy mess they are all now in. But whatever the details, the outcome of this summit remains the same. The withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated. Work will go on towards seeking assurances about the backstop, but it will be cosmetic. By day's end there were warm words from Mr Juncker and the President of the European Council Donald Tusk. At the closing press conference they paid tribute to the prime minister's courage and said they remained at her disposal. But they were sugaring the pill. Mrs May goes home with nothing substantial to show for her mad dash around Europe. At some point soon probably next month, she may have to say: ""I have run out of options, here is the deal, hold your noses and vote for it, or risk losing everything."" That jeopardy will not be the same for everyone. For Brexiteers the risk will be events moving towards a second referendum and Brexit never happening. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The rest will fear the clock running out and a ""no-deal"" Brexit happening by default. EU leaders have used this summit deliberately to raise those stakes. One source told The Times: ""We want all parties and factions in the British parliament to feel the bleak mid-winter."" In other words, Brussels is deliberately blowing a chill wind through Westminster hoping it will concentrate the minds of MPs and get them behind the deal or else. Plenty for our politicians to mull over this Christmas. Enough to get enough of them behind the deal? Probably not. So the same question will continue to haunt us all through to the New Year: What then?"
2018-12-15,"Tony Blair and Theresa May have been embroiled in a public row after she accused him of ""undermining"" the EU divorce talks by calling for a second Brexit referendum.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/where-do-former-prime-ministers-and-ex-party-leaders-stand-on-brexit-11582938,"Here, Sky News looks at the views of former prime ministers and ex-party leaders on Britain leaving the European Union. :: David Cameron Mrs May's predecessor triggered the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU and campaigned for Remain, before leaving politics shortly after the historic vote came back for Leave. Speaking to Sky News earlier this month, he said he did not regret calling the referendum but added: ""Obviously I'm very concerned about what's happening today but I do support the prime minister in her efforts to try and have a close partnership with the European Union."" :: Gordon Brown The most recent Labour politician in Number 10, Mr Brown said Brexit had left the country divided and led to a breakdown of trust within the electorate. He has also said the sense of betrayal felt by some of the public risks creating a ""poisonous and toxic atmosphere"" that could be exploited by populists. In October, Mr Brown predicted a future referendum on Brexit will take place if Britain leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019. He added that he expects an extended transition period, retaining some aspects of membership and that the next general election will be fought on Europe. :: Tony Blair The former PM said Mrs May must stop ""banging (her) head against this brick wall"" and go for a second referendum. Mr Blair described the ""disentangling"" process of Brexit as ""hideously complex"" and said all options of leaving the EU have ""significant drawbacks"" compared with staying in. After Mrs May robustly told him to step back from Brexit, he responded: ""In these circumstances it is not irresponsible or insulting to put forward an alternative way to achieve resolution. If a second vote did happen, what would it look like, who could vote and what would be on the ballot? ""The sensible thing is now to allow parliament to vote on each of the forms of Brexit canvassed including the prime minister’s deal. If they can’t reach agreement then the logical thing is to go back to the people."" He continued: ""What is irresponsible however is to try to steamroller MPs into accepting a deal they genuinely think is a bad one with the threat that if they do not fall into line, the government will have the country crash out without a deal."" :: Sir John Major The former prime minister who took up the reigns after Margaret Thatcher's resignation has made several public comments on Brexit. He has called for Article 50 to be revoked to give politicians across the Commons time to work through what he termed the ""morass"". He also warned that Brexiteers responsible for persuading the British public to leave the European Union will never be forgiven for their ""false promises"". :: William Hague The former Tory leader has backed Mrs May's withdrawal deal, saying if others in his party do not support it then ""Brexit might not happen at all"". Lord Hague has made it clear he believes a second referendum would be bad news for the country and has downplayed claims that the UK would be left in a difficult position in the eventuality of a ""no-deal"" scenario. :: Iain Duncan Smith Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith turned Tory rebel said the PM should take a tough line with EU leaders by threatening to withhold the so-called divorce bill of up to £39bn agreed as part of the UK's departure. Mr Duncan Smith is resolute that the Irish backstop issue must be resolved, urging Mrs May to ""say to the EU now 'your £39 billion is fully at risk. We are not committed to the £39bn unless we get some resolution'. ""They know that this backstop can be completely replaced by an open borders policy. Push them to the point where they recognise they have to do that and it resolves everything."" :: Michael Howard Firmly against another vote, Lord Howard has said: ""A second referendum would be a gross insult to the people."" The former Tory leader has previously said the UK should look to leave the EU with a managed no-deal Brexit. Once out, the UK could then attempt to organise a free trade deal from the outside, he says. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you?"

""When I realised there could be a delay at Christmas, I asked myself, how will these families eat?"" Sky News obtained data revealing a stark increase in Universal Credit claimants struggling to pay for housing and food Mr Jones said he had listened to customers tell him about late Universal Credit payments and sanctions for being a few minutes late to meetings. He added that he regularly collects for food banks and believes austerity is to blame for growing homelessness and poverty in his area. ""With Universal Credit coming in on a larger scale, we are going to see more of this,"" Mr Jones said. ""Poverty should be a worry for everybody."" Mr Jones initially posted his offer to help on Twitter and Facebook.

""I can't help with much but I can put a xmas dinner on you're table."" The tweet received 21,000 likes and was retweeted nearly 7,000 times, with responses from people affected by late payments still coming in. Mr Jones said the response ""has been great"". ""It's a decent hardworking community area, people still do pull together,"" he said. ""People have offered donations. We've had people sending cards through the post."" Universal Credit, which bundles a range of different benefits payments into one monthly sum, is currently being rolled out across the country. The government says the scheme will result in people getting work quickly. But claimants have faced five week delays in receiving their first payments, administrative problems and average losses of £48 a week for millions of families.

He died on Monday and his organs have been used over the past week to save a number of lives around the world, including those of other children. His mother, Jo Campanaro, said the pain she is feeling is indescribable. She told Sky News: ""I know my son has passed away, but the reality of thinking we took him to football like we've done for years on a Sunday and the fact he hasn't come home is the hardest thing to absorb. ""I get he's gone, but it just doesn't make sense. You just don't take your child to football and not bring him home. ""It's indescribable. My world stopped rotating the minute they told me Luca was gone. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""Just two weeks before his death, Luca had told his mother he would want to donate his organs in the event of his death after they watched a TV documentary on the subject. Ms Campanaro said having the conversation - and knowing Luca has helped others - was a silver lining. ""You just don't think those things happen to children - you hear stories of terrible accidents, but they don't happen to you, they happen to other people,"" she added. ""So it was just a conversation that had been put to the back of my mind and we just moved on obviously, until now. ""I'm so grateful for that conversation - I cannot get that over to people enough. It's an uncomfortable conversation but it's a really important one to have because it does make difficult situations like this easier."" The NHS says anyone, regardless of age, can join the organ donor register. Luca had been a team member of his club Bedgrove Dynamos since the age of six. In a statement, the club said it was ""deeply saddened"" and would be holding a minute's applause during its fixtures this weekend. A Just Giving page set up to raise money for Luca's funeral and other costs has already raised more than £25,000."

2018-12-15,"It's all anyone wants to talk to me about, Meghan and those rumours. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/is-the-public-falling-out-of-love-with-meghan-over-rumours-of-tantrums-11583326,"Stories of tantrums over tiaras, reports she's been upsetting the royal staff and whether she's really fallen out with Kate. Now her father says she's 'controlling' and has cut him out of her life completely. That's after a weekend of more newspaper reports that it's not all happy families at Kensington Palace, some of which I have been told are total fiction. But it has become part of a theme. After 2018 started with wall-to-wall excitement and largely positive stories about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, why has the tone of the coverage changed? I have to say it has surprised me. After a hugely successful overseas tour and the news they're expecting a baby next spring, I didn't think there was the public appetite for negative stories about the Sussexes. Chatting with crowds both here in the UK and during the tour I've found genuine affection and admiration for our new Duchess. I've spoken to women who see her as a role model, and many Meghan fans have sprung to her defence on social media. But while many of us love a good fairy tale, we can't resist a story that appears to lift the lid on the private lives of the Royal Family. Under the protection of anonymity some of those who are apparently close to Harry and Meghan have been happy to spill the beans. Only they know why. Do they feel they are putting the record straight or is it down to jealousy? Whatever it is, their stories are selling papers. When Prince Harry and Meghan got married I think many of us had already decided where we thought this story would go: The Cambridges and the Sussexes all getting along like a house on fire. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry have always appeared very close, Meghan we hoped would turn this powerful trio into the ""Fab Four"". But does it sound plausible that Meghan and Kate aren't best friends? Yes. They're very different personalities, their lives have been poles apart and they're both preparing for very specific royal roles. Is Meghan being a diva? I don't know. But it is possible that she's maybe put a few noses out of joint as she gets to grips with a more restrictive and traditional way of life. Can I imagine that William and Harry have fallen out? Not entirely but Harry finally settling down was always going to change the dynamic between the two brothers. William joked that he hoped it would mean that Harry stopped raiding his fridge. There'll be no chance of that when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex move away to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. The fact we haven't seen Harry and Meghan, Kate and William all out together since the formal setting of Remembrance weekend in November hasn't helped to quash any rumours of a rift. A vacuum of no new photo opportunities or joint royal engagements leaves plenty of time to speculate about what we think is going on. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? I personally can't wait for 25 December at Sandringham. I'll be there as the Royal Family all head to church. The cameras and the crowds will be out in force and no doubt every one of the Windsor clan will be on their best behaviour. And I'm sure there'll be plenty of us who can appreciate just what that is like, putting on appearances for the sake of simply having a quiet Christmas Day."

2018-12-15,"Tony Blair has hit back at criticism from the prime minister, warning her that it would be irresponsible to try and ""steamroller"" her Brexit agreement through.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/blair-and-may-clash-over-brexit-as-he-warns-pm-not-to-steamroller-mps-11582978,"The former Labour prime minister and Theresa May are embroiled in a row after she accused him of ""undermining"" the EU divorce talks by calling for a second referendum, which she said was an ""insult to the office he once held"". But Mr Blair has dismissed the charge and said he was acting in the national interest. The spat came as two of the prime minister's closest aides were forced to deny claims they were planning for a fresh Brexit poll. Labour has also vowed to do all it could to try and force a Commons vote this week on the PM's withdrawal agreement, which would almost certainly be defeated. Responding to Mrs May's criticism, Mr Blair said: ""To describe such a course as an insult is a strange description of what would be the opportunity for them to instruct Parliament as to how to proceed. ""Far from being anti-democratic, it would be the opposite - as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying. ""What is irresponsible however is to try to steamroller MPs into accepting a deal they genuinely think is a bad one with the threat that if they do not fall into line, the government will have the country crash out without a deal."" If a second vote did happen, what would it look like, who could vote and what would be on the ballot? The former Labour leader said he was within his rights to offer advice when the country was ""in crisis"" over ""the most important decision our country has taken since the end of World War Two"". Mr Blair said it was ""perfectly clear neither the British people nor their parliament will unite behind the prime minister's deal"" and that was why she was forced to pull the vote last week. ""In these circumstances it is not irresponsible or insulting to put forward an alternative way to achieve resolution,"" he said. ""The sensible thing is now to allow parliament to vote on each of the forms of Brexit canvassed including the prime minister's deal. ""If they can't reach agreement then the logical thing is to go back to the people."" But International Trade Secretary Liam Fox ruled this out, arguing a second referendum would ""perpetuate"" the deep divisions in Britain. However, he indicated he could support a free vote for MPs on Brexit options. Dr Fox told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show: ""That's not something we have considered. ""I have to say, personally, I wouldn't have a huge problem with parliament as a whole having a say on what the options were."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds also insisted the cabinet had not discussed a second EU referendum. Asked if the cabinet had talked about the issue, Mr Hinds told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: ""No. Government policy couldn't be clearer. We are here to act on the will of the British people clearly expressed in the referendum."" Warning that another vote would be ""divisive"", Mr Hinds added: ""We've had the people's vote, we've had the referendum and now we've got to get on with implementing it."" Happy to confirm I am *not* planning a 2nd referendum with political opponents (or anyone else to anticipate the next question) https://t.co/3hNDvmNTN9 His comments came as the PM's defacto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, and Mrs May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell, denied reports they were involved in planning for a new Brexit referendum. Mr Barwell tweeted: ""Happy to confirm I am *not* planning a 2nd referendum with political opponents (or anyone else to anticipate the next question)"" One of those arguing for a second referendum is former Tory minister Jo Johnson, who quit the government in protest over Brexit. He told Sky News: ""My priority is to ensure that we don't take an irrevocable step by accepting this bad deal. It's not in our national interest and I think it's really important we think again before we do that."" Meanwhile, Labour has said it will not bring a confidence motion against the government until after a meaningful vote on Mrs May's Brexit deal is held. Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne, who is also the party's election co-ordinator, told the BBC: ""Parliament has to decide whether or not it supports the prime minister's deal and fundamentally until we secure that meaningful vote from the parliament we can't move to the next stage. He added: ""We will be using whatever mechanisms we have at our disposal next week to try and force the government to bring forward that deal for a vote before Christmas."" More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? But Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she believed a confidence motion against the government could succeed and criticsed Labour's inaction. She told Sky News: ""Labour's position right now is it won't back a second EU referendum until it has tried and failed to trigger a general election, but if it won't try to trigger a general election then we're in this catch-22 position. ""It seems to me right now that Labour is as much of a barrier to making progress on Brexit as the Tories are."""
2018-12-15,"More people are going to the cinema than at any time since the 1970s, with 2018 on course to be a record year for the big  screen. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181216195209/https://news.sky.com/story/cinema-attendance-is-highest-since-the-1970s-11581982,"Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, said admissions were on course to hit 176 million for the whole of 2018 - the highest since 1970 and six million up from 2017. Box office takings are expected to reach between £1.33bn and £1.35bn by the end of the year. Much of the success is down to the strength of the year's blockbuster movie offering, Mr Clapp explained. Eight films released in the UK - including Peter Rabbit, Black Panther, The Greatest Showman and Bohemian Rhapsody - boasted box office takings of more than £40m. It is normal for about half of that to perform so well. ""There has been a really strong film slate with a diversity of films performing well,"" Mr Clapp told Sky News. ""Probably one of the reasons why admissions have been higher than they have been is because we've been pulling in audiences from a broad range of places."" More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? The rise took place alongside an increase in cinemas opening, too. Some places now have a cinema where they've lacked one for 20 years, while other areas will see new arthouse or specialist cinemas. ""It's something new in the community,"" Mr Clapp said. ""We also see cinemas acting as a space for more than just films, and cinemas are catering for this with events like accessible or parent-and-baby screenings"". Cinema attendance peaked in the UK in the 1930s and 1940s, when people attended screenings to find out the news and weather as well as watch films. But it dropped with the advent of television and cinemas became dilapidated from a lack of investment. It was only later, in the late 1980s and 1990s, that multiplex cinemas emerged and attendance began to pick up. Market research firm Mintel notes that the big screen success came despite an unusually hot summer and the World Cup, both of which might typically deter people from watching movies indoors. Customer surveys have indicated that, despite the increase, many Brits find going to the cinema expensive. Two adult tickets to see the latest Harry Potter movie in central London come to just over £35 on a Saturday evening, a cost that doesn't include sweets and drinks. The UK Cinema Association says the average price of a ticket nationwide is £7. ""We view ourselves still as an affordable out-of-home experience,"" Mr Clapp said."

""These are little Trojan horses that we are trying to get into schools where there's been an absolute decimation of the provision of arts in the last 10 years,"" she said. ""So a collapse in drama teaching, in students taking up GCSE drama, in drama teachers being in schools. ""The actors (in these plays) are all mindful of how do we inspire people who haven't come from privileged backgrounds, how can we give them the opportunities."" The trilogy, which is set in a women's prison, includes Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest. It has been described by one critic as ""one of the most important theatrical events of the last 20 years"". Phyllida's experience in the entertainment industry inspired her to put women centre stage in each of the productions. ""I didn't quite realise I was a woman until I worked in the movie industry,"" she said. ""I thought I was just a director and then suddenly when I walked onto the James Bond studio at Pinewood and everyone was saluting each other and calling each other 'sir, morning sir', and stuff - I thought: 'Crikey, I really have landed on another planet.'"" She also hopes her all female cast will serve as an example to others. ""These roles, great Shakespearean roles, have been handed down from man to man,"" she said. ""Of course we don't feel entitled to take them, we feel a bit nervous at first, but once we give them a go we realise we can do this. Young people need role models and that's what this is about."" Secondary schools all over the country will be able to watch the plays via the National Theatre's free on demand service. The schools will also be given access to extra digital learning resources, which are intended to help teachers and young people explore the key themes the plays throw up.

Among those who could become the first ethnic minority face on a British banknote include Noor Inayat Khan, Britain's first Muslim war heroine, or Crimean War nurse Mary Seacole. Other suggestions include composer and writer Ignatius Sancho, who fought to end the slave trade and became the first black person to vote in a British election, and John Edmonstone, a freed slave from Guyana who taught Charles Darwin taxidermy in Edinburgh. It comes after the Bank of England appealed for public nominations for a person to appear on the new polymer note, with nominations closing on Friday. Mr Carney, who has already indicated a scientist will be featured, will make the final choice next year. Ms Zaidi told Sky News she wanted the Bank of England to ""commit to the policy of trying to source this first ethnic minority figure"" as ""inclusion matters"". Campaign backer Lord Victor Adebowale, the chief executive of social care provider Turning Point, said it was an opportunity to ""educate the country"". He told Sky News: ""I think it's quite shocking - 400 years of the Bank of England and not one black face on any currency in multicultural country like Great Britain? ""We're a global country, it's obvious we should have a black face on the currency."" In a letter to The Sunday Times, signed by the likes of comedians Sanjeev Bhaskar and Sandi Toksvig and Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, the campaign said a BAME figure would show their contribution the UK was ""valued and recognised"". ""Ethnic minority communities represent 14% of the British population,"" it said. ""We do not lack candidates, and arguably their achievements were the greater for having been made at a time when many careers and were effectively closed to them, whether through colonial rules, racism, or the legacy of slavery. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""However, no one from an ethnic minority has yet featured on a banknote."" The executive director of the Equality Trust, Dr Wanda Wyporska, said it was time BAME ""heroes and heroines"" were recognised for their contributions to British society. She said: ""Now more than ever, we need to celebrate the rich diversity of UK society: representation on banknotes is a great way to do this."""

Freezing temperatures and the relentless popularity of shopping online are behind the terrible numbers, say experts. Shopping centres and retail parks, combined with high streets, saw footfall down 7.3% up to 3pm on Saturday, retail intelligence experts Springboard said. Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing and insights director, said Storm Deirdre's arrival would have deterred even the most loyal high street consumer from venturing out. She said: ""If people are presented with really terrible weather they then have the choice to shop online, and they can make other choices about what to do with their time. ""That unfortunately offers them sometimes better alternatives than trailing around a town centre or a high street in freezing cold or rainy weather."" Saturday's figures were ""severely down"" on last year, on what she described as a ""peak trading weekend"". She added that many shoppers may not venture out next weekend as it is so close to Christmas Day. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Shoppers may have already travelled to wherever they are spending the holidays, and may feel discouraged by bad weather forecasts, said Ms Wehrle. September figures showed the UK to be suffering its worst year on record as store sales declined for the eighth consecutive month. November's bargain bonanza, Black Friday, also disappointed, with data showing the biggest drop in footfall for that week in three years. Ms Wehrle said: ""It's unfortunate that the weather has come in. ""I think all retailers are finding it really tough, even the ones that are most resilient are finding it tough. And this is not what they need. This is really poor."" She added that the trend now to discount items before Christmas and having sometimes all-year-round sales affects buyers' attitudes towards price drops. ""We have come to expect discounts,"" she said. ""By the time we get to Christmas we've seen 20% off, we've seen 30% off, we've had Black Friday."""
2018-12-19,A schoolboy will spend at least a decade behind bars for murdering a man with a cricket bat as he looked for his stepchildren's stolen bicycles.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181220214553/https://news.sky.com/story/schoolboy-jimmy-owens-16-jailed-for-murdering-man-with-cricket-bat-11587070,"Sixteen-year-old Jimmy Owens - able to be named after a judge lifted a court order banning the media from identifying him - killed Derek Whyteside, 42, with a single blow to the head on 18 June. He crept up behind his victim on what was the youngster's final day at secondary school. After being struck by the cricket bat, Mr Whyteside - who was armed with a knuckleduster - was hit on the head by the teenager's father, William Owens, as he lay dying from a fractured skull. Passing sentence at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Thursday, Judge Paul Glenn jailed the teenager for life with a minimum term of 10 years, while his father, 41, was given 20 months for affray. The judge, who condemned those who took ""despicable"" mobile phone pictures of the victim before he received any help, said: ""Derek Whyteside had decided to go and look for those who he plainly considered to be involved (in the theft). ""He was plainly ready for trouble."" He told the younger Owens, of Malinslee, Telford, that he accepted he had not intended to kill Mr Whyteside, but the jury was told during the trial that he would be guilty of murder if he had intended to cause really serious harm to Mr Whyteside. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""You emerged from the bushes and struck him from behind with the bat,"" the judge said. ""You aimed at his head. You used significant force. He had no chance to take evasive action - it was a vicious blow delivered in anger."" As for the father, of Boulton Grange, Telford, the judge said: ""Your part was, frankly, outrageous. ""Your involvement and the effect on the community is so serious only custody is appropriate."" But he praised the efforts of the boy's mother to help Australian-born Mr Whyteside, who died in hospital 36 hours later. The judge said that while he too had behaved badly on the day in question, he had paid a ""terrible and totally unjustified price"" for doing so. In a victim impact statement read to the court on behalf of Mr Whyteside's partner, Michelle Beddall, she said: ""I am having to go through living hell because they acted like animals and can't face up to what they have done. ""I hate what they have done to me and my kids."" Prior to the sentencing, defence counsel Patrick Harrington QC told the court that the younger Owens had previously been chased by Mr Whyteside - and that the provocation had played a role in the incident. The boy was not responsible for stealing the missing bikes and another youth was later cautioned for theft, but the judge told him he had not ""done the decent thing"" in helping to recover them."

In a paper on travelling to the EU with a UK passport, references to negotiations going ""well"" and praise for Brussels for ""working hard to seek a positive deal"" have been removed. A new entry insists delivering the deal negotiated with EU leaders is still the ""top priority"" but that a ""significant programme of work"" has been launched to prepare for a no deal divorce. A log on changes to chemical regulation papers explains: ""Unlikely event information replaced by the government's latest position."" What does it all mean for borders, medicines and pets? The changes were confirmed by a government spokesperson, who said language had been ""updated"" after a cabinet decision on Wednesday. They added: ""We fully expect to get a deal and believe that is the most likely outcome - that is what we are focused on delivering."" In a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the government ramped up preparations for no deal, including putting 3,500 soldiers to intervene in any case of a crisis. Paul Hodges, chair of the business group Ready for Brexit, told Sky News the change in the document was a ""momentous change"". More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""To try and smuggle out this critical policy shift just before Christmas - without an official statement - is deeply worrying,"" he said. ""Businesses have been saying for months that they need clarity on what is going to happen, so that they can plan for it. ""Now they apparently have the clarity they need, but many will have completely missed the significance of what has just happened."" A cross-party group of MPs are now attempting to ensure the House of Commons has to give its ""explicit consent"" before the UK can leave the EU without an agreement.

The Commons is due to vote on the Finance Bill on 8 January, following MPs' return from their Christmas break. Ms Cooper told Sky News: ""It's irresponsible for the government to just try and create chaos in order to get a bad deal through that doesn't have support. ""The sensible thing is to rule out a no-deal cliff-edge. ""That, we know, would be damaging for businesses, we've got the army on standby and that's what this amendment tries to do - to say, even if the government won't rule out no-deal, parliament should have the opportunity to do so instead."" She suggested there are a majority of MPs who want to avoid a ""no-deal"" Brexit, and many would look for further opportunities to alter upcoming legislation to prevent leaving the EU without a divorce agreement. ""We should be looking for similar amendments to every other bit of legislation,"" Ms Cooper added."
2018-12-19,"Unwanted presents, non recyclable wrapping paper, and a mountain of plastic - more Britons than ever are trying to avoid the unethical elements of Christmas this year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181220214553/https://news.sky.com/story/britons-cut-spending-in-search-for-an-ethical-christmas-11586487,"It comes as charities warn of the environmental impact of the big day, with huge amounts of rubbish filling landfills, oceans and rivers. The Bronsdons from East Lothian are doing their best to have an eco-friendly Christmas, getting presents from swishing parties, where people trade unwanted clothes with each other, and buying plastic-free shaving kits. Mum Sarah has also carefully chosen chocolate bars wrapped in foil and paper, not plastic. They also make their own wrapping paper as a family, stamping Christmas designs onto brown paper. The ethical market in Britain is now worth £83bn a year, and people are keen to have a more sustainable Christmas. Connor McKay, from cosmetics brand Lush, said: ""In recent years there has been an increase in knowledge and with social media people have more access to companies. They want to know where ingredients come from and what impact does the packaging have on the environment."" Shoppers at Lush told Sky News they wanted to champion sustainability at Christmas. Estimates from the Wildlife and Countryside Link show more than 103,000 tonnes of plastic packaging will be thrown away and not recycled this Christmas, equivalent to the weight of 215,000 polar bears. Almost 3,600 tonnes of aluminium foil will end up in landfill, and 106sqkm of wrapping paper will be used. More than one-fifth of this, an area larger than the combined size of London's Royal Parks, will go to landfill. Dr Lyndsey Dodds, head of UK Marine Policy, at WWF: ""Living a sustainable lifestyle - from the food we eat to the clothes we wear - is a vital step in protecting our wildlife and our environment. ""People will be shocked to learn about the amount of waste we produce at Christmas and also frustrated that more isn't being done by the government and businesses to reduce the amount of packaging used. ""The first step is for each of us to say no to single-use plastic and to push the government to make better choices for our world, including the key step of requiring businesses to slash plastic production."" Britons will receive somewhere in the region of 60 to 70 million unwanted Christmas presents this year. A YouGov survey of 2000 adults revealed more than half of people receive a present they didn't want at Christmas, with bath products taking the top spot. The poll revealed a third of people would be happy to have a charitable donation made instead of a gift. More and more people have decided to reduce the number of presents they buy, with some agreeing not to buy any at all. An international survey of 23,000 families by Ferratim, a financial service company, found that in the UK a third of people would be spending less money on Christmas this year. The firm said fears over Brexit was contributing to people's decision to spend less. Cutting festive spending was first championed by Money Saving Expert's Martin Lewis, who encourages people to agree with wider family and friends to cut down on how many presents are bought. Harriet Vocking, of Eco-Age, a sustainability and communications consultancy, said: ""There is a tendency at Christmas to buy gifts because that is what is expected, but there are many ways to avoid the unwanted gift conundrum. ""We're seeing a significant increase in engagement around the topic, from people asking us where they can buy the most sustainable gifts, to contributing amazing ideas and debates for ways to have a meaningful, fun, and sustainable Christmas."" It's thought that last year, UK residents threw away 100 million black bin bags of waste. Tony Juniper, executive director, of WWF (UK) told Sky News: ""Lots of the stuff we get for Christmas we know we didn't want and much of it we really didn't need. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

It prompted angry accusations of misogyny from Tory MPs. :: Sky Data poll: Most think Corbyn's alleged 'stupid woman' comment not sexist However, Mr Corbyn later denied he used the phrase ""stupid woman"" but had instead muttered ""stupid people"" in reference to those on the Conservative benches. The dispute featured on many newspaper front pages on Thursday, while the Labour leader doubled down on his stance. In a Twitter post, he accused ""the Tories and much of the media"" of creating ""a phoney row about something I didn't say"". A team of lip readers study the footage of the Labour leader and disagree with the politician In an accompanying video, Mr Corbyn said: ""Yesterday the Tories tried to turn parliament into a pantomime, tried to turn it into a pantomime when there are very serious issues. ""I was accused of saying something I didn't say. Did I say 'stupid people'? Yeah, I did because I think they are. ""Because I think turning parliament into a pantomime is an act of unbelievable stupidity. ""They should be facing up to the real issues that people in our country face about the danger of a no-deal Brexit with all the chaos that will bring. ""And serious issues about poverty, Universal Credit and homelessness within our society."" Mr Corbyn later referenced the death of a homeless man who was sleeping rough outside parliament. He added: ""Isn't that a shame to our whole country? Shouldn't that be a shame to our political system? ""It wasn't reported in most of our media. ""My anger will only subside when we've won an election to get a Labour government that will transform our society, that will make sure we are a society that cares for all.""

Mr Corbyn's claim ""most of our media"" didn't report the death of the homeless man accompanied headlines of the ""stupid woman"" row as featured in The Times, the Daily Mail and the Independent website. All three outlets had reported on the death of the man - since widely named as Hungarian national Gyula Remes - before Mr Corbyn released his Twitter video. It was also covered by Sky News, the BBC, ITV, the Guardian, the Daily Mirror, The Sun and the Huffington Post amongst others. Official figures released on Thursday revealed the deaths of homeless people have increased by almost a quarter over five years.

2018-12-19,It will be a festive political break like no other. Teams of civil servants will be charged with spending millions preparing legislation and further contingency plans to prepare for a historic hard break from the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181220214553/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-festive-break-like-no-other-lies-ahead-as-parliament-kicks-can-into-next-year-11586296,"It's a prospect the government says it wants to avoid and a clear Commons majority suggest they will try to veto it. When the political narrative from the prime minister is that MPs have work to do in order to come up with a Brexit compromise, taking 18 days off, while the civil service beavers away, is not a great look, and during this break there will be pressure for an early return from recess. But above all, Theresa May hopes that some time at home with family and constituents will refocus the minds of over 100 of her own MPs and the DUP, and leave them with a post-advent open mind. Her job - or at least that of her top negotiator, Oliver Robbins - is to return from Brussels with a legally binding addendum that makes clear that if the backstop becomes permanent, the UK can exercise rights to leave unilaterally. But there is little evidence that the EU are talking right now or if it will do so over the Christmas break. Indeed, the very real doubts that the prime minister encountered at last week's Brussels summit were not necessarily just about the idea of a legally binding reassurance over the backstop. There was a fundamental doubt that there would be any point trying to offer such a concession to a leader who did not even dare call the vote she had promised she could pass. Such a concession might be better saved until the vote is actually lost, was the thinking. And indeed, any concession would require Dublin's active consent. The message Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar gave to me in Brussels was that he thought if the Commons does not want to pass this deal, the backstop is here to stay, and Mrs May should ponder seeking the delay of, or revoking entirely, the Article 50 notice. The Labour leadership too is playing for time. You don't have to employ a lipreader to see an opposition unwilling to use its most potent weapon of a full Commons no confidence vote and unable to take full advantage of the current tumult. Over the past year, the Labour leadership has been been squeezed by its membership and shadow cabinet to move at a glacial pace towards more of a Remain position. But over Christmas and into the New Year, there will be no hiding place. Jeremy Corbyn will have to come off the fence in the first half of January on the referendum coveted by many of his supporters. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? As the Labour leader told me in Lisbon earlier this month, his supporters who sport ""Love Corbyn Hate Brexit"" tote bags ""are not wrong"". We are on the cusp of momentous events that could properly split both major parties, see widespread economic and diplomatic turmoil, and lead rapidly to another major national poll of some description within months. When push came to shove parliament decided to kick the can into January. Christmas recess is a brief pause before that road officially runs out. A festive truce appears to have started, but there is little sign of the Christmas compromise the prime minister needs."

Men made up 84% of deaths of homeless people in 2017. The research found on average homeless men died aged 44 and women at 42, compared to 76 and 81 for the general population. London and the North West had the highest mortality rates. In 2017 in England and Wales, more than half of all the deaths were caused by drug poisoning (which includes misuse), liver disease or suicide. The highest number of deaths in 2017 came in August, with 72 dying, followed by 56 in February and 55 in May. The researchers broke down the deaths by region: :: North-east England - 32 (up 71%) :: North-west England - 119 (up 115%) :: Yorkshire and the Humber - 49 (up 58%) :: East Midlands - 34 (up 38%) :: West Midlands - 45 (up 11%) :: East of England - 33 (up 16%) :: London - 136 (up 2%) :: South-east England - 84 (up 7%) :: South-west England - 52 (up 6%) :: Wales - 13 (down 40%) The statistics come the day after MPs were told about the death of a 43-year-old homeless man, known as Gyula Remes, who was found outside the Houses of Parliament. He was the second homeless man to have died next to Parliament in 2018. An urgent question on the deaths will be heard in the House of Commons on Thursday. Ben Humberstone, Office for National Statistics director, said: ""Every year hundreds of people die while homeless. ""These are some of the most vulnerable members of our society so it was vital that we produced estimates of sufficient quality to properly shine a light on this critical issue. ""Today we have been able to do just that."" He added: ""Our findings show a pattern of deaths among homeless people which is strikingly different from the general population. For example, homeless people tend to die younger and from different causes."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Greg Beales, director of homelessness charity Shelter, said: ""This appalling loss of life should be a source of national shame. ""There is nothing inevitable about homelessness or about these tragic deaths which are a consequence of a housing system which fails too many people."" His comments were echoed by Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis. Mr Sparkes said: ""This is nothing short of a national tragedy - especially when we know that homelessness is not inevitable. In one of the world's wealthiest countries, no one should be dying because of homelessness. It's imperative that governments act now to stop this tragedy once and for all. ""Behind these statistics are human beings - mothers, fathers, daughters and sons - whose families will now be spending Christmas coming to terms with their loss. This has to change."""

It cut the forecast from 0.3% to 0.2% and said the figure was ""likely to remain around that level in the first quarter of 2019"". Chief among the bank's Christmas list of worries was Brexit fog damaging demand. The statement read: ""The further intensification of Brexit uncertainties, coupled with the slowing global economy, has also weighed on the near-term outlook for UK growth. ""Business investment has fallen for each of the past three quarters and is likely to remain weak in the near term. :: BoE welcomes 'crucial' EU step to avoid no-deal financial crunch ""The housing market has remained subdued.

Bank of England leaves interest rates unchanged at 0.75% and says Brexit uncertainty is starting to hold back economic growth https://t.co/GHr4b3WLJO pic.twitter.com/OAGAG1pKfa The Bank repeated its previous guidance on how it would handle the UK's expected departure from the EU in March. It added: ""The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction."" That means the Bank could either raise or cut interest rates depending on the demands of its mandate to ""achieve the 2% inflation target."" Official figures this week showed the rate of inflation at 2.3% - with wage growth earlier found to be growing at a faster pace of 3.3%. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The bank said that inflation was likely to dip below 2% early next year as plunging oil costs - a consequence of over-supply fears in a slowing global economy - made their way through supply chains. The Bank made its latest Brexit remarks soon after the government confirmed plans to re-start the parliamentary debate on Theresa May's Brexit deal with Brussels on 9 January. Its commentary on the process has faced steep criticism from Brexiteers who have accused governor Mark Carney of presiding over 'Project Fear'. He has insisted the Bank is merely doing its job. A recent report the Bank was asked to prepare for MPs, containing various scenarios, suggested a disorderly Brexit could push the UK towards the biggest slump in modern memory. Its latest survey of business conditions flagged problems for retailers, who were cautious about the outlook for Christmas sales after a disappointing Black Friday period in November. Meanwhile, the lack of availability of EU workers had exacerbated recruitment difficulties - with companies addressing the problem by taking on more apprentices and graduates, training existing employees, and investing in technology, as well as being more selective about bidding for contracts. The Brexit-hit pound - lifted on Thursday by stronger-than-expected retail sales figures - barely moved on the Bank's latest commentary. Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, said of the meeting's outcome: ""The Bank noted the growing tightness of the labour market, which has pushed wage growth higher than the central bank had previously anticipated. ""There is also the possibility that lower global oil prices could also stoke domestic demand. However, these positive factors do not outweigh those indicating a slowing economy. ""Ultimately though, it will be Brexit that determines the Bank's next move; a fact acknowledged by the committee, which said its monetary policy response could be in 'either direction'. ""On the assumption of a reasonably smooth Brexit, we would expect the Bank to raise interest rates once in 2019, likely later in the year."""

Despite many backbenchers pushing the government to name a date for the final vote, she refused to. The original vote was scheduled for the start of December - but was pulled the day before by Mrs May because she feared a ""significant"" defeat. Sky News calculated 184 MPs were set to support it.

""In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to appropriate persons who may be able to take remedial action,"" he added. He issued 18 recommendations, including one that the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command at Scotland Yard should be subject to external audit from another department within the police and receive better training for marauding terrorist attacks. The coroner also recommended Transport for London assess the height of parapets and railings after two of the victims fell from Westminster Bridge when they were struck by Masood. He also recommended the coastguard could issue guidance on how to retrieve unconscious bodies from water and that the Department for Transport and the car rental industry look at a code of practice on checks before vehicles are rented. Khalid Masood ran down five people on Westminster Bridge and stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death on 22 March last year. After a three-week inquest, Mr Lucraft made a finding of unlawful killing on the death of PC Palmer, 48, and on American musician Kurt Cochran, 54, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, school administrator Aysha Frade, 44, and Romanian designer Andreea Cristea, 31. Michelle Palmer, the policeman's widow, asked how her husband could have been left ""alone and unarmed"" and John Frade - Mrs Frade's husband - called on MI5 to learn lessons. MI5 faced similar complaints made after the 7 July and Woolwich killings that they were not keeping good enough records to explain why they had closed investigations. At the inquest, they complained that it was ""not practicable"" to record reasons for every decision by its officers ""not to do something"". But the coroner disagreed, saying in his report: ""It strikes me that closing a person as an subject of interest is a positive decision that further investigation is not justified or necessary. ""It is not obvious to me that such decisions are so numerous that recording each one with a short rationale would be impracticable. ""Furthermore, I can see clear operational benefits to corporate memory in having such reasoning recorded which could assist in the fight against terrorist activity."" He asked that the security service ""considers whether it would be practicable and beneficial to introduce a procedure to record with brief reasons the decision to close a person as a subject of interest (SOI)."" An inquest heard a heartfelt series of tributes to those who died in the terror attack on 22 March 2017 Mr Lucraft also said it was a ""matter of concern that, at the time of the attack, one of the most vulnerable and public entrances to the parliamentary estate was not protected by armed police"". If armed police officers had been stationed at Carriage Gates at the time of the attack ""it is possible that they may have been able to prevent PC Palmer suffering fatal injuries,"" the coroner added. He said there was a ""recurring feature"" of reviews of parliamentary security that public entrances, including Carriage Gates, where Masood entered, presented vulnerabilities. The coroner recommended that the Metropolitan Police Service consider imposing a ""standing order"" that there should be armed officers stationed at ""all open public entry points to the Palace of Westminster, and possibly to some other buildings on the parliamentary estate"". They should also introduce a provision that the standing order could only be varied with the written approval of an officer of ""very senior rank"". The order would provide ""clarity"" and a ""minimum level of protection,"" the coroner said. ""Given the nature of terrorist threats to this country and its parliament, it is difficult to imagine circumstances in the near future when an open public entry point to the palace should not be protected by armed guards,"" Mr Lucraft added. The coroner also highlighted ""shortcomings"" in the supervision of police officers at the Palace of Westminster and said it was a ""matter of concern"" that officers were unaware of their post instructions. He suggested ""regular supervisory audits"" of policing at the Palace of Westminster, and perhaps other parts of the parliamentary estate, preferably by officers outside the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command. ""It appeared that many armed officers in an important area of the palace were regularly patrolling in a way which was not compliant with their instructions, and that this was not being effectively corrected by their supervisors,"" the coroner said. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""It strikes me that there could be real benefit in having a periodic unannounced audit or review by an officer from outside the command, who could check practical compliance with post instructions and other standing orders."" ""As in other fields of life, assurance is often best carried out by somebody outside the body or department under scrutiny,"" the coroner added. The sisters and parents of PC Palmer had expressed concerns about the training of police officers at the Palace of Westminster and the coroner called on Scotland Yard to review the adequacy of training for ""lone actor"" and ""multi-actor"" marauding attacks. He also suggested that Scotland Yard considered a ""periodic audit"" of tactical firearms reviews because no new review had been carried out for eight months, despite the fact that the threat level had been raised. The inquest heard that despite warnings of other vehicle attacks around Europe, no protective barriers were put on Westminster Bridge, where five people were killed by Masood. The coroner warned that it was ""not clear from the evidence"" what work was being done at the national level to deliver wide-ranging advice on protective security measures, especially for roadways and public areas in urban areas. ""It would obviously be unsatisfactory if such work is limited to a limited group of areas designated as crowded places and crowded spaces,"" he added and recommended that ""consistent and up-to-date national advice"" should be provided. Organisations which have been asked to make changes were given until 12 February next year to respond."

""It is in the interests of both countries, both governments to get out of this deadlock. Are we interested in restoring full relations with Britain? Yes, we are interested,"" he said. Moscow's relationship with London collapsed following the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. UK police say Russian operatives Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga carried out the attack using the nerve agent novichok, which Moscow denies. Mr Putin dismissed Britain's stance as a ""politicised, Russophobic approach"" and ""simply a reason to organise yet another attack on Russia"". He added: ""If there were no Skripals, they would have come up with something else, that's clear to me. There's only one goal: to constrain Russia's growth as a possible competitor. ""It's good that he wasn't killed...Thank God, Skripal is alive."" The Russian leader says the former spy is ""simply a scumbag"" as tensions continue to flare over the nerve agent attack The Skripals both survived but Dawn Sturgess died in July after she and partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to the poison in nearby Amesbury, Wiltshire. In a wide-ranging news conference, Mr Putin also weighed in on the Brexit debate, saying Theresa May ""must enact the will of the people, expressed during the referendum"". He said: ""Otherwise, what kind of democracy is it?"" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

Rebels warn the shock decision has ""dangerous implications"" and will give ""momentum"" to terrorists The Russian president said he supported Donald Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and agreed with his US counterpart that the war against Islamic State has been won. ""The US has had a presence in Afghanistan for 17 years, lets say? And almost every year it says that it is withdrawing troops from there. But they are still present there,"" he said."

The first film sees a cunning Culkin outwit two would-be burglars after getting left in his family home alone when the rest jet off on holiday, thinking he is with them. Childhood stardom took something of a toll on the young Culkin, and in 2004 he was arrested in Oklahoma for possession of marijuana and two controlled substances. The arrest saw him jailed briefly before being given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty in court. His personal life also included estrangement from his father, retirement at 14, a marriage at age 18, and several years being dubbed a recluse as he kept away from the public eye.

2018-12-19,The owner of British Gas will on Friday spark a legal battle with Ofgem over Britain's impending energy price cap by trying to force it to change the way it calculates wholesale energy costs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181220214553/https://news.sky.com/story/british-gas-owner-sparks-legal-battle-over-energy-price-cap-11587379,"Sky News can reveal that Centrica will lodge an application for a judicial review of Ofgem's decision to alter the period within which wholesale prices were used to set the cap. Britain's biggest energy supplier, which has more than 12 million customers, is facing growing pressure from investors after seeing its shares fall sharply during the tenure of Iain Conn, its chief executive. British Gas has been haemorrhaging customers amid growing competition from a host of smaller suppliers, some of which have since encountered financial difficulties. A source close to Ofgem said it was notified of the decision to seek a judicial review by Centrica late on Thursday afternoon. One person close to the legal process said the decision focused on an Ofgem decision on the treatment of wholesale cost transitional arrangements and the regulator's unwillingness to investigate the matter. Npower and Scottish Power, two of the UK's other 'big six' energy suppliers, are said to have offered encouragement to the parent company of British Gas, although it is not thought that they are formally participating in the legal challenge. Sources said that Centrica was conscious of the risk that its appeal against the price cap would be misconstrued as an effort to delay or scrap it altogether. ""We want to ensure that the tariff cap being implemented by Ofgem proceeds in a fair and workable way, for all energy suppliers, and that it properly reflects the costs energy suppliers have incurred to supply customers,"" an insider said. ""Our action will not delay or stop the implementation of the price cap."" The price cap was devised after pressure from Theresa May, the Prime Minister, and Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, to clamp down on the standard variable tariffs - or default rates - charged by the major suppliers. It comes into effect on 1 January, and has been set for customers who pay by direct debit at £1137 for the first quarter of 2019, £68 lower than the current British Gas Standard Variable Tariff. Centrica said last month that changes devised by Ofcom to the calculation of the price cap would result in a £70m hit to operating profit in ""the initial period of the cap in the first quarter of 2019"". This week, SSE and Npower announced that they were scrapping a merger of their retail energy businesses, citing the price cap as a factor in their decision. In a statement issued in response to an enquiry from Sky News, a Centrica spokeswoman said: ""Centrica plc is seeking judicial review of Ofgem's decision of 6 November 2018, which relates only to the treatment of wholesale cost transitional arrangements and Ofgem's decision not to investigate and correct its failure to enable the recovery of the wholesale energy costs that all suppliers incur. ""Through this action Centrica has no intention to delay implementation of the cap, and does not expect the cap to be deferred in any way. ""As we have previously said, we do not believe that a price cap will benefit customers but we want to ensure that there is a transparent and rigorous regulatory process to deliver a price cap that allows suppliers, as a minimum, to continue to operate to meet the requirements of all customers."" The cap is expected to save customers on default tariffs around £76 on average and those on the most expensive tariffs as much as £120. In total, the cap will remove around £1bn of overcharging Centrica is said to have been concerned by the change in Ofgem's approach to wholesale costs when devising the cap. It initially proposed setting controls based on forward contracts during the period from April to September 2018, but subsequently changed that to the price of forward contracts from February to July 2018. The effect of that was to avoid raising the level at which the price cap was set, according to one source. An Ofgem spokesman said: ""Ofgem carried out an extensive consultation process when setting the price cap and we believe that it offers consumers on poor value tariffs a fairer deal. ""In the event of a judicial review we would defend our proposals robustly."""

He collapsed not far from the entrance to Westminster Tube station, which links directly to the Houses of Parliament, late on Tuesday night. ""At around 11.30pm on 18 December, we were alerted by officers from British Transport Police (BTP) to a man collapsed in an underpass near to Westminster underground station,"" said a Met Police spokesman. ""First aid was administered by the BTP officers and the man was taken to a central London hospital, where he died in the early hours of 19 December. ""The death is not being treated as suspicious."" Police have not named the man, but among the flowers and candles placed at the scene of his collapse is a piece of paper with ""Gyula Remes 1975-2018"" written on it. Sir Keir Starmer spoke of the death in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, following a question by Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb. Mr Lamp asked the Labour frontbencher whether he agreed that it was ""grotesque and obscene"" that the government was spending ""billions of pounds"" preparing for a ""no-deal"" Brexit, rather than on addressing ""burning injustices"" such as mental health care and homelessness. The shadow Brexit secretary said he did agree, adding: ""Tragically, one of those sleeping right outside the entrance and exit to this place died in the last 24 hours or so."" Back in February, the government minister for homelessness vowed to ""find solutions"" after another rough sleeper died just yards away from parliament. Heather Wheeler said it was ""dreadful news"" and said the death would ""push me on to find solutions and to work to eradicate rough sleeping for good"". More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The government has pledged £100m to halve rough sleeping in England by 2022 and eradicate it by 2027, with more than 24,000 people in Britain to be sleeping rough or in cars, trains or tents over Christmas. Charities including Crisis and Shelter are calling for more action from the government and the public."

The wider group reported a 4.1% fall in adjusted operating profits to $1.7bn (£1.3bn), blamed on the ""challenging market"" and one-off charges in the UK. Walgreens also said it was launching a major global cost-cutting programme aimed at saving $1bn (£790m) a year which could result in ""significant restructuring"". Boots has been marketing its Christmas offerings in a mother-and-daughter based ad campaign that highlights its make-up and hair ranges.

More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? It comes after Warpaint - the maker of W7 Cosmetics - issued a profit warning in October after tough trading in the UK. The weak UK conditions were cited as the main reason for a 2.3% underlying fall in sales for the Walgreens retail pharmacy international division, which includes nearly 4,800 stores in eight countries outside the US, about half of them in Britain. Overall group sales, including its main market in the US, were up by 9.9% to $33.8bn (£26.7bn). Walgreens chief executive Stefano Pessina announced the launch of a cost-cutting programme for the group. It includes a global ""smart spending and smart organisation"" programme initially focused on its retail businesses in the US and UK as well as ""global functions"". Mr Pessina said: ""We continue to focus on and invest in transforming our business."" Chicago-based Walgreens took full control of Boots owner Alliance Boots in a £9bn cash-and-shares deal in 2014 that saw it swallow up the 55% of the company it did not already own. The Boots UK division remains based in Nottingham. Walgreens operates stores under its own name as well as the Duane Reade brand in the US."
2018-12-19,Ex-Labour minister Ivan Lewis has quit the party as he expressed doubts about Jeremy Corbyn's willingness to fight antisemitism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181220214553/https://news.sky.com/story/former-labour-minister-ivan-lewis-quits-party-citing-antisemitism-concerns-11587298,"The Bury South MP resigned from Labour on Thursday with ""great sadness"", but told Mr Corbyn in a letter: ""All too often you have been unwilling to condemn those whose hatred of Israel becomes Jew hatred."" Mr Lewis, 51, has been suspended by Labour since November last year amid an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment. He has denied ever making non-consensual sexual comments or sexual advances towards women. Among the allegations, it was reported last year that Mr Lewis touched a woman's leg and invited her to his house at a Labour Party event in 2010, when she was 19. Sky News understands Mr Lewis was recently informed a date for his hearing with Labour's quasi-judicial disciplinary body would be set in the New Year. His resignation means that hearing will now not take place and the investigation into the MP cannot be concluded. A party source said: ""Ivan was under investigation for alleged sexual harassment. His resignation means the complainants have been denied a hearing."" I'm resigning from @UKLabour, but will continue to stand up for the people of Bury South as an Independent MP in the @HouseofCommons. Read my resignation letter to Jeremy Corbyn. pic.twitter.com/YNmqRVclvR In his resignation letter to Mr Corbyn, Mr Lewis claimed he had never been interviewed about the complaints made against him. He also hit out at an ""unnecessary and politically motivated delay"" in dealing with his case, despite Labour officials being ""fully aware of the impact the situation was having on my mental health"". ""Emails the party were forced to make available to me show clearly the party could have moved forward with the disciplinary process from April but chose not to for political reasons,"" he wrote. Mr Lewis revealed he had previously considered resigning in October, after a summer-long antisemitism row hit Labour, as he ""could no longer reconcile my Jewish identity and current Labour politics"". He claimed, at this point, a ""sudden attempt"" was made to move forward his disciplinary process, which came at a point when ""political control"" of the body investigating Mr Lewis had passed to ""supporters"" of Mr Corbyn. ""This is a process that is flawed and subject to political manipulation,"" Mr Lewis wrote. ""I have made it clear I strongly refute the charges which have been made and I am willing to cooperate with a truly independent process."" Mr Lewis told Mr Corbyn it is ""for others to determine whether you are antisemitic"", but he claimed it is ""clear"" the Labour leader and his key aide Seamus Milne ""do not believe in the right of the Jewish people to self-determination in their own state"". He added: ""You should be honest and acknowledge your preference is that there should only be a state of Palestine."" Attacking Mr Corbyn's ""anti-Western world view"", Mr Lewis claimed the Labour leader's ""long-standing preferences are for the values of Putin's Russia and the Islamist fundamentalism of Iran"". He also claimed Mr Corbyn has ""discomfort"" over Brexit as a ""lifelong eurosceptic"" leading an ""overwhelmingly pro-European"" party. Labour sources expressed bemusement at ""false and bizarre allegations"" in Mr Lewis's letter, stressing Mr Corbyn is committed to a two-state solution in securing peace in the Middle East. They also denied any ""political involvement"" in the disciplinary processes used to investigate the claims against Mr Lewis, which are ""entirely separate"" from the party's leadership. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Mr Lewis served as a minister in both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments, while he was also a member of former Labour leader Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He sought to become Labour's mayoral candidate in Greater Manchester in 2016 but the party instead chose Andy Burnham. Mr Lewis has vowed to ""continue to fight for local people"" in Bury South as an independent MP. In response to Mr Lewis's resignation, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""Jeremy Corbyn thanks Ivan for his service to the Labour Party. ""The Labour Party takes all complaints of sexual harassment extremely seriously, which are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and appropriate disciplinary action taken. ""This case was referred to a full hearing of Labour's National Constitutional Committee. The process is the same for everyone."""

In a statement, the world number nine said he had a ""hypomania episode"" before taking to the oche for the second-round tie and was ""fighting a battle with myself"". Having trailed two sets to one at Alexandra Palace on Wednesday, Wade, 35, fought back to take the match to sudden death before beating Asada 3-2. After levelling the match at one set all, Wade, who is bipolar and suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yelled in the Japanese player's face. When he threw the winning double, he again yelled aggressively several times, towards the audience and the board, with arms and fists clenched. Asada politely shook hands with wade and the officials, bowing as he did so.

2018-12-19,Britain is hooked on dating apps. A national obsession means we are downloading more and spending more on these apps than ever before.  ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181220214553/https://news.sky.com/story/dating-apps-spending-rises-60-thanks-to-swipe-addicted-brits-11586138,"The revolution that began with Tinder just six years ago has transformed the way the sexes meet. There has been an extraordinary cultural shift. The old stigma has gone and the assumption is if you are single you are on a dating app. Data collected by app analysts App Annie and shared exclusively with Sky News shows we spend more on dating apps than we do on entertainment such as films and music. In the third quarter of 2018, UK spending on the top 10 dating apps rose to £23.1m from £14.4m in the same period in 2017. That is a growth of 60% in a year. Tinder generated more consumer spend in the UK than any other non-gaming app in 2018, even more than Netflix and Spotify. And the UK's increase in spending on dating apps is now higher than the global average. The old protocols and elaborate dating rituals of our forefathers (and mothers) have gone. All the fun of the fair has been replaced with the dopamine rush of a Tinder match. It is a numbers game: low risk, high yield. Lily, a 29-year-old from London who has been single for about six years, is a regular dating app user - and has had some pretty unusual matches. ""I once matched with a porn star and I didn't even realise,"" she says. ""I didn't read it in his bio, but it did say. He was beautiful. But he said 'Are you OK with my job?' And I checked and thought 'Oh right!' ""He started asking about my sexual preferences and I was honest but he said my boundaries were too low for him."" But the experience didn't deter Lily from using the apps again. ""One of my best dates was a guy who I'm now really good friends with,"" she says. ""He was refreshingly honest. We didn't want the same thing so we ended up being just friends."" Ashton, 25, from London, uses Gay app Grindr for meeting men to hook up with. He says he does not try to meet them in bars and clubs anymore because he prefers that time to enjoy himself, dance and socialise with friends. When he wants to meet men for sex he turns to his phone. Going from first contact on an app to hooking up in person, he says, can take just a few minutes. ""I prefer to meet up on a Friday, as weekends are reserved for my friends. ""I won't meet someone every day, that's overkill. I'd meet someone once a week. I'll log on a Friday and speak to a few guys and then meet the one I like the most. ""I might browse in the week but I usually just meet on Friday. I don't want to mix my dating with my friends. ""If I was with someone then my friends would know eventually, but I want to hang out with my friends and have fun."" But Ashton has faced the sort of racism he has rarely encountered in person. He says the LGBT community has a real problem with blatant discrimination. ""It can be nasty out there. It's not as obvious today, things are more subtle,"" he says. Before they introduced certain rules people would write ""no Blacks"" in their bios. There also used to be a lot of people writing ""no fats, no fems"". To see that prejudice in the gay community is a problem. There is no subject that has been talked about or written about more. Love and romance, relationships and sex, this is what defines us. But with every swipe we are learning something else about our developing dating habits. Using a sample study of 150,000 users of the site eharmony, researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute discovered that 95% of users send requests to at most 12 people per week. And they reply to fewer than seven messages. This suggests that online daters have a maximum number of people that they communicate with at any one time. We might be understanding more about our dating behaviour, but we still do not fully realise the impact app dating is having on our mental well-being. App dating is like online shopping. We are presenting our 2D versions for others to make snap judgements, making us utterly disposable commodities. ""Ghosting"", when someone who you have been talking to suddenly disappears without trace or explanation, is what many app users hate most. ""I have been ghosted a few times and now I get a gut feeling about it. Sometimes it's genuinely fine, you know it's going to happen and it means you don't waste your time,"" says Zoe, 28. Julie, from Manchester, met husband Matt on a dating app three years ago. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? At their wedding they wanted to celebrate how they had met so they had a very unusual seating plan for their guests. ""By the time we were getting married I think the stigma around internet dating had gone,"" she explains. ""My cousins and friends had met their partners on the internet too. And people were more happy that we were happy than worried about how we met. ""At our wedding the names of our top table was Match.com. We had Plenty Of Fish, we had Grindr. Everyone knew that was how we met."" Julie and Matt are now expecting their second child. Cupid's arrow has been replaced by an algorithm."

Danish intelligence have revealed that Islamic State may be responsible for the murders, saying: ""The video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organisation."" Prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the killings can be considered ""politically motivated and thus an act of terror."" Morocco's prosecutor said on Wednesday one of the men suspected of killing the women belongs to a militant group but stopped short of naming which. The man was arrested on Tuesday in Marrakech, Morocco's main tourist hub. Three other suspects were arrested on Thursday following a extensive manhunt. Danish authorities have authenticated a video shared on social media showing one of the tourists screaming while a man fatally cuts her neck with a knife. The video appears to indicate the killing happened in a different location to where their bodies were found. A source from Imlil, a village six miles (10km) away from where the women were found, said one of the victims was found dead inside her tent while another was found outside. Moroccan news reports stated investigators have video surveillance footage showing three suspects putting up a tent near the victims' tent and leaving the area after the killings. The killings have shocked Morocco, a popular tourist destination where attacks on foreigners are extremely rare.

The seaplane's pilot, 44-year-old Gareth Morgan, also died. An interim report into the accident has said pictures from Canon digital camera recovered from the wreckage, along with eyewitness accounts, have helped investigators piece together what happened in the moments before the crash. A preliminary report earlier this year said the plane had hit an area of water away from the expected and standard flight path, before colliding with the water in a near-vertical position. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's (ATSB) executive director Nat Nagy said: ""With no on-board data available from the aircraft itself, transport safety investigators have been able to use witness statements and images retrieved from one of the passenger's cameras to determine what happened in the lead-up to this accident. ""The ATSB's investigation is continuing and will now look at a number of factors surrounding the pilot's health and medical history. ""We have engaged an aviation medical specialist to assist with reviewing the pilot's medical records as well as the autopsy results, which the ATSB has recently received over the past month. ""That review is now under way and we expect the results to appear from that over the coming months."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

2018-12-22,If the UK's communications regulator Ofcom sanctions RT (Russia Today) then the Kremlin could respond by targeting the BBC.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-threatens-bbc-ban-after-uks-ofcom-criticises-rt-11587705,"Both the BBC World News channel which is broadcast in Russia and its website could be affected by the response. The Russian statement follows an Ofcom ruling on Thursday that RT broadcast biased material following the poisoning in Salisbury of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, in a violation of impartiality rules. In addition to its coverage of the attempted murder, RT was also found by Ofcom to have failed to meet impartiality standards in its reports on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Ofcom said it was considering whether to impose a statutory sanction against RT for breaching those rules, which could see the Russian broadcaster's licence revoked. Responding to this criticism in a Facebook post, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that Moscow could respond in kind. The Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it would carry out checks to determine if the BBC World News channel and BBC internet sites complied with Russian law. RT receives direct funding from the Russian government, and is regularly accused of being a propaganda outlet for the Kremlin - although this is not what Ofcom determined. In contrast, although the BBC's revenues for broadcasting in the UK come through the licence fee, BBC World News, which is broadcast in Russia, is funded by subscription and advertising revenues. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Although some criticise the licence fee as a form of taxation and a way to keep the broadcaster within political control, others argue that it solves the difficult problem of funding public service broadcasting while keeping it at a crucial distance from politicians. Unlike newspapers, which the freedom of the press grants the allowance to express political opinions, all broadcasters in the UK must adhere to impartiality rules. While Ofcom's findings were against the English-language broadcaster, Russian-language television channels have also come in for criticism in recent weeks. A letter sent to Britain from the Latvian foreign ministry and seen by Sky News has warned that ""hardcore propaganda"" against the UK and its allies was being aired by two Russian-language television channels registered in London. Ofcom is investigating NTV Mir Baltic over a news programme transmitted on 2 and 3 April, almost exactly a month after the attempted assassination of Mr Skripal. Baiba Braze, the Latvian ambassador to the UK, said what she regards as disinformation put out by the channels makes the Kremlin-funded broadcaster RT look mild. ""For us Russia Today seems just like little flowers. It is not so bad,"" she said in an interview, using RT's former name. ""These TV channels, these Russian language TV channels that are broadcast into our country they are really hard-core propaganda. It is not the soft western type of Russia Today. That is why Britain should care."""

Members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) picketed for three hours on Friday at the tower and two other London sites, Hampton Court Palace and Kensington Palace. Beefeater picket line making some noise @pcs_union @M_Star_Online @TowerOfLondon pic.twitter.com/TIyWaDJNeT All three locations are managed by Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), an independent charity that looks after some of the biggest tourist attractions, including the Banqueting House, Kew Palace and Hillsborough Castle. The union is planning further three-hour walkouts on 28 December and 2 January and a separate 24-hour strike by GMB workers will take place on 8 January. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka accused HRP of making an ""unwarranted attack on our members' pensions"". About 120 staff are being moved from final salary pensions onto an ""inferior"" model, the GMB union said. ""Our members are not paid a king's ransom and the pension is one of the things that encourages people to stay in the job and deliver a first class service to the public,"" Mr Serwotka said. ""People who treasure these historic buildings in London should be left in no doubt that any disruption caused due to strike action, will be solely down to HRP's intransigence in not paying our members a decent pension."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? GMB regional organiser Michael Ainsley said in a statement: ""HRP are jumping on a bandwagon which is seeing employers engaging in a race to the bottom, ending good final salary schemes and replacing them with risky cheaper defined contribution schemes."" HRP chief executive John Barnes called the strikes ""disappointing"" and said it will not change their decision. ""We have already offered substantial compensation and transition arrangements to the 11% of our staff who are affected,"" he said. PCS and GMB members have overwhelmingly rejected the changes put forward by HRP in two consultative ballots. The tourist attractions stayed open during Friday's three-hour walkout, more of which are planned for over Christmas, but they will close on 8 January, when a 24-hour strike is scheduled."

They were arrested at about 10pm on Friday, Sussex Police said. The arrests were part of ""ongoing investigations into the criminal use of drones which has severely disrupted flights in and out of Gatwick Airport"", the force said. ""We continue to urge the public, passengers and the wider community around Gatwick to be vigilant and support us by contacting us immediately if they believe they have any information that can help us in bringing those responsible to justice,"" Superintendent James Collis added. ""The arrests we have made are a result of our determination to keep the public safe from harm. Every line of enquiry will remain open to us until we are confident that we have mitigated further threats to the safety of passengers."" He added that police are deploying tactics to ""build resilience to detect and mitigate further incursions from drones"". Many flights are still being delayed after three days of disruption, which began on Wednesday night. Hundreds of flights were grounded over the three days, and more than 100,000 Christmas travellers were affected. Services resumed on Friday morning but had to be temporarily suspended on Friday evening after another drone was spotted near the airfield just after 5pm. Flights resumed again on Friday night. By Saturday, the airport's timetables were slowly getting back to normal but long queues and some delays were still seen as airlines tries to clear the backlog. A Gatwick spokesman said: ""Broadly, things are going in the right direction. ""By the end of the weekend, things should be back to normal."" The airport had earlier said that military measures in place meant it was safe to fly. Equipment deployed to stop further drone chaos is believed to be capable of jamming signals to the rogue devices as well as tracking them. The Shorrock family from Oxford was hoping to travel to Austria for a skiing trip on Saturday. As they waited in the departures queue, Vivienne Shorrock said she was ""relieved"" to have avoided the disruption late last week. But she described the possible loss of their skiing holiday as a ""middle class problem"", adding: ""In perspective some people have suffered real losses by not getting where they want to go to be with family."" David Shorrock joked the drone drama was a ""nice distraction from Brexit"". Find out what you can claim if your flight was cancelled or delayed The airport faced a total shutdown on Thursday and part of Wednesday night when drones repeatedly violated its perimeter. Some passengers described freezing conditions as they slept on benches or on the airport floor. Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft offered a £10,000 reward for information that led to the arrest and charge of the drone operator.

2018-12-22,"Bitcoin hit its highest valuation a year ago, reaching above £15,000 on some exchanges.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/behind-the-collapse-the-real-cost-of-bitcoins-fall-from-grace-11585936,"Since then, a unit of the cryptocurrency has dropped 80% and is valued at less than £3,000. Sky News has learned that hundreds of businesses are being dragged down with Bitcoin's value, and with them mortgages and even marriages. The dreams of getting rich for some of those who spoke to Sky News were not especially virtuous or grounded in notions of productivity. Many of the Bitcoin investors recognised their own opportunism and expected the bubble would burst, and the price would eventually plummet, but they expected to sell before this happened. Others confessed to being blinded by the fear of missing out. Even if they enjoyed the casual chat about how the future of global exchange naturally lay with a decentralised currency, they just expected to get rich quick. In general, this did not happen. Analysing data from Companies House and OpenCorporates, Sky News has found that at least 340 companies related to cryptocurrencies or blockchain were dissolved or liquidated this year, compared to 139 in the previous year. More than 200 of those companies were incorporated with Companies House during 2017, when the value of Bitcoin surged 1,500% through to its peak in December. Hugh Halford-Thompson, an early cryptocurrency enthusiast and founder of several blockchain companies - who even sold Bitcoin to George Osborne when he was chancellor - told Sky News that the influx of inexperienced investors during this period had concerned him. ""We had a Bitcoin ATM that we set up in Shoreditch in a place called the Vape Lab, an e-cigarette cafe in the cool part of town. ""That was back in 2013, when the price first spiked to about £250 early in that year, and later that year spiked to £1,200."" When the December spike came round, he went abroad and didn't have access to his funds to sell them at the peak, which he describes as ""a shame"" - but even then there were other people looking to enter the market. ""There was a lot of people getting in, and I think for the first time I felt there were a large number of people who really didn't understand what they were getting into as well. ""So every Uber driver I had either had invested or was thinking about it. ""I had people asking me genuinely which coin to put their children's university funds into. That's not good. ""I didn't follow up with them, but I hope they didn't,"" Mr Halford-Thompson added. ""For the first time a lot of normal people who didn't understand investments [were getting involved, and they] made or lost money in fairly big ways. ""It's a lot worse when it's the general public."" It seemed like a gold rush - until the price began to sink. ""There was a lot of people trying to work out how they can get in four days before the big crash,"" Mr Halford-Thompson said. ""I saw a lot of companies get involved when the hype was building. There are a lot of issues in that whole sector. ""What you've had since the crash is a clean-out of the companies that don't really have much and probably shouldn't have been there in the first place."" Bitcoin shed half of its peak value by March 2018 and has continued to fall, a fall matched by an increase in the number of companies being dissolved. By June, Bitcoin was less than a third of its peak value, and an average of one company was being dissolved every day. Since then Bitcoin's value has continued to sink to less than a fifth of its peak value, and 60% of the 340 companies dissolved in 2018 ceased operations between June and November. For the first time, the number of newly-registered companies is growing more slowly than the number of dissolved businesses. Speaking to small business owners and investors, one particular tragedy stood out as typical. Married men accessed equity through their family homes, and often - whether because they felt they needed to act quickly to make the most money, or because they feared that their investment would be criticised by their spouses - did so without informing their families, only to see the value of their assets evaporate, followed by their homes. One man told Sky News he lost his marriage and remortgaged his home after he defaulted on loans he had used to invest in cryptocurrencies. He said he wished he had never heard of Bitcoin. He and many other investors and businesses declined to be identified in this article, explaining that they feared mockery from friends and relatives. Over the course of 2017, enthusiasts began ploughing as much cash as they could into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because customers were becoming increasingly interested in them. When the prices dropped and customers grew sparse, many businesses cut their losses and dissolved. Maybe they didn't exit at the peak, but some came away from the wild ride with a bit of extra cash. One small business owner told Sky News he wasn't quite ready to dissolve his business. Despite his losses, he hoped his experience would be of benefit to potential customers - although he wasn't prepared to identify himself or his business. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Last December, the interest in Bitcoin seemed divorced from any knowledge about the technology underpinning it - other than the name. Shares in an unprofitable company called Long Island Iced Tea soared up to 289% when it renamed itself Long Blockchain - although that company was subsequently de-listed from the Nasdaq stock, and has now been issued with a subpoena by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. How times have changed. Of the businesses which haven't been dissolved, Sky News has found more than 50 which have changed their names to no-longer reference Bitcoin, blockchain, or cryptocurrencies. The chief executive of one business said this was because opening a bank account with one of those words in the company name proved a nightmare - although Sky News identified hundreds of other businesses with similar titles."
2018-12-22,A British drugs kingpin has been jailed over a plot to smuggle 1.3 tonnes of cocaine with a street value of 240 million euro (£216m) into France.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/british-drugs-kingpin-robert-dawes-jailed-for-216m-cocaine-smuggling-plot-11588551,"Robert Dawes was described by the National Crime Agency (NCA) as ""one of the most influential and feared organised criminals in Europe"" after he was sentenced to 22 years on Friday. The 46-year-old, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, was convicted of drug trafficking offences after the cocaine was found stashed in 20 suitcases on an Air France flight from Venezuela to Paris in 2013. Dawes, who denied the charges, was heard in secret recordings bragging to a member of a Colombian cartel about his involvement in smuggling the drugs from Venezuela's capital Caracas. He was arrested in 2015 when officers swooped on his mansion in Benalmadena, a town in the Costa del Sol, Spain, where they found guns, cash and encrypted phones, the NCA said. His network was said to span Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia, using corruption, violence and intimidation to exert control, while his associates are suspected of shootings and murders in the UK and abroad. Dawes was accused of buying large amounts of drugs from Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia, which is thought to run much of Europe's cocaine trade from Calabria. He was extradited to France shortly after his arrest and tried by five judges who ordered him and four accomplices to pay a 30 million euro (£27m) fine. In his final statement at the Paris court hearing on Friday, Dawes said: ""I continue to claim my innocence."" Dawes had hoped to get the recording of him dismissed on legal grounds, but a document submitted by his defence team in support of that claim turned out to be a forgery. He told the court his claims in the video were ""just a made-up story"" intended to provoke the police into arresting him so that he could prove his innocence. Following his conviction, Dawes was told he would have to serve at least 15 years without the chance of parole. The discovery of the cocaine in 2013 caused a stir in Venezuela after a government minister admitted the suitcases had gone through security scanners that had clearly showed the presence of drugs. Venezuelan police arrested 25 people, including members of the military and an Air France manager, over the incident. After Dawes' sentencing, NCA deputy director Matt Horne said: ""Dawes was one of the most significant organised criminals in Europe with a network that literally spanned the globe. ""Dawes was prepared to use extreme levels of violence in order to further his reputation and take retribution against those who crossed him. ""Members or associates of his criminal group are known to have been involved in intimidation, shootings and murders."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you?"

""They castrated him and now my son's future life has dramatically changed."" The boy's mother said it was ""absolutely horrible"" what the surgeons had done.

Feeling very nauseous tonight as a result and a bit teary. Chemicals, huh? Still, getting there. And the cats brought me a lot of joy today. Also, dreading Christmas. Tough time for a lot of people. As Lee spoke to Chris, who was slurring and incoherent at times, he offered words of reassurance. ""Chris, I love you brother, you deserve better than this,"" Lee said.

A fatal shooting on 18 December in Enfield brought the number of people violently killed in the capital to 130. Twice this year, on 20 February and 15 April, three people were fatally attacked on the same day. The year's two bloodiest months, February and March, saw 16 and 21 people die. Elizabeth Ogunsola will spend her Christmas this year at the grave of her 18-year-old brother. Israel was stabbed to death in east London this April. He died 30 minutes after he was attacked, despite efforts from the emergency services. The arms of a policewoman who tried to save the young man were described by a witness as ""literally covered in blood"". ""The day he died, was the worse day of my life,"" Ms Ogunsola told Sky News. ""I was at home with my daughter and received a phone call saying my brother had been attacked and that there is a possibility he has died."" She rang and rang her brother's phone, hoping he would pick up. ""The day still seems like a blur, all I knew was that I wasn't myself after that whilst still trying to keep my composure because of my daughter. Our lives will never be the same again,"" she said. Israel, whom Ms Ogunsola described as ""an amazing smart boy who was extremely talented"" and a football lover who was scouted by Arsenal, was the 54th violent death in the capital in 2018. ""The events of his death have left us all traumatised,"" she said, adding that her family will be praying for him this Christmas. Ms Ogunsola is thankful for the efforts put in by the emergency services, saying: ""They were amazing, everyone who came to his aid tried all they can to save his life but he just couldn't hold on."" But she hits out at the government's approach to knife crime in the capital, calling it ""very, very relaxed"" and that stop and search targets ""specific type of ethnic minority. It's ridiculous"". Sky News has tracked every person murdered in the capital :: What does the Met say? The Metropolitan Police has confirmed there were 129 killings between January - November 2018, the last full month that data is available for. Compared with 2011, the number of murders in London during this same period has risen by 24% - from 104 to 129. The number of people killed in the capital between January and November in 2018 has risen by nearly 5% from the same period last year, from 123 to 129. The Met's official monthly data release, which may not take into account deaths that may have been reclassified as murders at a date after publication, states there have been 123 homicides from January to November 2018. According to this data, the boroughs of Greenwich and Southwark registered the highest homicide rate, with three people killed per 100,000 population. Bexley, Harrow and Sutton were the safest, with no offences recorded in 2018. Select each area on the map below to find out more information. In response to Sky News' analysis, a spokesperson for the Met Police said: ""Any homicide is one too many, and violence in London has claimed too many lives this year. ""Our thoughts are with all the victims' families and loved ones who show incredible strength in the face of the most devastating tragedy imaginable. Their assistance and support of the police investigation is invaluable."" The spokesperson added that the force is ""committed to reducing violent crime"" and said that since a spike in numbers between February and May homicide rates have begun to ""stabilise"". They said: ""We have increased our police enforcement, putting more officers on the streets, including the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce, and continue to be relentless in our pursuit of those who choose to be violent."" The Met says that since launching the taskforce, around 2,380 people have been arrested and many of those have been jailed - in addition to the investigations undertaken by local police and specialist crime detectives. Community-driven initiatives are also under way in a bid to find a long-term solution to tackling violent crime, the Met said. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has been under fire for the high figures seen in 2018. Mr Khan acknowledged the ""unacceptable"" rise, but claimed he is limited thanks to government cuts. He told Sky News: ""My number one priority is to keep Londoners safe, and it's unacceptable to see a rise in violent crime in London and across the country. ""We know the causes of violent crime are extremely complex and years in the making, further compounded by years of government cuts to policing and vital preventative services."" Mr Khan said he is leading a ""public health approach to tackling the root causes of violence"", alongside the Violent Crime Taskforce and investment in preventative measures. ""But I am having to do this with one hand behind my back because the government has refused to reverse the £850m of hugely damaging savings the Met has been required to make."" :: How does London compare to England and Wales? Homicides across England and Wales rose by 14% in the year to June 2018, according to the most recently available data from the Office for National Statistics. It grew from 630 in 2017 to 719 - the highest number since 2008, when 775 people were killed. Of the homicides between June 2017 to July 2018, 20% of them happened in London. London makes up 15% of England and Wales's population. When the rate of murders is compared - London is only the fifth highest in the country. Greater Manchester has 2.7 murders per 100,000 people, compared to London's 1.7 per 100,000. Sussex, at 2.1, Warwickshire, at 2.0, and Cheshire, at 1.8, are also above London. :: What about Scotland? Official figures published in October show that between the financial years of April 2016 - March 2017 and 2017 - 2018, the number of homicide cases decreased by 5% from 62 to 59. Police Scotland report that ""this is the joint lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single twelve-month period since 1976, the first year for which comparable data are available"". :: Snapshots across England and Wales  Sky News asked a handful of police forces to declare the number of homicides that have taken place this year in their area from January to 30 October. According to Freedom of Information requests: :: South Wales Police recorded seven homicides, which works out at 0.5 people per 100,000 of the population. :: West Midlands Police report 42 homicides, which works out at 1.5 per 100,000 of the population. :: Greater Manchester Police, report 47 murders, which works out at 1.7 per 100,000 of the population. Victim Support is an independent charity which works with the bereaved, as well as victims and witnesses of crime. Chief officer Diana Fawcett told Sky News that 2018 had seen an ""unprecedented"" number of cases. She said: ""We work closely with families bereaved by murder and manslaughter through our national Homicide Service and this year has been unprecedented in the number of cases we have dealt with, particularly in the capital, driven by the increase in violent attacks. ""Too many lives are destroyed and communities shattered by these violent crimes. This isn't just a police problem but society's problem - the only way to stop this is a joined up approach with all agencies and organisations working together."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are working to tackle violent crime and its devastating consequences through our Serious Violence Strategy, which puts a greater focus on early intervention, alongside strong enforcement. ""The strategy is also enabling a more coordinated approach involving a range of agencies, including the police, community groups, local authorities, education, health. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""Our brave police officers are essential to this effort, which is why we last week announced an increase to police funding of up to £970m, the most substantial increase since 2010."" :: Sky News is not including the murders of Abdi Ali, who is thought to have been killed in December 2017 but was found in 2018, Kyall Parnell, 17, who died on New Year's Eve but the crime was recorded the following day; and Henry Vincent, 37, whose killing was classed as self-defence. Sky News tracked the number of killings recorded in the press or released on the Met police's website, and dated the incidents according to the day of the attack."

The operation lasted around 25 minutes and no one on board was injured. Essex Police said the vessel was taken to the Port of Tilbury and four men were arrested under the Immigration Act when the ship docked just after 4.20am this morning. Officers boarded the 236-metre long cargo ship, called the Grande Tema, shortly after 11pm last night. Its operator, Grimaldi Lines, had earlier reported that four stowaways armed with iron bars had called for the crew to navigate closer to the coast. The company's spokesman Paul Kyprianou told Sky News: ""The vessel was coming from Nigeria... They managed to escape from the cabin and started threatening the crew, requesting to have the vessel navigate very close to the coast. ""We understand they wanted to jump and reach the British coast."" He added that the crew locked themselves in the bridge of the vessel after the migrants had picked up potentially harmful objects. ""They managed to get whatever they could find on the vessel... pieces of iron, tubes and things like that and this is what they used in order to threaten,"" Mr Kyprianou said. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The stowaways were found on the ship five days ago and were given food and water and placed in a cabin. They became threatening on Friday morning as the vessel travelled eastwards through the English Channel. Maritime navigational tracking sites showed the vessel circling around a position north east of Margate in Kent. Essex Police said they were not treating the incident as a ""hostage, piracy or terror-related""."

We Built This City… On Sausage Rolls takes the 1985 Starship track and replaces the original ""rock and roll"" lyrics with… you've guessed it: sausage rolls. LadBaby took the coveted number one spot from Grande's thank u, next and Ava Max's Sweet But Psycho, which had been tipped to win after an early lead. The 31-year-old recorded the song with his wife Roxanne and their two sons, who appear in the video, and proceeds will go to The Trussell Trust, which supplies food banks. Music experts think they have cracked the perfect recipe for a number one, including how many beats per minute the song should be In a message to those who bought the single, Hoyle told OfficialCharts.com: ""Thank you everybody in the UK who has got [the song] to the top. ""I can't thank you enough, not only for downloading the song but for raising money for such an incredible charity. ""I'm honestly speechless and lost for words. Thank you so much."" We Built This City sold 75,000 combined sales in the last week, of which 93% were downloads, according to the Official Charts Company. It shifted 18,500 more units than Max's Sweet But Psycho, which came in second, with thank u, next - last week's number one - dropping to number three. It has been viewed more than a million times on YouTube - compared with Grande's 193 million. Before the winner was announced, Hoyle appeared on Sky News's Sunrise show, saying he hoped the song had made people smile. ""My passion for sausage rolls has been a long-running theme so it was the natural choice,"" he said of his subject. Hoyle set his blog up two years ago, saying at the time he had been close to using food banks himself. He now has almost half a million subscribers on YouTube and millions of followers on Facebook. ""It's amazing and if I can keep people laughing that's the main thing,"" he said. We Built This City is the first novelty song to become Christmas number one since Bob The Builder's Can We Fix It? in 2000. Mariah Carey's perennial festive hit All I Want For Christmas Is You took fourth place - as it did last year - while Halsey's Without You placed fifth. Last Christmas by Wham! re-entered at seven, while Grande featured a second time with her most recent single, Imagine, charting at number eight. The Pogues' Fairytale Of New York charted at 11, Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? took 13th place, and Michael Buble's It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas claimed number 16. On the Christmas albums chart, the cast recording of The Greatest Showman scored a festive number one and its 23rd non-consecutive week at the top with its strongest ever week of sales, despite being released in December last year. The recording has not exited the top five once this year and went five times platinum this week, according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

The graphic image has been released by police as Erick Ekam, 19, was being sentenced at the Old Bailey for murder. The court had heard how Ekam, who was described by police as ""wicked"" and ""dangerous"", stabbed Mr Mohamed in the back after a brief confrontation. Mr Mohamed ran away and collapsed in the street in front of a plain clothes police officer, who witnessed the attack and gave chase. Details of Mr Mohamed's brother's death cannot be reported on at this stage for legal reasons. Their mother, Fowsioa Abdi, said: ""There are really no words in existence that accurately describe or quantify the pain and grief that the murder of our son has left us to bear. ""Mohamed was ripped from the hearts of four other siblings that day, a father, mother, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandmas and friends, all of whom he shared a unique individual relationship with. ""He was a young man with great ambitions and life goals. He had invincible confidence and would often say 'Just wait 'til I'm older and see what I achieve'. ""Losing a loved one is painful enough, but to hear and see the way in which he was so swiftly taken away from us makes the pain indescribable.

2018-12-22,City banker Zahid Naseem has been jailed for at least 19 years for murdering Christina Abbotts on her 29th birthday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/city-banker-jailed-for-at-least-19-years-for-murdering-woman-with-a-pestle-11587803,"In a killing fuelled by cocaine and champagne, Naseem, 48, struck Ms Abbotts 13 times on the back of the head with a ceramic pestle. The financial consultant claimed he acted in self-defence, saying he feared he was being strangled to death in a sex game gone wrong. The pair were last seen in public on the evening of 24 May this year, before spending the night together. Friends became worried when Ms Abbotts failed to turn up to her birthday party in South Kensington the next day. Police found her dead in her bed when they broke down the door of her flat in Crawley, West Sussex, in the early hours of 26 May. She died from blunt force trauma and manual strangulation, having been hit on the head 13 times with a pestle. She had bruises around her neck where she had been strangled, and upwards of 30 defensive wounds, bruising to her hands and back of her forearms. Police discovered Naseem pretending to be unconscious in the next room. A video showing Naseem lying on a sofa naked apart from a dressing gown, surrounded by half-drunk glasses of alcohol, drugs paraphernalia and underwear has been shared by Sussex Police. Paramedics were convinced he was play-acting and when he was arrested in hospital he claimed to have no idea what had happened. He also claimed he could not remember the incident when he was interviewed by police, but admitted hitting Ms Abbotts when speaking in court. He claimed it was in self-defence and that a ""red mist"" may have come over him. Prosecutor Christopher Tehrani dismissed it as a ""pack of lies"", telling him he carried on ""relentlessly"" during the ""savage"" attack. He said Naseem had stayed in the flat for 12 hours after her death - drinking, taking drugs and sending pornographic pictures and videos to other escorts. Ms Abbotts, who was born in the West Midlands, was described in court as a ""socialite"" who led a party lifestyle in London. She had discreetly advertised her services on site AdultWork.com under the pseudonym Tilly Pexton, although her family believed she worked in IT. Naseem, a freelance risk management consultant, was working for Toronto-Dominion Bank's London office when he found her profile, which offered overnight rates from £1,000. He told the court he began using escorts when the ""whirlwind romance"" with his partner fizzled out and they grew distant. He hired sex workers, drank alcohol on an almost daily basis and took cocaine for about 10 years. He told the court such behaviour was common in London's financial district. Naseem's lawyer said his client: ""had begun more and more to seek solace in the company of escorts and sex workers... And his addictions to alcohol, drugs and sex became an insatiable craving to fulfil his needs."" The father of two young children, who lives in a £600,000 home in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, earned up to £250,000 a year and had previously worked for investment bank Merrill Lynch. The jury at Lewes Crown Court found him guilty of murder after four hours of deliberations. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The parents of Ms Abbotts paid tribute to their ""loving, caring"" daughter and said the picture painted of her in court did not fully reflect who she was and that she ""held many legitimate jobs in estate agency and events"". ""She is not here to defend herself in this case and the way she has been portrayed does not reflect and define our Christina,"" they said in a statement. Her father said: ""I was hoping one day to walk her down the aisle. She would have been such a beautiful bride. Instead we had to take her in a coffin."""

The builder's partner, Trisha Fairhurst, and her niece, Louise, pressed him to check through them after he spent weeks working through a spate of particularly cold and wet winter days. ""Trisha kept telling me to check the tickets, and her niece Louise, who I was building an extension for, was also in on it once she'd heard about the unclaimed prize in the news,"" he said. ""It was something of a standing joke that I had all these tickets while there was a local prize outstanding, so for weeks they were on at me to check."" Reflecting on finding the winning ticket, he said: ""It almost feels like some magical Christmas story, the man who nearly lost £76m! ""For all our family, I’m very pleased that Trisha and Louise nagged me to check those tickets!"" Self-employed Mr Clark won a £76,369,806.80 EuroMillions jackpot. It is the 12th biggest win ever in the UK. Recalling the evening he found the ticket, Mr Clark said: ""It was about 8pm and we were watching telly when Louise reminded me again about the tickets. ""I finally gave in, got the bundle out of the van and started to work my way through them, methodically from the oldest to the most recent, starting with Lotto, before moving onto my EuroMillions tickets. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""You might say I was slightly winding up Louise but I certainly didn't expect the wind up to end with me saying 'I've done it, I've won £76M' - I won't say what she said in response!"" Mr Clark called up his partner, who he has been with for four years, to tell her they'd won. Ms Fairhurst said: ""I'd just got back from work and was settling in for a quiet evening when Andrew called and said, 'You know that £76M, well I've just won it.' ""Obviously I didn't believe a word of it, even when my niece came on the phone to say it was true I still couldn't take it in. ""It started to seem real when he called back and said, 'Honestly, it's real, so start looking for a mansion' - bang went my quiet evening, I didn't sleep a wink!"" The winning ticket was bought from Eastwood Road Post Office in Boston and the winning EuroMillions numbers from the draw on 2 November were 5, 15, 17, 37, 44, and Lucky Stars 7 and 11."
2018-12-22,It will be a festive political break like no other. Teams of civil servants will be charged with spending millions preparing legislation and further contingency plans to prepare for a historic hard break from the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-festive-break-like-no-other-lies-ahead-as-parliament-kicks-can-into-next-year-11586296,"It's a prospect the government says it wants to avoid and a clear Commons majority suggest they will try to veto it. When the political narrative from the prime minister is that MPs have work to do in order to come up with a Brexit compromise, taking 18 days off, while the civil service beavers away, is not a great look, and during this break there will be pressure for an early return from recess. But above all, Theresa May hopes that some time at home with family and constituents will refocus the minds of over 100 of her own MPs and the DUP, and leave them with a post-advent open mind. Her job - or at least that of her top negotiator, Oliver Robbins - is to return from Brussels with a legally binding addendum that makes clear that if the backstop becomes permanent, the UK can exercise rights to leave unilaterally. But there is little evidence that the EU are talking right now or if it will do so over the Christmas break. Indeed, the very real doubts that the prime minister encountered at last week's Brussels summit were not necessarily just about the idea of a legally binding reassurance over the backstop. There was a fundamental doubt that there would be any point trying to offer such a concession to a leader who did not even dare call the vote she had promised she could pass. Such a concession might be better saved until the vote is actually lost, was the thinking. And indeed, any concession would require Dublin's active consent. The message Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar gave to me in Brussels was that he thought if the Commons does not want to pass this deal, the backstop is here to stay, and Mrs May should ponder seeking the delay of, or revoking entirely, the Article 50 notice. The Labour leadership too is playing for time. You don't have to employ a lipreader to see an opposition unwilling to use its most potent weapon of a full Commons no confidence vote and unable to take full advantage of the current tumult. Over the past year, the Labour leadership has been been squeezed by its membership and shadow cabinet to move at a glacial pace towards more of a Remain position. But over Christmas and into the New Year, there will be no hiding place. Jeremy Corbyn will have to come off the fence in the first half of January on the referendum coveted by many of his supporters. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? As the Labour leader told me in Lisbon earlier this month, his supporters who sport ""Love Corbyn Hate Brexit"" tote bags ""are not wrong"". We are on the cusp of momentous events that could properly split both major parties, see widespread economic and diplomatic turmoil, and lead rapidly to another major national poll of some description within months. When push came to shove parliament decided to kick the can into January. Christmas recess is a brief pause before that road officially runs out. A festive truce appears to have started, but there is little sign of the Christmas compromise the prime minister needs."
2018-12-22,"Christmas trees could make some people ill because of the way they react when in contact with central heating, experts have warned. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/mould-spores-in-your-christmas-tree-could-make-you-ill-experts-warn-11574381,"Asthma sufferers and people with certain allergies are at risk of having attacks because, once inside a heated area, the trees give off thousands of mould spores. These are created naturally by pine trees but in warm environments their production increases rapidly to the point where they could trigger an allergic reaction. Dr Helen Cox, a consultant in paediatric allergy and immunology, said: ""Certainly I have had people in my clinic who have said that their symptoms started when the Christmas tree arrived and went away when the tree came down."" She added: ""The mould spores can cause asthma attacks in those who are allergic to them."" However, Dr Cox cautioned that when an asthma attack or other allergic reaction appears to be caused by a Christmas tree, there is often an underlying viral infection. More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? In a recent study, researchers in Connecticut found the mould count from a live Christmas tree rose to five times the normal level two weeks after the tree was brought indoors. The study found that the mould spore count rose from 800 per square metre for the first three days to a maximum of 5,000 per square metre by day 14. Normal spore counts are less than 1,000 per square metre. The apparently obvious answer - to switch to a plastic tree - also has drawbacks, experts said. Amena Warner, head of clinical services at Allergy UK, warned that because they are often stored uncovered in lofts, they ""can be covered in dust and dust mites can also set off asthma attacks"". She added: ""Few people wrap up their Christmas trees and decorations properly to prevent them being covered in dust."" Ms Warner also said food allergies can set off reactions. Sometimes a bad response to types of food may be the underlying cause of an allergic reaction which is then exacerbated by a tree's mould spores. Dr Cox and Ms Warner advised asthma sufferers to make sure their inhalers will last the holiday period and Dr Cox said having the flu jab offers the best chance of avoiding catching a virus."
2018-12-22,Sarah Garghan-Watson and her family group of nine arrived at Gatwick expecting to fly to Lanzarote for a sun-kissed Christmas.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/mums-heartbreaking-night-at-gatwick-amid-drone-chaos-11587996,"Instead they were stranded for around 24 hours, eventually taking off on Friday morning after rogue drones grounded flights. She made a video diary as her three children (two aged five and one aged 10) were forced to sleep under the stairs in the terminal. Her two parents, both in their 80s, are shown trying to get some rest in their wheelchairs. We first heard from Ms Garghan-Watson via a WhatsApp message at 1.45pm on Thursday, by which time she had already been there for nearly six hours. She said: ""Stuck at Gatwick departure. Flight MT1002. Lanzarote. ""First family holiday as a group of 9 with 3 kids all irritated at lack of info. Not even giving out water! I don't believe a few drones are responsible for all this chaos!"" At 10pm, she began her diary by filming the makeshift bed for her three children under the staircase. She said they had received little or no help from airport officials, who only sent one email apologising and were unable to provide blankets when the terminal became cold. Their tour operator, Thomas Cook, gave them some prepaid £10 vouchers to spend on whatever they might - but shops said they were blank and turned them away. Three hours later, at 1am, she filmed one of her children awake in his sleeping bag who said he could not sleep because it was ""too bright and too loud"". She complained about how there were ""plenty of staff"" but ""nobody has even asked us if we want any water, anything at all"". At 2am, looking tired and weary, Ms Garghan-Watson made her final entry, saying the terminal was still ""very bright, very noisy and also very cold"". ""I have asked if there is anywhere to get blankets from, but apparently not. You can't buy them and there is nowhere you can borrow them from. So it's still very frustrating here at Gatwick."" At around 4am, she said she could ""feel the tension rising again"" in the terminal. ""It is honestly heartbreaking when your child tells you they're cold, and you can't warm them, buy or borrow a blanket from anywhere. Massive sense of mum guilt, I feel so useless we are stuck here."" More than a hundred thousand Christmas travellers were affected by the airport's closure, in what was the biggest disruption at Gatwick for years The origin of the drones, which were first spotted on Wednesday evening, is still unknown."

In an interview with the Guardian, he said it would be a ""matter for the party to decide"" Labour's position on a second EU referendum after facing calls from some of his own MPs to back a People's Vote. But he added: ""My proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners."" From Cameron's pledge to May's deal: Sky News looks at the story of Brexit so far Mr Corbyn also attacked the EU over its rules on state aid and competition. He said: ""I think the state aid rules do need to be looked at again, because quite clearly, if you want to regenerate an economy, as we would want to do in government, then I don't want to be told by somebody else that we can't use state aid in order to be able to develop industry in this country."" Mr Corbyn said he was ""extremely angry"" during heated exchanges at prime minister's questions last Wednesday when he appeared to call Theresa May a ""stupid woman"". He insists he said ""stupid people"", not ""stupid woman"", despite a team of lip readers telling Sky News he ""clearly"" used the latter phrase. Addressing criticism from Tory MPs over the alleged remark, Mr Corbyn told the Guardian: ""It's interesting their sudden concern about these matters. Where is their concern about the homeless people of this country?""

Former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, who was sacked from government by Mrs May in 2016, has said the prime minister made a ""massive mistake"" in adopting her ""Brexit means Brexit"" motto when she entered 10 Downing Street. Claiming Remain-supporting Mrs May ""had to prove her Brexit credentials"", he said: ""That was essentially a massive mistake by the Conservative administration, which it was punished for at the general election because the Conservative Party decided to embrace the Brexit result in such a way as to essentially dismiss the views of those who voted Remain, treat them as saboteurs or traitors, and run against urban Britain."" Mr Osborne, who now edits London's Evening Standard newspaper, claimed the chance of another general election in 2019 is ""an under-reported likelihood"" due to it being ""the simplest way to solve political impasses"" over Brexit. Having quit as an MP last year, Mr Osborne said that if he had stayed in parliament he would now have to be ""going along with a whole load of things which I profoundly disagree with"", such as putting the military on standby to deal with the possible consequences of a ""no-deal"" Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Of course I think 'perhaps I should have stayed' and I could have been part of this melee in the Conservative Party at the moment. ""I would have essentially tried to steer a) the country away from the rocks to which it is heading at the moment and b) the Conservative Party away from a prolonged period of opposition, which is where I think it is heading unless it engages more with modern Britain."""
2018-12-22,The US government has entered a partial shutdown after Republicans in the Senate failed to secure the votes needed to approve $5bn demanded by Donald Trump for a border wall.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181222084220/https://news.sky.com/story/partial-shutdown-of-us-government-looms-after-spending-deal-fails-11588566,"Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials were on Capitol Hill late on Friday night trying to broker a compromise over funding for the wall on the Mexico border, which is staunchly opposed by Democrats. Without a deal, funding for around 25% of the government expired at midnight (5am GMT). Nine cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including homeland security, transportation, interior, agriculture, state and justice, will be affected by the shutdown. Mr Trump had said any impending shutdown could last ""a very long time"" as he blamed Democrats over the failure to agree a deal on spending. Earlier this week he said: ""This is our only chance that we'll ever have, in my opinion, because of the world and the way it breaks out, to get great border security."" But on Friday, he stressed he hoped the shutdown would not last long. In a video on his Twitter account he said: ""We're going to have a shutdown. There's nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes."" Democrats will take control of the House in January, and oppose major funding for construction of any wall along the border with Mexico. Congress had been on track to fund the government, but changed direction when Mr Trump - after criticism from conservative supporters - declared he would not sign a bill if it did not include billions to fund the wall. He said: ""We're totally prepared for a very long shutdown,"" adding there was strong support for border security ""the barrier, wall or steel slats - it's all the same"". Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told the Senate: ""President Trump has thrown a temper tantrum and now has us careening towards a 'Trump shutdown' over Christmas. ""You're not getting the wall today, next week or on 3 January, when Democrats take control of the House."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? A partial government shutdown would see staff at affected agencies limited to those deemed ""essential"" to public safety. Those workers, including US border agents, would not get paid until the dispute was resolved. The wall was a key promise during Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign, which he insisted would be paid for by Mexico. It comes amid tension in Washington following Mr Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which prompted the resignation of defence secretary Jim Mattis."

Ms Markle and her father, Thomas Markle Snr, have made several public appearances and appeals to speak with his estranged daughter, who married Prince Harry in Windsor in May. Mr Markle was due to walk Meghan down the aisle, but did not come to Britain after suffering health problems. He had also been found to have staged paparazzi pictures around his hometown. The Sunday Mirror published a picture of the card which read: ""Holidays are a time for family and are sentimental. ""Dad has been trying to contact you and is very hurt because you are avoiding him.   ""Life is short and you know Dad is wonderful. Please give him joy in his last years by showing you love him. The time is now."" Mr Markle made another appearance on Good Morning Britain earlier this week, in which he said he hoped he and the duchess would be speaking again soon. Ms Markle, a paternal half-sister of Meghan, told the Sunday Mirror of their childhood Christmases, spent watching Christmas shows together and helping to cook the dinner. She insisted she loves her sister but said she does not agree with ""the way she's behaving"". The Markle family say Meghan and Prince Harry have not spoken to them in six months.   While Meghan's father is not paid for his public appeals and interviews urging reconciliation with his daughter, Ms Markle was reportedly paid more than £1,000 per appearance when news of her half-sister's engagement and wedding emerged throughout the last year. The card comes amid rumours of an internal Royal Family rift as well, with the Sussexes and the Cambridges said to have a ""strained relationship"" since the wedding in May. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? All four will be at Sandringham House with the Queen on Christmas Day, though Harry and Meghan are understood not to be staying with the Cambridges at their home in Anmer Hall, two miles away, despite being there last year. The Mail On Sunday reports pregnant Meghan and Harry will stay in the main home, despite it being a tight squeeze for all the guests. Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, is also said to have turned down an invitation to join the royals in Norfolk, opting instead to have Christmas in Los Angeles."

The Saturday before Christmas is meant to be the most lucrative day of the year and normally means a 20% increase in footfall as shoppers move away from online purchasing and on to the high street. However, with many shops providing heavy discounts of up to 70%, the amount they will earn is likely to be down overall compared to last year. After last weekend's washout because of Storm Deirdre many stores are relying even more on Super Saturday than they normally would. More than 100,000 shoppers were expected at the Metro Centre in Gateshead, one of Europe's biggest shopping centres, but it was not as busy as predicted. Sam, who was hoping for some last minute bargains at the Metro Centre, told Sky News: ""I was expecting it to be heaving, heaps and heaps of people, I didn't think I'd be able to get around the shops. ""But it's pretty quiet, I'm really surprised."" His friend, Gareth, added: ""We were expecting a heavy traffic jam to get here but there wasn't anything, a real surprise. ""It was busier last year but there are loads of sales this year. ""It kind of makes you question whether there's any point in going to the Boxing Day Sales because you may as well just get it now."" Last year Christmas fell on a Monday so retailers are hoping the ""bonus day"" after the weekend will be as busy as Sunday, which is usually busy but not as popular as Saturday. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Sky News reporter Frazer Maude, in Gateshead, said: ""At the moment it's not looking like it will be as super as the retailers hoped it would be."" Britain's retailers have been hit hard this year, with several large companies entering administration, including House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, which were both bought by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley. Toys R Us UK, Poundworld and electronic retailer Maplin also fell into administration, while New Look, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams announced store closures."

She spoke out after a visit to a homeless centre to urge her fans and young people to be ""more conscious"" that someone on the street is ""another human being"". ""Interaction is such an important thing,"" Goulding said, adding that Christmas is when many people feel ""the most vulnerable and lonely"". :: Homelessness in Britain 'at record high' Crisis estimates more than 170,000 families and individuals in the UK are experiencing the worst forms of homelessness. That includes people living on the streets, those who sofa-surf and sleep in cars and on public transport. Goulding said that people who see someone on the street should give ""anything you can offer them, an umbrella or a blanket or coat"". ""But just that exchange and taking the time to stop and talk to someone, ask their name - sometimes they might not want to talk but if they do, do that,"" she added. ""Obviously, change and food does help too, but honestly, taking the time to show that you've noticed them... So many get ignored."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Goulding also called on ministers to do more. ""Really it does need to come from the top, from the Government,"" she said. ""There needs to be more of a political force."" It comes after new figures showed the number of homeless deaths rose by almost a quarter over the last five years. Some 597 people sleeping rough or in emergency accommodation were estimated to have died last year in England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics said. That represents a 24% leap from 2013. A homeless man also died outside parliament this week. Police have not named the man, but among the flowers and candles placed at the scene of his collapse is a piece of paper with ""Gyula Remes 1975-2018"" written on it."
2018-12-23,"When fake news goes viral, who better to fight it than a virologist?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181223215045/https://news.sky.com/story/meet-the-doctor-curing-fake-news-italian-wages-twitter-war-against-anti-vaxxers-11584301,"The anti-vaxx hoax, which claims that life-saving vaccines actually cause autism in children, has spread in Italy - and beyond - in recent years, causing a drastic increase in the number of parents who refuse to protect their kids from deadly diseases. Waging a Twitter war against conspiracy theories, a 56-year-old doctor has become an unlikely celebrity in Italy, perhaps even a future political figure. Roberto Burioni doesn't mince words, which is part of his appeal. ""I don't mind being curt with those who spend five minutes on Google and want to teach me about virology, which I have studied for 35 years,"" he told Sky News in an interview. ""Science is no democracy."" Anti-vaxxers are ""idiots"" and ""fools,"" he writes on Twitter, and children of anti-vaxxers should not be admitted to public school. To those who dispute medical advances, he says: ""Go have a root canal without anaesthetics"". To his supporters, he is the voice of reason seeking to reassert science over ignorance: almost 450,000 people follow his Facebook page, almost as many like it. On Twitter, he has 76,600 followers and his books - the latest one called Balle Mortali (Deadly Lies) - are bestsellers in Italy. But to his enemies, he is an arrogant man whose aggressive tone only stifles debate. Conspiracy theorists say he is in cahoots with Big Pharma. On social media, he has been called a fascist, a Satan worshipper, and plenty of obscene things, too. He has even received death threats, directed both towards him and towards his seven-year-old daughter, he said. ""It's incredible, troubling really,"" he says. ""It's like being threatened for saying smoking is bad for your health."" Italy was a perfect cauldron for anti-vaxx myths. After centuries of political instability, many Italians harbour suspicion about any official claim. And the current government, a coalition of the populist 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League, has been ambiguous at best toward vaccinations. Matteo Salvini, the country's deputy prime minister, has said a set of 10 mandatory vaccinations are ""useless and in many cases dangerous"". However, the government has maintained the mandatory vaccinations law, rolling back on plans to scrap the measure. In Italy, cases of measles jumped from a little over 250 in 2015 to over 5,000 last year. For the first nine months of 2018, the number of recorded cases stood at almost 2,300. In 2010, the vaccination coverage stood at 90.6% but over the following years that decreased to 85.2 % in 2015. Now it has ticked up again to 87.3%. The anti-vaxx movement goes well beyond Italy. Public Health England saw a spike in the number of laboratory-confirmed measles cases - from 259 last year to 913 for the first nine months of this year. And while it stresses the outbreak is under control, it has advised the public to ensure that both doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine are given. In England 87% of children receive two doses, short of the 95% target. And it was a British-born former doctor, Andrew Wakefield, who falsely linked the MMR vaccination to autism in a now-retracted 1998 study. The research has since been fully discredited and withdrawn from the Lancet medical journal, and Mr Wakefield has had his medical licence revoked. But false information circulates and flourishes on the internet, fuelling the movement of anti-vaxxers, in many cases linked to populist movements. The World Health Organisation warned last month that measles is on the rise around the world, especially in Europe and Latin America, in part because parents shun vaccines. Some 173,000 measles cases were officially reported worldwide in 2017, a jump of more than 30% from the previous year, the UN agency said in a report. An estimated 110,000 people died, mainly children. Dr Seth Berkley, chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said ""the increase in measles cases is deeply concerning, but not surprising"". He cited ""complacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe"" among factors driving the spike. Dr Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at the prestigious Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, has watched the progress of a preventable disease. Finally, he started answering back. ""We've all forgotten how terrible these preventable diseases are, thank goodness,"" he told Sky News. ""As a doctor I have seen children die from measles. This led me to believe that my duty as a scientist, as a citizen and as a father was to make my voice heard. And so I have."" In one of his social media posts, he referenced Roald Dahl's letter about the death of his seven-year-old daughter, Olivia, from measles in 1962. The author wrote: ""I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn't do anything. 'Are you feeling all right?' I asked her. 'I feel all sleepy,' she said. In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead"". Dahl, who penned the letter in 1986, advocated for children to be immunised, telling parents: ""What on earth are you worrying about? It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunised."" Dr Burioni has recently launched an Italian-language website to establish medical truths beyond immunisation. Whether the good doctor would be a good candidate remains a matter of debate. For now, he has stayed out of party politics. In national elections last March, the centre-left Democratic Party asked him to run on their ticket, he says, but Dr Burioni refused on the grounds that he could fight ignorance better as an independent. More than 120,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""As scientists perhaps we have overlooked the power of social media and have not explained things,"" he says. ""But we must: we cannot leave social media to those who say the earth is flat and man never set foot on the moon."""
2018-12-23,President Trump says his defence secretary Jim Mattis will leave his post on 1 January - two months earlier than originally planned.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181223215045/https://news.sky.com/story/general-jim-mattis-trumps-defence-secretary-to-leave-two-months-early-11590505,"When General Mattis said earlier this week he was quitting, the outgoing Pentagon chief offered to stay on until February to ensure an orderly transition. His announcement he was stepping down came a day after the president said his troops were to pull out of Syria, much to the surprise of Congress, US allies around the world and, apparently, the Pentagon. And it appears that the defence secretary decided to leave after clashing with his commander-in-chief. He will be replaced on an interim basis by his deputy Patrick Shanahan. Donald Trump's decision to pull US forces out of Syria will lead to a revival of Islamic State in the country, Syrian rebels have warned The president tweeted: ""I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. ""Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!"" In his resignation letter, Gen Mattis criticised Mr Trump's foreign policies and his treatment of military allies after the president's decision to take troops out of war-ravaged Syria. Mr Trump also claimed the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria had been defeated - a claim disputed by senior figures in his own Republican party. And Syrian rebels warned Mr Trump's decision will lead to a revival of the insurgents. He is stepping down after clashing with the president over foreign policy, including Syria Mr Trump said he has spoken to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan about ""a slow and highly coordinated"" withdrawal. ""We discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, and the slow and highly coordinated pullout of US troops from the area,"" Mr Trump said in a tweet. ""After many years they are coming home."" Mr Trump said he and Mr Erdogan also discussed ""heavily expanded"" trade between the US and Turkey. The US troop pullout in Syria will leave thousands of Kurdish fighters in northern Syria - which the Pentagon spent years training and arming against IS - vulnerable to Turkish attack. Turkey, which fears the separatist ambitions of Kurds in its own country, has threatened to launch another offensive against Kurdish groups in Syria that Ankara accuse of being ""terrorists"". More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has criticised Mr Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, saying ""an ally must be reliable"". In a sign of the growing diplomatic rift between the two leaders, Mr Macron said ""I deeply regret the decision"" by Trump to pullout US troops. France has said it will maintain its role in the coalition fighting IS in Syria."

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph she gave her support for a ""managed no deal"", which would see the UK reflect EU rules during an implementation period while making several mini deals on aviation and trade.   Mrs Leadsom's plan would be an alternative to Mrs May's deal should it not pass through the Commons. Three Conservative MPs - Nick Boles, Anna Soubry, and Sarah Wollaston - have said they will resign the whip if a no deal Brexit becomes official government policy. Justice Secretary David Gauke suggested he would also quit the government in those circumstances. But Mrs Leadsom said the government would have to prepare for a variety of outcomes and if parliament does not want a no deal, MPs should vote for the prime minister's plans. She said: ""Parliament can always of course express a view, but in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, parliament does need to vote for a deal. ""The legal default position is that if there isn't a deal then the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 without a deal."" Although Mrs May has delayed the vote on her Brexit deal until January, it is still unlikely to make it through the Commons with MPs in nearly every party divided over the vote. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Former chancellor George Osborne attacked the Conservative Party in a Radio 4 interview, insisting Tories had to engage with modern Britain or face losing power. The editor of the Evening Standard said Mrs May had quietly backed Remain in the referendum and now had to push a ""Brexit means Brexit"" ideology to prove her credentials.   He said: ""That was essentially a massive mistake by the Conservative administration, which it was punished for at the general election because the Conservative Party decided to embrace the Brexit result in such a way as to essentially dismiss the views of those who voted Remain, treat them as saboteurs or traitors, and run against urban Britain."" He also attacked the ""reckless decision of the hard Brexiteers"" to pursue no deal, saying: ""I don't think the country voted to mobilise the Army, stockpile medicine, hoard food and go around the world buying every fridge available.

In the last week, a fatal shooting in Enfield on 18 December and a stabbing in Haringey on 22 December have brought the number of people violently killed in the capital to 131. Twice this year, on 20 February and 15 April, three people were fatally attacked on the same day. The year's two bloodiest months, February and March, saw 16 and 21 people die. Elizabeth Ogunsola will spend her Christmas this year at the grave of her 18-year-old brother. Israel was stabbed to death in east London this April. He died 30 minutes after he was attacked, despite efforts from the emergency services. The arms of a policewoman who tried to save the young man were described by a witness as ""literally covered in blood"". ""The day he died, was the worse day of my life,"" Ms Ogunsola told Sky News. ""I was at home with my daughter and received a phone call saying my brother had been attacked and that there is a possibility he has died."" She rang and rang her brother's phone, hoping he would pick up. ""The day still seems like a blur, all I knew was that I wasn't myself after that whilst still trying to keep my composure because of my daughter. Our lives will never be the same again,"" she said. Israel, whom Ms Ogunsola described as ""an amazing smart boy who was extremely talented"" and a football lover who was scouted by Arsenal, was the 54th violent death in the capital in 2018. ""The events of his death have left us all traumatised,"" she said, adding that her family will be praying for him this Christmas. Ms Ogunsola is thankful for the efforts put in by the emergency services, saying: ""They were amazing, everyone who came to his aid tried all they can to save his life but he just couldn't hold on."" But she hits out at the government's approach to knife crime in the capital, calling it ""very, very relaxed"" and that stop and search targets ""specific type of ethnic minority. It's ridiculous"". Sky News has tracked every person murdered in the capital :: What does the Met say? The Metropolitan Police has confirmed there were 129 killings between January - November 2018, the last full month that data is available for. Compared with 2011, the number of murders in London during this same period has risen by 24% - from 104 to 129. The number of people killed in the capital between January and November in 2018 has risen by nearly 5% from the same period last year, from 123 to 129. The Met's official monthly data release, which may not take into account deaths that may have been reclassified as murders at a date after publication, states there have been 123 homicides from January to November 2018. According to this data, the boroughs of Greenwich and Southwark registered the highest homicide rate, with three people killed per 100,000 population. Bexley, Harrow and Sutton were the safest, with no offences recorded in 2018. Select each area on the map below to find out more information. In response to Sky News' analysis, a spokesperson for the Met Police said: ""Any homicide is one too many, and violence in London has claimed too many lives this year. ""Our thoughts are with all the victims' families and loved ones who show incredible strength in the face of the most devastating tragedy imaginable. Their assistance and support of the police investigation is invaluable."" The spokesperson added that the force is ""committed to reducing violent crime"" and said that since a spike in numbers between February and May homicide rates have begun to ""stabilise"". They said: ""We have increased our police enforcement, putting more officers on the streets, including the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce, and continue to be relentless in our pursuit of those who choose to be violent."" The Met says that since launching the taskforce, around 2,380 people have been arrested and many of those have been jailed - in addition to the investigations undertaken by local police and specialist crime detectives. Community-driven initiatives are also under way in a bid to find a long-term solution to tackling violent crime, the Met said. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has been under fire for the high figures seen in 2018. Mr Khan acknowledged the ""unacceptable"" rise, but claimed he is limited thanks to government cuts. He told Sky News: ""My number one priority is to keep Londoners safe, and it's unacceptable to see a rise in violent crime in London and across the country. ""We know the causes of violent crime are extremely complex and years in the making, further compounded by years of government cuts to policing and vital preventative services."" Mr Khan said he is leading a ""public health approach to tackling the root causes of violence"", alongside the Violent Crime Taskforce and investment in preventative measures. ""But I am having to do this with one hand behind my back because the government has refused to reverse the £850m of hugely damaging savings the Met has been required to make."" :: How does London compare to England and Wales? Homicides across England and Wales rose by 14% in the year to June 2018, according to the most recently available data from the Office for National Statistics. It grew from 630 in 2017 to 719 - the highest number since 2008, when 775 people were killed. Of the homicides between June 2017 to July 2018, 20% of them happened in London. London makes up 15% of England and Wales's population. When the rate of murders is compared - London is only the fifth highest in the country. Greater Manchester has 2.7 murders per 100,000 people, compared to London's 1.7 per 100,000. Sussex, at 2.1, Warwickshire, at 2.0, and Cheshire, at 1.8, are also above London. :: What about Scotland? Official figures published in October show that between the financial years of April 2016 - March 2017 and 2017 - 2018, the number of homicide cases decreased by 5% from 62 to 59. Police Scotland report that ""this is the joint lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single twelve-month period since 1976, the first year for which comparable data are available"". :: Snapshots across England and Wales  Sky News asked a handful of police forces to declare the number of homicides that have taken place this year in their area from January to 30 October. According to Freedom of Information requests: :: South Wales Police recorded seven homicides, which works out at 0.5 people per 100,000 of the population. :: West Midlands Police report 42 homicides, which works out at 1.5 per 100,000 of the population. :: Greater Manchester Police, report 47 murders, which works out at 1.7 per 100,000 of the population. Victim Support is an independent charity which works with the bereaved, as well as victims and witnesses of crime. Chief officer Diana Fawcett told Sky News that 2018 had seen an ""unprecedented"" number of cases. She said: ""We work closely with families bereaved by murder and manslaughter through our national Homicide Service and this year has been unprecedented in the number of cases we have dealt with, particularly in the capital, driven by the increase in violent attacks. ""Too many lives are destroyed and communities shattered by these violent crimes. This isn't just a police problem but society's problem - the only way to stop this is a joined up approach with all agencies and organisations working together."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are working to tackle violent crime and its devastating consequences through our Serious Violence Strategy, which puts a greater focus on early intervention, alongside strong enforcement. ""The strategy is also enabling a more coordinated approach involving a range of agencies, including the police, community groups, local authorities, education, health. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

Video footage shows dozens of people watching the act in a marquee at a beach resort on the western tip of the Indonesian island of Java before the giant wave hit. The band are just finishing a song when the stage suddenly appears to vanish, consumed by water, and members of the audience scream in terror. The band's singer Riefian Fajarsyah posted on social media on Sunday to say his wife and the band's drummer were still missing, and paid tribute to his bassist and the band's manager, who had died. At least 222 people have died and 28 are still missing after the tsunami, which is believed to have been caused by a volcanic eruption. More than 800 people were injured after the huge wave crashed into beaches around the Sunda Strait at about 9.30pm local time (2.30pm GMT) on Saturday, officials said. Over 430 homes were severely damaged by the tsunami, which is said to have reached 10ft high. It is believe the waves were caused by an eruption of Anak Krakatau, the active cone that arose after the infamous Krakatoa eruption of 1883 that left tens of thousands dead and cut world temperatures for years. Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency said it is likely to have been triggered by underwater landslides.

Scientists also suggested tidal waves caused by the full moon may have contributed. A Norwegian tourist Oystein Lund Andersen said he and his family were taking photos of a volcano when a huge wave came towards them. ""I had to run, as the wave passed the beach and landed 15-20m (metres) inland,"" he said. ""(The) next wave entered the hotel area where I was staying and downed cars on the road behind it. ""Managed to evacuate with my family to higher ground through forest paths and villages, where we are taken care of (by) the locals. We're unharmed, thankfully.""

He was found in the garden of a home in Terrington St Clements, Norfolk, on Wednesday morning by a shocked homeowner who called the RSPCA. Animal collection officer Naemi Kilbery said she was so surprised by the call that she was ""wondering if there had been a misunderstanding"" but when she arrived she saw the seal was indeed miles from his usual habitat. ""We think that possibly he may have travelled up a drainage system and that's how he ended up where he was, but the water system only literally had two inches of water in it, so this poor pup must have just kept trying to travel further and further down in the hope of finding water or food,"" she said. ""He was an incredibly feisty little fella and it took all my strength to catch and rescue him, but it would have been his spirit and fight for life, that would have kept him alive during his ordeal."" She said the pup could have died of starvation but he is now recovering at an RSPCA centre. RSPCA East Winch centre manager Alison Charles said the pup was likely to make a full recovery over the next few days as he is fed and monitored. Then he will be released into the Wash, a Norfolk bay that opens into the North Sea. Ms Charles warned that even though seal pups can look sweet, they can still be very feisty. ""Seals are incredibly strong and powerful wild animals and can have a very powerful bite which can cause horrible wounds,"" she said. ""And we want to remind people to always stay away from seals, no matter where you find them."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The RSPCA said it had been ""incredibly concerned"" by reports that people had been getting too close to seal pups during the recent grey seal pupping season along the Norfolk coast. ""We know that it is an incredible sight to see, but people must respect that these are wild animals, and not interfere or get close to them,"" Ms Charles said. ""We have already had some reports of seals being bitten by dogs, because people have also been too close to them with their pets."""

NASA said the pictures would help observers understand the object's orbit. The asteroid, first discovered in 2003, is classified as ""potentially hazardous"" due to its size and close approaches to Earth's orbit. However, the latest radar measurements confirm it does not pose a future impact threat to Earth. The asteroid - called 2003 SD220 - flew safely past Earth on Saturday at a distance of about 1.8 million miles (2.9 million kilometres) - its closest approach in more than 400 years. It will be the closest approach until 2070, when it will come slightly closer. The radar photos released by the space agency reveal the asteroid is at least one mile (1.6km) long. NASA said its shape was similar to that of the ""exposed portion of a hippopotamus wading in a river"". The pictures were obtained by coordinating NASA's 70m (230ft) antenna in California, the National Science Foundation's 100m (330ft) telescope in West Virginia and the Arecibo Observatory's 305m (1,000ft) antenna in Puerto Rico. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""The radar images achieve an unprecedented level of detail and are comparable to those obtained from a spacecraft flyby,"" said Lance Benner, the scientist leading the observations from California. ""The most conspicuous surface feature is a prominent ridge that appears to wrap partway around the asteroid near one end. The ridge extends about 330ft above the surrounding terrain. ""Numerous small bright spots are visible in the data and may be reflections from boulders. The images also show a cluster of dark, circular features near the right edge that may be craters."" Scientists said the images confirmed the asteroid had a slow rotation period of about 12 days and that it had a complex rotation - like a ""poorly thrown football""."

Her family told Sky News that Christmas was her favourite time of year and that they still buy presents for her and put them under the tree. Her mother, Jayne Jones, said: ""Nell loved Christmas. From September onwards it was Christmas all the way. Counting down how many sleeps were left till Christmas was just Nell's thing."" Speaking at her home in Cheshire, she said Christmas was very difficult without the ""bubbly excitement"" of Nell, who was her youngest child and only daughter. ""You've just got to deal with it,"" she said. ""I always have to buy her things. I've bought her a Christmas present again. I've still bought baubles and things for her. It just makes me feel like I'm doing things for her. I like to think she's somewhere thinking 'thanks Mum'."" The family set up the Remembering Nell Foundation in her memory and decided to make a difference to the lives of children in Manchester by raising £2,000 to buy presents for children who might otherwise have received nothing. They bought the gifts and donated them to the Wood Street Mission charity in the city, where children can choose what they would like. ""It was poignant because - especially the girls' stuff - it was just like, 'well Nell would love that', so I knew what to get,"" said Ms Jones. ""It'll just be nice to think they're going to open them on Christmas Day and hopefully there'll be a smile there."" Sophie Bell from the charity has met with the family several times. ""What the Remembering Nell Foundation and Nell's family have done in donating all of those presents to us is giving children a special Christmas,"" she said. ""Giving them something to open on Christmas Day like any other child - we think it's wonderful."" For the family, the prospect of Christmas is tough. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""Its difficult,"" said Nell's brother Sam. ""There's a part of the family missing and there always will be a part of the family missing.

She made a video diary as her three children (two aged five and one aged 10) were forced to sleep under the stairs in the terminal. Her two parents, both in their 80s, are shown trying to get some rest in their wheelchairs. We first heard from Ms Garghan-Watson via a WhatsApp message at 1.45pm on Thursday, by which time she had already been there for nearly six hours. She said: ""Stuck at Gatwick departure. Flight MT1002. Lanzarote. ""First family holiday as a group of 9 with 3 kids all irritated at lack of info. Not even giving out water! I don't believe a few drones are responsible for all this chaos!"" At 10pm, she began her diary by filming the makeshift bed for her three children under the staircase. She said they had received little or no help from airport officials, who only sent one email apologising and were unable to provide blankets when the terminal became cold. Their tour operator, Thomas Cook, gave them some prepaid £10 vouchers to spend on whatever they might - but shops said they were blank and turned them away. Three hours later, at 1am, she filmed one of her children awake in his sleeping bag who said he could not sleep because it was ""too bright and too loud"". She complained about how there were ""plenty of staff"" but ""nobody has even asked us if we want any water, anything at all"". At 2am, looking tired and weary, Ms Garghan-Watson made her final entry, saying the terminal was still ""very bright, very noisy and also very cold"". ""I have asked if there is anywhere to get blankets from, but apparently not. You can't buy them and there is nowhere you can borrow them from. So it's still very frustrating here at Gatwick."" At around 4am, she said she could ""feel the tension rising again"" in the terminal. ""It is honestly heartbreaking when your child tells you they're cold, and you can't warm them, buy or borrow a blanket from anywhere. Massive sense of mum guilt, I feel so useless we are stuck here."" More than a hundred thousand Christmas travellers were affected by the airport's closure, in what was the biggest disruption at Gatwick for years The origin of the drones, which were first spotted on Wednesday evening, is still unknown."

The worst part of the country for delays today will be the M40 north from J8A (Oxford) to M42 Warwickshire, where drivers could face an extra 61 minutes on their trip time. Those keen to avoid jams should keep off the roads between 10.30am and 4pm, and make their journey before 9.30am or after 7.30pm, the RAC has said. On Sunday, the window of bad traffic will narrow to just 4pm to 6.30pm, but the RAC suggests making a trip before 11am or after 8pm to be sure of the best conditions. Union members in two rail networks are striking today, forcing reduced services as passengers try to get to and from the capital and around the north of England. South Western Railway is running a reduced service on the majority of its lines after RMT announced another strike over the issues of guards on the trains. The rail firm said in a statement that the RMT was ""ensuring that maximum misery is inflicted"" by holding the strike just before Christmas. ""This action is totally unnecessary,"" the statement said. ""We have guaranteed to roster a guard on every train, and we need more, not fewer guards - 70 more by May 2019 - and we have an opportunity with the introduction of the new suburban trains to operate these trains differently to maximise the customer benefits."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? On Northern Rail, a reduced service will begin after 5pm and there are planned cancellations in place for 23 December. David Brown, managing director at Northern, said: ""We expect all of our services, and those of other operators, to be extremely busy and are calling on our customers to plan their travel carefully for the coming weekend, check the new timetables well in advance, and make sure they do not rely on the last trains home."" The network will not be running trains to Manchester from Liverpool, Kirkby or Warrington Central and will stop running some others as early as 4.38pm. In London, there will be no service on TfL rail from 23 December, with limited services across some tube lines and the overground. Those travelling on Christmas Eve and Boxing Day have been warned to check before they travel as there will be a Sunday service on many lines, finishing earlier than usual. There will be no public transport on Christmas Day. Meanwhile, Gatwick Airport is still recovering after three days of drone chaos in its airfield. More than 100,000 passengers were affected when the airport had to close its runway for hours at a time as drones were sighted."

Some 12,300 cases were sleeping rough in 2017 - a 98% increase on 2012 - while nearly 12,000 were staying in vehicles or tents, the study found. In Manchester, 47-year-old rough sleeper Joe told Sky News he was unable to find emergency accommodation because there were not enough places. Describing his experience of living on the street, he said: ""People set you alight, p*** on you, kick you. ""You need to sleep with one eye open, you know what I mean."" Sky News meets six homeless people living on the streets in Bolton An estimated 500 people sleep rough on the streets of Greater Manchester. Last year emergency shelters only opened after temperatures dropped below zero. But this year, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has pledged to provide shelter for people sleeping rough every night of the winter. One of the region's new shelters in north Manchester is a former children's home with twin rooms instead of dormitories. One resident, who asked not to be named, said he had been homeless for two years after his wife died. ""I just lost my head,"" he told Sky News. ""I just couldn't cope...it's been hell. ""Once you become homeless you just get stuck in that rut. There's no coming back from it, you know what I mean. ""You just become invisible."" The government wants to end rough sleeping by 2027, while Mr Burnham says he is seeking to go further and reach the target in Greater Manchester by 2020. He told Sky News: ""In politics you hesitate before you go out there with a big commitment but to be honest, it's urgent. ""It's a humanitarian crisis right here before our eyes. If you can't make a big commitment what's going to change?"" The mayor's pledge means more shelters will be open in Greater Manchester through the winter until 31 March.

2018-12-23,It will be a festive political break like no other. Teams of civil servants will be charged with spending millions preparing legislation and further contingency plans to prepare for a historic hard break from the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181223215045/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-festive-break-like-no-other-lies-ahead-as-parliament-kicks-can-into-next-year-11586296,"It's a prospect the government says it wants to avoid and a clear Commons majority suggest they will try to veto it. When the political narrative from the prime minister is that MPs have work to do in order to come up with a Brexit compromise, taking 18 days off, while the civil service beavers away, is not a great look, and during this break there will be pressure for an early return from recess. But above all, Theresa May hopes that some time at home with family and constituents will refocus the minds of over 100 of her own MPs and the DUP, and leave them with a post-advent open mind. Her job - or at least that of her top negotiator, Oliver Robbins - is to return from Brussels with a legally binding addendum that makes clear that if the backstop becomes permanent, the UK can exercise rights to leave unilaterally. But there is little evidence that the EU are talking right now or if it will do so over the Christmas break. Indeed, the very real doubts that the prime minister encountered at last week's Brussels summit were not necessarily just about the idea of a legally binding reassurance over the backstop. There was a fundamental doubt that there would be any point trying to offer such a concession to a leader who did not even dare call the vote she had promised she could pass. Such a concession might be better saved until the vote is actually lost, was the thinking. And indeed, any concession would require Dublin's active consent. The message Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar gave to me in Brussels was that he thought if the Commons does not want to pass this deal, the backstop is here to stay, and Mrs May should ponder seeking the delay of, or revoking entirely, the Article 50 notice. The Labour leadership too is playing for time. You don't have to employ a lipreader to see an opposition unwilling to use its most potent weapon of a full Commons no confidence vote and unable to take full advantage of the current tumult. Over the past year, the Labour leadership has been been squeezed by its membership and shadow cabinet to move at a glacial pace towards more of a Remain position. But over Christmas and into the New Year, there will be no hiding place. Jeremy Corbyn will have to come off the fence in the first half of January on the referendum coveted by many of his supporters. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? As the Labour leader told me in Lisbon earlier this month, his supporters who sport ""Love Corbyn Hate Brexit"" tote bags ""are not wrong"". We are on the cusp of momentous events that could properly split both major parties, see widespread economic and diplomatic turmoil, and lead rapidly to another major national poll of some description within months. When push came to shove parliament decided to kick the can into January. Christmas recess is a brief pause before that road officially runs out. A festive truce appears to have started, but there is little sign of the Christmas compromise the prime minister needs."
2018-12-23,"Former Liberal Democrats leader Paddy Ashdown has died at the age of 77, the party has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181223215045/https://news.sky.com/story/former-lib-dem-leader-paddy-ashdown-dies-aged-77-11589545,"Former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg is among those who has led the tributes to the man who was the first leader of the party after the merger of the Liberal and Social Democratic parties. Sir Nick told Sky News Lord Ashdown was a pivotal factor in the Lib Dems going into coalition with the Conservatives after the 2010 election. He said: ""He was not only a supporting factor, he was a pivotal factor. Like all of us, he wrestled with what was right for the country, after that indecisive election in 2010, and he came to the view that it was the right thing to put the national interest first - whatever the political risks were for the party."" He added: ""He was in many ways the embodiment of vitality and energy in everything that he did so it's very difficult to imagine him not being around... so for him to not be around is just so tragic."" Lord Ashdown's death comes a month after he revealed that he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer. He said on Twitter his condition did ""not merit any fuss"", adding that ""many go through this"". Reaction after former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown dies at the age of 77 A Lib Dem spokesperson said Lord Ashdown died on Saturday evening ""following a short illness"". They added: ""He will be desperately missed by everyone at the Liberal Democrats as a dear friend and colleague, and remembered as someone who made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism."" Born in India in 1941 as the eldest of seven children, Jeremy John Durham Ashdown (who preferred to be known as Paddy) served with the Royal Marines from 1959 and then the Special Boat Service in the 1960s. In 1971, he left military life and joined the Foreign Office, moving his wife Jane and their two children to Geneva while he was attached to the United Nations. But the couple became restless and worried about their children's education so decided to return to England, settling into Jane's home town of Yeovil. In 1983, he snatched the seat from the Conservatives, who had held it for years and remained as MP in the seat until 2001. In 1988, he became leader of the Liberal Democrats and transformed the party into a political force with 46 MPs by 1997. Current Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said Lord Ashdown had ""exercised every ounce of his considerable personal stamina"" to win the Yeovil seat. ""He was a personal example to me and to many other candidates,"" he said. Sir Vince said the former party leader was ""always listened to, in particular, on international issues and defence"" and that he often ""took up unpopular causes where he was respected for his convictions"". ""He took the Lib Dems from position in the mid 80s when we were at a very low ebb, and gradually built it up and within a decade we were then a major force and I was one of the MPs who came in on his coat tails, but he was also important internationally,"" the Lib Dem leader told Sky News. Lord Ashdown's leadership was rocked in 1992 by revelations of his five-month affair with former secretary Patricia Howard, but his marriage survived. After stepping down as party leader in 1999, he was knighted and then made a peer as Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon. As a former military man, he was a regular spokesman in parliament on the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. He went on to spend four years as High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from May 2002, reflecting his passionate advocacy for international intervention in that region. He was also a witness for the prosecution at the war crimes trial of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. Former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major said: ""In government, Paddy Ashdown was my opponent. In life, he was a much-valued friend. Throughout his life, Paddy was a true patriot, whose overriding wish was to serve his country."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Tony Blair described him as a political visionary and leader and said he was excellent company and always fun to be around. David Cameron said he had seldom known a public servant with so much energy and dynamism. Theresa May said that Lord Ashdown had served his country with distinction and would be sorely missed. Olly Grender, the former Lib Dem head of communications who shared an office with Lord Ashdown for the past five years, said he was ""adored"", ""iconic"" and a ""great mentor"". She told Sky News: ""He was my boss, my leader - he was the kind of political leader you would literally follow into the trenches with just a Swiss army knife in your hand and follow anywhere. ""We shared an office in the House of Lords and it was joyful, gossipy and challenging on a daily basis - because he never ever stopped wanting to deliver on political change."" Lord Ashdown is survived by his wife Jane and two adult children."

Police said the victim was taken to an east London hospital after they were called at 1.20am, and was pronounced dead at the hospital less than an hour later. They are trying to find and notify his next of kin of his death, the Met Police said. Detective Chief Inspector Glen Lloyd, who is leading the investigation, said: ""Whilst we have made good progress with two arrests, I still need to hear from anyone who has information that could assist with my investigation. ""At the heart of this, we have an innocent young man who has been brutally murdered just days before Christmas."" More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Police believe they know who the victim is but are waiting for him to be formally identified before releasing his name. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course. The latest death brings the number of homicides - both murder and manslaughter - in London up to 130 this year, and increases the number of murders in Haringey, the borough where Tottenham is, to eight. :: Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting CAD 503/22 Dec. :: To remain anonymous contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2018-12-23,A Banksy mural which appeared overnight in a Welsh steel town this week is under 24-hour guard to manage crowds flocking to see it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181223215045/https://news.sky.com/story/new-banksy-mural-gets-24-hour-guard-to-protect-from-crowds-11589449,"The secretive British artist's latest instalment appeared on a garage in Port Talbot, south Wales, on Tuesday. Since then queues have been forming as people gather to see the mural which at first looks like a boy in the snow. But on the other side of the garage wall the painting shows a fire in a skip, revealing that what appeared to be snow is actually ash from the smoke. The painting is believed to be a statement on the industrial town, its steel works and the pollution it creates. Banksy revealed he was the artist behind the mural on Wednesday in an Instagram video entitled Season's greetings.  . . . . Season’s greetings . . . A post shared by  Banksy (@banksy) on Dec 19, 2018 at 6:53am PST The local council has now put up metal fences and on Saturday placed a perspex screen over the painting as crowds come to see Banksy's first piece in Wales. Traffic wardens were also brought in to manage crowds in the quiet suburban alley, with councillors reminding visitors to not disturb those living nearby. Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has even reportedly helped to help fund the security and legal bills to protect the work. The 49-year-old, who is from the adjoining village of Baglan, wants to ensure the garage's owner does not have to pay to protect it. Ian Lewis, a steelworker who owns the garage, said he saw the artwork on Facebook before he realised it was on his garage wall. ""At first I didn't really think much of it. I didn't even know if it was my garage. But then I had a look and saw it was,"" the 55-year-old said. ""It started off as fun, but now it's gone to stress. It's down to not sleeping, but now I've got the security there it's taken that weight off me. ""I've never experienced anything like this. My phone is ringing, on my house phone there's 1,000 messages on it."" He said he thought Port Talbot was chosen because the town made the news in July when black dust from the steelworks covered houses and cars. And he said he had ""no idea"" what his plans for the artwork were and denied receiving any offers to sell it. ""I'm really just rolling with it at the moment and I don't know where it's going,"" he said. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Rachel Honey-Jones, 33, who lives the other side of Swansea Bay, said an artist friend of hers was tipped off about the artwork's location and stayed overnight to guard it. ""It's amazing, an incredible addition to Port Talbot,"" she said. ""People have already taken sledgehammers to it and tried to throw paint on it. ""It will bring visitors and trade and tourism to the county, so it really does need to be protected."""

I am in the coastal village of Teluk. Or to be more accurate I am walking through what remains of the village. It lies on Java's western coast, the same Indonesian shoreline that was battered by a volcano-triggered tsunami on Saturday night. The broken toys in the rubble hint at the life that existed here just few days ago. The narrow alleyways might have echoed with the laughter of children. Now there is a deathly silence. Some eighteen thousand people called Teluk their home. But it has been wrecked. The wave that swept through here destroyed everything in its path. Furniture has been reduced to splintered wood, bicycles are bent and buckled, walls have tumbled. Everywhere there are fragments of family life: flippers and photo frames half buried in the mud. Sunaina fled Teluk with her young son Mohammed, his sister Shakeela and her elderly mother Bhaia. The family were fast asleep when they were woken by the screams of neighbours. ""I had been watching the news for the past few days. There had been coverage of the volcano Anak Krakatoa so I knew there had been some activity. That night I heard it erupt, a loud roar"", she tells me. ""I even felt the ground shake. But I thought nothing of it and went to sleep. But I was woken up by neighbours shouting 'there's a tsunami'. ""I just grabbed my children and my mother and we ran."" Sunaina has is now living with her family at a cousin's house. Nine other families from Teluk are also staying there. It's very cramped but the discomfort is worth it for Sunaina because the house is high up a steep hill and a safe distance from the shoreline. ""I'm scared of the water, I don't want to go back. But I will have to one day. What else can I do?"" We offer to go back with Sunaina to Teluk. She says she will not return alone so asks two neighbours to accompany her. Sunaina has not realised just how deeply traumatised she is. She takes a few unsteady steps towards the beach structure. Then stops, shakes her head and doubles back. It is too close to the sea. She is not ready. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? One of her neighbours has also returned. But the shock at seeing the damage to her home she bursts into tears. The wailing attracts the attention of another woman standing nearby. Lena Herlina is a volunteer damage assessor and has been trying to estimate just how wrecked Teluk now is. She consoles the crying woman by hugging her tightly and telling her not to cry. ""I told her I will help her and other people who are affected by this disaster. Her house is badly damaged so we will try to help her as much as we can but not only her all the homes in this village that were destroyed"". Sunaina's story is utterly heartbreaking. But the real tragedy is that her grief is not isolated. There are hundreds of Teluks all along this devastated coastline."

""The way we were initially perceived was disgusting, although those who knew us didn't doubt us for a second."" The pair were released following two nights in custody and say they will now be trying to get through Christmas ""as best we can"". Around 1,000 flights were cancelled or diverted after drones were spotted inside the perimeter of the airport on Wednesday, with the disruption spanning three days and affecting around 140,000 passengers. In an attempt to catch those responsible, Gatwick Airport has offered a £50,000 reward through Crimestoppers, while another £10,000 has been put up by the charity's chairman Lord Ashcroft. Gatwick - Britain's second busiest airport - serves more than 43 million passengers a year. In a statement, a spokesperson for the airport said its runway remains open and a full schedule of flights has operated across the weekend and on Monday. As the fallout from the chaos continues, Sky News understands ministers have labelled the police handling of communications surrounding the drone sightings as a ""mess-up"". After an hour-long conference call on Monday chaired by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, it was acknowledged police ""have not handled their communication response well"". More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Sunday's claim by police that there was a ""possibility"" that there might never have been a drone was described as a ""mess-up"". On Monday afternoon, police appeared to backtrack completely over that statement. Sussex Police Deputy Chief Constable Jo Shiner said: ""We can unequivocally state that there have been numerous illegal drone sightings at the airport over three days from 19 to 21 December. ""There were numerous reports clustered around 37 occasions where a drone or drones were seen and I am keen for those responsible to be brought to justice. ""The impact of this criminal and reckless behaviour has been enormous and we are determined to locate those responsible to bring them to justice."" There have been more than 200 sightings since the first drone was spotted in the area surrounding the airport on Wednesday. Police have taken 67 statements, including from police officers and staff at the airport. A damaged drone found near the airport perimeter, close to the last reported sighting, is also being forensically examined. The airport said: ""We are clear that there were multiple confirmed sightings of drone activity at the airport. ""Therefore we took the necessary actions to ensure the safety of passengers using our airport. ""Safety will always be our number one priority.

The two couples later delighted well-wishers by shaking hands and greeting people after the service ended. Prince Charles, the princes' father, accompanied the quartet on the walk into the church but Charles' wife, Camilla, did not attend. The Duchess of Cornwall is believed to be recovering from a heavy cold that forced her to miss an appearance at last week's Olympia Horse Show. Hundreds of people lined the route, some carrying flowers and wearing Santa hats and warm clothing to keep out the chill on a cold morning in Norfolk. The Queen arrived in a limousine to cheers from the crowds but her husband, Prince Philip, was not with her. Her Majesty was accompanied by her son, Prince Andrew, the Duke of Windsor. The duke's daughter, Princess Eugenie, who, like Harry and Meghan, married this year, arrived with her new husband, Jack Brooksbank. It is a short walk to the church from Sandringham, the Queen's country estate in Norfolk, where the Royal Family traditionally spends Christmas and New Year. Those who turned out to see the family arrive were rewarded by the younger royal generation looking happy and relaxed as they approached, scotching reports of a growing rift between Kate and Meghan. The duchesses walked side by side along the path that led to the church, Meghan arm in arm with her husband, chatting as they went. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

""I have good health and I had two kidneys and I only needed one of them,"" the 62-year-old from Kettering in Northamptonshire said. ""So I thought why not give one to somebody else to help give them a better life and maybe save their life."" The lucky recipient was 70-year-old Joe Salvatore, who she has now finally met after exchanging anonymous letters following the donation five years ago. Speaking after their emotional first meeting, Mrs Dobson said the pair ""got on really well"". ""And we've certainly got something in common."" Mr Salvatore, from New Malden in Surrey, said the transplant has changed his life. ""Everybody says how much better I look. I feel better. I feel fitter,"" he said. Mr Salvatore had been undergoing treatment for renal failure for 15 years, but when doctors discovered both of his kidneys were severely failing, they made it clear he needed an urgent transplant. His wife and daughter initially offered their kidneys, but they were not suitable. However, Mr Salvatore's daughter, Carmel Dalby, did donate her kidney to another stranger as part of a four-way altruistic donor chain which meant her father could receive one. ""Really if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have got a kidney,"" he said of his daughter. ""And I'm really grateful for her. She's a nice, strong girl and I'm really proud of her."" Mr Salvatore said the transplant means he can continue his martial arts training, his passion that also helps him to keep fit. ""Teresa's made my life a whole new life again and I'm able to enjoy my life with my family, with my group of friends,"" he said. ""What a wonderful person Teresa is, and people like her, who can actually donate to somebody they don't even know."" The modest Mrs Dobson played down her selfless act, which was organised through the charity Give a Kidney. She said it was ""just one of those things"" she could to help, adding she would rather do that than run a marathon. ""Lots of people do lots of wonderful things for people, like running marathons and raising thousands of pounds,"" she said. ""Well I hate running and I'd rather give a kidney away any day."" Mrs Dobson said that being an organ donor also ""gives a lot back"" to the giver. ""When I met Joe today, that feeling I had inside, it doesn't get much better than that,"" she said. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? At first, the pair exchanged occasional anonymous letters, which were arranged through their hospital transplant units. Then she suggested they could meet in person - and Mr Salvatore replied to say he would be ""very happy"" to do so. Mr Salvatore said he was ""very nervous"" before the meeting, adding: ""Meeting Teresa for the first time today, I promised I'd be strong. ""But of course at the end I wasn't. I did break down a bit. It was very nice to meet her. A lovely woman."" Mrs Dobson cried as well, wiping tears from her eyes after she was given flowers and a hug. ""It's so special to see you,"" she said. ""You look so well."""
2018-12-25,A rise in burglaries and other crime has prompted an increasing number of residents to pay for their own private security or even patrolling themselves.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181226015101/https://news.sky.com/story/rise-in-burglaries-sees-residents-pay-for-private-security-11591173,"Sky News has learned the number of burglaries going unsolved in England has jumped by at least 8%. A freedom of information request revealed that over 200,000 cases are closed with ""no suspect identified"" every year. Across 28 police forces, more than 235,000 burglaries went unsolved in 2017 compared to over 218,000 in 2016. The first six months of this year also saw more than 105,000 cases closed with no suspect identified. Sparta Security in the north-east says it has had to double its workforce in the last 12 months because of demand. Julian McBride, a general manager at Sparta, told Sky News they actively recruit ex-military personnel and close protection officers, informally known as bodyguards. He said: ""We have a lot of houses that ask for the support of Sparta… a lot of it is just being boots on the ground, showing a presence and seeing who is about. ""Challenging people if we think they’re up to something but challenging them in a correct manner not just in an abrupt manner. ""If we see them commit a crime we try and gather evidence and alert the police, which we like to think we have got a really good reputation with. ""The police do a fantastic job it's just that they had some cuts... so they can't attend as many incidents."" Some local councils employ Sparta to look after events and businesses. Sunbed shop The Beach Hut in Darlington pay Sparta monthly for nightly patrols after they were burgled. Mark Savage, owner of the business, said it gives him ""peace of mind"": ""If there are patrols going around it makes there less chance of burglaries,"" he said. ""I just think the way the police force is at the moment, probably stretched, they just don't have the facility to do those regular checks that they used to many years ago."" Che Donald, vice chair of the Police Federation said: ""It's a sad indictment of government where opportunities exist for a privately funded firms to fulfil the role of policing, because police cannot cope with the demands placed on an overstretched, understaffed and underfunded service."" Darlington police, however, say they have managed to reduce burglaries in the town by 32% compared to last year, and a 4% decrease in crime overall. Inspector Chris Knox said: ""Nationally we are seeing a significant increase in the number of calls made to police - a high number of these are concern for welfare incidents and incidents involving mental health, which require an immediate response. ""These can place a strain on our ability to respond as promptly as we have done in previous years. ""I would like to reassure people that County Durham and Darlington remains one of the safest places to live in the country, and Durham constabulary has been rated as 'outstanding' for the past three years by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS). ""Protecting the most vulnerable people remains a force priority and we will do everything we can to provide the best possible service to our residents."" The government has promised an extra £970 million for forces in 2019 but critics say it is simply not enough. There is also concern that a 'two-tier' system will develop where those who can afford to pay for private security feel safer than those who cannot. In a statement a spokesperson from the National Police Chiefs Council said: “Resource within policing is under strain as forces deal with rising crime, demand that is more complex, and an unprecedented terror threat with fewer officers and staff available to meet this demand. ""It is for individual chief constables to manage this within their force, and some have already made it clear that police can only prioritise their resources against the greatest harm. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? “We encourage communities who have concerns about policing in their area to contact their local Neighbourhood Policing teams. ""These firms should not replace or supplement policing and it is for properly trained officers to intervene when a crime has been committed. ""Where communities wish to fund their own security patrols, we will work with these personnel in the most appropriate way and any reports of crime and evidence provided to police by a third party will always be assessed and dealt with. ""Our advice to anyone who has information about a suspect or witnesses a crime, is to contact police as soon as possible."""
2018-12-25,Forty people have been rescued in the English Channel after attempting to reach the UK today.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181226015101/https://news.sky.com/story/forty-migrants-rescued-from-five-boats-in-english-channel-11591240,"Migrants were picked up in five separate incidents in the early hours of the morning, with some attempting to make the crossing in dinghies. Those on board the boats said they were from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, and at least two children were travelling with the groups. All the migrants are now in the UK and have undergone medical assessments before being transferred to immigration officials for interview. The children were taken to social services, the Home Office said. The Home Office has blamed the crossings on ""organised criminal gang activity"". ""We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk,"" a spokesperson said. It said it had ""deployed resources to deal with these incidents"", including sending Border Force cutters and coast patrol vessels to the stricken boats. The number of people trying to cross the English Channel in small and often dangerous journeys has risen in recent months, with 86 people picked up in a two-week period in November. The rise in channel crossings corresponds with tighter border checks in France and crackdowns on migrant camps that have made it more difficult to reach the UK by other means. The Home Office says its work with French authorities and ""enhanced security measures"" have seen a 50% reduction in what it calls ""clandestine detections"" in the UK since 2015. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Since April, immigration enforcement has disrupted 43 organised crime groups involved in people smuggling. In November, two men were jailed for eight years each for smuggling people into the UK in small boats. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said it was ""deeply concerning"" that so many migrants had attempted to enter Britain. ""This is incredibly hazardous in the middle of winter - especially for children,"" he said. ""It is vital that the British and French authorities find and stop the traffickers behind these crossings before there is a tragedy in the English Channel."""

Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for criminal misuse of drones, said: ""Before anyone uses a drone it is vital that they make themselves aware of their responsibilities and the rules to make sure these devices are operated in a safe and responsible way. ""Do not take this lightly, if you break any of these and act irresponsibly you could face criminal charges. ""Police officers will use all available powers to investigate reports of drones being misused and seek the appropriate penalty,"" she added. Drone sightings at Gatwick caused around 1,000 flights to be cancelled or diverted across three days last week, disrupting the Christmas travel plans of an estimated 140,000 people. Home office minister, Ben Wallace, announced on Christmas Day that detection systems can now be deployed throughout the UK to combat the threat drones pose. Mr Wallace echoed the warning from police, saying: ""Those people who chose to use drones either recklessly or for criminal purposes can expect the most severe sentence and jail time when caught."" More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Reported drones near aircraft increased by a third to 120 in the year to 4 December, according to figures from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2014, there were just six reported incidents. Anyone who owns a drone weighing at least 250 grams will need to register with the CAA and take an online safety test from 30 November next year. The Drone Code, the CAA's new code of conduct, states that the gadgets must not be flown above 400 feet or within 150 feet of people or property. Drones must also be kept at least 500 feet away from crowds and built-up areas, and must not fly over those locations at any height. Ministers consulted on a series of other measures to crackdown on drone misuse over the summer, including giving police the power to issue on-the-spot fines of up to £300 and the ability to seize drones being used irresponsibly. The Department for Transport is also considering using new technology to protect public events, critical national infrastructure and prisons from drone disruption."

He scratches an outline of Theresa May using a nib and ink. ""She has this stoop...little bump in the nose...always looks unhappy. Not surprising..."" The prime minister begins to take shape. This year Adams has portrayed her as everything from a dog being wagged by Jacob Rees-Mogg's tail, to a cricketer being battered by bouncers bowled by her own team. With just under 100 days to go until Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union, he had her diving head first into an empty swimming pool. He did briefly worry that he was going too far. ""There is a slight problem with Theresa May that she is a woman and at the very beginning when she was home secretary I did get complaints saying it was misogynistic. ""I said it doesn't matter if she's a woman or a man."" He laughs. ""Anyway, she chose to be prime minister so I have no sympathy for her."" His boss would appear to share that view. But then one of her first acts as prime minister was to sack him from the job he had held for six years. Which is why George Osborne is now the editor of the Standard, rather than Chancellor of the Exchequer. His move from politics to journalism has put him in a unique position; where once he was the subject of Christian Adams's cartoons, he's now overseeing the way Adams is portraying his former Conservative Party colleagues. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""I'm always trying to encourage Christian to poke things up a bit,"" Mr Osborne says. ""He's an artist.

He denies taking particular delight at cartoons about Mrs May, though he did seem to relish showing us the May dog being wagged by the Rees-Mogg tail. ""A very powerful image"" he called it. ""The thing about politicians is they complain about being in cartoons. But the only thing worse than being in cartoons is not being featured in cartoons. ""Sometimes my former colleagues and members of the Royal Family will buy an original artwork because they like to have a little memento of the day they were lampooned in the paper."" Adams admits it's ""very strange"" to be guided by a man he used to draw. ""I don't get any interference from the editor, but he is the editor. ""I'm not going to draw something which is the exact opposite of the political stance of the paper, but I don't exactly toe the line of what the leader column is going to say. ""Ongoing chaos is brilliant for cartoonists. Brexit is the awful gift that keeps on giving. It's been a very rich year, and if in doubt there's always Trump to fall back on,"" he added. The orange skin and coiffed hair of the president provides endless material for cartoonists. Adams turned him into a hamburger with his hair as the bun in one cartoon, and transformed the poster of the Oscar winning movie The Shape of Water into a version with a naked Trump locked in an embrace with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He won't be short of material in 2019."

Switlyk was met with almost unanimous fury when she posted the photo on Twitter, writing: ""Beautiful wild goat here on the Island of Islay in Scotland. Such a fun hunt!!"" ""They live on the edge of the cliffs of the island and know how to hide well,"" she continued. ""Made a perfect 200 yard shot and dropped him.""

But Steve Sidwell, who retired from playing last summer and now works as a pundit on Sky Sports, says he will miss playing during what is his first proper Christmas off in 15 years. ""It's tough and unforgiving,"" he said, ""but you learn it from an early age. You quickly become accustomed to it... you get paid well to do a fantastic job. ""I'm looking forward to Christmas with the family, but I will miss playing."" Sidwell's former club, Brighton and Hove Albion, have a typically arduous schedule over the holiday period, as they face four Premier League games and an FA Cup tie in the space of two weeks. During his career, so many matches meant the monk-like existence of a professional athlete became even more strict. Sidwell, who is not a big drinker anyway, said he would ""have a glass of wine with dinner and that's it. I didn't really miss it."" More than 100,000 people have signed the petition - have you? As for the Christmas feast, he said he partook but didn't overdo it. ""I'm not one who has a bowl of pasta while the family has Christmas dinner. I would have a little turkey and stuffing and all the rest but I wouldn't over-indulge."" ""I like a glass of wine, but I wouldn't overdo it. Very few players do at Christmas as it does affect physical performance and health, especially at the elite level,"" he admitted. But players are given some control over what happens, he said, as ""these days, managers are very forgiving. After the Christmas programme, they'll give you a break into January."" ""And on Xmas day, the manager will give players the option of training in the morning or afternoon."" And he said the atmosphere at training over the Christmas period was good as the training is light. For those who will play most or all of the games over the holiday period, ""it's mostly about recovery between games. Most clubs hire a cryo-chamber to speed up recovery."" There are 12 Premier League matches live on Sky Sports between 23 December and 3 January as well as games from the EFL other leagues across the world."
2018-12-25,"The Queen has joked in her Christmas Day message that the events of this year - including a number of royal weddings and births - have kept her ""well-occupied"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181226015101/https://news.sky.com/story/queen-jokes-about-being-kept-well-occupied-in-her-christmas-message-11591209,"She has had an eventful 2018, with the Duke of Cambridge and Zara Tindall both welcoming new additions to their families. Prince Harry, meanwhile, married Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle, with the pair becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The couple announced a few months later that they are expecting their first child in the spring. And another grandchild also got married - Princess Eugenie tied the knot with long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank. Referencing these events in her annual televised address, the Queen said: ""Closer to home, it's been a busy year for my family, with two weddings and two babies and another child expected soon. ""It helps to keep a grandmother well-occupied."" Kate and Meghan chat as they arrive for the service together, scotching rumours of a rift, before greeting crowds afterwards She also spoke about the importance of being surrounded by loved ones, saying: ""Through the many changes I have seen over the years, faith, family and friendship have been not only a constant for me but a source of personal comfort and reassurance."" And for those who are keenly feeling the loss of relatives or friends at this time of year, she sought to offer words of comfort. ""At Christmas, we become keenly aware of loved ones who have died, whatever the circumstances,"" the Queen said. ""But, of course, we would not grieve if we did not love."" She also remembered her father, George VI, reflecting on his time in the Royal Navy in the First World War and the part he played in the early years of the Commonwealth. The Queen said the Commonwealth's strength ""lies in the bonds of affection it promotes"" and a ""common desire to life in a better, more peaceful world"". She also paid tribute to members of the armed forces, many of whom are deployed abroad at Christmas, saying Britain owes them ""our deepest gratitude"". But as well as offering words of comfort and including a touch of humour in her speech, which was recorded in Buckingham Palace's White Drawing Room, she also reflected on some of the darker aspects of life. The Queen spoke of how religion can see people ""fall victim to tribalism"", as well as do good in the service of others. Sitting at a desk and with a Christmas tree in the background, she said: ""Some cultures believe a long life brings wisdom. I'd like to think so. ""Perhaps part of that wisdom is to recognise some of life's baffling paradoxes, such as the way human beings have a huge propensity for good, and yet a capacity for evil. ""Even the power of faith, which frequently inspires great generosity and self-sacrifice, can fall victim to tribalism."" The broadcast featured footage of 2018's two royal weddings, as well as the moments the couples kissed on the steps of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Also included was a clip of William and Kate presenting the first royal baby born this year, Louis, to the world outside the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in April. In June, Zara and husband Mike Tindall, a former England rugby player, had their second child - daughter Lena. ""We have had other celebrations too, including the 70th birthday of the Prince of Wales,"" the Queen said as the camera panned to a framed picture on her desk. The image was the official picture released to mark Charles's milestone birthday. It features his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Cambridges and their children, and the Sussexes. Although the Queen, as head of state, remains publicly neutral on political matters and does not express her views on issues, her call for unity in the speech may be interpreted by some as a reference to current political events and the recriminations surrounding Brexit. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? She said the ""message of peace on Earth"" is ""needed as much as ever"" and also called for people treat others with respect, even in situations where there are ""deeply held differences"". The Archbishop of Canterbury also called for unity, using his Christmas Day sermon to highlight the importance of forgetting ""tribalism"" and ""political advantage"". Addressing worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Rev Justin Welby said: ""God's language of love is exclusive. ""It requires us to forget other languages of hatred, tribalism, rivalry, political advantage and of materialism, pride, greed, and so many more."" The Queen, 92, has been on the throne for 66 years and has been married to the Duke of Edinburgh for over seven decades. Her broadcast has become a traditional part of Christmas Day and is a rare chance for Her Majesty to share her personal thoughts with people in the UK and across the Commonwealth. The palace does not explain the full meaning behind the message, leaving it open to interpretation."

2018-12-25,"Photographs showing ""missing"" Dubai princess Latifa posing with the former UN high commissioner for human rights have been released.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181226015101/https://news.sky.com/story/missing-dubai-princess-pictured-alive-11590923,"In a statement, the UAE ministry of foreign affairs and international co-operation said in an effort to rebut ""false allegations"" they have ""provided evidence that Her Highness Sheikha Latifa was at home and living with her family in Dubai"". The statement says the photographs with Mary Robinson, former United Nations high commissioner for human rights and former president of Ireland, were taken on 15 December. In late November, it was reported by The Sunday Times that Ms Robinson pulled out of a literary event in the UAE in protest against the jailing of UK academic, Matthew Hedges. Princess Latifa is the daughter of Dubai's ruler Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. In March she fled the UAE and a video was circulated online in which she made allegations of abuse at the hands of her father. Until the release of these images, the 33-year-old royal had not been seen in public for more than nine months. The full statement from the UAE government says: ""On 21st December 2018, the UAE Mission in Geneva delivered a communique regarding H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum to the office of special procedures at the United Nations high commissioner for human rights. ""The communique responds to and rebuts false allegations and provided evidence that Her Highness Sheikha Latifa was at home and living with her family in Dubai. ""At the request of the family, on 15th December 2018, Mary Robinson, former United Nations high commissioner for human rights and former president of Ireland, met with Her Highness Sheikha Latifa in Dubai. ""Photographs taken during the afternoon they spent together have been shared, with their consent. During her visit to Dubai, Mary Robinson was reassured that H.H. Sheikha Latifa is receiving the necessary care and support she requires."" When asked by Sky News, the spokesperson for the UAE government would not clarify or add detail on what ""care and support"" entails. Lawyers working on her case cautiously welcomed the pictures, but raised concerns about the context. Princess Latifa's case sounds stranger than fiction, but has been accepted by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, while the UN group on enforced disappearances heard evidence on her case earlier this year. She attempted to escape with the help of French former spy Hervé Jaubert and long-time friend Tiina Jauhiainen. The murky story of what happened to a Dubai princess who attempted to flee her family After fleeing through neighbouring Oman, she made it onboard Mr Jaubert's boat, The Nostromo, and set sail for the Indian coast. The yacht was intercepted and those on board say they were beaten by armed men who boarded the ship and then detained in the UAE. Both Ms Jauhiainen and Mr Jaubert say Latifa shouted that she was seeking asylum in India but was taken onto a helicopter. It is the last time they ever saw her in person. ""Latifa was determined to leave Dubai... She said it was worth taking any kind of risk as she had literally had enough of her life in Dubai,"" Ms Jauhiainen told Sky News. Sheikha Latifa, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, planned to flee for years ""She was looking forward to the day impatiently and when with me it was the only topic we would talk about along all the things she wanted to do when she had what she had always wanted, her freedom,"" she added. Dubai have consistently said Latifa is alive. In response to the pictures, lawyers acting on behalf of Mr Jaubert and Ms Jauhiainen told Sky News: ""The recent photographs of Princess Sheikha Latifa published by Sky News on 24 December 2018 are, if verified, a welcome development. ""However, a number of serious questions still remain as to Sheikha Latifa’s whereabouts, her overall well-being and whether she remains detained all appear to be at issue and unanswered by the official statement of the United Arab Emirates."" Her lawyers questioned why no images where released in the nine months since Latifa was seen and questioned the timing of the photos. ""It is curious timing that following a highly critical BBC documentary the UAE authorities seek to silence further comment by terming this a private family matter,"" they said. More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The statement said Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers and the wider team ""look forward to confirmation"" from Ms Robinson and are waiting for ""further engagement from the United Arab Emirates in relation to this matter."" The lawyers added they ""noted with some concern"" that Ms Robinson has thus far not commented publicly on the visit."

Speaking about the birth of Jesus and the Christmas story, she will reinforce that theme, adding: ""I believe his message of peace on Earth and goodwill to all is never out of date. ""It can be heeded by everyone; it's needed as much as ever."" The Queen's broadcast has become a traditional part of Christmas Day and is a rare chance for Her Majesty to share her personal thoughts with people in the UK and across the Commonwealth. The palace does not explain the full meaning behind the message, leaving it open to interpretation, but the quotes released show a strong theme of unity and refer to the need to treat others with respect, and it does appear that the Queen may be referring to the recent chaos over Brexit and the divisions it has caused. Sky's royal commentator Alastair Bruce said: ""The UK has had two very significant referendums recently, first of all in Scotland and then on the Brexit question. ""And always with referendums they divide. ""It's very much the role of the monarch to steady the nation, and the Queen has done that here.

More than 125,000 people have signed our petition - have you? In a photograph released of the broadcast the Queen is sitting at a desk in the White Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace. It was filmed on 12 December, the day after the meaningful vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal was due to take place in the House of Commons. She is wearing an ivory and blue silk cocktail dress, with a lace overlay designed by her in-house dress designer Angela Kelly. She is also wearing a brooch given to her by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1966. On a table is a black and white photograph of her holding a young Prince Charles with Prince Philip alongside her. It was another big year for the Windsors. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex got married, Princess Beatrice married Jack Brooksbank, and the Queen welcomed two new great grandchildren with both the Duchess of Cambridge and Zara Philips having babies. Referring to her source of strength and encouragement, the Queen will talk of the importance of family, saying: ""Through the many changes I have seen over the years, faith, family and friendship have been not only a constant for me but a source of personal comfort and reassurance."" Amid rumours of a rift between the Cambridges and the Sussexes, both couples will be at Sandringham for the traditional royal festivities. Royal journalist Victoria Murphy said: ""We certainly will see all four of them going to church on Christmas Day and of course it does come amid suggestions that they've not been getting on, amid rumours of rifts over the past few weeks, months. ""But certainly if there have been any of these behind closed doors we won't see any sign of that on Christmas Day. ""I suspect we're going to see a family united, enjoying Christmas together."" The Queen travelled to Norfolk last Thursday to begin her annual Christmas stay at Sandringham."

The US losses followed US president Donald Trump comparing the US Federal Reserve to a bad golfer in yet another Twitter rant. The benchmark S&P 500 has dropped nearly 15% during December and the market is on track for its worst year since 2008. This month is also likely to be the worst December since 1931, when the US was in the grip of the Great Depression. Elsewhere, European shares were down nearly 14% year-to-date and on track for their worst year since 2008, with Brexit, Italy's contested budget and the US-China trade spat being blamed. Mr Trump's outburst comes at a time of increasing isolation for the president, with a dispute about the funding for his planned border wall prompting a government shutdown that is now in its third day. The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt! ""The only problem our economy has is the Fed,"" the president tweeted at around 3.45pm on Monday. ""They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders,"" he wrote. ""The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!"" The tweet heightened fears about the potential destabilisation of the economy by a president who wants control over the Fed. Mr Trump was expressing frustration that the central bank had raised its short-term interest rate four times this year. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the moves are intended to prevent the economy from overheating in a time of quick growth. Mr Trump's attacks have been interpreted as an attack on the political independence of the Federal Reserve, with many advising against the removal of Mr Powell. I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy! As well as attacking the Federal Reserve, Mr Trump targeted critics to his border wall plan and decision to pull US troops out of Syria in his Twitter tirade on Monday. Making a distinction between funding for border security, he said the wall would be built with ""shutdown money"". ""I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,"" he wrote. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

Her close friend Xinran Xue said: ""It is very sad news. Many people see her as a religious person and she was far more than that. It's a huge loss for the art world. She was a brilliant art critic."" Sister Wendy found fame as an unlikely TV star when she presented a series of BBC documentaries during the 1990s, including Sister Wendy's Odyssey and Sister Wendy's Grand Tour. She presented unscripted programmes from galleries around the world. Wendy Beckett was born in South Africa, before moving to Edinburgh as a child and joining a convent at the age of 16. In 1950 she was awarded a Congratulatory First Class degree in English literature from Oxford University and later taught in cities including Cape Town and Liverpool. She began studying art in the 1980s and decided to write a book on her passion to raise money for her convent. The result was 1988's Contemporary Women Artists and three years later, by which time she was already in her 60s, the BBC hired her to present a documentary on the National Gallery. Dressed in her black nun's habit, Ms Beckett stood in front of paintings and discussed them to the camera without script or autocue, relying on her knowledge and natural presentation style."

The Met chief made her controversial comments in a radio interview in which she was asked about a no-deal Brexit and said the UK worked closely with the EU on security at the moment. ""If we come out without immediately obvious replacements for those instruments, that will undoubtedly mean we will have to work incredibly hard on a bilateral basis with countries to try to get in place some kind of way of working together,"" she said. Emphasising that talks were ongoing, the Commissioner added: ""We've set up an EU co-ordination unit, absolutely. ""That is to help local forces to understand to how to work most effectively across Europe after we exit the EU, under whatever circumstances. ""Of course, we would hope we will have as much as possible of the instruments we currently have or something very similar as quickly as possible, in order to be able to keep our public safe and at the same sort of cost."" Asked if she was suggesting the consequences meant the UK would be less safe, Ms Dick replied: ""The consequences are that we will have to replace - and of course if there was a no-deal scenario that would be very difficult to do in short-term - some of the things we currently use, in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kind of things, we will have to replace as effectively as we can.

""But it must be clear to her and everyone working in our police and security services that leaving with the government's deal would not address those risks. It would be a huge mistake for anyone to think otherwise. ""The reality is that the government's plan will weaken UK participation in the European Arrest Warrant, making it harder to tackle cross-border crime, and offers no long-term guarantees at all of access to vital security databases. ""From a security perspective, by far the best option would be to go back to the public in a People's Vote with the option of keeping our current deal as EU members. That would keep the European Arrest Warrant and all database access and allow the UK to continue working with our European partners to keep the public safe."" Ms Smith was backed by Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, who said: ""It doesn't matter whether you voted to leave or to remain, you certainly did not vote to be less safe. Yet, now we know Brexit will do just that. ""The UK's top police officer is only echoing what we've heard from police forces across the country: that Brexit threatens the ability of police to catch criminals. No one can argue that would make us better off than if we stay in the EU. ""Continuing along these dangerous lines is criminal. The public need the final say on Brexit, with the option to stay and pool our safety with the rest of Europe."" But Mr Batten, who earlier this month survived a move to oust him as UKIP leader after appointing English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson as an adviser, attacked Ms Dick's comments. He tweeted: ""Two points: 1) When the UK withdraws from Europol's databases it can revert to Interpol's pre-existing databases. ""2) Why did Cressida Dick never point out the free movement of people also meant the free movement of criminals? That put us all at risk."""

It comes as passengers face widespread disruption to their plans over the Christmas break with lengthy closures and reduced services on key routes and at major stations, as well as one-day strike action on South Western Railway. Analysis of the latest ORR data by the Press Association showed the annual rolling average for punctuality has not been worse since September 2005. The PPM figure is based on whether a train arrives at its destination within five minutes of its scheduled time, or ten minutes for a long-distance service. The transport select committee has released a scathing report into disruption caused by the rollout of new train timetables Over the past year, problems have been caused by the ""Beast from the East"" cold snap followed by the summer heatwave, as well as the botched introduction of new timetables on parts of the network in May and a long-running industrial dispute. Below is a list of the proportion of train services missing the PPM for each train operating company for the 12 months to 8 December: Hull Trains 30.9% London North Eastern Rail 27.3% TransPennine Express 24.8% Grand Central 23.1% Northern 19% Govia Thameslink Railway 18.9% South Western Railway 18.6% Virgin Trains West Coast 17.9% Great Western Railway 17.5% CrossCountry 16.8% West Midlands Trains 14.6% Greater Anglia 13.1% ScotRail 12.7% Southeastern 12.3% Caledonian Sleeper 11.9% East Midlands Trains 10.9% Heathrow Express 10.0% Arriva Trains Wales 9.0% TfL Rail 8.2% Chiltern Railways 7.5% London Overground 6.4% c2c 6.2% Merseyrail 4.7% More than 130,000 have signed our petition - have you?

The changes would impact the food industry, who may have to adapt their recipes and cooking methods in order to lower the calorie content to comply with the regulations. The way food is labelled in stores will not change, nor will the current calorie guidelines for men (2,500 calories per day) and women (2,000 calories per day). In a statement to Sky News, Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""Children and adults routinely eat too many calories and severe obesity in ten to eleven year olds has reached an all-time high. ""These are early days in the calorie reduction programme but the food industry has a responsibility to act. The warning comes as a senior health official brands obesity 'the pandemic of modern times' ""We are consulting on ambitious guidelines to help tackle everyday excess calories - we welcome the industry’s feedback to help shape the final guidelines, due for publication next year."" Sky News understands the final guidelines are expected to be issued in the spring. Proposed calorie limits include: :: All convenience meals - 544:: All restaurant mains - 951:: Sandwiches - 550:: Salad (as a main) - 550:: Pizza - 1,040:: Portion of chips sold in supermarkets - 302:: Portion of chips in a restaurant - 416:: Onion bhaji - 134 The consultation comes after PHE announced earlier this year that it was encouraging food sellers and manufacturers to cut calories in their products by 20% by 2024.

2018-12-26,Shoppers will have to pay 10p for plastic bags in all shops across England under news plans set out by the environment secretary.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181227212552/https://news.sky.com/story/plastic-bag-charge-to-be-doubled-to-10p-in-all-shops-across-england-11592314,"The existing 5p charge is to be doubled and will no longer be restricted to large retailers. The new measures laid out by Michael Gove come as schools are being urged to end the use of single-use plastics by 2022. It is estimated around 3.6 billion single-use bags are supplied a year by small retailers exempt from the current 5p levy. Trade bodies representing around 40,000 small retailers have already launched a voluntary approach to the existing charge, but this accounts for less than one-fifth of England's estimated 253,000 small and medium-sized enterprises. The changes, which could come into effect in January 2020, are contained in a consultation which has been launched by the government. Theresa May announced in August there would be a consultation on changes to the plastic bag levy by the end of 2018 despite reported opposition from the Treasury and Chancellor Philip Hammond. Mr Gove said: ""The 5p single-use plastic carrier bag charge has been extremely successful in reducing the amount of plastic we use in our everyday lives. ""Between us, we have taken over 15 billion plastic bags out of circulation. The UN Committee on Climate Change has warned that we have just 12 years left to save the world from catastrophic climate change. ""But we want to do even more to protect our precious planet and today's announcement will accelerate further behaviour-change and build on the success of the existing charge."" The 5p charge was introduced in England in 2015, with the money raised going to good causes rather than government coffers. Nearly two billion 5p plastic bags were sold in the last financial year, figures from the government show. This is a stark reduction from 2014, when 7.6 billion carrier bags - the equivalent of 140 per person - were handed out solely by England's seven largest supermarkets. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said: ""We welcome the government's plans to extend carrier bag charging to all shops. ""This has been shown to be highly effective at reducing waste, whilst also raising money for local, national and environmental charities. ""Around half of small shops in England already charge for plastic bags voluntarily, with wider support for a mandatory charge."" Dr Laura Foster, head of Clean Seas at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), said she hoped there would be support for the move. The MCS has been monitoring the impact of the 5p charge since it was introduced in October 2015 and regularly provides evidence for government consultations. Dr Foster said: ""We are able to measure the impact of legislation and we've seen that since the introduction of the plastic bag charge in the UK the amount we find on the beaches has gone down. ""That's also been replicated by studies that have been done offshore - they've also seen a reduction in the amount of plastic bags they find. ""So we do know that legislation can directly impact on the amount we find on our beaches and in our oceans."" More than 130,000 have signed our petition - have you? Education Secretary Damian Hinds has called on school leaders to stop using items including plastic straws, bottles and food packaging such as cling film in favour of sustainable alternatives. He said: ""On my first school visit as education secretary almost a year ago, the very first question I was asked by a pupil was what we can do to limit the damage of plastic on the environment. ""Reducing our use of plastic clearly is an important and timely issue which has captured the interest and the imagination of everyone in society."" Mr Hinds is urging schools across the country to follow the lead of Georgeham Primary School in Devon, which is the first in the UK to achieve single-use plastic-free status. :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

2018-12-26,A drug-driver who was jailed earlier this year for killing two young boys died in prison on Christmas Day.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181227212552/https://news.sky.com/story/drug-driver-robert-brown-who-killed-two-boys-dies-in-prison-on-christmas-day-11591748,"Robert Brown, 53, was sentenced in April for mowing down Corey and Casper Platt-May, aged six and two, in Coventry in February. He was driving at more than twice the speed limit and had taken a cocktail of drugs. Brown was jailed after admitting all charges against him, including two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, but had his sentence increased in July from nine years to 10 and a half. The children were with their mother on the way to a park when they were struck by Brown's Ford Focus as they crossed MacDonald Road. A spokesman for Serco, which manages the prison in which Brown had been serving his sentence, said: ""We can confirm a prisoner died yesterday (Christmas Day) at HMP Dovegate and, as is normal, the death will be subject to a coroner's investigation."" Brown, of Attwood Crescent in Wyken, Warwickshire, didn't have a driving licence and was banned from driving at the time of the crash. He had taken cocaine, diazepam and zopiclone and was driving his Ford Focus at more than 60mph in a 30mph zone when he ploughed into the children and fled the scene. Judge Andrew Lockhart QC told Brown that his driving had been ""selfish and reckless"" and had ""torn this family apart"" at his sentencing. Speaking on behalf of the brothers' family, solicitor Rebecca Hearsey said at the time: ""Corey and Casper were everything to us and we will not get over losing them. ""To watch your children die in front of you is something no parents should have to experience. ""Our family should have had so many years ahead of us to create a lifetime of memories, but these have all been snatched away by Robert Brown."" Brown had 30 previous convictions for driving offences and had only been released from prison six days before the crash after serving half of a six-month sentence for having an offensive weapon. His passenger at the time of the crash, Gwendoline Harrison, 42, was jailed for six months after admitting assault intending to resist arrest and attempting to flee the scene."

A crater collapse on the volcanic island at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 5m (16ft) high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Bali. The disaster struck without warning, taking people by surprise in a country that regularly suffers landslides, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and heavy rain and high seas have hampered the search and effort. According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, more than 128 people are still missing. :: Indonesia tsunami: Grim rhythm as search for the missing begins Authorities have warned that the crater of Anak Krakatau remains fragile, raising fears of another collapse and tsunami. More than 130,000 have signed our petition - have you? There are also fears of a bigger eruption and many residents are already refusing to return to their communities over fears of another tsunami. The volcano has been rumbling on and off since July but has been particularly active since Sunday, spewing lava and rocks, and sending clouds of ash up to 3,000 metres into the sky. A thin layer of volcanic ash has been settling on buildings, vehicles and vegetation along the west coast of Java since late on Wednesday, according to images shared by the national disaster mitigation agency. Authorities said the ash was not dangerous but advised residents to wear masks and goggles when outside, while aircraft were ordered away. ""All flights are rerouted due to Krakatau volcano ash on red alert,"" the government air-traffic control agency AirNav said. The civil aviation authority said no airports would be affected. The capital, Jakarta, is about 155 km east of the volcano."

The picture was much rosier for stores in London, with shoppers visiting the West End expected to spend around £50m in the Boxing Day sales. That is according to the New West End Company, which represents more than 600 businesses in Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street. Chief executive Jace Tyrrell said the West End was enjoying a ""Boxing Day bounce"" with international tourists ""out in force driven by the weaker pound"" behind a rise in footfall year-on-year of 15% at its stores. According to Barclaycard, 26 December is the most popular day to shop during the Christmas sales period, with three in 10 people planning to take advantage of the deals on offer. Bargain hunters rose early to queue outside stores as the post-Christmas sales saw prices slashed by as much as 70%. Shoppers queued outside stores around the country before first light as stores swapped their festive window displays for huge signs promising hefty discounts. People were pictured inside shops with armfuls of half price clothes, with more than half a million shoppers are expected to descend on central London. Michael Ward, managing director of Harrods, said the store's butlers served customers hot beverages as they queued outside the building before the sales began. He told Sky News: ""We've already got queues outside every aspect of the building - people have been here since seven o'clock. ""Our butlers are just out serving them with teas and coffees - so we're going to have a very civilised but very good sale."" He said consumers are attracted to the department store on Boxing Day because they offer the ""exceptional"" and ""special"". Boxing Day still remains a key shopping day, with twice as much money spent on this day last year than Black Friday. The period between Christmas Day and New Year generated £12bn in sales, according to ShopperTrak. But retail experts Springboard said the decline in footfall on Boxing Day on three consecutive years indicates the lessening in importance of Boxing Day as a trading day. They said footfall up to midday was 10% lower than on 22 December, which was the peak trading day before Christmas this year, and 9.4% lower than on Black Friday. It has been a torrid year for retailers, with notable high street names such as Poundworld and Maplin falling into administration, Marks and Spencer and Debenhams announcing plans to shut stores, while Superdry, Carpetright and Card Factory issued profit warnings. Online fashion retailer ASOS also issued a profit warning on the back of a ""significant deterioration"" in sales growth. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? It is the latest big name to warn of the effects of weaker consumer confidence in the run-up to Brexit. But its statement also signalled there were bargains to be had for price-savvy consumers. While the sales will start in most shops on Thursday, John Lewis started its clearance on its website at 5pm on Christmas Eve. Argos also started its sale online on Christmas Day, as it did last year. Tech giant Currys PC World is set to slash its prices, with last year's deals including bargains on laptops, TVs, washing machines and fridge freezers. Samsung TVs were reduced by £700 and the price of the Lenovo IdeaPad was slashed by £220."

Ms Vine wrote that their son was ""stitched up a treat"" by doctors, who included consultant surgeon Edward Ibrahim. She said her son emerged on a Christmas Eve night ""excited at the prospect of some thrilling scars with which to wow the girls"" and was well enough to open his presents on Christmas Day.

2018-12-26,British officials have said three more migrants have been intercepted after attempting to take a small boat from France to Britain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181227212552/https://news.sky.com/story/three-more-migrants-intercepted-crossing-english-channel-in-small-boat-11591479,"The Home Office said the migrants were found overnight trying to cross the English Channel after 40 migrants were stopped in their attempts to make the journey on Christmas Day. Shortly after midnight on Wednesday, the Border Force was made aware that three male adult migrants on board a small boat had been rescued by the French authorities near Dover. The semi-rigid boat was 3.5 metres in size and was detected during a mission of surveillance of navigation around 16.4km (10 miles) from the French coast. The migrants, who presented themselves as Iranian, were transferred to the UK authorities and taken onshore at Dover by a Border Force vessel. They received a medical assessment before being transferred to immigration officials for interview. It comes after authorities were called to five separate incidents involving people presenting themselves as Iraqi, Iranian and Afghan on Christmas Day, including: :: A girl was among eight people who arrived in Folkestone, Kent, at around 2.40am;:: A child was among 13 people on a dinghy helped by Border Force off the coast of Deal, also in Kent, just before 7am;:: A Border Force cutter was deployed at 5.50am to help a dinghy which was heading for Britain with seven men and a woman on board. There has been a recent spike in small boat crossings that British authorities say are organised by smuggling gangs, with 86 people picked up in a two-week period in November. The Home Office has said it is working with French officials to try to shut down the people smuggling. It blamed the crossings on ""organised criminal gang activity"". ""We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk,"" a spokesperson said. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? It said it had ""deployed resources to deal with these incidents"", including sending Border Force cutters and coast patrol vessels to the stricken boats. British officials said all the migrants picked up in recent days have received medical aid. The children were taken to social services, the Home Office said. The rise in crossings corresponds with tighter border checks in France and crackdowns on migrant camps that have made it more difficult to reach the UK by other means. The Home Office says its work with French authorities and ""enhanced security measures"" have seen a 50% reduction in what it calls ""clandestine detections"" in the UK since 2015."

Mr Ahluwalia is expected to step down from the board of LKQ Corporation, the Nasdaq-listed company which bought ECP for £280m in 2011. Sources said the British subsidiary's management team - including chief executive Martin Gray and chief operating officer Steve Horne - had decided to follow Mr Ahluwalia out of the door. The company's head of trading is also said to have resigned. ECP executives are understood to have locked horns with their counterparts at LKQ over what one insider described as a ""swingeing cost-cutting programme"". Aimed at saving millions of pounds annually, the cost-saving drive comes after a 40% fall in LKQ's share price in the last 12 months.

Meanwhile, another six adult males were detained as they arrived on Shakespeare Beach, Dover, at about 8.30am. Also in Dover, a further eight men were seen in an inflatable boat off the coast of Dover about 15 minutes later and were also picked up by British officials. All those held by UK authorities were Iranian, according to the Home Office. On Boxing Day night, an additional 11 migrants had been seen by French authorities off the coast of Sangatte, near Calais, and were intercepted. It comes after three other migrants were intercepted during a Channel attempt on Boxing Day and 40 more were rescued on Christmas Day. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said: ""The number of incidents over recent days is deeply concerning. ""Some of this is clearly facilitated by organised crime groups while other attempts appear to be opportunistic. ""Attempting to cross the Channel in this way is extremely dangerous and they are putting their lives at risk."" The latest group to reach England - five men, one woman, two boys and a girl - are believed to have used a small boat, which was recovered at Dover. A stack of inflatable boats, all about 13-metres-long with small outboard motors, are piled up at a dock in Dover - and Sky News footage shows another similar craft being loaded onto a trailer and removed from a beach today. It is believed the latest boat to arrive had been pushed back out to sea after reaching land. The craft was about three miles off shore when it was spotted and the alarm raised. A helicopter was deployed to find the occupants, who were then picked up by police on a beach. Littlestone lifeboat station manager Matt Crittenden said: ""There were very scant details. We launched at around 1am and headed down and Rescue 163, the rescue Coastguard helicopter from Lydd, joined us."" Sky News' senior correspondent Ian Woods, who is on the Kent coast, said: ""The weather is very calm. The sea is incredibly still. ""All the locals here tell us they've never seen anything quite like this in December... conditions so still and calm as this."" He added that the kind of boats being used by migrants would not normally be much use in rough conditions, but they may be adequate for crossing the Channel in the current weather. ""They've obviously also bargained on the fact that, perhaps as it's Christmas, the shipping lanes might not be as busy as usual and there may be less security - although that is not actually the case. ""People in this area say there have been a lot of patrols, both out at sea and also the helicopter keeping an eye on things."" Speaking about today's rescue, Mr Crittenden added: ""I am sure it won't be the last that we go to... they are very desperate people."" While there are no official figures available, Sky News believes around 180 people attempted to cross the Channel in November. Some of those rescued have been suffering hypothermia. Over recent days, a crew from Dover lifeboat station was dispatched after up to eight migrants were spotted by passengers on the Spirit Of Britain ferry. Christmas Day saw migrants picked up in five separate incidents. Those on board the boats said they were from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, and at least two children were travelling with the groups. More than 130,000 have signed our petition - have you? On Boxing Day, British officials confirmed that three more migrants were intercepted after attempting to take a small boat across the Channel.

The UK charity Goodwill Caravan has been sponsoring Najib and organised crowdfunding to support him. Its founder Hanan Ashegh said: ""It's a miracle. ""He's got a straight back."" I've been following the plight of Najib Ali for nearly two years. When I first met and reported on him, Najib and his family were stuck in Greece unable to get the medical help they needed. Najib has undergone surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. The operation was carried out by orthopaedic surgeon Ramesh Naderajah. He told me: ""We use about 25 to 32 screws. ""It's a very complex operation. ""The key thing is that there are other bits of shrapnel in his back which can make the operation to straighten it more difficult."" Sky News filmed as the specialist team cut deeper and deeper into Najib's back to reveal his spine. They then used state of the art rods and screws to straighten his back carefully positioning and securing each one. Several hours in and the surgeons reached a huge fragment of shrapnel from the airstrike which was still lodged in Najib's back but was too deeply embedded to remove. The operations lasted for more than six hours. Najib has undergone rehabilitation at Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Middlesex. He is able to manoeuvre himself for the first time in nearly six years since the airstrike in Syria. Najib said: ""Before the operation my back was in pain. ""I'd cry all day because of the pain. ""And the pain would affect my knees, my body and my shoulders. ""Thank you everyone who donated and to the charity for helping me."" The procedure isn't a miracle cure enabling Najib to walk again but it has improved his and his mother's quality of life dramatically. More than 130,000 have signed our petition - have you? His mother Faten Sh'houd said: ""Najib was always on my lap. ""I've always carried him like a five-month-old baby and had to look after him. ""Before the operation everything was difficult for him.

Najib's situation has improved and I ask God to help him with his treatment so he can improve even more."" Goodwill Caravan's fundraising for Najib has finished but the charity says there are many more children in Greece who need their help. Founder Hanan Ashegh said: ""When we see Najib now he's almost unrecognisable. ""He's with a straight back. ""He can take a full breath. ""He can put on his top on his own. ""It might not sound like a big thing but before he could barely move his arm to move himself on the sofa when we first met him two years ago."""

Both men were in the running to be the first to traverse Antarctica without receiving resupplies or being powered forward by the wind. It took Capt Rudd, a father of three from Hereford, 56 days to complete the gruelling journey, hauling a 140kg sled for 925 miles. He did not have a single rest day as he ascended more than 6,000ft (1,830m) over sastrugi - wave-like ridges created by the wind - sustained by a ""grazing bag"" which included chocolate, nuts, and 200g of cheese and salami. The feat has been compared to pulling two adult males from London to Naples via the summit of Mont Blanc. Speaking to Sky News from his one man tent as he waited to be picked by a ski plane, Capt Rudd said he was ""elated and really happy"". Capt Rudd, a motor transport officer based at the Infantry Battle School in Brecon, Mid Wales, was not disappointed to come second, he said, because it was ""all about the journey"".  Day 54: FINISH LINE!!! I did it! The Impossible First ✅. 32 hours and 30 minutes after leaving my last camp early Christmas morning, I covered the remaining ~80 miles in one continuous “Antarctica Ultramarathon” push to the finish line. The wooden post in the background of this picture marks the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, where Antarctica’s land mass ends and the sea ice begins. As I pulled my sled over this invisible line, I accomplished my goal: to become the first person in history to traverse the continent of Antarctica coast to coast solo, unsupported and unaided. While the last 32 hours were some of the most challenging hours of my life, they have quite honestly been some of the best moments I have ever experienced. I was locked in a deep flow state the entire time, equally focused on the end goal, while allowing my mind to recount the profound lessons of this journey. I’m delirious writing this as I haven’t slept yet. There is so much to process and integrate and there will be many more posts to acknowledge the incredible group of people who supported this project. But for now, I want to simply recognize my #1 who I, of course, called immediately upon finishing. I burst into tears making this call. I was never alone out there. @jennabesaw you walked every step with me and guided me with your courage and strength. WE DID IT!! We turned our dream into reality and proved that The Impossible First is indeed possible. “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” - Nelson Mandela. #TheImpossibleFirst #BePossible A post shared by  Colin O'Brady (@colinobrady) on Dec 26, 2018 at 12:55pm PST Conditions in Antarctica were very unpredictable, Capt Rudd said. He explained: ""Some days when he sun's out and the winds are light and visibility's good, you'll be skiing along - it'll be minus 20 which I'm very comfortable at - and you'll thinking, 'This is fantastic.' ""(But) it can change in the blink of an eye, and suddenly you'll be at minus 35 in a 50mph wind in complete whiteout, having to stare at your compass for 12 hours to make sure you ski a straight line, thinking, 'This is absolutely horrific.' Capt Rudd said the trek had been emotional and was dedicated to his close friend and fellow British explorer Henry Worsley, who died near the end of his attempt of the same journey in 2016. Writing in his blog, Capt Rudd said: ""I've just heard that the American Colin's finished. Fantastic, well done to him. He'd pushed really hard all the way across and done extremely well, so congratulations to him."" More than 130,000 have signed our petition - have you? Mr O'Brady had been told he may never walk again after an accident burned his legs in 2008. After finishing, he wrote: ""I'm going to sit tight here at the finish and wait for Lou to complete his crossing. ""Captain Louis Rudd is one of the most accomplished polar explorers to ever live and a distinguished member of the British Armed Forces. ""It has been an honour to strive for the same goal - the first to complete a solo, unsupported, unaided crossing of Antarctica. ""I'm looking forward to greeting him here at the finish line and congratulating him on his extraordinary accomplishment. ""We will step into the history books together as the only two people to have completed such a crossing."" Capt Rudd returned the praise: ""I want to say a huge congratulations to Colin - what an achievement. ""To be honest it's a minor miracle that both of us have completed a journey that's been attempted before, but nobody's ever managed it and then, lo and behold, in one season two of us attempting it. ""The fact that both of us have finished is absolutely fantastic,"" he added."

A caller from the US wanted to know which contestant had been voted off Strictly Come Dancing the previous night, while a caller in the Netherlands had questions about the plot of Braveheart. Although most British embassies will provide a list of local lawyers if you find yourself arrested overseas, they are not used to being asked for a list of women you can marry - as was the request from a man in Argentina. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Meanwhile, a man in Thailand wanted diplomatic backing as he argued against paying for a massage. He had fallen asleep during it, after all. Someone in the Canary Islands wanted a new hotel room after a stray cat urinated on his bed, while a man in New Delhi wanted to know if the British High Commission was selling vegetarian sausages. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""I can regretfully confirm that the Foreign Office isn't able to offer advice on vampires, rogue stray cats or Strictly contestants. And our capacity to deploy veggie sausages remains sadly lacking. ""But in all seriousness, getting into trouble abroad can be daunting and upsetting. ""If you find yourself in an emergency in another country, contact the nearest British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate and our consular staff will do everything they can to help."""
2018-12-30,"Thousands of number plates are being cloned by criminals, with innocent drivers receiving fines for offences they did not commit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181230203811/https://news.sky.com/story/why-motorists-are-getting-fines-for-crimes-they-did-not-commit-11594652,"A senior police official says cloned plates are being used for ram raids and other illegal activities - with fraudsters concealing their identity while racking up speeding fines and congestion charges. In other cases, criminals using stolen number plates have filled up cars with petrol and driven off without paying. David Jamieson, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, said: ""People stealing number plates is a very considerable problem. ""We're seeing thousands of plates being stolen just in the West Midlands - Merseyside, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire are seeing huge rises as well."" He is urging car manufacturers to ""play a part"" in making it more difficult for criminals to clone plates - and says it is ""ludicrous"" that vehicles are still being made where plates can pulled off or unscrewed with ease. Adam Shirley, from Farnborough, has received speeding tickets, parking fines and unpaid toll bills totalling more than £2,000. He believes his plates were cloned after criminals spotted a picture of his car on the internet, which he had bought through an online dealership. ""The police told me the most likely scenario was that they stole a car, Googled the same make and colour of that car, and my licence plate would have then appeared in the search results,"" Mr Shirley explained. ""Then, they just copied the plate and put it on their vehicle… it seems a really easy thing to do."" Mr Shirley claims he has received fines about once a fortnight for the past six months, leaving him with no choice but to contest the letters and point out differences between his car and the one used by the criminals. He added: ""It took the DVLA about three months to issue me a new licence plate and I had to pay to get them to issue it. There has not been a huge amount of help. ""The DVLA and the police need to enforce the law when it comes to printing licence plates."" In another case, Matthew Shaw said he started getting fines linked to his private number plate - months after his car was written off in an accident. He believed that his car was being scrapped, but it seems his private plates were sold along with the wrecked vehicle. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""The police did the best they could do, but it took about six months to get the car off the road. It was a massive inconvenience - I had to take time off work to appeal all the fines. ""The entire situation was really frustrating - salvagers and insurers just don't want to know. Unfortunately, you're left on your own to sort it out, there's no one there to help you. It's nuts."" It is hard to know exactly how widespread the problem of cloned plates is. Anyone who suspects their vehicle's number plates have been cloned is advised to contact the police, the organisations sending fines, and the DVLA. However, Commissioner Jamieson warned: ""The number of police officers we have, especially on car patrol, has reduced and you cannot do everything."""

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has already declared ""major incident"" following a recent spike in attempts by migrants to cross the Channel from France. He held a telephone call with French interior minister Christophe Castaner on Sunday to agree moves to deter further small boat crossings. These include: :: Stepping up joint patrols, increased surveillance, and greater use of a UK-France Coordination and Information Centre near Calais :: Greater sharing of resources, the disruption of organised trafficking groups, and a raising of awareness of the dangers of crossing the Channel :: A face-to-face meeting in January between Mr Javid and Mr Castaner Mr Castaner is understood to have described to Mr Javid how French officials dismantled an organised criminal gang earlier this month, which had been trafficking people through France. On Monday, Mr Javid will lead a cross-government meeting in response to what has become a growing issue. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We have stepped up deployments of our coastal patrol vessels along the south-east coast. ""We know there is organised criminal gang activity behind these attempts to cross the Channel, and the government is working with domestic and international agencies, including the French authorities, to coordinate our response."" Here's an in-depth guide Sky News understands Border Force was alerted by local residents at around 7.30am on Sunday to the incident at Kingsdown. The group of six men were discovered to be Iranian and each has been given a medical assessment and transferred to immigration officials for processing. Scores of people have recently been intercepted attempting to cross the Channel, with two boats carrying 12 men from Syria and Iran brought to shore at Dover on Friday and 40 migrants detected on Christmas Day. There are fears it is only a matter of time before there is a migrant death in the Channel from a capsized dinghy. Mr Javid this weekend cut short a family holiday to help deal with a situation he described as a ""grave concern"", as people make ""reckless attempts to reach the UK in unsafe boats and treacherous conditions"". ""It is vital we strike a balance between protecting them and protecting our borders, ensuring we do not encourage more people to make this dangerous journey,"" he added. Dimanche diplomatique 🇫🇷 🇬🇧 En lien avec mon homologue britannique @SajidJavid, nous nous coordonnons pour renforcer notre action pour lutter contre les traversées de la Manche effectuées par certains migrants irréguliers sur de petites embarcations au péril de leur vie. pic.twitter.com/bDLImai5QJ Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said the UK's armed forces ""stand ready"" if needed to prevent further crossings. The Immigration Services Union, which represents Border Force staff, has said the two ageing Cutters available for patrols are ""woefully inadequate"". The National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned that more ""highly dangerous"" attempts by migrants to reach the UK are likely. Tackling organised criminal gangs behind attempted Channel crossings is an ""operational priority"" for the NCA, who are working with their French counterparts. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes visited Dover on Saturday, but suggested deploying more resources could in fact prompt further attempted crossings. She said: ""It is feasible that were we to put additional craft (out) they might act as a magnet - encouraging people to make a perilous crossing."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn posted on Twitter on Sunday: ""We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety."" And Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Mr Javid for a ""flawed"" response to attempted migrant crossings. She wrote in the Sunday Mirror: ""He has still to explain exactly how the government plans to handle these mass criminal operations in British waters. ""The Home Office's flawed strategy has been to focus on deterring refugees, thinking that the issues in the Mediterranean would never reach our shores. ""While the Tories wax lyrical about control of our borders and being tough on security, they cannot seem to get a grip on criminal smugglers operating on a few hundred miles of coastline, in one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world."""
2018-12-30,The Channel migrant story has dominated the news in recent days - so what has been going on? Here's an in-depth guide.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181230203811/https://news.sky.com/story/why-are-more-migrants-trying-to-cross-the-channel-this-christmas-11594750,":: Why has Home Secretary Sajid Javid called the situation a ""major incident""? There has been a sharp rise in December in the number of migrants being picked up by UK authorities while trying to cross the English Channel in small boats such as dinghies. Scores of people have been intercepted, including 12 men on two boats who were brought to shore at Dover last Friday. Forty migrants were detected on Christmas Day. There are fears it is only a matter of time before there is a migrant death in the Channel from a capsized dinghy. :: Why has there been an increase in the number of migrants trying to cross the Channel? It is believed the recent mild weather and calm sea conditions have led to more attempted crossings. Also, smuggling gangs could be trying to exploit the holiday period, where there may be fewer border staff on duty than usual. :: Who are the migrants? Many of them are thought to come from Iran and others from war-ravaged Syria. Some have said they would rather die trying to make the sea crossing to the UK than return to France. It is reported that one reason for the increase in Iranians is the effect of sanctions imposed on their country by the US. Iran's economy has been squeezed and many young people are struggling to get work, despite being well-educated. There has also been an increase in the number of French police raids on Calais camps, dispersing the inhabitants. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? :: What is the UK government doing to try to stop the migrants' Channel attempts? Mr Javid, who is returning to work early from a family holiday, declared a ""major incident"" on Friday and said the situation was ""of grave concern"". He said people were ""gambling their lives in reckless attempts to reach the UK in unsafe boats and treacherous conditions"". Mr Javid has appointed a ""gold commander"" to oversee the situation and give daily updates. There are currently two Border Force cutter boats available for patrol but there have been calls, including from Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, for similar UK vessels to be brought back from the Mediterranean to intercept traffickers' dinghies. A spokeswoman for the Immigration Services Union (ISU), which represents Border Force staff, said the two ageing cutters available were ""woefully inadequate"". Mr Javid said he was keeping the number of Border Force vessels in the Channel ""under close review"", but admitted there was ""no one easy answer"" to the situation. He spoke to French interior minister Christopher Castaner by telephone on Sunday. The latter wrote on Twitter: ""In touch with my British counterpart Sajid Javid. ""We are co-ordinating to strengthen our actions to combat Channel crossings undertaken by certain irregular migrants on small boats, at peril of their lives."" :: Could the Royal Navy help? Some MPs want the navy to be deployed. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the armed forces were ready to offer help if needed. He told The Sunday Telegraph: ""We have not had any requests as yet but if the Home Office is in need of armed forces support then our navy, air force and army stand ready to assist."" :: What is France doing to crack down on its side? The head of the National Crime Agency-led Invigor organised immigration crime task force, Chris Hogben, said UK-French co-operation has led to dozens of attempted crossings being prevented. He said three suspected ""facilitators"" were arrested and charged in France last week and will face trial in the new year. He added: ""Over the last three weeks, our French colleagues have disrupted numerous attempts, recovering at least 95 migrants including nine children, and arrested seven people caught attempting to facilitate these crossings."" However, a volunteer who works with migrants described how difficult the French coastline is to police. Maya Konforti of the charity Migrants Inn said there were around a dozen spots between Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk, along a 30-mile (48km) stretch of coast, which would be suitable launch spots for migrant boats. :: Will there be more attempted crossings in the near future? Mr Hogben has warned more crossings are ""likely"" early next year. He said: ""Working with our French partners, we would anticipate further arrests over the coming weeks and also more attempts to reach the UK are likely."" :: Could Serbia be linked to the current situation? A Serbian refugee organisation claims the migrants arriving in the UK are among thousands who flew to Serbia after the country started offering visa-free access to Iranians in August 2017. The move was to increase tourism and trade between the countries but the visa scheme led to claims it was being abused by migrants seeking access to western Europe. Around 40,000 Iranians are believed to have flown to the Balkan nation by the time the scheme ended in October. Reports said direct flights from Tehran to Belgrade were full when they arrived in the Serbian capital but were empty when they returned. :: How have other countries tried to tackle the migrant situation? Italy's new right-wing government has taken a noticeable hard-line against migrants. A bill passed in September will make it easier to expel migrants and strip them of citizenship. The new legislation is ""a step forward to make Italy safer"", interior minister Matteo Salvini said, adding it would help Italy ""be stronger in the fight against the mafia and (people) smugglers"". His government has moved to stop rescue boats actively saving migrants at sea and bringing them to Italy's shores, arguing that other European Union countries need to do more. Hungary has also taken an anti-migrant stance. Its parliament has passed a series of laws that criminalise any individual or group that offers to help an illegal immigrant claim asylum. The legislation restricts the ability of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to act in asylum cases and was passed in defiance of the European Union and human rights groups."

Sky News takes a look at some of those celebrated for their achievements this year. :: Cave divers who saved trapped Thai boys British divers who played a part in the daring operation to rescue 12 boys trapped in a cave complex in Thailand have been decorated for their actions. The world held its breath as a multinational team of specialists helped guide each youngster and their coach out of the underground system. Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, who were the first divers to reach the children, have been awarded the George Medal - the second highest civilian gallantry award. Sixties model Twiggy is given a damehood in the honours list for services to fashion, the arts and charity Ex-pat Vern Unsworth, 63, who is suing Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk for labelling him a ""paedo"", has been handed an MBE. Joshua Bratchley and Lance Corporal Connor Roe received the same. Christopher Jewell and Jason Mallinson, 50, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, have been given the Queen's Gallantry Medal for exemplary acts of bravery. :: Northern Ireland's first female firefighter Heather Smart, Northern Ireland's first female firefighter, has been given an MBE in the New Year's honours. She joined the service in 1991 and retired earlier this year. Ms Smart is seen as a trailblazer who paved the way for the 62 women currently working as firefighters in Northern Ireland. Alan Walmsley, interim chief fire officer, hailed her as a ""passionate advocate and ambassador for female firefighters"" who ""helped change the culture of the organisation at that time"". He called the award a ""fitting recognition for her achievement as Northern Ireland's first female firefighter"". :: London and Manchester terror attack responders Four leading medics have been recognised for their work in the aftermath of terror attacks in London and Manchester. Dr Malik Ramadhan operated through the night on 12 victims of the London Bridge attack at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel on 3 June 2017. He was awarded an OBE for services to healthcare. Paul Woodrow, operations director for the London Ambulance Service, also got an OBE for his role in organising care for victims of the attack in London and the Grenfell Tower fire. Colin Kelsey, who led the NHS response to the Manchester Arena suicide bombing, also received an OBE. Receiving the same honour was Peter Boorman, who helped deal with the fallout from the two terror attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire, the Wannacry cyber-attack on the health service and the Croydon tram crash in 2016. :: Father of a domestic violence victim The father of a nurse brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend has been made an MBE for services to victims of domestic abuse. John Clough and wife Penny, who was made an MBE in the 2013 New Year honours list, have thrown themselves into campaigning since the death of their daughter Jane in July 2010. Mr Clough, of Barrowford, Lancashire, is an ambassador for the National Stalking Advocacy Service, which is calling for a national register of serial stalkers and domestic abusers. The Cloughs also campaign for more refuge funding and are patrons of domestic abuse help service SafeNet. Last year, it opened Jane's Place, a refuge for those with complex needs such as mental health issues and drug or alcohol misuse. :: Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter Dr Helen Pankhurst, a great-granddaughter of suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, has been given a CBE for services to gender equality. She is a senior adviser at CARE international, the international agency fighting global poverty. 2018 marks 100 years since women were able to vote for the first time in a general election. Dr Pankhurst said earlier this year she ""feels the need to keep campaigning because my name gives me a voice - when they hear it, people are more likely to listen"". :: Welsh rocker fighting against cancer that has struck three times Welsh rocker Mike Peters has been honoured for his charitable fight against the cancer which has transformed his life three times. He has been given an MBE for services to charity having raised thousands to help the struggle against cancer, and wants to keep saving lives ""one helping hand at a time"". Peters founded rock band The Alarm in 1981, and had a successful career on stage, opening for the likes of Bob Dylan. He first overcame cancer in 1996, before again suffering from the devastating disease after developing leukaemia in 2005. His wife Jules was then diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016. Peters founded the Love Hope Strength Foundation, which aims to raise money for cancer treatments through music events. He thanked everyone who has supported him in the battle against cancer, saying: ""My being awarded this MBE is all down to their collective brilliant efforts. This MBE really is for them."" :: Businesswoman behind African childbirth charities A businesswoman and philanthropist who set up childbirth charities and helps with hospital ships has been made a dame in the honours list.

But in a statement released on Sunday evening, the Premier League said Ms Dinnage - who has spent more than 20 years working in TV, starting at MTV and also working at Channel Five - would no longer be taking up the position. The statement read: ""Despite her commitment to the Premier League in early November, Susanna Dinnage has now advised the nominations committee that she will not be taking up the position of chief executive. ""The committee has reconvened its search and is talking to candidates. There will be no further comment until an appointment is made."" More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? She had been hailed as ""the outstanding choice"" from a ""very strong field"" of candidates for the role by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, who led the recruitment process alongside Burnley counterpart Mike Garlick and Leicester City chief executive Susan Whelan. She had been set to become the first female chief executive in the history of the Premier League, which has become the most lucrative football league in the world thanks to some record-breaking TV deals. Mr Scudamore announced he was leaving his post after 19 years in June and Premier League clubs agreed to pay him a £5m bonus as a farewell gift. He has combined the roles of chairman and chief executive since 2014 and leaves halfway through a season currently being led by Liverpool, who are seven points clear of champions Manchester City at the top of the table."
2018-12-30,A Russian state-run TV station has been criticised for sending chocolate models of Salisbury Cathedral as a Christmas gift. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181230203811/https://news.sky.com/story/russian-station-rts-chocolate-salisbury-cathedral-christmas-gift-slammed-11594126,"The chocolate was sent to a number of people in the media and others in what RT said was to mark one of the ""biggest news stories of the year"". Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury in March. John Glen, MP for Salisbury, said: ""This is bizarre behaviour but to be expected."" A picture of the chocolate cathedral circulated online after one of the recipients, Russian channel TV Dozhd, also known as TV rain, posted a picture of the edible gift on Twitter. Salisbury councillor Jo Broom said the gift was ""in very poor taste"". ""It's very regrettable that somebody would see fit to do something like this, and is quite disrespectful to those that were caught up in the incident."" How the Salisbury poisoning unfolded RT - previously called Russia Today - broadcast interviews with two men named as the suspects in the Skripal poisonings. Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov claimed they were just tourists visiting Salisbury. More than 130,000 have signed our petition - have you? The UK government said Russia's GRU spy agency was responsible for the poisoning. The Skripals survived the poisoning which involved the nerve agent novichok. However, Dawn Sturgess, who had no Russian connections, died in July after she was exposed to the same substance. RT said the chocolate model had been sent as a gift ""in the spirit of the holiday season"" to ""multiple friends, peers and partners in the media sphere and beyond"". It added: ""As a news organisation, every year we put together presents that reflect one or several of the biggest news stories of the year. ""In 2018 we chose to highlight the internationally-resonant interview conducted by RT's own editor in chief."" Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning."
2018-12-30,Campaigners are urging the government to do more to rid the cancer risk from processed meats such as bacon and ham.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181230203811/https://news.sky.com/story/vast-majority-of-bacon-contains-cancer-causing-chemicals-11594749,"They say there is a ""growing consensus of scientific opinion"" that nitrites in processed meats result in carcinogenic nitrosamines - believed to be responsible for bowel cancer. Nitrites are added to cure the meats - helping preserve them and enhancing the colour and flavour. A 2015 World Health Organisation report classed processed meats as a group one carcinogen that could cause an additional 34,000 cancer deaths a year. That could equate to 6,600 bowel cancer cases ever year in the UK, according to new analysis. A top NHS doctor and a senior food scientist have now joined politicians, including Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, to call for action. ""There is a consensus of scientific opinion that nitrites in processed meats result in the production of carcinogenic nitrosamines - and therefore increase cancer risk for those who regularly consume traditional bacon and ham,"" they said. ""For these reasons, we are concerned that not enough is being done to raise awareness of nitrites in our processed meat and their health risks, in stark contrast to warnings regularly issued regarding sugar and fattening foods. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""A united and active front is needed from policy-makers, the food industry and the cancer-care community. ""We must work together to raise awareness of their risks and encourage the much wider use of nitrite-free alternatives that are safer and can reduce the number of cancer cases."" The warning comes from director of the Queen's University Belfast Institute for Global Food Safety, Professor Chris Elliott; senior cardiologist Aseem Malhotra; and leading nutritionist Chris Gill of the University of Ulster. Dr Malhotra said there was a failure to act on evidence that nitrites are harmful. ""The vast majority of bacon on sale today still contains these dangerous carcinogens,"" he said. ""Not only this, reminiscent of the tobacco industry's stance in the 1990s, some of those in the business of making and regulating food continue to claim that health risks from nitrite-cured meat are negligible. The evidence says otherwise. ""Government action to remove nitrites from processed meats should not be far away. Nor can a day of reckoning for those who continue to dispute the incontrovertible facts. ""The meat industry must act fast, act now - or be condemned to a similar reputational blow to that dealt to tobacco."" Dr Malhotra said nitrites were not essential to preserve processed meats and had been eliminated from Parma ham production, while some producers such as Nestle in France were using alternative natural processes. Others backing the call for action include chair of the parliamentary group on food and health, Conservative MP Sir David Amess, and chair of the Commons environmental audit committee Mary Creagh."

Between now and 2021, 7,000 new vehicles are being introduced by train companies as part of an industry-wide plan to provide 6,400 extra services each week. A total of 11 train operators are introducing new carriages in 2019, which will bring about the retirement of some of the oldest trains on the network, first introduced by British Rail in the 1970s. Passengers are being promised more seats, improved accessibility, mobile phone charging points, wifi and air conditioning. Those operators introducing new carriages are the Caledonian Sleeper, Govia Thameslink Railway, Great Western Railway, Greater Anglia, Hull Trains, London North Eastern Railway, London Overground, Northern, Scotrail, South Western Railway, and Trans Pennine Express. At least £13.8bn is being invested by the private sector in new rolling stock. Robert Nisbet, regional director of the Rail Delivery Group, told Sky News the new carriages ""should mean a better experience for passengers"". ""Not just what they see when they get on board these carriages - more seats, better seats, wifi that actually works, toilets that are also working,"" he said. ""It also means the trains should be more punctual as well, because they'll be newer, fresher rolling stock. ""This is not just in specific pockets around the country, this is all over the country. From Scotland, northern England, London, the South West, Wales as well."" More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

Last month, it was announced the price of train tickets will rise by an average of 3.1% in January, just slightly less than the latest wage growth figure of 3.2% for the three months to September. Meanwhile, train punctuality fell to a 13-year low in the 12 months to December, latest figures showed."

And it would appear the sharp rise in alcohol-related hospital attendances may be linked to the Three Lions' win, said an NHS England spokesman. The 711 figure compared to an average of 386 alcohol poisoning cases on a normal Saturday. Patients admitted to hospital for excess drinking are monitored until the alcohol has left the system, taking up medics' time and energy.

Fridays and Sundays are also among the worst days for alcohol poisoning cases, with hospitals dealing with an average of 302 and 388 cases respectively. The figures come as the health service gears up for what is usually one of the busiest times of the year for alcohol-related incidents as revellers prepare to see in the new year. The festive period often sees a jump in the number of people needing emergency treatment after excessive drinking. More than 10% of all cases at emergency departments are related to drunkenness, with Friday and Saturday nights sometimes having seven in 10 patients going to A&E because of drink."

2018-12-30,Ariana Grande has reportedly turned down a damehood offered following her response to the bombing at her Manchester Arena concert.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181230203811/https://news.sky.com/story/ariana-grande-politely-turns-down-damehood-11594819,"The US pop star, 25, is said to have been offered the top award after she visited victims of the terror attack in hospital and organised a charity gig. But even though the singer was honoured to be asked by a committee, she felt it was too soon to accept in the wake of the atrocity that killed 23 people including suicide bomber Salman Abedi. Grande was physically unharmed in the 22 May 2017 attack but has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. The Sun quoted a source as saying: ""Ariana was flattered but said it was too soon. She explained she was still grieving. So were scores of families. ""She feared some affected might see it as insensitive. The committee wrote to her but she politely said no."" According to the paper, another source added: ""She was deeply moved and honoured. She didn't decline it as such but explained it was not the right time to accept."" Sky News has contacted her representatives for a comment. Last month, the singer described the Manchester Arena terror attack as something ""that seems impossible to fully recover from"". In the fourth episode of her docu-series, Ariana Grande: Dangerous Woman Diaries, the star shared a letter about the attack. More than 130,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The letter said: ""I'm writing to you this 22 February 2018. It's been eight months since the attack at our show at the Manchester Arena. ""It's impossible to know where to start or to know what to say about this part. 22 May 2017 will leave me speechless and filled with questions for the rest of my life. Every year, some choose to avoid the pomp and ceremony of a royal mention ""Music is an escape. Music is the safest thing I've ever known. ""When something so opposite and so poisonous takes place in your world that is supposed to be everything but that... it is shocking and heartbreaking in a way that seems impossible to fully recover from."" A couple of weeks after the atrocity, Grande set up the One Love Manchester benefit concert on 4 June which raised money for victims and their relatives. The singer performed along with a number of stars including Take That, Little Mix, Justin Bieber, and Liam Gallagher."
2018-12-30,"""Numerous instances"" of illegal drone activity at Gatwick led to the airport being shut in the run-up to Christmas and it was not a police drone, according to Sussex's top officer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181230203811/https://news.sky.com/story/some-gatwick-drone-sightings-may-have-been-police-drones-chief-constable-says-11593854,"Chief constable Giles York appeared to try to clarify earlier comments in which he said some of the drones spotted near the hub during the festive disruption may have belonged to police. He said his force was using ""all available resource"" to identify and bring to justice those involved in the incident. Officers are looking into ""relevant sightings"" by 115 witnesses, including 93 from ""credible witnesses"" such as a pilot, airport staff and police officers. Police have searched 26 potential launch sites near the airport, but have not located the device that disrupted about 1,000 flights on 19 and 20 December. The incident ruined the travel plans of more than 140,000 people. Mr York said: ""It is established that the incident, which led to widespread travel disruption, was caused by numerous instances of illegal drone activity at the site between 19 and 21 December. This was not a police drone. ""Police, supported by a range of partner agencies and working closely with Gatwick Airport, are currently examining relevant sightings by 115 witnesses - 93 from credible witnesses, people used to working in the busy airport environment, including a pilot, airport staff and police officers. ""This includes further information generated as a result of a public appeal for information and more than 1,000 house to house enquiries."" Two drones found near the airport have now been ruled out of the investigation. Police previously said it was ""possible"" there was no drone at all - though they later backtracked. Mr York told the BBC earlier on Saturday that he was ""absolutely certain that there was a drone flying throughout the period that the airport was closed"". He said: ""Of course, we will have launched our own Sussex Police drones at the time with a view to investigate, with a view to engage, with a view to survey the area looking for the drone, so there could be some level of confusion there."" He added that new military technology was in place in Gatwick to tackle rogue drones. Gatwick Airport is offering a £50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Two people who were arrested over the disruption have now been released without charge. Mr York said he was ""really sorry"" for the pair who said they felt ""violated"" after being questioned in custody for 36 hours before being freed. But the chief constable said he was ""convinced that the grounds for arrest - the lawful suspicion - in the first instance was well founded"". He added: ""I'm really sorry for what he has experienced and the feeling of violation around it. ""I am really sorry for what he went through, but the reason why we held him was so that we could dispel everything in the first instance. ""What might have been worse as an experience for him would have been to be released under investigation still. ""We are able to exhaust all our lines of inquiry on that first instance and, however hard it is, able to release him from police custody saying he is no longer a suspect in this line of inquiry. ""That's why we took the time - in order to allow him the best opportunity to put his life back on the rails."""
