2018-11-04,A major Brexit donor has denied claims that funding came from Russia - and admitted the UK may have been better staying in the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105023623/https://news.sky.com/story/major-brexit-funder-arron-banks-uk-may-have-been-better-to-remain-11544655,"Arron Banks is being investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA) after the UK's elections watchdog found ""reasonable grounds to suspect"" he was ""not the true source"" of £8m loaned to an organisation that ran the Leave.EU group. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections Mr Banks's funding of the Brexit campaign is the biggest donation in British political history. In a series of TV interviews on Sunday, the businessman attacked what he called a ""witch hunt"". He told Sky News: ""The £8m came from a UK company, the cash was generated in the UK. ""I run an insurance business with half a million customers, that's the size of Manchester. ""We employ 1,000 people and we turn over £250m of premium a year. ""The press reports are slanted but then we know what this is about, it's the Remain campaign trying to tarnish the Brexit campaign and it's a fairly obvious move."" Mr Banks said the source of the loans was Rock Services. The Electoral Commission has said it suspects the cash instead came via another company called Rock Holdings, which is incorporated in the Isle of Man. This would have made it an ""impermissible"" source of money under UK electoral law. ""There was no Russian money and no interference of any type,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""I want to be absolutely clear about that."" Mr Banks also suggested he had changed his mind on Brexit, telling Marr: ""The corruption I have seen in British politics, the sewer that exists and the disgraceful behaviour of the government over what they are doing with Brexit and how they are selling out, means that if I had my time again I think we would have been better to probably Remain and not unleash these demons."" Mr Banks revealed he will be publishing bank statements on Monday that show ""no money came in from overseas foreign sources"". He previously told MPs in June that Rock Services ""is a treasury function"" and ""just delivers the cash"". ""It is just a service company. The actual loan came from another one of my companies that was delivered in,"" he told the House of Commons' digital, culture, media and sport committee in June. On Sunday, Mr Banks denied fresh newspaper allegations that he might have misled parliament over links between one of his insurance companies and the Leave.EU campaign. Mr Banks revealed he had ""seconded a small number of people to run a call centre in Bristol"" but stressed this was properly declared to the Electoral Commission. He disputed the Electoral Commission's status as an independent body, claiming ""they're all Remainers"" - and he also described the organisation as a ""complete shambles"". One of the self-styled ""Bad Boys of Brexit"", Mr Banks has disclosed how he enjoyed a ""boozy lunch"" with the Russian ambassador in 2015, which preceded further meetings. One of those meetings was three days after Mr Banks, his associate Andy Wigmore and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met newly elected US President Donald Trump. Mr Banks denied any business links with Russia as he stated he is ""not going to apologise for having lunch with a diplomat, I've had lunch with many diplomats"". He added: ""I have no connection with any Russian businesses, I've done no deals in Russia, I've had lunch with the Russian ambassador a couple of times."" Repeating his allegation of a political motive to the investigation into himself and Leave.EU, Mr Banks disagreed the UK's exit from the EU should be postponed until the NCA probe is completed. ""The whole point of this exercise is to have a reason to try to delay Brexit,"" he said. The Electoral Commission is not responding to Mr Banks' comments."

The identity of the ticket holder has not yet been revealed but the winning numbers in Friday's draw were 05, 15, 17, 37, 44, while the winning Lucky Star numbers were 07 and 11. The jackpot had been rolling over since the start of October, making the total winnings £76,369,806.80. The payout is someway behind that won by the UK's biggest lottery winners Chris and Colin Weir, who scooped £161m in 2011. But the jackpot is large enough to put the ticket holder in the top 10 of winners. Assuming the ticket holder is just one person or family, their wealth puts them on a par with stars like musician Ed Sheeran, who is worth £80m, Take That star Gary Barlow, also worth £80m, Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood (£75m) or former Bee Gees frontman Barry Gibb (also £75m).

2018-11-04,This week marks the centenary of the end of a war which cost the lives of a staggering 16 million people.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105023623/https://news.sky.com/story/st-symphorien-war-cemetery-resting-place-of-first-and-last-british-casualties-of-first-world-war-11544377,"World War One, the Great War, ranks among the most deadly wars in human history; it was the conflict in which modern warfare was invented, and the major battles which came to define its horror and its hopelessness were all fought in one small stretch of land in northeastern France and western Belgium. Just to the southeast of the Belgian town of Mons, there is a place which seems perfectly to capture the courage and the sacrifice of so many compelled to fight, but inescapably too, the pointlessness and the waste. On Friday, Theresa May will visit St Symphorien, marking the start of a series of high-profile events reflecting the centenary. They will include a Peace Forum in Paris organised by French President Emmanuel Macron and attended by world leaders including Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. I've visited St Symphorien a number of times and each time I find it profoundly moving. It's one of 23,000 cemeteries and memorials cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) and it contains the graves of 513 soldiers; 284 Germans, 227 British and two Canadians. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections My guide for this visit is CWGC historian Max Dutton. We walk past a row of German graves - some with names, others without. There are 40 Germans here and 65 Commonwealth soldiers who's identity isn't known. ""It's hard not to be moved by coming to a War Graves Commission's cemetery,"" Max tells me. ""It's hard to think of anything but the sacrifices of these men and what it meant for them on a personal level, for communities back home as well, losing all of their loved ones out on the Western Front,"" he says. We walk to the bottom end of the cemetery and a row of white headstones. One has a cluster of poppies at its base. ""This is John..."" Max says. We are at the grave of Private John Parr. Max then tells the story of the teenage soldier who had lied about his age to join up. ""John was in the Middlesex Regiment before the First World War and he comes across with the British Expeditionary Force. They are searching for Germans here near the Belgian town of Mons. ""And he goes out on his bicycle and they spot the Germans and his mate goes back to tell base. ""But John is killed in action and he becomes the very first British combat casualty on the western front dying on 21st August 1914."" We then turn and walk just 10 feet to the next row of headstones. ""This is George. George is the very last British soldier to die in combat during the First World War. ""He's a barman from Leeds. He was here in these fields in 1914 - perhaps he'd met John. ""But he fights throughout the First World War and then is killed just an hour and half before the minute hand ticks to 11 o'clock."" Private George Ellison was the last British soldier to be killed, but others, from other nations died after him. On Armistice Day - 11 November 1918 - more than 10,000 soldiers, from both sides were killed or injured. The very last Commonwealth soldier to die was a Canadian called George Price and he too is buried in St Symphorien. According to war records, Private Price was shot and killed at 10.58am on 11 November 1918, just two minutes before the armistice came into effect. And so they rest just yards apart; the first and the last, and in between them, 1.1 million British and Commonwealth soldiers lost; two million German soldiers. Behind each name on each headstone is a story. Private John Parr's story is reflected in words from his mother Alice now held in the National Archives. In September 1914, from the family home in Finchley, just weeks after the war started she wrote to his regiment. ""I have not heard from him at all..."" she wrote. ""The war office can tell me nothing..."" ""I should be very grateful for any information as to his whereabouts...."" It's a letter from a mother about her boy. Alice Parr was to be the first to grieve; the first of so many from countries all over the world to lose their sons in this war. The first and the last lie in St Symphorien because the first and the last major battles were fought in the fields surrounding the cemetery. Four years of fighting - no ground gained and so many lives lost. ""It began here and it ended here and between those points, one point one million people died for the British and Commonwealth forces alone. But it go anywhere?"" Max Dutton asks. ""Geographically, no. Did it change the world? Absolutely. Did it change the world for the better? Almost certainly not. ""After all, the Second World War is just over the horizon,"" he says. ""I recommend everybody should come and visit the Western Front. There is nothing like coming and seeing where these men fought and died and now rest forever... what are the lessons to be learnt? ""I think everyone has to come and take their own lessons,"" he says."

After being forced to disembark an earlier plane due to a technical fault, the aircraft that eventually departed Orlando was diverted due to what BA called ""a minor technical issue"" and was forced to land in New York. Images of children sleeping on the airport's floor and complaints of having no food, drink or accommodation were shared on social media and described to reporters. ""BA's customer service was disgusting, absolutely abhorrent,"" passenger Sarah Wilson told the BBC.

BA has issued an apology, saying: ""We appreciate that this was an exhausting and frustrating experience for our customers, and we have apologised for the long delay to their flight."" The incident coincided with the New York marathon which meant hotels were busier than usual. Despite allegations from customers that they were left to sleep on the floor of the terminal and given no food or drink, a spokesperson for BA said: ""Customers were rebooked where possible and while there were limited hotel rooms available, our teams on the ground cared for customers in our first class lounge providing bedding, food and drinks to ensure they were comfortable during their stay.""

2018-11-04,Work has started in Britain on building on a robot vehicle that will be sent to look for life on Mars.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105023623/https://news.sky.com/story/life-on-mars-work-starts-on-british-built-robot-to-explore-red-planet-11544543,"The European Space Agency's Mars rover is being constructed in Stevenage with the aim of exploring the Martian surface in 2021. It has a drill to probe up to two metres under the surface of Mars and has instruments on board that can examine the samples it finds. The 300kg robot vehicle is capable of travelling 2cm a second for at least 90 days, but scientists hope it will remain active for as long as the latest American rover Curiosity, which landed in August 2012 and is still exploring. Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections Liz Seward, senior strategist at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said it was a first for the European space project. ""It's part of a big plan called the global expedition road map,"" she said. ""We've got robot expeditions going to the moon and Mars and the plan is to do humans to the moon next and Mars after that in 2030. ""What's really exciting is that this week we will be sending part of the Orion spacecraft to America, which is the European contribution to people going to the Moon, in the next few years."" The Orion spacecraft is a European-American joint venture which is designed ultimately to take humans to the Moon, Mars and other destinations in the solar system. Airbus, which bases its space systems division in Stevenage, is responsible for building Orion's service module and the ExoMars rover project. Ms Seward said the exploration of Mars by robots should pave the way for humans to follow within the next few decades. ""I definitely think we can explore Mars; colonisation is tricky - it's a very harsh environment,"" she added. ""But the plan at the minute in the next decade or two is to look at how people can live in space and use the moon as a test ground and then sometime after 2030 we will have people exploring the Red Planet."" The European Space Agency plans to launch its Mars rover on its journey in the summer of 2020, with the aim of seeing it land in the spring of 2021. Whereas previous expeditions have looked at the chemistry and geology of the Martian surface, Ms Seward said the European rover will be examining its potential biology. A prototype of the rover, nicknamed Bruno, was brought on to the Sky campus on Sunday to illustrate what the vehicle is capable of. It came ahead of the launch of the new six-part second series of the National Geographic channel's Mars programme, produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer and featuring interviews with Elon Musk among others. The show will look at how it will be possible to live on Mars and will tackle subjects like the tension between scientific exploration and the commercial opportunities such missions will open up. Previous American Mars rovers have discovered fossilised cracks in mud and sediments that suggested the presence of liquid water in Mars's past, other signs that led the team to conclude habitable conditions on the planet lasted millions of years and key elements that could have provided the building blocks for life. :: The second season of Mars starts on Sunday 11 November at 8pm on National Geographic."

Rooney said on Twitter: ""I am truly humbled and hugely excited to play for England at Wembley again. Winning my 120th - and final - cap will be a special moment for me."" Here's what @WayneRooney had to say about the USA game being dedicated to @FoundationWR:https://t.co/Twyg6vLvN3 The former Manchester United and Everton player, England's record goalscorer with 53 goals in 14 years with the Three Lions, moved to America in the summer when he joined Washington club DC United. The game against the USA, his 120th senior appearance in an England shirt, will be a one-off farewell performance. It will also raise money for the Wayne Rooney Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of disadvantaged children. It is understood he will start the match on the bench before coming on as a substitute in the closing stages so supporters can show their appreciation for his years of service to the national side. Rooney, the former Manchester United and Everton forward, announced his retirement from international football in August 2017.

2018-11-04,"The name Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust conjures up the image of a group of highly conservative Scottish accountants, sitting in a dusty old office in Edinburgh's financial quarter, poring over Dickensian-style ledgers as they cautiously invest their money.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105023623/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-century-old-scottish-fund-made-a-1000-return-on-alibaba-11542687,"That stereotypical image might have fitted the bill when, in 1909, Augustus Baillie and Carlyle Gifford launched the Straits Mortgage and Trust Company with the intention of investing in mortgages on rubber plantations in Malaysia and Sri Lanka. It changed its name to Scottish Mortgage and Trust Company four years later as it moved its investment strategy towards the United States and away from Asia and rubber interests. But today there is nothing Scottish about this investment trust at all, other than the fact it is run by Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based fund manager. And it certainly doesn't invest in mortgages anymore. In fact, Scottish Mortgage Trust is the largest quoted investment trust in the UK and a member of the FTSE-100. Its market capitalisation of £6.9bn makes it bigger than household names like Marks & Spencer, ITV, Easyjet and Royal Mail. It has achieved that status with a decision taken about 15 years ago by James Anderson, who took on management of the trust in 2000, to focus on technology stocks. In his early years, Mr Anderson focused the trust chiefly on emerging markets, plus some solid old UK-based blue-chips such as British American Tobacco and GlaxoSmithKline. Yet the portfolio is today almost exclusively comprised of tech stocks, as confirmed by today's half-year results, in which it revealed a net return after tax of £1.2bn - up from £868m in the same period last year. The fund's biggest shareholding is Amazon, which comprises 10.5% of the portfolio, while its second-biggest holding is in the California-based genetic research company Illumina. Other significant shareholdings are in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth; Tencent, the Chinese tech giant; Baidu, the Chinese search engine; Tesla, the electric carmaker and Netflix, the entertainment provider. The period on which the company was reporting today falls before the stock market turbulence of October in which tech stocks, in particular, were battered. Shares of Amazon fell by 20% during the month and Alibaba by 14%. Mr Anderson addressed this in the results statement with this observation: ""[Six months] is too short a time over which to judge the success or otherwise of this investment approach. The value of the portfolio can and will fluctuate over such short periods. We are inclined to view such times more as an opportunity than a cause for serious concern."" More interesting was that, for the first time, the trust provided details of its strategy on investing in unquoted companies which, as it noted, would ""not normally be accessible to public equity market investors"". It began investing in unquoted companies in June 2010 and the managers said today that, since then, such holdings had returned 17% if only the period in which they remained unquoted was included. If the period after they floated on the stock market was included, they said, that figure increases to 30%. It added: ""Put another way, from June 2010 when the managers made their first unquoted investment to the end of September 2018, the entire Scottish Mortgage portfolio generated a total return of 344%, but the total return from just the subset of holdings that had started out as unlisted investments over the same period was 419%. For context, the FTSE All-Share World Index's total return over the same period was 163%."" Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections Among the trust's biggest hits down the years, by adopting that investment approach, has been Alibaba. It reckons to have achieved a return of more than 270% between its first investment in the Chinese company in 2012 and its flotation - still a US stock market record - in September 2014. Include the period since Alibaba came to market, however, and the total return rises to more than 1,000%. But Scottish Mortgage is not only interested in these companies for the investment return they generated. At least as important, the managers argue, is the access to the management of those companies and the insight they get from them. As an example, they cite Daniel Ek, the founder of music-streaming business Spotify, another of the trust's big investments. They add: ""[There are] benefits of being able to develop relationships in this way with those at the companies which are driving significant changes in their industries. ""For private companies, such insights are not available to purely public equity investors, yet, for example, understanding the business model and growth of Airbnb is crucial to thinking about the future of the hotel and broader travel industry, as well as that particular company. ""Hearing the thoughts of Jack Ma at Alibaba, both before and after the IPO in 2014, has been critical to understanding the development of the consumption economy within China. ""There are more benefits too in terms of the ability to access new investments. This can be direct…alternatively, it may simply be by virtue of earning a reputation in the sector for being long term constructive shareholders. ""The relationship developed with Alibaba as a private company and then the managers' steady support through the inevitable market volatility in the share price, post-IPO, led to the managers getting the opportunity to invest a significant amount into Alibaba's financial technology company, Ant Financial. ""This business is driving the digital provision of a wide range of financial services in China, but it has the potential to become a global, financial services platform business. It is hardly an undiscovered gem but few can actually gain access to invest."" As for the outlook, the managers quote the Alibaba founder and chairman, Jack Ma, who they readily admit is cleverer than them: ""Recently, the global economy has found itself in a state of turmoil. Uncertainties abound in trade relations, consumer trends, stock markets and the manufacturing industry. US-China trade tensions create increased risk of instability.…our past experience tells us there are huge opportunities behind the anxiety and friction. ""The only question is how we should pivot. Monumental challenges give rise to monumental opportunities."" This is not a cheap company for ordinary investors to invest in. Its net asset value (NAV) per share at the end of September - crudely put what shareholders would get, per share, if the trust sold all of its holdings and wound itself up - stood at 527.7p on 30 September. The NAV will obviously have fallen since but, on that date, the share price stood at 541.3p. It is rare to see shares of investment trusts trading at a premium to their net asset value but the premium has been narrowing of late. The shares were today trading up by almost 3% at 495p. And the point is that this is a fund invested for the long term. Movements in its valuations from one six-monthly period to the next are not really that meaningful."

2018-11-04,"The trial of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who is accused of running the world's biggest drug cartel, is about to begin in the US with anonymous jurors and high security.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105023623/https://news.sky.com/story/trial-of-drug-lord-joaquin-el-chapo-guzman-to-begin-in-us-with-anonymous-jury-and-high-security-11544671,"It is alleged that he spent a quarter of a century smuggling more than 155 tonnes of cocaine into the United States. The mammoth trial in a Brooklyn federal court starts on Monday, will cost millions of dollars and is expected to last more than four months. Years have been spent piecing together evidence against Guzman, 61, who was extradited from Mexico in 2017 after twice escaping prison - first hidden in a laundry cart, then slipping down a tunnel that reached his prison shower. Guzman has been branded the world's biggest drug lord since Colombia's Pablo Escobar, who was dubbed ""The King of Cocaine"" and was one of the wealthiest men in the world until police shot him dead in 1993. Legal experts say the case against Guzman is water-tight and could see him being sent to a maximum security prison for the rest of his life. The Sinaloa cartel that Guzman founded in 1989 is still hugely powerful and his co-defendant Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada remains at large. Jury selection will take place amid tight security conditions reserved only for the most dangerous defendants. US district court judge Brian Cogan will preside over the process behind closed doors. The 12 jurors, with six alternates, will remain anonymous and will be escorted by US marshals to and from court every day. The jury will determine whether Guzman - the father of two whose nickname means ""shorty"" as he is only 5ft 2ins tall - is guilty or not of 11 trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges. According to the indictment, the Sinaloa cartel, which Guzman is accused of leading from 1989 to 2014, became ""the largest drug trafficking organisation in the world... with thousands of members"". During Guzman's reign, the cartel's empire expanded across the globe, stretching from the Americas to Europe and Asia. It is alleged that from 1989 to 2014, the cartel smuggled at least 340,892 pounds (154,626 kilograms) of cocaine into the US, as well as heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana, raking in $14bn (£11bn). Guzman's wealth from drugs was so great that he was on Forbes magazine's list of billionaires but he dropped out in 2013 after spending much of his money on protection. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections In a secret meeting with actor Sean Penn which the Hollywood star wrote about in Rolling Stone magazine in 2016, Guzman boasted: ""I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world. I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats."" Guzman was born in 1957 in the Mexican town Badiraguato - where several drugs lords operated. He was recruited by Guadalajara cartel boss Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, known as ""The Godfather"" of Mexico's modern drug cartels. After Felix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, Guzman's Sinaloa cartel began its meteoric rise. Guzman is pleading not guilty but the government has presented a wealth of evidence that includes more than 300,000 pages and at least 117,000 audio recordings. The trial, which one expert says will cost the US taxpayer more than $50m (£38m), will hear several hundred witnesses testify. Some of the informants have already been absorbed into the US witness protection programme and given new identities and homes around the country. Guzman has been held in solitary confinement in New York since Mexico extradited him and he spends 23 hours a day in his cell. The only visitors he is allowed are his three lawyers and twin seven-year-old daughters - the judge banned his 29-year-old beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel, from visiting. He has complained that his cell is too small and that he is not in good health. Arrested for the first time in Guatemala in 1993, Guzman spent more than seven years in a Mexican prison before his first escape in 2001. He was arrested again by Mexican marines in February 2014 but escaped 14 months later before being re-captured in January 2016. His story has been the subject of numerous documentaries and a Netflix series."

Across America, hundreds of thousands came to express their unbridled anger. They were collectively incensed by the man who'd been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, who had called women fat pigs, dogs and slobs and bragged about grabbing them by the genitals. His reward? The highest office in the land. For left leaning women, the 2016 election was a referendum on misogyny. America might seem okay with it - they were not. Since then women have mobilised. Poll after poll puts left-leaning women as the most energised demographic. Record numbers are running for public office. Twenty-three women are running for Senate seats and 237 are vying for House of Representatives seats. Of that total, 75% are Democrats. Donald Trump | A Divided America Kara Eastman is one of them. She feels that just by putting herself out there she is inspiring younger women. She's running on a progressive agenda in a swing district in the republican state of Nebraska. From what she's seen on the campaign trail, that female fire is still burning. ""Just the number of volunteers that I have on my campaign everyday - I'm still floored when its a Monday afternoon and we've got all these people making phone calls and knocking on doors,"" she said. ""I think that energy is still up there. I do think people are energised by this campaign but also just by their desire to bring America back to being our country."" Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation process was a fever pitch moment for progressive women: a brave survivor telling her truth - ultimately dismissed by the ruling patriarchy. For the first time, the majority of the Democratic Party's nominees are women, minority, LGBTQ and first-time candidates But female cries over Kavanaugh were not a unified chorus. I met a group of politically engaged Republican women for lunch in Omaha, Nebraska. They said they were just as incensed over the way this decent family man was treated. Connie Kretchmer agreed with President Trump that it was all a hoax. ""I think it was staged - it was intended to be their first step towards discrediting the president and his choices,"" she told Sky News. Voters in the United States will go to the polls on Tuesday to cast their ballots in a set of elections that could have far-reaching implications for Donald Trump Her friend Mary Jane Truemper said she doesn't go in for identity politics. ""I don't have to look to any president to define me as a woman or tell me what I'm capable of doing,"" she said. What matters to these women is the economy and a tough line on immigration, and they believe Donald Trump is delivering what they want. But if anger is the motivating emotion in US politics right now, liberal women have the edge. With more running for office than ever before - women candidates are likely to get more women out to vote. I've seen that first hand on the campaign trail - candidates welcomed by female voters clearly energised by seeing a woman on their doorstep asking for their vote. Democratic female candidates for the 2020 presidential race are starting to emerge. Senator Elizabeth Warren is probably the most high profile. Her combative anti-Trump tactics have been criticised but her bold approach is also inspiring women across America. Her campaign mantra is ""Listen up Mr President - do you hear that sound? Tick tick - tick tock - democracy is coming."" I asked her if she's concerned that if women don't deliver in the midterms this moment will be written off. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections She said: ""Look, I've been listening to this 'they're going to write off women' ever since the day after Donald Trump was sworn in and women put together the biggest protest rally in the history of the world. ""Understand this about women: We're coming off the bench and nobody's going to tell us to sit down and shut up ever again."" If women don't turn out in droves and don't win across the board there will likely be those who say the so-called ""Year of the Woman"" didn't deliver. Despite the visceral anger, this could be a slower burn than those driving this tide would like. But for many, particularly younger women, this is a moment of opportunity and hope for a future where they feel more represented. Even modest gains could mark the beginning of a new path."

2018-11-04,Health secretary Matt Hancock has ordered a review of the long-term treatment of people with learning disabilities or autism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105023623/https://news.sky.com/story/review-ordered-into-barbaric-treatment-of-patients-with-autism-and-learningdisabilities-11544681,"Mr Hancock has asked hospital inspectorate the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to open an urgent investigation into practices including the use of seclusion and segregation of patients within secure hospitals. The health secretary's intervention comes after coverage of the treatment of more than 2,300 people with autism or a learning disability currently detained in secure hospitals, known as Assessment and Treatment Units (ATUs), since 2015. Earlier this week a Sky News investigation revealed that at least 40 people have died while admitted to an ATU in the last three-and-a-half years. It also exposed the plight of one man who has spent 18 years detained in an ATU 100 miles from his parents' home to which he was originally admitted for just nine months. Mr Hancock is known to have been particularly concerned at the case of a 17 year-old girl kept in seclusion in an ATU, whose father is only able to communicate with her through a hatch when he visits. He has ordered an urgent NHS England review of her case, and following a meeting with her father, who has detailed her treatment on social media, has ordered the CQC to look at practices in the sector. It follows a Sky investigation that shows that targets for moving patients from Assessment and Treatment Units are being missed.
 In his letter to the chief executive of the CQC Mr Hancock writes: ""Since becoming Secretary of State for Health and Social Care I have become increasingly concerned about the use of seclusion settings for those with autism and learning disabilities. ""Under Section 48 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 we are requesting that you immediately initiate a Care Quality Commission thematic review into the practice of prolonged seclusion and long-term segregation for children and adults with a mental illness, learning disability or autism in secondary care and social care settings. ""In the circumstances I request that this review be expedited and completed as quickly as is feasible. I look forward to seeing the findings of this work to ensure that we can eliminate inappropriate restrictive practices and ensure that vulnerable people supported by health and social care are accorded the best possible care."" Last week Mr Hancock told Sky News that he was ""not happy"" with the lack of progress on a government promise to close up to half of the beds in ATUs, and said some of the cases highlighted were unacceptable. The use of restraint in ATUs, including seclusion, medication and physical restraint, has soared in the last two years, with more than 26,000 incidents of restraint in 2017. NHS England say the increase may be explained by better reporting by institutions. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections Sir Stephen Bubb, who has written two reviews of the government's progress on ATUs, told Sky News restraint was ""barbaric"" and should be outlawed. Government policy is to move people with a learning disability or autism into community care settings, but many are trapped in ATUs or similar institutions. People are supposed to be admitted to ATUs for nine to 18 months, but the average length of stay is five-and-a-half years."

Embedded with the police, you get a real sense of the scale of the problem. Drug addicts walk the street, looking to score. The police are on first name terms with most of the users and with many spending up to £400 a day on drugs, some end up stealing or dealing in order to fund their habit.

He's since been released, but is still addicted and homeless. The drugs he takes are known as ""snowballs"" on the street - a mixture of crack and heroin. He is desperate to get clean, but there is no money for him to go into rehab. His legs are swollen and covered in scars from where he has over-injected. He tells me how he now has a hole in his groin that he could fit his finger into. He has been using for years. ""Before I knew it I was addicted and to fund my habit I started selling,"" he told Sky News. ""I sold for the best part of 15 years. I thought I was untouchable. It's just greediness. If I am honest, if I am truthful, jail gets me a bit well. I put a bit of weight on. A bit of routine. Three meals a day."" A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We want everyone across the country to get the help, treatment and support they need, and we are committed to doing more to reduce alcohol and drug-related harm. ""We are giving local authorities £16bn over the current spending period to provide public health services, including drug support and treatment."""

The couple told Sky News they believe the slide buckled because too many children were climbing up to the top at the same time and they did not see anyone supervising numbers on the ride. They both praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying they arrived quickly and that the high number of community police officers were able to help manage the situation. They said the scene was ""very calm"", adding: ""It was awful, but it wasn't a disaster where everyone was screaming."" Andy Datson, 23, was at the funfair and told Sky News: ""There were lots of kids on the floor next to the inflatable slide. ""I don't want to speculate but the only obvious thing that happened is it gave way on the side and they fell."" Mr Datson said he saw about 40 children on the top of the slide, which he thought was around 25ft to 30ft high, and that he was unable to see anyone supervising it. ""[The children] were doing what they liked, running and jumping when they wanted."" Speaking to Sky News from Woking Park, Adam Morris of Eagle Radio, who was hosting the fireworks event, described the mood after the incident as ""very sombre and ""very quiet"". He said that after he made the announcement for people to evacuate they did so quickly and calmly. One of the organisers, Michael Holden, from Woking District Rotary Club, said they were ""very distressed and upset"" by what had happened, adding that their thoughts were ""very much with the children affected and their families"". He said that, although it was ""too early to speculate"" on the cause, the organisation was co-operating with police. ""I don't think crowds were an issue tonight, merely the way that particular ride was operated."" Anne Cantelo, who was with her six-year-old granddaughter, said: ""An announcement came over at 7.50pm, the fireworks were due to start at 8pm and we were told to evacuate due to a major incident. ""The inflatable was still up so it could not have collapsed. There are few fairground rides here for 12,000 people. There were a lot of children on the rides and it was very difficult for parents to supervise them. ""This ride is very tall, 20ft to 30ft high so if children fell from the top, it's terrible."" The organisers have pledged to conduct ""a full review"" into the incident and apologised for the ""for the short notice cancellation of the Fireworks Extravaganza, caused by a serious accident which occurred in the funfair area during the build up"". Some attendees were criticised for asking for a refund on their tickets within hours of the slide's collapse. Woking Park is likely to remain closed on Sunday. The Health and Safety Executive is going to investigate."

The revelation of the critical role played by former cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy, who served four prime ministers, underlines the influence he had behind the scenes at the heart of government. Few doctors and nurses will know this but there would absolutely not have been an extra £20 bn for the NHS without Jeremy Heywood’s tireless working behind the scenes. One of many examples of his extraordinary service to us all. Smart, loyal and decent, we will sorely miss him The respected Whitehall mandarin, who been cabinet secretary since 2012 and head of the home civil service since 2014, retired less than two weeks ago following medical advice. Prime Minister Theresa May said Sir Jeremy, who was 56, would be ""sorely missed"". ""He worked tirelessly to serve our country in the finest traditions of the civil service and he is a huge loss to British public life,"" Mrs May said. ""I will always be grateful for the support which he gave me personally and will remember his achievements across his career as we regret that he did not have the chance to offer his talents for longer in retirement."" In recognition of his distinguished service, the PM had nominated Sir Jeremy for a life peerage as Lord Heywood of Whitehall. Mr Hunt said in a Twitter post: ""Few doctors and nurses will know this but there would absolutely not have been an extra £20bn for the NHS without Jeremy Heywood's tireless working behind the scenes. ""One of many examples of his extraordinary service to us all. Smart, loyal and decent, we will sorely miss him."" Sir Jeremy had previously served as principal private secretary to prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and worked as chief of staff to Mr Brown and Downing Street permanent secretary to David Cameron. The father-of-three revealed earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with cancer in June 2017, but had stayed in post amid the ensuing political turmoil following the shock general election result. In a statement, Sir Jeremy's wife Suzanne paid tribute to a ""wonderful father"" who ""crammed a huge amount into his 56 years"". She said: ""He saw it as a huge privilege to work so closely with four prime ministers and two chancellors and was unwavering in his efforts to help each of them reach their goals. ""He was always conscious of the need for civil servants to see the world through ministers' eyes while at the same time respecting the boundaries between politicians and civil servants. ""Away from his work, he inspired admiration, respect and affection in his many and diverse group of friends and returned it to them. ""Jeremy could light up any room or conversation and loved hosting a good party."" So sad to hear of the death of Jeremy Heywood, my successor. He was a great, dedicated civil servant who worked tirelessly for his country, his political masters and his colleagues. My thoughts are with his family who have supported him so well. Mr Blair said: ""He worked with more prime ministers and at a more senior level than any civil servant in recent memory and served us all with integrity, distinction and infinite commitment. ""The British civil service and all of us who worked with him will miss him deeply."" Mr Brown added: ""The country has lost a leader of exceptional ability, unquestioned integrity and - as we saw in the way he fought his illness - remarkable courage."" Sir Jeremy's predecessor Lord O'Donnell wrote in a tweet: ""He was a great, dedicated civil servant who worked tirelessly for his country, his political masters and his colleagues.

Jeremy was a wonderful public servant and he did a huge amount to hold governments together at very difficult times. I obviously knew him very well personally. ""People will not be aware of quite how many remarkable things he did to solve crises, to deal with some of the most difficult problems and as a very honourable public servant to hold people together and to make sure that the government frankly didn't do stupid things on many occasions and to make sure there were solutions. ""His contribution to public life for all governments, whatever your politics, his contribution to public life was immense and I think we all owe him a debt of gratitude."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""He was a superb public servant. He was brilliant in getting his head around complicated problems."" Sir Mark Sedwill, who succeeded Sir Jeremy as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, said: ""Jeremy was the exemplary public servant. We will miss him more than we can say, and will be the poorer without his advice, leadership and extraordinary insight."""

2018-11-04,No ministerial resignation is easy for a prime minister - but for a leader trying to steer her party though one of the trickiest periods in recent political history it's the last thing she needs. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105023623/https://news.sky.com/story/tracey-crouch-quits-baffled-tory-mps-digest-another-resignation-11542163,"Tracey Crouch was well-liked, popular and had the support of Labour MPs - a rare feat in a parliament where party politics matters more than ever before. During her time as minister for sport and loneliness she united colleagues over serious and difficult issues as well as demonstrating she has personality - her popular posts on Instagram showed just how much she loved her job. As a result, her departure over government plans to introduce a lower stake for fixed odds betting terminals in October next year instead of April has united her party in disbelief. Baffled MPs said it made no sense. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections Even some political journalists - always desperate for a good resignation story - didn't really believe she would be forced to step down, convinced the Treasury would find a compromise to allow her to stay. In her resignation letter Ms Crouch took aim at a decision to delay the changes ""due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests"". She also warned two people will take their own lives every day over gambling addiction and explained knowing the impact of such a decision meant there was no way for her to stay. But while she may not be a household name, Ms Crouch's decision to leave government over the issue has, according to some, highlighted a political blindspot at Number 10. A ministerial source said the decision not to change course and bring forward the changes rather than risk a resignation was short-sighted. And it has inflamed tensions among backbench MPs who fear the prime minister is refusing to focus on anything but Brexit and had become complacent after days of largely positive coverage for the chancellor's budget. Most pressingly, the row over Mrs May's Brexit position may have fallen quiet over the last couple of days but it hasn't gone away. Just a week ago her critics on the Tory backbenches were warning as many as 40 MPs had written letters calling for her to leave. Their biggest gripe? That the prime minister doesn't listen to their concerns and instead ploughs on with her own plans without consulting colleagues. Reigniting that particular row by allowing a popular minister to walk out of government just days before more key Brexit talks over an issue which the government backs, could put Number 10 in a tricky position in the days to come. Government sources said it would have been impossible to bring forward changes to fixed odds terminals and that a date for the policy had never been announced, so it had not been delayed. But that is unlikely to ease the concerns of those who fear Mrs May's refusal to change course, even on an issue that has widespread support, is a sign of things to come as Brexit talks fire up again."

Mr Ballard, who was a keen rugby player, fell into a coma for 420 days after contracting a strand of meningitis called eosinophilic meningoencephalitis. Most people are said to recover from the illness, but he suffered a severe infection in his brain. Mr Ballard, who used a wheelchair, was left as a paraplegic meaning he was paralysed from the waist down. He died aged 28 on Friday after years of medical complications. Rat lungworm is a parasite found in rodents which passes its larvae into the animals' faeces. Snails and slugs can then become infected after ingesting it. Earlier this year, Mr Ballard's friend Jimmy recalled the night of the party. He told the Australian current affairs show The Project: ""We were sitting, having a bit of a red wine appreciation night, trying to act as grown-ups and a slug came crawling across. Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections ""The conversation came, 'should I eat it?' ""Off Sam went. Bang. That's how it happened."" Mr Galvin said he apologised to his friend for not stopping him from eating the slug. He added that when he did Mr Ballard ""started bawling his eyes out"". Another friend Michael Sheasby spoke of the first time he walked into the hospital room where Mr Ballard was being treated. He said: ""When I walked in, he was very very gaunt, and there were cables everywhere - it was a big shock."" Lisa Wilkinson, who hosts a Sunday edition of The Project, said Mr Ballard was ""surrounded by his family and loyal, loving mates"" before his death. She added that his last words to his mum were ""I love you"". His mother Katie Ballard told the Daily Telegraph in Australia how tough life had been for her son after the dare. She said he was unable to eat for himself and needed help going to the bathroom. Mrs Ballard has also said she doesn't blame the boys for their dare or her son for going through with it, adding they were just ""being mates"" on the night it happened."

Now there are just 139. During that time, there were £60m of cuts, UKAT has stated. One such centre, Chandos House in Bristol, has helped thousands of people over the years, but in a matter of weeks it will close its doors for good because of funding cuts. ""Most of these guys in here, out there we would rob each other and stab each other,"" said Anthony Corbett, who is currently in treatment.

He fears crime will rise when the centre closes, saying that when he was using, if work did not provide the money he needed he would ""get it from somewhere else"". Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections For the last six months, Sky News has been out on patrol with police in Hartcliffe in south Bristol, one of the city's most deprived areas, where heroin and crack cocaine are the drugs of choice. Embedded with the police, you get a real sense of the scale of the problem. Drug addicts walk the street, looking to score. The police are on first name terms with most of the users and with many spending up to £400 a day on drugs, some end up stealing or dealing in order to fund their habit. Day in, day out, police carry out raids, but it is the dealers they want off the streets. ""They know cut-throughs, they know gardens, they know what gate works, what gate doesn't work. They know which fence they can jump, which fence they can't jump,"" says Sergeant Dan Ashfield as we drive though Hartcliffe. It does not take long before the police find what they are looking for. After receiving intelligence that a man is dealing in the area, they track down a suspect on the streets. Following a brief search, class A drugs worth £700 are found. Wraps of heroin and cocaine are concealed in small plastic eggs. As he's arrested, the suspect shouts: ""Once I find out where you live, I will blow your house up. You think I'm joking? I know people, bruv. Your house will get blown up."" Avon and Somerset Police is the only force in the country to offer drugs awareness courses to those caught in possession, as an alternative to prosecution. Some insist it frees up valuable police time as they hunt down dealers, while others believe it is overly lenient and is the first step towards legalising drugs. Across the city are so-called ""crack dens"" - buildings usually in a state of disrepair. The floors are covered with needles, tourniquets and excrement. Simon has spent years in prison for dealing. He's since been released, but is still addicted and homeless. The drugs he takes are known as ""snowballs"" on the street - a mixture of crack and heroin. He is desperate to get clean, but there is no money for him to go into rehab. His legs are swollen and covered in scars from where he has over-injected. He tells me how he now has a hole in his groin that he could fit his finger into. He has been using for years. ""Before I knew it I was addicted and to fund my habit I started selling,"" he told Sky News. ""I sold for the best part of 15 years. I thought I was untouchable. It's just greediness. If I am honest, if I am truthful, jail gets me a bit well. I put a bit of weight on. A bit of routine. Three meals a day."" A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We want everyone across the country to get the help, treatment and support they need, and we are committed to doing more to reduce alcohol and drug-related harm. ""We are giving local authorities £16bn over the current spending period to provide public health services, including drug support and treatment."""

The secretary of state claimed more than 20 countries have cut oil imports from Iran, reducing them by more than one million barrels. He said the sanctions would accelerate the ""rapid decline"" of Iran's international economic activity, but he hopes a new deal would be possible. But Hassan Rouhani, Iran's president, has said his country will ""proudly bypass"" Donald Trump's ""illegal"" and ""unjust"" sanctions by selling oil, and compared the US president to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Mr Rouhani, who also referred to the US as a ""bullying power"", made the announcement in a meeting with economists that was broadcast on state TV. Iran kicked off its air defence war games this week across a vast swathe of the north of the country. The Iranian president said: ""America wanted to cut to zero Iran's oil sales ... but we will continue to sell our oil... to break sanctions."" pic.twitter.com/nk2vKvHuaL The US measures were imposed on Monday after the Trump administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year. Thousands of Iranian students chanted ""death to America"" in protests that took place on the eve of the sanctions, which target the country's vital oil, shipping and banking sectors. Oil is a crucial source of hard currency for Iran's struggling economy. US flags, an effigy of Uncle Sam and pictures of Donald Trump were set on fire in images broadcast on state TV. The events were timed to coincide with the 39th anniversary of the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran. Mr Pompeo earlier defended the sanctions and heralded them as the ""toughest"" ever put in place on the country. However there are some waivers in place, and Mr Pompeo confirmed he had authorised three for ""non proliferation projects"", but said they would be ""very narrow, very time-limited"". US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected European nations to honour the sanctions, but there would be certain humanitarian exemptions. He said the US is watching Iran with ""laser focus"". Iran was hit with its first round of measures in August. Mr Rouhani said in the meeting on Monday: ""I announce that we will proudly bypass your illegal, unjust sanctions because it's against international regulations. ""We are in the war situation. ""We are in a situation of economic war, confronting a bullying power."" Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said Tehran would consider diplomatic talks with the US if Washington changes its approach to discussing the nuclear deal. Theresa May was one of a number of world leaders who said they ""regret"" the US decision to impose sanctions on Iran. Her spokesman said: ""We continue to believe that the Iran nuclear deal makes the world a safer place and our position remains that as long as Iran continues to meet its obligations under the deal by respecting strict limits on its nuclear activity, we will be committed to it too."" China's foreign ministry spokeswoman issued a statement in a similar vein, and added Beijing will continue to uphold the nuclear deal it agreed to as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The Iran nuclear deal was drawn up by the Obama administration and was agreed to by the UK, Russia, France, China, Germany and the EU. International financial and economic sanctions were lifted in return for Tehran curbing its disputed nuclear activity under UN surveillance. The US president posted a Game of Thrones-style image on Twitter on Friday, which showed him striding in front of a moody grey background. Mr Trump had the words ""Sanctions are coming, November 5"" across his chest. The font was the same as that used in the hit TV drama and the wording is a riff on one of its famous lines ""winter is coming"".

The judge indicated that he might have excused McPartlin's non-attendance had he been contacted in advance and given a reason for it. Mr Mostyn began analysing issues relating to the division of assets in the Family Division of the High Court. The judge has placed limits on what can be reported with regards to financial matters. McPartlin, 42, had asked the judge to impose reporting restrictions. The TV star and Ms Armstrong were granted a divorce in 30 seconds on the grounds of adultery on 16 October.

Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections Mr Banks's funding of the Brexit campaign is the biggest donation in British political history. In a series of TV interviews on Sunday, the businessman attacked what he called a ""witch hunt"". He told Sky News: ""The £8m came from a UK company, the cash was generated in the UK. ""I run an insurance business with half a million customers, that's the size of Manchester. ""We employ 1,000 people and we turn over £250m of premium a year.

Mr Banks said the source of the loans was Rock Services. The Electoral Commission has said it suspects the cash instead came via another company called Rock Holdings, which is incorporated in the Isle of Man. This would have made it an ""impermissible"" source of money under UK electoral law. ""There was no Russian money and no interference of any type,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""I want to be absolutely clear about that."" Mr Banks also suggested he had changed his mind on Brexit, telling Marr: ""The corruption I have seen in British politics, the sewer that exists and the disgraceful behaviour of the government over what they are doing with Brexit and how they are selling out, means that if I had my time again I think we would have been better to probably Remain and not unleash these demons.""

He disputed the Electoral Commission's status as an independent body, claiming ""they're all Remainers"" - and he also described the organisation as a ""complete shambles"". One of the self-styled ""Bad Boys of Brexit"", Mr Banks has disclosed how he enjoyed a ""boozy lunch"" with the Russian ambassador in 2015, which preceded further meetings. One of those meetings was three days after Mr Banks, his associate Andy Wigmore and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met newly elected US President Donald Trump. Mr Banks denied any business links with Russia as he stated he is ""not going to apologise for having lunch with a diplomat, I've had lunch with many diplomats"". He added: ""I have no connection with any Russian businesses, I've done no deals in Russia, I've had lunch with the Russian ambassador a couple of times."" Repeating his allegation of a political motive to the investigation into himself and Leave.EU, Mr Banks disagreed the UK's exit from the EU should be postponed until the NCA probe is completed. ""The whole point of this exercise is to have a reason to try to delay Brexit,"" he said. The Electoral Commission is not responding to Mr Banks' comments."

Arron Fraser Andrew Banks is 52 and a self-made millionaire who has donated big sums to anti-EU political causes including UKIP ahead of the 2016 referendum. His fortune, estimated by some at up to £250m, is difficult to nail down because of a vast array of privately-owned business interests. These are dominated by insurance companies but also include a South African diamond mine. :: Why should we care? Mr Banks is facing a criminal investigation into the origin of £8m of donations he made to the Leave.EU campaign he co-founded in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum. The source, or sources, of those funds are at the heart of the inquiry. The investigation was launched after the Electoral Commission said there were ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect that Mr Banks was not the true origin of the cash. The National Crime Agency has powers not available to the commission to investigate offshore interests. Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections :: What is the accusation? There are two strands to this. The commission believes funding involved a company called Rock Holdings, which is based on the Isle of Man, making any campaign donations impermissible under electoral finance rules. He argues the money came via UK-based Rock Services - one of his insurance firms. Newspaper suggestions of Russian involvement have been vehemently denied by Mr Banks. :: Does he have links to Donald Trump? Hmm. Not really. But there was much commentary around a photo taken in New York in November 2016, before Mr Trump entered the White House. Mr Banks was there to meet the US president-elect with his business associate and Leave.EU press spokesman Andy Wigmore at the behest of Nigel Farage. Mr Farage had just left the top job at UKIP (again) after the referendum victory and was there in a personal capacity to celebrate the tide of populism witnessed in the UK and US. :: Who are other central figures at Leave.EU? The group was led chief executive Liz Bilney, also a business associate of Mr Banks, with the PR being handled by Mr Wigmore. It was based in Bristol, where the millionaire has offices for his insurance interests. Ms Bilney was responsible for submitting all income and spending figures to the commission and has insisted there was no wrongdoing. Mr Wigmore ran the day-to-day PR campaign. He is also an Olympic athlete who was on the shooting team for his native Belize at the Rio Olympics."

The military hopes to recruit 1,350 extra personnel from overseas every year to the Navy, Army and Air Force. It comes as the armed forces are struggling to recruit enough servicemen and women to fill a shortfall in their ranks. In April, a National Audit Office report said the full-time military was running at a 5.7% shortfall. A further 8,200 regulars and 2,400 engineers were needed to fill the ""largest gap in a decade"", the report added, while intelligence analysts and pilots were also in demand. Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections Applicants from countries including India, Australia, Canada and Fiji will be considered for all roles in the forces, without having lived in the UK. The army will begin the admissions from early next year, while the Navy and RAF will begin the process immediately. Other than the Nepalese Gurkhas and applicants from the Republic of Ireland who can enrol under a special arrangement, those from outside the Commonwealth will still need British citizenship to apply. In January the army unveiled a recruitment advertising campaign reported to have cost £1.6 million. It intended to encourage more people from different backgrounds, genders, sexualities and faiths to join up. However it was criticised for failing to target those most interested in joining the forces. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said the main group of people considering signing up are more worried about ""how they are going to face combat"". He added: ""This also reflects the fact that the army, like the rest of government, is being forced down a route of political correctness. ""What is most important is that the army recruits and is full of soldiers. ""It's of secondary importance that they reflect the composition of society."""

Mr Srivastava said the girl had been in the hospital for four days and was being treated for a snake bite. The hospital is located 155 miles southwest of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. India has been shaken by a series of sexual assaults in recent years, including the gang-rape and murder of a student on a moving New Delhi bus in 2012. The attack shocked the country where widespread violence against women had long been quietly accepted. Although the government has passed a series of laws increasing punishment for rape of an adult to 20 years in prison, sexual assaults are still being reported regularly. Following outrage over the recent rape and killings of young girls and other attacks on children, India's government approved the death penalty for anyone convicted of raping children under 12."

The UN special envoy for Yemen backs calls for ceasefire efforts and stresses military action is not the solution ""For too long in the Yemen conflict both sides have believed a military solution is possible with catastrophic consequences for the people,"" Jeremy Hunt said in a statement. ""Now for the first time there appears to be a window in which both sides can be encouraged to come to the table, stop the killing and find a political solution - that is the only long-term way out of disaster."" The words signal a hardening of tone towards Saudi Arabia, which London has assisted in its more than three-and-a-half year campaign against the Houthi rebels, providing intelligence and continuing to supply Riyadh with warplanes and weapons. But the war has caused thousands of civilian deaths and left millions on the brink of famine, ramping up pressure on the UK to stop arms sales to the kingdom. Saudi Arabia is also facing censure by the West over the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Istanbul a month ago. People whose stories help explain why Yemenis are facing daily misery as conditions go from bad to worse The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the UK is talking with the 14 other members of the UN Security Council about what more can be done to stop the suffering in Yemen as fighting intensifies around a key rebel-held port city. A foreign office source said the plan is to draft a resolution that paves the way for what is being described as a ""cessation of hostilities"" and peace talks, which lead to a permanent ceasefire. ""Precise words to be determined but whatever achieves that end,"" the source said. The civil war, which has caused chronic shortages of food, water and medicine in a country that was already one of the poorest in the Arab world, has created a ""living hell"" for the country's children, the UN children's agency said on Sunday. Some 30,000 Yemeni children die every year of malnutrition as one of the most important underlying causes. Angelina Jolie, the US actress and a special envoy for the UN refugee agency, said the international community had been ""shamefully slow"" to act on Yemen. She urged the security council to find a negotiated end to the conflict. The UK is the ""pen holder"" on Yemen at the security council, which means it takes the lead on drafting new resolutions. This role appeared under threat of being upstaged last week when two of President Donald Trump's most senior officials - his defence secretary and his secretary of state - called for a cessation of hostilities and for peace talks in Sweden later this month. Mr Hunt and Theresa May were quick to support the call and say that the UK has been pushing for the same goal, but is mindful that an end in the violence will only work if it is underpinned by a political process. The foreign secretary met Martin Griffiths last Tuesday, the UN special envoy for Yemen and a former British diplomat. There is a ""small but real chance that a cessation of hostilities could alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people"", Mr Hunt said. ""This must be the first priority as we seek to put in place a longer term solution,"" he added.

2018-11-05,No ministerial resignation is easy for a prime minister - but for a leader trying to steer her party though one of the trickiest periods in recent political history it's the last thing she needs. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105142231/https://news.sky.com/story/tracey-crouch-quits-baffled-tory-mps-digest-another-resignation-11542163,"Tracey Crouch was well-liked, popular and had the support of Labour MPs - a rare feat in a parliament where party politics matters more than ever before. During her time as minister for sport and loneliness she united colleagues over serious and difficult issues as well as demonstrating she has personality - her popular posts on Instagram showed just how much she loved her job. As a result, her departure over government plans to introduce a lower stake for fixed odds betting terminals in October next year instead of April has united her party in disbelief. Baffled MPs said it made no sense. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections Even some political journalists - always desperate for a good resignation story - didn't really believe she would be forced to step down, convinced the Treasury would find a compromise to allow her to stay. In her resignation letter Ms Crouch took aim at a decision to delay the changes ""due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests"". She also warned two people will take their own lives every day over gambling addiction and explained knowing the impact of such a decision meant there was no way for her to stay. But while she may not be a household name, Ms Crouch's decision to leave government over the issue has, according to some, highlighted a political blindspot at Number 10. A ministerial source said the decision not to change course and bring forward the changes rather than risk a resignation was short-sighted. And it has inflamed tensions among backbench MPs who fear the prime minister is refusing to focus on anything but Brexit and had become complacent after days of largely positive coverage for the chancellor's budget. Most pressingly, the row over Mrs May's Brexit position may have fallen quiet over the last couple of days but it hasn't gone away. Just a week ago her critics on the Tory backbenches were warning as many as 40 MPs had written letters calling for her to leave. Their biggest gripe? That the prime minister doesn't listen to their concerns and instead ploughs on with her own plans without consulting colleagues. Reigniting that particular row by allowing a popular minister to walk out of government just days before more key Brexit talks over an issue which the government backs, could put Number 10 in a tricky position in the days to come. Government sources said it would have been impossible to bring forward changes to fixed odds terminals and that a date for the policy had never been announced, so it had not been delayed. But that is unlikely to ease the concerns of those who fear Mrs May's refusal to change course, even on an issue that has widespread support, is a sign of things to come as Brexit talks fire up again."

""That's why we're inviting local people to join us for an exclusive meal where customers will pay what they feel their food is worth and support incredible local initiatives in the process."" The restaurant has been entirely refitted during the closure and has been given a ""clean bill of health"" from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The branch employs 24 members of staff. Money raised in Zizzi on Tuesday will support The Rose Gale Trust and Children's Chance. The Skripals fell ill on 4 March, and were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury. The pub they visited - The Mill - before going for dinner was also cordoned off, and extensive searches took place at their home. It remains closed. Although the Skripals both made a recovery, Dawn Sturgess died after coming into contact with the nerve agent in a perfume bottle in Amesbury. Her partner Charlie Rowley recovered. The UK and several other nations expelled Russian diplomats after intelligence services linked the poisoning to Moscow, but Vladimir Putin has continuously denied involvement. Investigative website Bellingcat named the Salisbury suspects as Dr Alexander Yevgenyevich Mishkin, and Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, 39, both GRU officers. In September, British police accused the two men of attempting to assassinate Mr Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter Yulia with a novichok nerve agent in Salisbury. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Kremlin, though she has stopped short of directly accusing Mr Putin. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the attack and previously dismissed photos linking Chepiga to the GRU. The two men denied being involved, saying they were in the UK as tourists, and claiming they had simply been wanting to visit the famous Salisbury cathedral."
2018-11-05,"A ""lack of progress"" in Brexit negotiations is being blamed for a measure of business confidence falling to its lowest level since post-crash 2009.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105142231/https://news.sky.com/story/business-confidence-at-lowest-level-since-2009-icaew-11545334,"The latest business confidence monitor by the accountancy body the ICAEW showed a sharp drop-off nationwide though FTSE 350 firms were said to be more pessimistic than privately-owned companies. It found that while sales were stable there was particular weakness in capital investment. The reading for the fourth quarter, the ICAEW said, followed the humbling Salzburg summit for the prime minister in which her Brexit stance was branded ""uncompromising"" by the EU - raising fears of a ""no-deal"" scenario. While the mood music has since improved, there has also been growing evidence of exasperation at the pace of negotiations as the clock ticks down to March next year when the UK is due to leave. This has been seen most recently in the latest round of IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) activity indicators. The report covering the manufacturing sector came in at its lowest level since July 2016 - the month after the EU vote - amid low domestic demand despite continued support from the weak pound which makes UK exports more competitive. Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections The survey covering the powerhouse services sector also did little to ease fears of an economic slowdown in the final quarter of the year. Its data, also covering October and released on Monday, showed activity at a seven-month low with firms also at their most gloomy on the outlook since July 2016. In addition to Brexit uncertainty firms also cited the US/China trade war, slowing global growth and financial market turbulence for the cautious approach. The Bank of England used its Inflation Report last week to warn that growth could sag to 0.3% in the final three months of 2018 - down from a forecast 0.6% in the third quarter which was boosted by a hot summer. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said of the PMI figures: ""The survey data suggest that, despite slowing, the service sector is on course to provide the main impetus to economic growth in the fourth quarter, albeit growing at a rate of just 0.2% if current levels are maintained (around half the pace seen in the third quarter). ""In contrast, at current levels, manufacturing is on course to act as a drag on the economy in the fourth quarter with construction making only a weak contribution to GDP."" Sharron Gunn, ICAEW executive director, said of its confidence survey: ""Leaving the EU and its potential impact is at the front of everyone's minds. ""This is a difficult time to run a business, let alone finance the major investments the UK economy will desperately need post Brexit to drive growth. ""The Budget offered some relief to business but more significant action is needed by Government to provide stability and reassurance."""
2018-11-05,Hundreds of additional police officers will be on the beat after four fatal stabbings in five days in London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105142231/https://news.sky.com/story/extra-police-on-london-streets-after-four-murders-in-five-days-11545417,"Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said the plan followed a ""terrible"" few days in the capital - which has seen a total of 118 murders so far this year. It comes after a Home Office minister said a change in the nature of crime was to blame for a spike in gang-related violence, rather than cuts to police force staffing. Victoria Atkins said that a government review had revealed ""the claim about police numbers isn't supported by the evidence of previous spikes in serious violence"". But Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, said the Home Office's own leaked documents show there is a link between officer numbers declining and crime levels rising. Announcing the increase in police officers, Mr Cundy said the force's violent crime taskforce carried out more than 21,000 weapons searches since April, seizing hundreds of guns and knives. He said: ""Tragically, we have had four murders since Wednesday of last week, none of them are connected. ""That's four families, four groups of friends and acquaintances, who have all been tragically affected by this senseless violence. ""We have hundreds of additional duty officers on the streets of every single borough. Only together can we bring down the level of violence in London."" :: Met police chief says violent crime in London has levelled off He added: ""We have had 118 murders in London, they do disproportionately affect young people, but not just teenagers. ""We are working closely with schools, we need to take more knives off the streets, because knife crime is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges we are facing."" Malcolm Mide-Madariola, 17, was stabbed on Friday outside Clapham South tube station in south London, close to where he studied. On Thursday, Jay Hughes was killed in Bellingham, south east London, suffering a stab wound to the heart. On Halloween, 38-year-old Rocky Djelal was stabbed near a park at about lunchtime in Rotherhithe, and died of his injuries. On Sunday, a man believed to be 22 years old was stabbed in Anerley, south London. :: Man arrested after two stabbed at Sony HQ in London Cressida Dick, Met Police Commissioner, said ""stretched"" forces would have to prioritise serious violence and drugs gangs over non-criminal acts such as misogyny. But Ms Atkins played down those comments. She said: ""We are all, I think, realising that the nature of crime is changing. ""The levels of violence which doctors are now seeing in A&Es show that incidents which before perhaps wouldn't have resulted in fatalities now are resulting in fatalities. ""Gangs are behind the vast majority of these murders, and the gang leaders are using social media to communicate... using mobile communications in a way that 10 or even five years ago simply wasn't possible. ""We and the police and others have to face up to the reality that criminals are changing their crime types and we have to be able to tackle that."" Mr Khan has warned it could take 10 years to make significant progress on violent crime in the capital. He told the BBC: ""The most senior police officers in the country have said it's naive to think there's not a link between cutting police numbers and an increase in violent crime. ""We've got to be more successful in lobbying this government to invest in policing."" Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections"
2018-11-05,"The name Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust conjures up the image of a group of highly conservative Scottish accountants, sitting in a dusty old office in Edinburgh's financial quarter, poring over Dickensian-style ledgers as they cautiously invest their money.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181105142231/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-century-old-scottish-fund-made-a-1000-return-on-alibaba-11542687,"That stereotypical image might have fitted the bill when, in 1909, Augustus Baillie and Carlyle Gifford launched the Straits Mortgage and Trust Company with the intention of investing in mortgages on rubber plantations in Malaysia and Sri Lanka. It changed its name to Scottish Mortgage and Trust Company four years later as it moved its investment strategy towards the United States and away from Asia and rubber interests. But today there is nothing Scottish about this investment trust at all, other than the fact it is run by Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based fund manager. And it certainly doesn't invest in mortgages anymore. In fact, Scottish Mortgage Trust is the largest quoted investment trust in the UK and a member of the FTSE-100. Its market capitalisation of £6.9bn makes it bigger than household names like Marks & Spencer, ITV, Easyjet and Royal Mail. It has achieved that status with a decision taken about 15 years ago by James Anderson, who took on management of the trust in 2000, to focus on technology stocks. In his early years, Mr Anderson focused the trust chiefly on emerging markets, plus some solid old UK-based blue-chips such as British American Tobacco and GlaxoSmithKline. Yet the portfolio is today almost exclusively comprised of tech stocks, as confirmed by today's half-year results, in which it revealed a net return after tax of £1.2bn - up from £868m in the same period last year. The fund's biggest shareholding is Amazon, which comprises 10.5% of the portfolio, while its second-biggest holding is in the California-based genetic research company Illumina. Other significant shareholdings are in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth; Tencent, the Chinese tech giant; Baidu, the Chinese search engine; Tesla, the electric carmaker and Netflix, the entertainment provider. The period on which the company was reporting today falls before the stock market turbulence of October in which tech stocks, in particular, were battered. Shares of Amazon fell by 20% during the month and Alibaba by 14%. Mr Anderson addressed this in the results statement with this observation: ""[Six months] is too short a time over which to judge the success or otherwise of this investment approach. The value of the portfolio can and will fluctuate over such short periods. We are inclined to view such times more as an opportunity than a cause for serious concern."" More interesting was that, for the first time, the trust provided details of its strategy on investing in unquoted companies which, as it noted, would ""not normally be accessible to public equity market investors"". It began investing in unquoted companies in June 2010 and the managers said today that, since then, such holdings had returned 17% if only the period in which they remained unquoted was included. If the period after they floated on the stock market was included, they said, that figure increases to 30%. It added: ""Put another way, from June 2010 when the managers made their first unquoted investment to the end of September 2018, the entire Scottish Mortgage portfolio generated a total return of 344%, but the total return from just the subset of holdings that had started out as unlisted investments over the same period was 419%. For context, the FTSE All-Share World Index's total return over the same period was 163%."" Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections Among the trust's biggest hits down the years, by adopting that investment approach, has been Alibaba. It reckons to have achieved a return of more than 270% between its first investment in the Chinese company in 2012 and its flotation - still a US stock market record - in September 2014. Include the period since Alibaba came to market, however, and the total return rises to more than 1,000%. But Scottish Mortgage is not only interested in these companies for the investment return they generated. At least as important, the managers argue, is the access to the management of those companies and the insight they get from them. As an example, they cite Daniel Ek, the founder of music-streaming business Spotify, another of the trust's big investments. They add: ""[There are] benefits of being able to develop relationships in this way with those at the companies which are driving significant changes in their industries. ""For private companies, such insights are not available to purely public equity investors, yet, for example, understanding the business model and growth of Airbnb is crucial to thinking about the future of the hotel and broader travel industry, as well as that particular company. ""Hearing the thoughts of Jack Ma at Alibaba, both before and after the IPO in 2014, has been critical to understanding the development of the consumption economy within China. ""There are more benefits too in terms of the ability to access new investments. This can be direct…alternatively, it may simply be by virtue of earning a reputation in the sector for being long term constructive shareholders. ""The relationship developed with Alibaba as a private company and then the managers' steady support through the inevitable market volatility in the share price, post-IPO, led to the managers getting the opportunity to invest a significant amount into Alibaba's financial technology company, Ant Financial. ""This business is driving the digital provision of a wide range of financial services in China, but it has the potential to become a global, financial services platform business. It is hardly an undiscovered gem but few can actually gain access to invest."" As for the outlook, the managers quote the Alibaba founder and chairman, Jack Ma, who they readily admit is cleverer than them: ""Recently, the global economy has found itself in a state of turmoil. Uncertainties abound in trade relations, consumer trends, stock markets and the manufacturing industry. US-China trade tensions create increased risk of instability.…our past experience tells us there are huge opportunities behind the anxiety and friction. ""The only question is how we should pivot. Monumental challenges give rise to monumental opportunities."" This is not a cheap company for ordinary investors to invest in. Its net asset value (NAV) per share at the end of September - crudely put what shareholders would get, per share, if the trust sold all of its holdings and wound itself up - stood at 527.7p on 30 September. The NAV will obviously have fallen since but, on that date, the share price stood at 541.3p. It is rare to see shares of investment trusts trading at a premium to their net asset value but the premium has been narrowing of late. The shares were today trading up by almost 3% at 495p. And the point is that this is a fund invested for the long term. Movements in its valuations from one six-monthly period to the next are not really that meaningful."

The mammoth trial in a Brooklyn federal court starts on Monday, will cost millions of dollars and is expected to last more than four months. Years have been spent piecing together evidence against Guzman, 61, who was extradited from Mexico in 2017 after twice escaping prison - first hidden in a laundry cart, then slipping down a tunnel that reached his prison shower. Guzman has been branded the world's biggest drug lord since Colombia's Pablo Escobar, who was dubbed ""The King of Cocaine"" and was one of the wealthiest men in the world until police shot him dead in 1993. Legal experts say the case against Guzman is water-tight and could see him being sent to a maximum security prison for the rest of his life. The Sinaloa cartel that Guzman founded in 1989 is still hugely powerful and his co-defendant Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada remains at large. Jury selection will take place amid tight security conditions reserved only for the most dangerous defendants. US district court judge Brian Cogan will preside over the process behind closed doors. The 12 jurors, with six alternates, will remain anonymous and will be escorted by US marshals to and from court every day. The jury will determine whether Guzman - the father of two whose nickname means ""shorty"" as he is only 5ft 2ins tall - is guilty or not of 11 trafficking, firearms and money laundering charges. According to the indictment, the Sinaloa cartel, which Guzman is accused of leading from 1989 to 2014, became ""the largest drug trafficking organisation in the world... with thousands of members"". During Guzman's reign, the cartel's empire expanded across the globe, stretching from the Americas to Europe and Asia. It is alleged that from 1989 to 2014, the cartel smuggled at least 340,892 pounds (154,626 kilograms) of cocaine into the US, as well as heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana, raking in $14bn (£11bn). Guzman's wealth from drugs was so great that he was on Forbes magazine's list of billionaires but he dropped out in 2013 after spending much of his money on protection. Sign our petition to force party leaders to hold televised debates ahead of elections In a secret meeting with actor Sean Penn which the Hollywood star wrote about in Rolling Stone magazine in 2016, Guzman boasted: ""I supply more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world. I have a fleet of submarines, airplanes, trucks and boats."" Guzman was born in 1957 in the Mexican town Badiraguato - where several drugs lords operated. He was recruited by Guadalajara cartel boss Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, known as ""The Godfather"" of Mexico's modern drug cartels. After Felix Gallardo was arrested in 1989, Guzman's Sinaloa cartel began its meteoric rise. Guzman is pleading not guilty but the government has presented a wealth of evidence that includes more than 300,000 pages and at least 117,000 audio recordings. The trial, which one expert says will cost the US taxpayer more than $50m (£38m), will hear several hundred witnesses testify. Some of the informants have already been absorbed into the US witness protection programme and given new identities and homes around the country. Guzman has been held in solitary confinement in New York since Mexico extradited him and he spends 23 hours a day in his cell. The only visitors he is allowed are his three lawyers and twin seven-year-old daughters - the judge banned his 29-year-old beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel, from visiting. He has complained that his cell is too small and that he is not in good health. Arrested for the first time in Guatemala in 1993, Guzman spent more than seven years in a Mexican prison before his first escape in 2001. He was arrested again by Mexican marines in February 2014 but escaped 14 months later before being re-captured in January 2016. His story has been the subject of numerous documentaries and a Netflix series."

The plans argue for a shift towards primary and community care services, to look at the early support they can offer people in preventing bad health taking hold. Force party leaders to debate on TV before general elections Mr Hancock said in a speech at the International Association of National Public Health Institutes: ""Prevention is also about ensuring people take greater responsibility for managing their own health. ""It's about people choosing to look after themselves better, staying active and stopping smoking. Making better choices by limiting alcohol, sugar, salt and fat. ""But focusing on the responsibilities of patients isn't about penalising people. It's about helping them make better choices, giving them the all the support we can, because we know taking the tough decisions is never easy."" Mr Hancock added the ""numbers don't stack up"" when it comes to spending on prevention as opposed to treatment. ""In the UK, we are spending £97bn of public money on treating disease and only £8bn preventing it across the UK,"" he said. ""You don't have to be an economist to see those numbers don't stack up.""

He also defended government plans to stockpile medicines, appearing to blame Brussels for the contingency. ""If the borders gum up and it's hard to get lorries across on the ferries because of action the EU side takes, then we've got to make sure that people can have access to their medicines,"" the health secretary said. Public Health England is looking at ""harnessing digital technology"" as a form of ""predictive prevention"", potentially leading to targeted health advice for people based on their their location and lifestyle. Helen Donovan, from the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed Mr Hancock's plans but urged serious investment at a local level to back them up. She said: ""Matt Hancock must realise his plans will start at a disadvantage as local authorities struggle with planned cuts to public health budgets of almost 4% per year until 2021. ""While it's clear he sees that prevention isn't an optional extra, we need to see properly funded, accountable services delivered by a fully staffed nursing workforce backed by adequate resources."" Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said while the plans are ""laudable"", they follow ""years of cuts and failed privatisation"". ""Unless ministers reverse these cuts and start fully funding public health services, these announcements will be dismissed as a litany of hollow promises,"" he added."
2018-11-12,"The UK may be about to cut some of its ties with Europe – but other ties, of a far more physical form, are under construction just as the country prepares for Brexit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181112174842/https://news.sky.com/story/national-grid-builds-energy-ties-with-europe-ahead-of-brexit-11548167,"National Grid, operator of the electricity transmission network in England and Wales and the gas National Transmission System in England, Wales and Scotland, gave an update today on the physical links it is building between Britain and mainland Europe. These are in the form of interconnectors that will allow the UK to import energy to the continent when it is needed and export it when a surplus arises. The Grid already owns joint stakes in two interconnectors linking Britain with France and the Netherlands and has three more under construction - Nemo to Belgium, the North Sea Link to Norway and IFA2 to France. These remain on track. But the Grid today confirmed it has also signed off on investment in a fourth interconnector, Viking Link, to connect the Lincolnshire coast with Denmark. The project, due to be completed by 2023, will cost the company £850m and involve the laying of 760 kilometres of cables under the North Sea. The Grid's chief executive, John Pettigrew, said today that 80% of the energy imported through the interconnector would be 'clean', reflecting the fact that Denmark is a world leader in renewables. He added: ""In the next six months our priority will be to progress with Viking and continue with the efficient delivery of our other three interconnector projects under construction. These represent a combined £2.1bn worth of investment between now and 2023."" But what of the other big European issue, Brexit? Mr Pettigrew said: ""As you'd expect, with a company like National Grid, we work very closely with government and with regulators to make sure that we're considering all possible scenarios around Brexit. Our focus has been, as the system operator, considering security of supply and our position is that we don't see any significant issues at this point. ""We obviously look at it from an interconnector perspective and we believe the fundamentals of interconnection don't change under Brexit. We know that we can trade on that interconnector [after Brexit]. ""And like any business we are considering our supply chain…and believe we are well set."" Mr Pettigrew said the company was well prepared for this winter after investing in resilience and reliability for years. He noted that UK gas demand was forecast to be lower this winter. He was speaking as the Grid reported a 4% drop in underlying half year pre-tax profits, to £816m, reflecting the impact of storms in the US, where it supplies gas and electricity to 20 million customers in New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, in April and May. The drop in profits also reflects the return of £50m worth of allowances to the energy regulator, Ofgem, that it was previously awarded for a gas pipeline project at Avonmouth, near Bristol, that is now no longer going ahead. These were partly offset by gains from price rises in the United States. More than 57,000 people have signed our petition calling for televised debates ahead of elections - have you? The results were slightly better than expected and shares of the Grid, which as a legacy of its past public ownership are owned by 850,000 retail investors, rose by more than 1% this morning - valuing the company at £28.4bn. The interconnectors are not the only major investments the Grid is making in the UK. Mr Pettigrew also pointed today to work being done to replace Feeder 9, a gas pipeline under the Humber Estuary, which to date has bored 1,700 of the required 5,000 metres and is on course for completion by the Autumn of 2020: ""This is an important project to maintain the security of supply for a pipeline that transports 20% of the UK's annual gas needs."" The Grid also announced an efficiency drive aimed at delivering £100m worth of savings by 2021. This has raised eyebrows in the City because the plan has been unveiled just as the company is haggling with Ofgem over the rules that set price controls to ensure consumers - both current and future ones - pay a fair price for network services. These are known as RIIO (Revenue=Incentives Innovation Outputs) and have already created one dispute with Ofgem this year over the cost of linking the UK's transmission network to the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset. The second set of rules, RIIO 2, will determine price controls from 2021 onwards. Ofgem has already published a framework decision at the end of July and is due to give more details on the financial parameters governing the Grid's transmission businesses next month. The final decision is due before the end of 2020. It is easy to forget that, while this is a company that touches the lives of millions of Britons every day, National Grid is increasingly a transatlantic company. Mr Pettigrew confirmed today that the Grid will exercise an option to sell its remaining 39% stake in Cadent, the UK's largest gas distribution network and once part of British Gas, which it began selling last year. He said that the cash proceeds of £2bn would be reinvested in the business. At least some of that is likely to find its way to the US, where the Grid has invested $1.5bn so far this year, mostly in small projects. The company is also, as previously announced, investing in renewables projects and Mr Pettigrew said today that it is still looking for opportunities in this space. He added: ""We do see the rapid growth of renewables in the US as an opportunity. Over the past few years we've built up a small portfolio in solar and storage and we continue to...add capability. If we see an opportunity that delivers good returns for our shareholders, we will look at it carefully and take it forward."" Britain is often accused of not investing sufficiently in infrastructure. National Grid's recent history contradicts that. But the energy needs of both the UK and the US, its two markets, are evolving rapidly. How the company meets those needs will also evolve."

Sky News is calling for the creation of an independent Leaders' Debates Commission to oversee television debates However, Mrs May will point to advances in a number of areas to suggest an overall exit agreement is close. So, what has already been settled? :: CITIZENS' RIGHTS In a draft of the UK's withdrawal agreement published in March, issues concerning the rights of EU citizens living in Britain - as well as UK citizens living in the EU - were said to have been finalised. Mrs May has since guaranteed the rights of EU citizens in the UK even in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit. :: DIVORCE BILL In the March draft agreement, the UK's financial settlement was also marked in green to imply it has been settled. The Treasury estimates Britain's divorce bill will cost between £35bn and £39bn. However, the prime minister has suggested she could reconsider handing over the cash if there is no overall deal with the EU. :: TRANSITION PERIOD The so-called ""implementation period"" - otherwise known as the Brexit transition period - was also marked in green back in March. It has been agreed the UK will maintain the status quo of EU membership between the date of Brexit on 29 March next year, and 31 December 2020. The government argues this will mean businesses will only need to make one set of changes required by Brexit, as new trade relationships are negotiated and put into place after 2019. Mrs May has since opened the possibility of the transition period being extended beyond 21 months as she struggles to solve the Irish border issue. :: GIBRALTAR In her address to MPs on Monday, the prime minister will reveal the UK and Spain have ""developed a protocol and a set of underlying memoranda relating to Gibraltar, heralding a new era in our relations"". The issue of Gibraltar's sovereignty, which has long been disputed by Spain, had been expected to be a key flashpoint in Brexit talks. Soon after the Leave vote in 2016, then Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo claimed Brexit ""opens up new possibilities"" for Spain to take control of Gibraltar, adding: ""The Spanish flag on 'the Rock' is much closer than before"". However, the status of Gibraltar after Brexit appears to have been settled without further tensions between London and Madrid. :: CYPRUS The prime minister will also hail progress on the issue of Britain's military presence in Cyprus. Mrs May will tell MPs on Monday: ""We have developed a protocol relating to the UK sovereign base areas in Cyprus."" Two UK military bases have remained on the Mediterranean island since Cyprus's independence from Britain. :: NORTHERN IRELAND Along with citizens' rights and the UK's divorce bill, Northern Ireland is another key part of Britain's withdrawal agreement. The prime minister will tell MPs on Monday of settled agreements ""on the preservation of the particular rights for UK and Irish citizens - and the special arrangements between us such as the Common Travel Area - all of which have existed since before either the UK or Ireland ever became members of the European Economic Community"". But, what remains to be settled? :: IRISH BORDER BACKSTOP Despite the progress in some areas relating to Northern Ireland, the issue of the Irish border continues to act as a blockage in Brexit negotiations. Both the UK and the EU are committed to the idea of a backstop solution to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, should a future UK-EU trade relationship not avert this. But, both sides remain at loggerheads over their competing backstop proposals. Mrs May is adamant Northern Ireland should not in any way be split off from the rest of the UK after Brexit, as Brussels has suggested; while the EU are resisting Britain's demand for any backstop solution to be time-limited. :: THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP Mrs May's claim 95% of the Brexit deal is complete only applies to the UK's withdrawal agreement, with the EU having yet to show any sign of dropping their resistance to the prime minister's Chequers plan for the future UK-EU relationship. Despite the prime minister hailing ""important progress made on issues like security, transport and services"", Brussels has told Mrs May her plans for an economic partnership based on a ""common rulebook"" and a ""combined customs territory"" will not work. Labour MP Chris Leslie, who wants a second Brexit referendum, claimed the prime minister's suggestion a Brexit deal is 95% complete is ""utter misrepresentation"" and ""designed to make you think Brexit is nearly over"". He added a withdrawal agreement is a ""merely clearing of the throat"" before ""arduous"" trade deal negotiations lasting, Mr Leslie suggested, more than a further five years. And remember... :: NOTHING IS AGREED UNTIL EVERYTHING IS AGREED A mantra often quoted in EU negotiations portrays how any one part of the withdrawal deal unravelling could lead to a whole agreement falling apart."

But despite a two-week search and an excavation of the back garden, nothing has been found. The 25-year-old estate agent went missing in London in 1986 and was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994. :: Suzy Lamplugh: Who is she and what happened to her? Police secured a search warrant after they received new information about the case. Ms Lamplugh went missing after going to meet a client - known as Mr Kipper - at a house in Fulham. She was last seen being joined by a man and walking away from the property and although her car was found police have never found out what happened to her. Three days before she disappeared, John Cannan had been released from a hostel at Wormwood Scrubs Prison - where he served a six-year sentence for rape. He is now currently serving a life sentence for the 1987 abduction and murder of Shirley Banks in Bristol. Nobody has ever been charged as part of the Lamplugh investigation. Met Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Wood said that despite no new leads, the case remains open and police are ""committed to bringing Suzy's killer to justice"". ""This has been a landmark case for the Met, both in terms of its scale and complexity, and because of the huge sense of tragedy of a young woman's life being cut short and the uncertainty around what happened to Suzy,"" he said. ""A total of 32 years have passed since Suzy's disappearance; years that have undoubtedly been hugely painful for her family and loved ones, and our thoughts remain with them at this time.""

The 22-year-old and his partner Patatas, 38, were on trial accused of being members of the ""extreme and violent"" far-right group National Action, which was banned in 2016. The court heard that Thomas, who gave their baby the middle name Adolf, posed for a photo with the child while wearing Ku Klux Klan robes. It emerged that counter-terrorism officers from Prevent had visited the couple's home in October last year ""due to concerns Ms Patatas may be involved in the extreme right wing"". A third defendant, Daniel Bogunovic, of Crown Hills Rise, Leicester, was also convicted of being a member. The warehouse worker was a leading figure in National Action's Midlands chapter. Thomas, a former Amazon security guard, was also convicted on a majority verdict of having a copy of a document likely to be of use to a terrorist, which explained how to make a ""viable"" bomb. Lawyers said that after being banned by the government in December 2016, National Action simply ""shed one skin for another"" and ""rebranded"". Jurors heard evidence of social media chats involving Thomas, Patatas and Bogunovic, discussing what prosecutors have alleged was the banned group's continuing operation, under a different name. The jury also heard that Thomas and Patatas plastered National Action stickers in public locations after the ban, while Bogunovic was calling for a ""leadership"" meeting in a chat group for senior members in April 2017. During evidence in his defence, given from the witness box, Thomas - a self-confessed Holocaust denier and racist - said he moved to Israel when he was 18 in a bid to convert to Judaism. He added that he was motivated to look at converting because it would have allowed him to join the Israeli military. He told the jury he lived in kibbutzes and at a college while in Israel, said he ""just lost interest"" and returned home in August 2016. He met Patatas - who jurors heard told a chat group ""bring back concentration camps"" - in a pub in December that year, and had a baby with her at the end of 2017. Three other men who had been due to stand trial alongside the trio, admitted being National Action members before the trial began. Thomas's close friend Darren Fletcher, 28, of Kitchen Lane, Wednesfield, West Midlands, Joel Wilmore, 24, of Bramhall Road, Stockport, Greater Manchester, and Nathan Pryke, 26, of Dartford Road, March, Cambridgeshire, will be sentenced later. It can now also be reported that an Army veteran was at the heart of National Action, which set its sights on recruiting within the armed forces. White supremacist and self-confessed racist Corporal Mikko Vehvilainen, 34, believed in a coming ""race war"" and wanted to help establish an all-white stronghold in a Welsh village. The Royal Anglian Regiment soldier was convicted after a trial in March of being a member and was jailed for eight years. Prosecutors said at Vehvilainen's trial that he was working within the Army as a ""recruiter"" for the banned organisation. It can now be revealed he was connected to three other soldiers, one of whom was thrown out of the Army. Before his conviction, Vehvilainen was considered an ""outstanding"" soldier. More than 50,000 people have signed the petition - have you? Thomas had applied to join the army twice but failed both times. In total, 10 people have now been convicted or admitted membership of the terrorist group. Counter-terrorism police are continuing to investigate suspected off-shoots of National Action."

Ali blew up a vehicle packed with gas cylinders on Friday before stabbing three members of the public, killing 74-year-old restaurant owner Sisto Malaspina. As Ali turned his knife on police officers who were trying to stop him, Mr Rogers, 46, grabbed an empty shopping trolley and attempted to shove it towards him. Mr Rogers told Melbourne newspaper The Age that his actions had been ""spur of the moment"". ""I just wanted to help and do something right for the first time in me life."" He told Channel Seven: ""I have seen the trolley to the side, so I've picked it up and I ran and threw the trolley straight at him. ""Got him but didn't get him down.

Donna Stolzenberg, the founder of registered charity Melbourne Homeless Collective, is behind the fundraising effort for Mr Rogers. Ms Stolzenberg said: ""As a person, he just deserves it."" She added that the charity will help find him support with financial literacy, housing and making sure nobody took advantage of him once he had the large sum of money.

The area has been ravaged by the flames that have killed 25 people, in what is the third-deadliest California wildfire on record. Mrs Jolly and other nurses helped the hospital's 60 patients leave the hospital before they were told to drive to a nearby road that was safe. She told ABC News: ""So we went down the road and my car got completely engulfed in flames. ""The cab filled up with smoke.

The fire engine then took her back to the hospital. She added that she ""didn't even know her best friend was right behind her"" and made it back to the hospital as well. Mrs Jolly said that the nurses started treating patients outside the hospital as firefighters tackled flames on the roof. She told ABC that her husband had driven to the area to find her but turned around when his vehicle was surrounded by flames. Mrs Jolly said: ""He knew that even if I was dead he had to save the kids... he had to get to them, he got to them, he got them out of there. ""Our phones were disconnected there was no service."" She was finally able to get hold of her mother who had contacted her husband and knew where he was. Mrs Jolly said: ""I saw him by the side of the road and I just got out of the car, and I held onto him forever and I haven't let go."" It comes as footage emerged of a wildfire survivor visiting an area where people he knew were killed in the flames. The unnamed man said his disabled friend and a woman who had stopped to put her make-up on died after becoming trapped by fire.

2018-11-12,"More British parents are turning to home education because their child is at risk of expulsion from school, Sky News research has shown.  ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181112174842/https://news.sky.com/story/home-schooling-on-the-rise-over-fears-of-expulsion-11552180,"Freedom of Information requests to councils and local authorities across the UK revealed that, since 2013, there has been a 242% increase in the number of home-educating parents who cite ""avoiding or facing permanent exclusion"" when they remove their child from school. Natalie Walker decided to home school her son earlier this year. Jay, 12, had been at secondary school but was experiencing problems there that made him anxious and depressed and, as a consequence, he had begun lashing out in class. Ms Walker told Sky News: ""The talk about a managed move started quite quickly, and I just knew where that would end up: with him in a Pupil Referral Unit and I just didn't want that for Jay."" Ms Walker is a single mum who works from home. For her, the choice to home educate wasn't easy, but it was the right one. ""I didn't feel sending him to another school would help because of the emotional baggage he had by that point, and I'd lost faith in the mainstream system by that point, if I'm honest,"" Ms Walker said. ""At first I was nervous about being with him all day, every day, but once I started connecting with the groups that were available, I didn't realise, it was a whole new world that opened up."" The number of children in home education has risen by 78% since 2013, with an estimated 45,000 children now been educated outside of a traditional school environment. For the Walker family, a decision made in desperation is working. ""It's really fun, it's actually more enjoyable than school,"" Jay told Sky News. ""I feel like people who are at school, they should be home schooled too. Because I'm living a life of happiness."" Ms Walker says she feels like she has her son back: ""For me that's the main thing. That happy lad - he's back now. School had stripped that from him."" More than 50,000 people have signed Sky News' petition backing televised leaders' debates for elections - have you? Sky News' figures show that ""religion, culture and philosophy"" are the still the most common reasons given for home education and that white, British families make up the majority of home educators. By law, a parent must ensure their child receives an education that's suitable for their age, ability and aptitude. That can be in a school or otherwise. In south London, mum Samia Tossio hosts a weekly science and maths lesson for her son Isaac, who is 13, and other local home-schooled children. She employs a specialist maths and science tutor who comes with equipment for the children to do experiments around the dining room table. ""I'm not a teacher, I'm not trying to replace teachers, I think many of them do a good job,"" Ms Tossio said. ""I'm just doing what I am legally allowed to do, which is to educate my child otherwise than at school."" Jae Avery, whose daughter attends the session, says the existence of groups like this helps mitigate the impact of a child not being in a bigger school environment. ""People seem to be very concerned about socialising,"" Ms Avery told Sky News. ""I don't know any home-educated child who isn't socialised really, they are all very socialised."" To access higher education, many children who are taught at home will take mainstream exams but otherwise what they learn in these lessons is driven by the pupils' interests. Home educators have no set curriculum or exams and teaching does not necessarily have to be done by the parent or in the home. ""I love the freedom, obviously I don't do whatever I want, but the ability to do what I want is just amazing,"" one student said. Unless there are safeguarding issues, or welfare concerns, local authorities can only conduct ""informal checks"" on home-educating parents and their children. But earlier this year, the Department for Education opened a consultation to see whether there should be greater powers given to councils to allow them to check what education parents are providing. They are also investigating whether they should be a compulsory register introduced for all home-educated children, which would enable children to be tracked and monitored more easily. But it's something some home-educating parents feel is unnecessary and unfair. ""The only register in this country at the moment for people is the sex offenders register,"" Ms Tossio said. ""So do parents have to be on a register to home educate?"" But Sky News spoke to Hashim Aziz, now aged 23, whose experience of home education has left him thinking there does need to be better regulation of parents who choose to home educate. Mr Aziz's father took him out of school aged eight. Hashim says his father tried his best but, a combination of ill health and inexperience meant there wasn't much education. ""We basically sat in our rooms, with the books and were expected to get on with it and teach ourselves,"" he said. ""As you can imagine for a kid who is quite sheltered at that point I didn't really understand the value in education, it didn't really accomplish much at all."" Mr Aziz has now entered part-time college and is studying for a maths GCSE so that he can enter higher education, but he feels he is behind his peers. He said: ""I could have already been accomplishing things at this point. Rather than being 23 and likely to get into university at maybe 27, 28 at this point. ""I'm always playing catch-up."""

The Indian air safety watchdog stated on Monday that he would have his licence revoked for three years. While he acknowledged that he had failed the check-ups, Mr Kathpalia had told Reuters news agency he planned to contest the results. Speaking before his suspension was confirmed, he said: ""It was 1.30 in the afternoon, only a bloody stark-raving alcoholic is bloody drunk at 1.30 in the afternoon. ""I am going to contest this."" Mr Kathpalia, who claims he was the victim of internal feuding within Air India, was only appointed at the loss-making airline in June 2017 and had already run afoul of alcohol tests before the latest incident. More than 50,000 people have signed Sky News' petition backing televised leaders' debates for elections - have you? He was suspended for three months last year for allegedly refusing to take breathalysers, which led to a court case being filed against him by trade union the Indian Commercial Pilots Association. Air India has not commented on the latest suspension and it is unclear whether the pilot will retain his position as director of operations during the ban. Mr Kathpalia is not alone among Indian pilots for alcohol-related misconduct. In August, the country's aviation minister told parliament that 132 had failed pre-flight alcohol tests between 2015 and 2017. Of those, Suresh Prabhu said that 112 pilots were first time offenders and their license was suspended for three months. Fifteen were repeat offenders and had their licence suspended for three years. India is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world, with a 20% increase in the number of passengers taking domestic and international flights over the past few years. More than one million flights departed the country during the last fiscal year."

Their 22-year-old daughter, Nikola Dunova, was injured and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. Her daughter, aged three, Livia Matova, who was also in the car, remains in a critical condition. Mr Jarral's uncle, Shafqat Mirza, told Sky News correspondent Tom Parmenter, who is in Darnall, that his nephew was a ""unique character, very humble, very polite - he was full of life and devoted to his sons. He would do anything for them"". ""He was always taking them out on trips, shopping, fun fairs...he was very, very close to his kids."" Mr Mirza confirmed his nephew's wife, who is originally Slovakian, was in the vehicle but survived and is being treated in hospital for a broken leg, back injuries and minor facial injuries. He revealed they had been planning a trip to Mecca on 27 November. Mr Jarral had been driving the people carrier home after a trip to London when they were hit by the VW Golf at 8:50pm on Friday evening. A South Yorkshire police vehicle had been pursuing the VW Golf at the time of the crash and the incident has now been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct who are carrying out their own investigation. Tufail Hussain, 80, was one of the first people to get to the wreckage of the crash after hearing a loud bang outside his home. Mr Hussain said: ""It was just terrible. It's the worst thing I have ever seen. ""The whole of Darnall is in shock. We are all traumatised and it will take a long time for us to get over this."" He said an off-duty paramedic who lives on the street treated the victims at the scene. Medics from a private medical support firm, based a few hundred yards from where the collision happened, also came to help. Mr Hussain said: ""The whole community is shocked but they have pulled together. Everyone came together to help."" Detective Chief Inspector Jude Ashmore, leading the investigation, said: ""We are continuing to support both families and we have specially trained officers with them. My thoughts are with them and I'd ask that people continue to respect their privacy as they try to digest what's happened. ""We remain keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, or who may have footage of the collision. If you have information that could assist with the investigation, please call 101 quoting incident number 741 of 9 November 2018. You can also speak to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.""

On Sunday, flowers were left by the side of the road but all traces of the crash had been removed. The three occupants of the car, aged 17, 18 and 23, are being questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving."

It was August 1971 when the British army launched Operation Demetrius - the introduction of internment without trial. Over the course of three days, eyewitnesses claim members of the British Parachute Regiment shot dead 10 people. The dead included a Catholic priest who had gone to the aid of the wounded and a mother of eight. At the time, the army claimed the soldiers had come under gun attack and that the dead had been armed. But no one has ever produced forensic evidence to support that allegation and families have spent decades campaigning for justice. Ballymurphy was overshadowed by Bloody Sunday, when the Parachute Regiment shot 14 people dead in Derry six months later. John Teggart, whose father Daniel was one of the victims, has waited a lifetime for his death to be investigated. ""He was shot in the leg, initially shot in the leg and the eyewitness says he was shot repeatedly as he lay on the ground defenceless,"" he said. ""In total, there was 14 shots passed through his body."" In recent months, the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) claimed it was behind some of the Ballymurphy killings. Doug Beattie MLA, a former British army captain turned Ulster Unionist politician, says families need the whole story. More than 50,000 people have signed Sky News' petition backing televised leaders' debates for elections - have you? ""This was not just the British army killing civilians,"" he said. ""What hasn't happened is the IRA have not come forward to give their side of the story. ""Those people who were there, who are now senior members of Sinn Fein, need to come forward and say exactly what they were doing."" The inquest into the deaths of Francis Quinn, 19, Father Hugh Mullan, 38, Noel Phillips, 20, Joan Connolly, 50, Daniel Teggart, 44, Joseph Murphy, 41, Edward Doherty, 28, John Laverty, 20, Joseph Corr, 43 and John McKerr, 49, is expected to last six months."

The correspondence has been seen by the Sunday Mirror and handed to police. It comes as the police search of the back garden of a house in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, once owned by Cannan's mother continues into its 13th day. Cannan denies any involvement in the 25-year-old's disappearance in 1986. The letter purportedly reads: ""I was just about to throw myself off the building when your kind letter arrived. Many thanks. If I ever win the lottery I'll buy you a villa. ""Yes, this police and press assassination of me has upset me deeply. Worse, I am in no position to reply to it so I feel powerless. ""Strange really, the reality of my life is so much more interesting yet it has been buried."" Mystery of estate agent who vanished in 1986 It also refers to a video for a dating agency Cannan made in 1987 in which he describes his ideal woman as ""somebody who's easy and relaxed to be with"". The video is understood to have been made six weeks before he was arrested for abducting and murdering newlywed Shirley Banks in Bristol. He is serving a life sentence for her murder at maximum security Full Sutton prison in Yorkshire.   Ms Lamplugh went missing after leaving her west London office to meet a client, known only as Mr Kipper, at a property in Fulham.

""We are on the verge of signing up for something even worse than the current constitutional position. These are terms that might be enforced on a colony,"" he adds. Mr Johnson's stinging attack on Number 10 comes days after his brother, Jo, quit his role as transport minister. :: Jo Johnson's resignation could signal real trouble for Theresa May Jo Johnson said the PM's Brexit proposal was a ""failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis"". Over the weekend, promises of a deal with the EU collapsed with both sides stuck on the terms of the Irish backstop. The UK and the EU want to avoid border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic but cannot agree how that would work. Brexiteers insist any arrangement should be time limited, with the UK able to say when it breaks away. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom warned that if there is no get-out clause ""I very much doubt we could get it through parliament"". :: Military could be used in the event of a 'no-deal' Brexit More than 50,000 people have signed Sky News' petition backing televised leaders' debates for elections - have you? The EU rejected Mrs May's plan for a mechanism which would allow the UK to leave such an arrangement. Mr Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary in July over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, writes in his column: ""Even if we agree with the EU that the UK must have a unilateral break clause, so that we can go our own sweet way at a time of our own choosing, it is irrelevant because the programme and ambition of the government is to remain in captivity, to stay in our cell even if we are given the theoretical key to escape."" With no deal reached, time is running out to secure a special EU summit before the end of the month. An extra cabinet meeting had been pencilled in this week but that's looking highly unlikely. Mr Johnson warns MPs not to surrender to the ""scare tactic"" approach of the PM when she speaks of the ""chaos of no deal"". Downing Street is preparing for a difficult week, with more resignations a growing possibility. Reports suggest a further four Remain-voting ministers are considering their positions. Even if the PM agrees a deal with the EU and her cabinet, getting it through parliament remains a challenge. With the DUP and hardline Brexiteers prepared to vote down any deal, the parliamentary arithmetic is looking increasingly difficult. The government insists a deal can still be done, but Downing Street knows the slipping timetable leaves little time to achieve it."

Mr Hunt will have meetings with King Salman and the country's controversial crown prince Mohammed bin Salman during the visit, it has been confirmed. Ahead of arriving in the Middle East on Monday, Mr Hunt said: ""The international community remain united in horror and outrage at the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi one month ago. ""It is clearly unacceptable that the full circumstances behind his murder still remain unclear. ""We encourage the Saudi authorities to co-operate fully with the Turkish investigation into his death, so that we deliver justice for his family and the watching world.""

He posted a long message on Instagram after appearing on Good Morning Britain, saying he had wanted to say more but did not have enough time on the show. Statistics showing it is ""largely black youths stabbing each other"" are ""only true of certain areas"", he said. ""There had been a lot of reference to a statistic that it's largely black youths stabbing each other - what was left out was that this is only true of certain areas, as anyone with a brain can work out, in more densely white populated areas, the face of knife crime is white,"" he said. ""That's never represented in the media. The fact that the face of knife crime they project nationally is black youths, as I said this morning implies institutional racism and criminalises a whole race, fitting their agenda to bring back racially profiled stop and search. ""I don't think stop and search works to do anything apart from cause more division, friction and lack of trust of an organisation ever proven to be growingly corrupt."" The star, whose real name is Stephen Manderson, went on to say that the problem has been growing for years, with ""many contributing factors"". ""I'd put poverty at the top of the list. There's a science to social deprivation, to exclusion, expulsion, lack of paternal role models, lack of any role models, unequal education, unequal opportunity, cuts to all the services that might help people from going down the road to carrying a knife.""

He finished his message by saying that knife crime is not just a problem for the people affected, but society as a whole. ""We need to start empowering people in their communities and giving them voices, doing everything we can to help underprivileged children and struggling families,"" he continued. ""All of this happens while our government quite simply washes the blood from their hands. Let's discuss."" It comes after several stabbings in London in the past few weeks. On 31 October, Rocky Djelal, 38, died after a daylight attack in Rotherhithe, southeast London. Fifteen-year-old Jay Hughes died in hospital after being attacked in Bellingham, southeast London, the following day.

2018-11-12,"A five-minute neck scan could predict cognitive decline 10 years before symptoms appear, according to scientists.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181112174842/https://news.sky.com/story/five-minute-neck-scan-could-indicate-dementia-risk-11552237,"Researchers suggest the quick scan of blood vessels may become a routine part of screening for people at risk of dementia if the results are confirmed in larger studies. The scan identifies whether the vessels in the neck are stiffening, diminishing their ability to protect more delicate vessels around the body from the powerful physical pulses of blood generated by the heart. Ageing and high blood pressure can cause this stiffening, which over time will weaken the protective effect given by healthy, elastic vessels. As a progressively stronger pulse travels into fragile vessels it could cause structural changes in the brain's blood vessel network, as well as minor brain bleeds called mini-strokes. All of these can contribute to the development of dementia. Dr Scott Chiesa, post-doctoral researcher at UCL, said: ""These findings demonstrate the first direct link between the intensity of the pulse transmitted towards the brain with every heartbeat and future impairments in cognitive function. ""It's therefore an easily measurable and potentially treatable cause of cognitive decline in middle-aged adults which can be spotted well in advance."" More than 50,000 people have signed Sky News' petition backing televised leaders' debates for elections - have you? A group of 3,191 middle-aged men and women volunteered in the study, which began in 2002. All were given an ultrasound which measured the intensity of the pulse travelling toward their brain, and were monitored for 15 years, with researchers testing their memory and problem-solving ability. The 25% of volunteers with the highest pulse at the beginning of the study were about 50% more likely to exhibit accelerated cognitive decline over the next 10 years when compared with the other participants. Researchers defined cognitive decline as a noticeable and measurable reduction in cognitive abilities, including memory, language, thinking and judgement skills. It can be one of the first signs of dementia, but not everyone with those signs will develop dementia. The UCL team plan to use MRI scans to check if the individuals who showed signed of decline also show structural and functional changes. They will also test whether the scan can improve existing ""risk scores"" which predict dementia. Professor Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which co-funded the research, said further research was needed to check whether lifestyle changes and medicines to reduce pulse wave intensity also delay cognitive decline. The research is being presented to the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions conference in Chicago."

2018-11-12,For days in Westminster we've been bracing ourselves for a round of resignations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181112174842/https://news.sky.com/story/jo-johnsons-resignation-could-signal-real-trouble-for-theresa-may-11549595,"As the prospect of a Brexit deal looms larger, we had thought that a minister or two, might throw in the towel. We just didn't think the resignation would come from the side it did. Instead of a livid Liam Fox, or pugnacious Penny Mordaunt, or one of the other senior Brexiteers, it was Jo Johnson, mid-ranking transport minister, younger brother of Boris, and ardent Remainer who has quit. With it, he's calling for another referendum, or so-called ""People's Vote"", on Brexit. Indeed, he went further than that. In an excoriating online piece, Mr Johnson denounced the prime minister's handling of Brexit as ""a failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis"". He also said that he could no longer accept the prime minister's ultimatum - that it is her deal or no deal at all, saying that is a false choice which will doom Britain to ""vassalage"". Mr Johnson's resignation will not rock the government as violently as did that of his brother's, only a few month ago. But it is, for the prime minister, a menacing portent. When it comes to the final showdown, getting her deal through parliament Theresa May already faced a huge problem with the Brexiteer wing of her party. On my assessment, whatever the PM brings back from Brussels, it is virtually certain that there are around 30 of her own most die-hard MPs who will resist her come what may. :: Five key points from his resignation blog post The parliamentary arithmetic, for her deal then, was tortuous. If Mr Johnson is symptomatic of a wider shift amongst Remainer Conservative MPs, that they too reject May's dichotomy that it is her deal or bust, then the PM is in real trouble. She might - just - have been able to corral the support of enough Labour MPs, frightened of the economic consequences of ""no-deal"", to compensate for the shortfall of a few Tory Leavers. There is no way she can plug a second gap. She could just about afford one splinter cell. Not two. Mr Johnson's behaviour does echo a shift that's taken place among more moderate, centrist figures in the Tory parliamentary party in recent months. Hitherto the complaints about the PM's conduct were largely limited to the Brexiteers. That sense of unease, of lack of trust in the PM's judgement, has spread to new quarters. Indeed, one People's Vote source told me that Mr Johnson is not alone, that they are wooing another handful of Tory Remainers who might resign in the coming days. He says the country is 'barrelling towards an incoherent Brexit' The source said: ""We think there are a handful of ministers who do not think that differently from Jo. We're working on them. ""Everyone has to make up their own mind. It's their choice about how best to represent the interests of their constituents and their country. Do I expect Johnson to be the last ministerial resignation? I don't."" An upsurge of support on the Tory benches for another referendum doesn't just pose problems for Downing Street. Jeremy Corbyn too, already under pressure from his overwhelmingly Remainer grassroots, might just start to look ever so slightly awkward if he continues to resist calls to voice his support, as Tory after Tory does so. Especially as the realisation grows that it is entirely possible, if he were to shift position, that there would possibly be a parliamentary majority for a new plebiscite. But it is not Mr Corbyn's job to ram a deal through parliament. More than 50,000 people have signed Sky News' petition backing televised leaders' debates for elections - have you? The PM's problems are of a different order of magnitude. It might be that an exodus of Remainers makes Brexiteers think twice before signing their resignation letters, fearful of her fall without foresight of the consequences. Once again, Mrs May's weakness might prove her strength. But even if she survives the coming weeks, she can't run forever. Time has run out. Stanley Johnson said that his son's decision reminded him of Tennyson's famous poem The Charge of the Light Brigade. Of course, its most celebrated line: ""Cannon to the left of them, cannon to the right"" reminds me far more, of Theresa May, than of either Johnson. If more Remainer resignations come and Mrs May continues to charge down the same course, it is now my belief that she will meet her political demise on the floor of the House of Commons, as a result of cannon from both sides of her own party."

Mr Trump and Mr Putin listened in silence as France's president used the occasion to sound a sobering warning about the fragility of peace and the dangers of nations that put themselves first.

However, speaking to Sky News this morning, Sir Keir directly countered the stance of his party leader. ""Brexit can be stopped,"" the shadow Brexit secretary said. ""But the real question is, what are the decisions we're going to face over the next few weeks and months? ""Decision one is on the deal; decision two is - if the deal goes down - should there be a general election? ""And decision three is - if there's no general election - all options must be on the table, including the option of a public vote.

Sir Keir said Mr Corbyn was ""explaining how he approached the referendum"" in the magazine interview. But he insisted he, Mr Corbyn, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and ""the whole of the Labour Party"" is behind the party's Brexit policy. As agreed at their September conference, Labour may support a fresh Brexit referendum if parliament rejects a deal agreed with the EU by Prime Minister Theresa May and a general election doesn't follow. Sir Keir claimed ""nothing Jeremy has said is intended to disturb that"", adding: ""I think just trying to find differences between us, ok fine, but actually the party position is very clear."" His junior shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, later attempted to clarify the confusion over Labour's stance. She told Sky News: ""Anything can be stopped, I suppose, theoretically. ""But, what Jeremy was doing in his response was emphasising the fact we've said all along that we respect the outcome of the referendum."" She added: ""We do mean it, we respect the outcome of the referendum."" Labour have stated they will vote against a Brexit deal in the House of Commons if it does not meet their six tests for an agreement. On Sunday, Ms Thornberry denied the party was chasing a ""fantasy prospectus"" with their demand a Brexit deal delivers the exact same benefits as membership of the EU's single market and customs union. She also told the BBC's Andrew Marr show ""all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a people's vote"" if a general election is not held following MPs' rejection of an agreement with Brussels. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown stated his belief Mr Corbyn would abide by Labour's conference motion on Brexit. He told an Institute for Government event in London on Monday: ""Jeremy used to remind me when I was in government that we should be bound by conference motions, he always says he is bound by them."" The ex-premier also called for a royal commission to help heal Brexit divisions, by addressing questions about migration, sovereignty and the UK's economic future raised by the EU referendum. And Mr Brown repeated his belief there will be a second Brexit referendum. It has been reported, if no agreement with the EU is reached this week, the UK will meet the deadline at which plans for a ""no-deal"" Brexit have to be acted upon. Senior UK and EU officials continued their negotiations until 2.45am on Monday, Downing Street revealed. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We have made good progress in the negotiations in relation to the withdrawal agreement but there are substantial issues still to be overcome in relation to the Northern Irish backstop. ""That remains the case. The talks are ongoing."" But sources told Sky News there would still be no emergency cabinet meeting on Monday for ministers to sign off on a Brexit deal, with the agenda for Tuesday's scheduled meeting yet to be set. Time is running out for an extraordinary EU summit to be held this month for the bloc's leaders to approve an agreement, with Mrs May coming under increasing pressure at the key time in negotiations. Ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy on Monday, as he expressed despair the government ""seems to be on the verge of total surrender"". Meanwhile, House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom warned the UK must not be left ""trapped"" in a backstop agreement aimed at avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt warned the prime minister both cabinet and parliament would act as ""checks"" on a Brexit deal. ""Cabinet's job is to put something to parliament that's going to deliver on the referendum result,"" she said. And, former culture secretary John Whittingdale claimed it is ""quite difficult"" to see how Mrs May could remain in 10 Downing Street if parliament votes down her Brexit deal. Remain-supporting ex-cabinet minister Justine Greening also added to the strain on the prime minister, as she told Sky News Mrs May's Chequers plan would ""clearly"" not get through the Commons. ""I think parliament will reject that deal, I think parliament will vote against a no-deal,"" said Ms Greening, who supports a second EU referendum. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier updated the bloc's foreign ministers on the state of negotiations on Monday, where he repeated an agreement has not yet been reached. The European Commission official highlighted how the Irish border issue remains a key stumbling block. Downing Street played down a report that Mr Barnier told them the ""main elements"" of a deal are ready to present to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""I've talked about taking things with a pinch of salt before. That applies here. I'd apply a bucket of salt to this one,"" a spokesman said."

The event, on 21 November, will mark 100 years since the passing of the Qualification of Women Act, where women could legally stand for Parliament. Nancy Astor became the first female MP to take her seat in the Commons in 1919. The first female MP, Constance Markievicz, was Sinn Fein and so didn't take her Commons seat. During the day, the women will spend time with their MPs, and can attend Prime Ministers' Questions as well as an event with Harriet Harman and Vicky Ford. Helen Pankhurst, whose great-grandmother was suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, will also be speaking on an Ask Her to Stand panel. Frances Scott, director of 50:50 Parliament said: ""Every MP in the UK should take part in this event. It is vital that our political representatives reflect the communities they serve. ""Today only one in three politicians are women and until that number is increased laws and regulations will never properly reflect the needs of the variety of women in the UK today. ""If you are considering standing for public office or want to know more about what it means to be an MP this event is for you."" Women interested must contact their MP and ask for an invitation, as no one without one will be able to attend. More than 50,000 people have signed the petition - have you? 50:50 Parliament explained the purpose of the day is to ""inspire and encourage a diverse range of women to stand for political office"". The group added: ""In last 100 years, only 491 women have gained seats at Westminster, compared to 4,503 men. ""At the last election only 12 extra women were elected - at this rate it will take over 50 years to achieve the gender balanced Parliament that all parties have agreed is desirable."""
2018-11-12,Formula One driver Max Verstappen has been punished after being caught on camera shoving his rival Esteban Ocon.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181112174842/https://news.sky.com/story/f1-driver-max-verstappen-punished-for-shoving-esteban-ocon-after-brazilian-grand-prix-11552131,"The angry exchange in the paddock came after a collision during the Brazilian Grand Prix which likely cost Red Bull driver Verstappen the win in Sao Paolo. Verstappen has been ordered to serve two days of public service after race stewards ruled he ""started an altercation"" with the Force India driver before ""pushing or hitting Ocon forcibly several times in the chest"". Verstappen was leading at Interlagos when he tried to pass backmarker Ocon, who attempted to get ahead of him whilst being a lap behind, but instead the pair made contact. The impact sent the 21-year-old Dutchman into a spin and he ended up in second place, which allowed five-times world champion Britain's Lewis Hamilton to gain the lead and he won the race for Mercedes. Verstappen was furious with Ocon, 22, and said over the radio: ""I hope I can't find him now in the paddock because that guy has a f****** problem."" He also branded the Frenchman an ""idiot"" and said Ocon had taken ""a stupid risk"". Stewards found Ocon at fault and handed him a 10-second stop and go penalty. After the race, TV footage from the paddock showed the Red Bull star pushing Ocon with one hand, with the Frenchman responding by pressing his hand into Verstappen's chest. Verstappen brushed his hand away and continued to push Ocon backwards, who at one stage seemed to drop down a step onto a lower level. Verstappen then shoved him again before walking away as officials intervened. Both drivers were then called to the stewards for alleged ""physical contact with another competitor"". More than 50,000 people have signed Sky News' petition backing televised leaders' debates for elections - have you? Force India defended their driver, while Ocon criticised Verstappen for the Dutchman's post-race conduct. He told Sky F1: ""What I'm really surprised of is the behaviour of Max, the FIA having to stop him from being violent, pushing me and wanting to punch me. ""That is not professional."" Red Bull boss Christian Horner said he could understand his driver's frustration. He told Sky F1: ""I think has been pretty restrained, to be honest with you, it's cost him a grand prix victory. ""He's driven his heart out with a damaged car. Esteban was lucky to get away with a push. ""Emotions are running high. I told him 'just get yourself under control on the cool-down lap', because he's lost a victory through no fault of his own today."" Verstappen added: ""What can I do about it? I lost a victory but hopefully in 15 years time, we can laugh about it."""

2018-11-12,"A Briton who died from rabies after being bitten by a cat in Morocco did not receive the needed vaccine ""until it was too late"", it has emerged.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181112174842/https://news.sky.com/story/vaccine-came-too-late-for-briton-who-died-of-rabies-after-cat-bite-in-morocco-11552500,"Public Health England (PHE) revealed news of the death earlier alongside a renewed warning to travellers over the risk of the potentially fatal disease, although no other details about the case were revealed. But according to Professor Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the victim experienced a delay in getting the treatment they needed. Vaccines are extremely effective if provided promptly after exposure to rabies, but the symptoms are always fatal if allowed to fully develop. Professor Whitworth said the victim ""in this tragic case"" was bitten just a few weeks ago. ""My understanding is that this is somebody who had contact with a cat that was behaving abnormally and sought care, I believe in Morocco and in the UK, but unfortunately didn't receive vaccination until it was too late,"" he said. ""The typical time interval (for symptoms to appear) is two to three months, so you do have enough time (to seek care). More than 50,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""But it can be as short as a week and that's why seeking prompt care and getting vaccination is so important."" The victim is believed to have sought help in both Morocco and the UK, but it is not known where they experienced the delay in what Professor Whitworth described as a ""high stakes"" situation. He said that such cases were proof as to why it was so important for health workers to be aware of the potentially deadly impact of rabies, which is extremely rare in the UK. There has been just one case of a human obtaining the disease from a native animal since 1902, when in 2002 a person was bitten by an infected bat in Scotland. The last recorded rabies case in Britain was in 2012, after a UK resident was bitten by a dog - the most common source of infection in most parts of the world - in South Asia. It does not pass between humans, but health workers and those close to the victim of the Morocco case are being assessed and offered vaccination where necessary. PHE describes rabies as a ""very serious viral infection"", which affects the brain and central nervous system, but initial symptoms can be as unsuspecting as a headache. As the disease progresses, there may be hallucinations and respiratory failure, potentially followed by death. It has been all but eliminated in much of the western world, including Australia and New Zealand, but is more common in countries in Asia and Africa. People travelling there are advised to consider vaccination, particularly if they intend to stay for at least a month or if they are planning activities which put them at increased risk of coming into contact with animals with rabies."
2018-11-14,The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery has fired a 41-gun salute from Green Park to mark Prince Charles's 70th birthday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181114211533/https://news.sky.com/story/41-gun-salute-to-mark-prince-charles-70th-birthday-11554067,"In the Tower of London, the Honourable Artillery Company fired a 62-gun salute at 1pm, while Westminster Abbey's bells also rang out in his honour. At Green Park at noon, six First World War-era 13-pounder field guns fired blank rounds at 10 seconds intervals until 41 had been fired. The guns had been pulled to the park by 71 horses. But it was business as usual for the heir to the throne who is spending his birthday working, as are his son Prince William and daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. The couple travelled to Barnsley in Yorkshire where they helped prepare lunch for young people affected by homelessness, in the town's Centrepoint branch. They chatted with two of the young people who have been helped by the charity, while helping make soup. Charles will host a tea party with the Duchess of Cornwall for other inspirational 70-year-olds this afternoon, before a glittering black tie event this evening.   He has received birthday wishes from around the world, including the Welsh Guards at home and abroad, with troops recording messages from Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany, Chile and Canada. On Buckingham Palace's forecourt, the Band of the Welsh Guards played Happy Birthday to the prince. European Royals and some of Charles's closest friends and family members will attend a party at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening, hosted by the Queen. On Thursday, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn will be in a delegation of MPs and peers who will visit the Prince of Wales to offer him a portfolio of humble address thanking him for his service to the commonwealth. A group of MPs will debate the content of the address in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon. Ahead of the debate Mrs May paid tribute to his work saying his commitment to public service has been ""total"". She added: ""That is true of his royal duties, which see him performing well over 600 official engagements every year. ""It is true of his work with the Commonwealth in which he has played an active role for many years, and the esteem in which he is held by the Commonwealth was made clear at the Heads of Government meeting earlier this year when the member states unanimously chose to name him as the next head of the organisation."" 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? She also praised his sons, saying they were a credit to him. Mr Corbyn toned down his republican views, adding: ""It might come as a surprise to many that His Royal Highness and I have something in common - we're both, it seems, leaving it late when it comes to career progression, although he has had a lifetime preparing for this role."" He said despite varying opinion, no one could say being heir to the throne was an easy job. Peers in the House of Lords are also expected to debate the message before joining with the Commons to send it later in the week. Ahead of his birthday, Clarence House released two new images, showing the prince with his entire dynasty for the first time. The relaxed pictures showed him in the garden with Prince George on his knee, while his sons and daughter-in-laws stood around him. The prince has become Britain's longest serving heir to the throne, and surpasses the age of retirement without having held what will be his biggest job. He remains passionate about environmental issues, and guest edited an edition of Country Life in which he encouraged people to ""think ahead to what our grandchildren will want and need"". A basic gun salute is 21-guns, but another 20 are added when it takes place in a royal park, like Green Park or Hyde Park. The extra 21 are added at the Tower of London because it is in the City of London. The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery is a mounted ceremonial battery formed by royal decree, which was originally called the Riding Troop. During a visit by King George VI, he crossed out 'Riding' in a guest book and wrote 'King's', leading to the renaming of the battery."

Ms Ljevleva was killed in the blast at the Zabka Polish supermarket in Hinckley Road in Leicester on 25 February, along with Mary Ragoobeer, 46, her sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17, and Shane's girlfriend Leah Beth Reek, 18, who were all in the flat above. The three men on trial for the murder of all five victims are Ms Ljevleva's partner Arkan Ali, 37, the supermarket's leaseholder Aram Kurd, 33, and Hawkar Hassan, 32. Prosecuting barrister David Herbert QC said the explosion was caused by ""many many litres of petrol"" and was so powerful it demolished the entire building. The court watched three CCTV recordings of the explosion from three different angles, one of which showed debris being thrown across the main road with dust and smoke filling the street. Mr Herbert told the jury: ""It was no accident that the petrol used caused so much damage - that was their intention."" The jury was told the three men ""knew people would be at home in the flat above the shop at the time of the explosion - that fact didn't bother the defendants one bit as they sought to maximise the damage caused to the shop premises."" 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Ms Ljevleva is alleged to have conspired with the defendants by helping them to buy an insurance policy on the shop which was not making much money. But Mr Herbert said that the three men ""thought she knew too much and decided to leave her to perish in the fire"". All three men deny all the charges against them, and the trial is expected to last for at least five weeks."

The members of staff had complained of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Salmond. Sky News has established that the party figure contacted by airport officials is Angus Robertson, the then leader of the SNP at Westminster. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? We asked Ms Sturgeon if it was conceivable that he did not tell her about Edinburgh Airport's concerns over the behaviour of Mr Salmond. She said: ""I understand public and media interest in this story but there are ongoing legal processes right now. We are in the midst of a civil court action between Alex Salmond and the Scottish government. As we know, there are ongoing police enquiries. ""I simply cannot comment or answer the questions that you are asking me. I am absolutely satisfied that I, the SNP, the Scottish Government have acted entirely appropriately at all stages."" Sky News asked Ms Sturgeon if the Edinburgh Airport claims were concealed and whether she was part of that. 
Sky News understands female employees expressed concerns to airport managers about what they regarded as inappropriate behaviour She replied: ""That is not the case, emphatically not the case. I understand these questions, I understand the interest, but I think people will also understand that serious concerns and complaints have been raised - actually the people raising those complaints now deserve to have the benefit of due process. ""I will answer all and any questions when legal processes have concluded but I think as most people will understand, it is neither possible nor appropriate for me to do so at this time."" Edinburgh Airport has confirmed that members of its staff are assisting with police enquiries into suggestions of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Salmond. As Scotland's first minister, he was a regular user of the passenger terminal. Mr Salmond strongly denies misconduct. In a statement, a spokesman said: ""Mr Salmond denies all suggestions of misconduct at any time and suggests that everyone should allow the police enquiries to take their proper course without briefing or breaching confidentiality. The ex-Scottish first minister's decision to ask the public for money was criticised by opposition politicians ""Alex has not been interviewed by Police about any matter. He is content to have his case against the Scottish Government stated in the Court of Session in January."" The former first minister is challenging the Scottish government's handling of two other complaints against him of sexual misconduct by government employees, dating back to 2013, which he denies. Scottish Labour's equalities spokesperson Pauline McNeill said: ""The allegations facing Alex Salmond are extremely serious and deserve proper scrutiny. ""But Nicola Sturgeon seems determined to hide behind process rather than be honest about who knew what and when - and crucially what was done to protect women. ""That is unacceptable. Given it now seems clear Angus Robertson - one of the SNP's most senior politicians - was told about concerns around Mr Salmond as early as 2008, we need an urgent statement from the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon clarifying exactly how these allegations were dealt with."""

It forecast the economy would be up to 3.9% weaker if the UK sought a free trade deal, such as the so-called Canada-plus being advocated by some Brexiteers. These projections are in comparison with how the UK would grow if it stayed inside the EU, so do not necessarily imply that the UK would be weaker in the long run than it is today. Indeed, the projections are in line with many others produced by independent bodies, and are slightly more conservative than those produced by the government.

Short answer: Ireland by a long shot, though the GDP impact is still lower than for the UK pic.twitter.com/LJbuEsYvQU ""The most significant risk to the forecast is the possibility of leaving the EU without an agreement, which would have a large negative impact on growth, especially if it happens in a disorderly manner and without a transition period. ""Beyond Brexit, the UK faces a range of other economic challenges, including persistently lacklustre productivity growth, high public debt, rising age-related spending pressures, and a wide current account deficit."" The Fund recommended that Britain raise its retirement age even further beyond the current plans of 67 between 2026 and 2028, and urged it to ditch the triple lock on state pension payments."

Its decision to shut the stores - Lakeside in Essex, its Metrocentre operation in Gateshead and sites in Norwich and Nottingham - places hundreds of jobs at risk. HoF was yet to confirm exactly how many would be lost. Intu said in response it was looking for new opportunities for the four stores as they had been ""under-performing"". HoF's statement said: ""We had various meetings with the landlord, Intu Properties, and adopted a flexible approach. ""Despite our best efforts we have been unable to agree reasonable terms for these stores to continue trading. ""Sadly, we are now in consultation with staff about the fact these stores face closure. ""We hope other institutional landlords will continue to work with us in order to save stores and jobs."" More than 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Mr Ashley said the stores face closing in the New Year. He added: ""I urge other institutional landlords to be more proactive to help save the HoF stores in their schemes."" The billionaire businessman had warned when HoF came under his control that 20% of its 59 premises may have to be shut. The previous management, who had planned to shut down half the sites in an effort to save the business, were thrown out as he prepared to make the chain become the ""Harrods of the high street"". In addition to Sports Direct and HoF he has further exposure to town centres through a 30% stake in Debenhams and has also recently bought Evans Cycles out of administration. Mr Ashley also plans to cut 50% of Evans stores. The high street has endured a brutal 2018 - with Toys R Us and Maplin the first casualties while a string of other big names have been forced to seek rescue deals with landlords. Pressures have included rising rents, business rates and wage bills at a time of greater consumer restraint in the run-up to Brexit. Landlords have attacked the growing use of Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs) by retailers looking to cut stores and reduce rent bills. A legal challenge against House of Fraser's pre-collapse CVA plan - brought by several companies - was settled out of court. House of Fraser fell into Mr Ashley's hands just days later. Intu Properties, currently the subject of possible takeover interest, said in response: ""We have been advised this morning that the four House of Fraser stores in our portfolio will be closing in early 2019, representing around 1% of our secured rent and 526,000 sq ft of retail space. We have had numerous meetings with Sports Direct including at the highest level to try to agree terms. ""While we cannot discuss the detail, we have been unable to reach agreement. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to re-engineer and re-let this under-performing space to new and exciting alternatives."""

It comes after Tracey Crouch quit as sports minister over the policy and a Sky News report that Theresa May was facing a mass resignation of ministerial aides if she did not change course. NEW: Told by source that govt will now accelerate the introduction of a £2 cap on #FOBT to April next year after Crouch resignation and ministerial aide rebellion (as we reported yesterday). WMS expected this afternoon confirming the move. More than 70 MPs, several former cabinet ministers among them, had tabled amendments to government business in a bid to force Downing Street to bring forward the reduction from £100 to £2. Appearing on Sky News, Ms Crouch was told ""you've got your way, but you've lost your job"". She replied: ""That is true, but people were losing their lives over these machines.""

""It's very sad that it took an honourable resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed odds betting terminals,"" the shadow culture secretary said. ""Whilst this is a personal humiliation for Jeremy Wright, this is a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction."" In his statement, Mr Wright said: ""The government has been clear that protecting vulnerable people is the prime concern, but that as a responsible government it is also right to take the needs of those employed by the gambling industry into account and provide time for an orderly transition. ""Parliament has, however, been clear that they want this change to be made sooner. The government has listened and will now implement the reduction in April 2019.""

""Can I ask my right honourable friend: is it a reality that now we have put down an amendment, that the government will accede and we will get this process started on 1 April next year?"" The PM replied: ""I know he has campaigned on this issue with a passion because, as he said, this question of the maximum stakes for FOBTs (fixed odd betting terminals) is one which does have an impact on vulnerable people as well as their families and loved ones. ""I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue. I know gambling addiction can devastate lives. ""Our priority is making sure that this change delivers the result we all want to see, we are listening to the concerns being raised by colleagues, and if my right honourable friend will have a little patience I can tell him my right honourable friend the culture secretary will set out further details later today."" An impact assessment in May 2017 suggested the new policy should come into force in nine months to a year. But Chancellor Philip Hammond told the Treasury committee last week that after talks with the betting industry, October 2019 was a ""sensible"" date to bring in the change."

Mr Ashley has a stake of almost 30% in Debenhams. The fashion industry publication Drapers reported that a number of high street suppliers had stopped working with Debenhams. It cited cuts to its credit insurance and fears of missed payments. Stock market analysts said the report was the reason for the chain's market value coming under renewed pressure. It is almost 85% down in the year to date, standing at £81.5m. Debenhams currently has a workforce of 27,000 staff and 165 stores. The company said: ""Many suppliers don't use credit insurance. Those that have used it historically are well aware of the current situation and work with retailers to manage things accordingly. ""Debenhams is well stocked for Christmas."" The wider retail sector is hoping for a pick-up in business after a tough 2018 dominated by Brexit caution and weather - the latter issue seeing shoppers staying away during the ""Beast from the East"" winter cold snap before a joint-record summer helped sales return."

But she has suffered a wave of ministerial resignations, as senior MPs ditched their support for her - either because she was pursuing too hard a divorce from the EU or one they deemed not hard enough. Sky News has rounded up the list of all those who have resigned over Brexit so far. Proving that Brexit can divide families just as much as the rest of politics, Jo Johnson, brother of Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson, quit as a transport minister on Friday. He warned the UK was ""barrelling towards an incoherent"" divorce and called for another referendum on the final terms of Brexit. A Remain-supporting minister in Orpington, where a majority of people voted to Leave in the 2016 poll, Mr Johnson attacked the draft agreement for being ""so radically different to what was proposed in the referendum campaign"". Having led the UK's Brexit strategy from the beginning, David Davis announced he was standing down in July over the PM's Chequers proposal. The plan for the UK's future relationship with Brussels angered many Brexiteers. In quitting, Mr Davis, a veteran Tory MP, said he feared the UK's ""negotiating approach"" would only result in ""further demands for concessions"" from the EU. One of the biggest figures of the Brexit campaign, Boris Johnson also quit as foreign secretary over the Chequers proposal. A closely watched figure in Westminster because of rumours of a leadership challenge, the former mayor of London said the Brexit dream was ""dying"" under Mrs May. He blamed ""needless self-doubt"", and has continued to be a vocal critic of Mrs May's Brexit plan since, saying it would turn the country into a colony of the EU. Seen as Mr Davis' deputy at the Brexit department, minister Steve Baker quit the same day. Referring to the Chequers proposal in his resignation letter, he wrote: ""I cannot support this policy with the sincerity and resolve which will be necessary"". Guto Bebb resigned as a defence minister in a surprise move ahead of a vote in the House of Commons. He quit the government to vote against it on an amendment tabled by Leave-backer Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Aberconwy MP complained that ""the Brexit that is being delivered today could not be further from what was promised"" and backed a so-called People's Vote, a second referendum on the final divorce terms. Two senior figures within the Conservative party have also quit over Brexit. Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield, vice-chairs for youth and women, respectively, stood down just seven months after being appointed. More than 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? More senior Conservatives have quit as aides to ministers over Brexit. Scott Mann, Robert Courts, Andrea Jenkyns, Chris Green have all resigned as parliamentary private secretaries so far to speak out about Brexit."

While Facebook still remains the dominant player in the social media space, the company's series of data blunders and potentially simply its age have left it losing some cool among younger users. Snapchat, with disappearing messages and clever image filters, has replaced Facebook as the growing market player among younger teens in the UK. Its access to measure not merely how many people know each other - as per Facebook's social graph - but the consolidated metric regarding close relationships - also offers it a strong avenue to attract advertisers. The Friendship Profiles offer Snapchat a way of measuring how much interest in particular topics or consumer items could be shared between different individuals. The update comes as the company struggles to recover from the collapse of its share price just days after it initially listed on the New York Stock Exchange, alongside consistent user growth."

The attackers spared three young children: a newborn baby found lying next to her dead mother, as well as two others who were six months and three years old. Officials accused the Wagners of an elaborate cover-up, including tampering with cell phones and security camera footage. ""They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully. But not carefully enough,"" Reader said. ""They left traces. They left a trail: The parts to build a silencer, the forged documents, the cameras, the cellphones, all that they tampered with, and the lies, all the lies they told us.""

2018-11-14,Business will be one of the key allies Theresa May seeks to enlist as she seeks to build support for the draft Brexit deal she has negotiated with the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181114211533/https://news.sky.com/story/may-looks-to-business-for-public-support-on-brexit-plan-11554144,"Put very crudely, big businesses and multinationals supported the Remain cause during the referendum, while most support for Brexit in the world of commerce came largely from the ranks of smaller business and privately and family-owned firms. Many businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector, have been vocal since the referendum about the need for any Brexit deal to keep trade as frictionless as possible. :: LIVE: PM seeks cabinet approval of draft deal Accordingly, while most business leaders are understandably reluctant to endorse Mrs May's deal until they have been through the fine detail, the chances are that many will privately be welcoming the terms negotiated. One business leader who has been prepared to go public is Jurgen Maier, chief executive of Siemens UK, one of the UK's largest manufacturing employers. He told Sky News: ""It seems like we have a deal that is possible now, so let's get behind it - it will be much lower friction [than a no deal Brexit] and as a business we can make it work, so let's get on with it."" That will be music to Mrs May's ears. A key aspect of the Prime Minister's Chequers proposals, which would appear to be enshrined in the Brexit deal, was to ensure trade in goods between Britain and the EU remained as frictionless as possible after Britain leaves the EU. This is something for which many business leaders, particularly manufacturers, had been calling. So Mrs May and her advisers were disappointed that business leaders were not more supportive, in public, of the Chequers proposals. They regarded it as the most pro-Brexit measure her government has undertaken. Mrs May has had to work hard to build bridges with business. For her first two years in office, she gave the impression of not liking business much, while relations sank to a new low when in June Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, was reported as having said ""f*** business"". Things have begun to change in recent months though, particularly since Mrs May appointed the former investment banker William Vereker as her business envoy in July. Business leaders have enjoyed greater access to the Prime Minister and have been invited to take part in meetings and telephone conference calls with her. This included a meeting with 150 or so business leaders on Halloween at the Guildhall in the City of London, co-hosted by Philip Hammond, the Chancellor. Many attendees were struck by the confident tone the pair adopted around Brexit. This was followed by the creation of five business councils that are intended to meet three times a year, twice with Mrs May and once with a senior cabinet minister, with the aim of providing ""high level advice and policy recommendations on the critical issues facing business"". While manufacturers and exporters have clearly been the main types of business leaders Mrs May has sought to protect in any Brexit deal, it is not the only one, although many players in the services sector - which accounts for three-quarters of GDP - feel they have been neglected. The City and the wider financial services sector have felt particularly sensitive. Mrs May abandoned early on in the Brexit process any idea of UK firms retaining 'passporting' arrangements that allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to go via individual country regulators. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Later, she also appeared to abandon the idea of 'mutual recognition', which essentially replicated the passporting arrangements. The expectation now is that the UK will seek so-called 'enhanced equivalence', under which UK and EU regulations would be regarded as equivalent, while the EU's existing equivalence regime with other countries would be widened to include sectors such as bank lending, which are not currently covered by them. This may be enough to satisfy some in the City. Accordingly, having sought closer ties with business leaders in recent months, Mrs May will be hoping many of them provide public backing to her as she seeks to get her Brexit deal over the line. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the battle Mrs May faces in getting the Commons to vote through her deal, contingency planning continues. It is already known that a lot of manufacturers are stockpiling goods and parts ahead of possible hold-ups at the borders after March next year. The majority of these have preferred to keep these activities secret but among those who have said publicly that they are include Airbus, the aircraft maker; Sanofi, the French drug maker; Bentley, the carmaker and Novo Nordisk, the Danish healthcare company and biggest supplier of insulin to Britain. Tobacco giant Imperial Brands, the maker of Lambert & Butler and Superkings cigarettes, has also started stockpiling inventory, as has Mondelez, the US owner of confectionary maker Cadbury. Warren East, the chief executive of aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce, has called stockpiling ""costly and inconvenient"" but has nonetheless signalled the company is engaging in it. The latest to discuss stockpiling publicly is Premier Foods, the maker of Oxo, Bisto and Batchelor's Super Noodles, which has already started ensuring it has adequate provisions of packaging and ingredients and which on Tuesday said it would start stockpiling finished goods if a no deal Brexit began to look likely. Yet some companies have ruled out stockpiling. Bombardier, the Canadian-owned aircraft and train manufacturer, has ruled out stockpiling parts on the grounds that it would cost it up to £30m to do so. Others argue that the complexity of their supply chains is such that even stockpiling parts and components would be of little use. For example, industry gossip suggests that at least one of the major Japanese carmakers has ruled out any stockpiling on the basis that to do so would only partly mitigate the damage that a hard Brexit would do to it. It - and others - will be desperately hoping that Mrs May succeeds in winning Parliament's backing, plus sign-off from the EU's other 27 countries, for her Brexit deal."

Named Antlia 2, or Ant 2 for short, the galaxy has managed to avoid detection until now due to its extremely low density - as well as being hidden behind the shroud of the Milky Way's disk. It is known as a dwarf galaxy, one of the first types of galaxies to emerge in the early universe. Dwarf galaxy stars are old and quite low in mass and metal. However compared to other dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, Ant 2 is truly enormous - about a third of the size of the Milky Way itself. It is also eerily faint, according to normal measurements. The University of Cambridge wrote that the galaxy is either far too large for its luminosity or far too dim for its size. ""This is a ghost of a galaxy,"" said Dr Gabriel Torrealba, the paper's lead author. ""Objects as diffuse as Ant 2 have simply not been seen before. Our discovery was only possible thanks to the quality of the Gaia data."" Co-author Dr Sergey Koposov, from Carnegie Mellon University, added: ""The simplest explanation of why Ant 2 appears to have so little mass today is that it is being taken apart by the Galactic tides of the Milky Way. ""What remains unexplained, however, is the object's giant size. Normally, as galaxies lose mass to the Milky Way's tides, they shrink, not grow."" According to the University of Cambridge, if it is impossible for the dwarf galaxy to have grown as the Milky Way stripped its mass away, then Ant 2 must have been truly enormous. More than 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Alternatively, the academics suggest that Ant 2's low density could mean that a modification to the properties of dark matter is needed. The current favoured theory predicts dark matter to pack tightly in the centres of galaxies. But given the lack of density within Ant 2, it suggests another dark matter particle which does not cluster may be needed. ""Compared to the rest of the 60 or so Milky Way satellites, Ant 2 is an oddball,"" said co-author Dr Matthew Walker, from Carnegie Mellon University. ""We are wondering whether this galaxy is just the tip of an iceberg, and the Milky Way is surrounded by a large population of nearly invisible dwarfs similar to this one."""

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) also revealed the helicopter's manufacturer has issued a safety alert to all owners of the particular model - AW169 - involved in the crash on 27 October. They have been told to carry out a ""precautionary inspection"" of the system which controls the tail rotor. Owners of another model - AW189 - which has a similar tail rotor control system, have also been warned. The helicopter came down outside the King Power Stadium, killing the club's owner, Thai billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha; the helicopter's pilot Eric Swaffer; Mr Swaffer's partner Izabela Lechowicz; ex-Thai beauty queen Nursara Suknamai; and Kaveporn Punpare, who worked for the Leicester City owner. One witness, Sky Sports News cameraman Dan Cox, told Sky News: ""I heard the helicopter coming out of the stadium, saw it as you do, they are amazing pieces of machinery and then I just carried on walking thinking next time I look up it is going to be overhead. ""The next thing I just looked up and it was just spinning, static just out of control, just a constant spinning, I have never seen anything like it."" He added: ""I don't know how the pilot did it but he seemed to manage to slow down the spinning rotation and it drifted off into the corner part of the car park."" More than 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Investigators have so far found that at the time of the crash the weather was good with clear visibility. They believe the helicopter hit the ground in an ""upright position on a stepped concrete surface"". Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's son Aiyawatt is planning to erect a statue of his father outside the stadium as ""a permanent and fitting tribute to the man that made it all possible"". He said: ""He will forever be in our hearts. He will never be forgotten."""

He joked that while the show ""didn't change anything"", its popularity meant that ""schoolchildren knew who ran the country for the first time ever"". Of the Thatcher puppet, which is one of three, he said children now would see it and ""think that's Theresa May"". The collection had been stored in three shipping containers at Law's home on the Cambridgeshire Fens. Scripts from all 18 series are also included, along with scores of sketches. The first batch of items arrived at Cambridge University Library on Tuesday. The collection also includes newspaper cuttings, designs and puppet moulds - including 10 large boxes of teeth moulds. Law said there ""couldn't be a better place"" to house the collection. Over the coming months, the items will be put into environmentally-controlled archival storage, and could be displayed in future. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Cambridge University Librarian Dr Jessica Gardner said it was ""an easy decision"" to welcome the collection. ""Immediately my eyes lit up and my sense of both the political, cultural and historical importance of this archive was immediate to me,"" she said. Law first met Spitting Image co-creator Peter Fluck as a teenager at Cambridge School of Art and they had their first studio in the city. ""Now for those who are interested they can come here and find all the scandals and nonsense that went on in the 1980s to the mid-1990s which is probably more truthful than the official archives, because we didn't stint ourselves,"" Law said. Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, who was a scriptwriter on the show, said: ""I am delighted that the Spitting Image archive has gone to Cambridge University Library and that Roger Law is to be studied properly.

2018-11-18,"We have, of course, been here before.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181118195317/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-can-look-to-sir-john-major-for-hope-of-victory-in-any-no-confidence-vote-11556912,"The increasingly likely no-confidence vote facing Theresa May in the coming days is already looking like a re-run of Sir John Major's battle against Tory Eurosceptics in 1995. When the prime minister began her Number 10 news conference declaring that ""serving in high office is an honour and privilege"", it was eerily similar to Mr Major's opening words in 1995 in the Downing Street rose garden. ""I see public service as a duty and if you can serve, I believe you have an obligation to do so,"" he began, before sensationally quitting as Tory leader and challenging his tormentors: ""It's time to put up or shut up."" The party's rules are different now. If Mrs May had quit, she couldn't stand, so the Brexiteers aiming to force her out just need to put up 48 letters to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to trigger a no-confidence vote. Another similarity between now and 1995 - or so it has seemed to me - was the chaotic nature of Jacob Rees Mogg's impromptu news conference outside parliament's St Stephen's Entrance and of John Redwood's campaign launch 23 years ago. Mr Redwood - known to MPs in those days as ""the Vulcan"", after Star Trek's Mr Spock - was surrounded by maverick right-wing backbenchers including Teresa Gorman, wearing a bright lime green jacket, and Tony Marlow, in a garish striped blazer. Of course, Mrs May and Mr Major are not the only Tory leaders to have faced backbench plots to remove them in recent years. Mr Major survived, but Margaret Thatcher, in 1990, and Iain Duncan Smith, in 2003, were toppled by their MPs. I have had a ringside seat for the first three: But so far the plot that most closely resembles Mrs May's bruising Brexit battle with her backbenchers is Mr Major's showdown with his Eurosceptic MPs in 1995. It's beginning to look like deja vu. A few years earlier, in 1993, Mr Major had famously - or notoriously - called Eurosceptic cabinet ministers ""bastards"" in comments recorded after a TV interview with ITN's Michael Brunson. Vicar's daughter Mrs May would never use such uncouth language, but she must have been exasperated by cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson, David Davis and - this week - Dominic Raab and Esther McVey. And probably at times by Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom, too. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Back then I was political editor of the Daily Express and my 1995 cuttings book - which my wife found in a cupboard at home - reveals how ""the biggest political gamble of any prime minister since the war"" became ""a famous victory"". And it's not just the issue, Europe, that's the same. Some of the 1995 backbench plotters against Mr Major are - nearly a quarter of a century later - among those MPs now campaigning to remove Mrs May. Mr Major's war with the Tory right, which reached its climax in 1995, had begun in 1992, when hardliners opposed the Maastricht Treaty. Nine Conservative MPs had the whip withdrawn, but there were many more rebels. They included Bill Cash, who voted against the treaty, and Mr Duncan Smith, Bernard Jenkin and John Whittingdale - now one of the MPs who has written a no-confidence letter to Mr Brady - who were among the abstainers. After Mr Major's big gamble, his enemies were divided on who should oppose him. Norman Lamont, sacked by Mr Major from his job as chancellor two years earlier and now a leading cheerleader for Brexit, was touted. Michael Portillo, the darling of the Tory right at the time, was embarrassed when it was revealed that - despite pledging loyalty to Mr Major - he had set up a campaign HQ and installed telephone lines ready to enter the contest in a second ballot. Mr Whittingdale, then seen as Mr Portillo's campaign lieutenant, confirmed that his man was ready to strike. ""If the prime minister did come to stand down, whenever that time may be, then Michael Portillo will be a candidate for the leadership,"" he said in a radio interview. And Edward Leigh, now seen as a Tory grandee but who was then another ex-minister sacked by Mr Major and later backed Mr Redwood, said at the time: ""There is no point in having a leadership contest with a Mickey Mouse candidate."" When Tory MPs voted on 4 July, a day the Daily Express described as ""the most dramatic at Westminster since Margaret Thatcher's downfall in 1990"", Mr Major won 218 votes, Mr Redwood 89, there were eight abstentions and - bizarrely - 12 spoilt ballot papers. That meant 109 Conservative MPs failed to back him and his winning margin was exactly 2-1. Within minutes of the result, flanked by his wife Norma and his campaign team, Mr Major stood outside 10 Downing Street and said the time for division was over. The day after his victory, he made Mr Heseltine deputy prime minister - ""enter Hezza the enforcer"", said the Daily Express headline - in a reshuffle that was ""the biggest since Margaret Thatcher's purge of the Tory 'wets' in 1981"". His cabinet shake-up led to accusations of ""taking revenge on the right"" - a claim dismissed by his supporters as ""ridiculous"". It was the reshuffle that saw Mr Portillo become defence secretary and William Hague enter the cabinet at the age of 34 as Mr Redwood's successor as Welsh secretary. It was Mr Hague, as Tory leader a few years later in 1998, who brought in the party's current leadership election rules, under which 15% of Conservative MPs have to write to the 1922 Committee chairman. These are the rules under which - if a no-confidence vote goes ahead - Mrs May will either win a famous victory, like Mr Major in 1995, or be ousted, like Mrs Thatcher in 1990 and Mr Duncan Smith in 2003."

Coordinated action took place at sites around the UK and the globally. The largest crowds were on Westminster Bridge, with police keeping watch as protesters - some carrying banners - blocked the normally busy bridge. Sky News reporter Phil Edwards said there were around 1,000 people taking part in the protest next to the Houses of Parliament. Organisers said more than 6,000 people were involved. Extinction Rebellion claims scientific data shows the enormity of climate change has been ignored by governments and that ecological catastrophe, and social collapse, is possible within a generation. One of the protest organisers, Dr Gail Bradbrook, said: ""The UN has given us until 2020 to change the course of humanity. ""If that doesn't happen human extinction in my children's lifetime is a possibility."" ""People need to take their heads out the sand and look at the science and frankly panic and join us. It's extremely frightening."" Dr Bradbrook said blocking the bridges was necessary after other protests, marches and letters to MPs had achieved little. ""Nothing is being done of any real significance,"" she said. ""Our demand is the government must tell the truth about the crisis we're in. And that includes working with communities to build resilience... We want to go to net carbon zero emissions by 2015 and reduce our consumption levels."" Two women who did not want to be named were at the protest dressed as bumble bees. ""I have concern for my children and grandchildren. I truthfully believe we're all heading for extinction,"" one said. ""Climate change is so important, it's coming over so fast and nothing is being done."" 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Other people at the demonstration were there to urge the government to stop the controversial process of ""fracking"" for gas - which recently resumed in the UK. Just before the bridges reopened, police superintendent Waheed Khan said: ""The demonstration is having a direct impact on others across London who wish to go about their daily business - and (stopped) the emergency services from using the bridges to travel around London."" Organisers estimate that dozens of people have been arrested for taking part in action over the last week. Twenty-two people were arrested on Monday, when protesters glued themselves to gates at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy."

At least 10 business organisations have now raised their heads above the parapet and tentatively welcomed the withdrawal agreement. The NI Retail Consortium, NI Food and Drink, Manufacturing NI, Retail NI and the Freight Transport Association were first to say ""yes"". For generations, the DUP has comfortably relied on the support of a significant section of Northern Ireland's farming community. But the Ulster Farmers Union - representing 11,500 family farms - has called on the party to consider supporting the draft deal. They said a ""no-deal"" Brexit would be ""absolutely disastrous"" for the agri-food and farming industry. The CBI, Federation of Small Businesses NI, Institute of Directors NI and NI Chamber of Commerce were next to row behind the withdrawal agreement. In a joint statement, they said: ""While by no means perfect, it provides a platform to move onto the critical next stage and allows work to begin on the formulation of a comprehensive future trade deal."" They added: ""We have been clear that a no-deal Brexit would be deeply damaging and would represent a very bad outcome for businesses, consumers and the economy as a whole."" It was always going to be the consequence of Brexit - the question of a border on the island of Ireland or in the Irish Sea, between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. For the DUP, on whose votes the Tories rely to remain in government, this is about the constitution. It is important to remember that hundreds of police officers and soldiers died defending Northern Ireland's place in the UK. But Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU and for many in this generation, this is about their livelihoods. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you?

The little girl was found by her grandfather tied to a pink Frozen bed which had been converted into a ""cage"" with bedding and sheets over the sides to stop her from seeing outside, a jury heard. A postmortem found she had died due to ""forcible restraint by ligatures in a face-down position complicated by hypothermia"" and there were marks on her wrists and ankles. Following a trial at Liverpool Crown Court, Coyle and Hitchcott, both 20, were jailed for 10 years each on Friday.

""All the positive energy and joy which she had brought into the world was extinguished on March 23 (2017) and it was extinguished by you both,"" the judge said.

He went into the bedroom to check on his granddaughter with Hitchcott, but rang emergency services when he realised she was not breathing. Coyle said when Hitchcott took Ellie-May out of the purple Disney bed, she noticed what appeared to be a black velcro strap around her ankles. She told the court: ""I said to Reece: 'Did you do this? Why would you do it?' And he said: 'I'm sorry.'"" Coyle and Hitchott, who both denied they had tied the youngster to the bed, were also convicted of one count of child cruelty by ""caging"" the child in her bed, and another count of child cruelty by restraining her in the bed.

2018-11-18,"Albanian gangs operating at the ""higher end of sophistication"" are being linked to a surge in the number of trafficking victims brought to the UK. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181118195317/https://news.sky.com/story/sophisticated-albanian-gangs-linked-to-people-trafficking-surge-in-uk-11555887,"Latest statistics from the National Crime Agency (NCA) show a 35% increase in the number of people trafficked into the UK - the majority from Albania. Sky News met 15 victims at a shelter in Vlore, a city in the south of Albania which remains a hot spot for the country's trafficking network. Beaten while pregnant, locked up and raped by multiple men - their stories are horrific. These women and girls are victims of Albanian trafficking gangs and are now receiving help from the charity Vatra. Besjana was in her early twenties when she fell pregnant. She told Sky News how it brought shame on her family and described how she was beaten by her own mother and brother. ""They punched me in the womb so I would lose the baby... it was really bad because I could lose the baby at any moment,"" she said. After fleeing her home she ended up in the hands of one of Albania's trafficking gangs in Italy and was forced to work unpaid as a prostitute in the UK for 18 months. She told Sky News: ""It happened on the same day, as soon as we arrived at the house within an hour he [her trafficker] started to talk roughly...'you are going to do this'... they started locking me inside the house... and they threatened me and my baby if I didn't do what they said or tried to escape."" She did manage to get away - but others end up being sold from gang to gang across Europe and increasingly into the UK. The National Crime Agency (NCA) says the number of potential trafficking victims referred to British authorities rose to 5,145 between 2016 to 2017. Most foreign victims are from Albania, trafficked by a network of criminal gangs which operate across European countries, selling victims as commodities. The deputy director of the NCA, Tom Dowdall, says the groups are particularly resilient to law enforcement. He said: ""Albanian organised criminal gangs are operating at the higher end of sophistication and are certainly operating in the UK as they do within several other countries in western Europe. ""They are what we call 'poly-criminals' as well, so not only are they involved in organised immigration crime and trafficking but also in drug smuggling, firearms trafficking and often violent and serious organised crime."" Another victim was lured away from her home country on the false promise of a relationship. She was sold for sex by Albanian gangs across Europe and is now receiving help in the UK from the Salvation Army. Her traffickers are yet to be caught. She said: ""He [the trafficker] did see me like a human being for the first few months. ""But then I was his possession... after two months, when I was bruised, he waited for the bruises to go, he started bringing other men, friends, I don't know who they were, I was just trapped in that house… most of them were just animals who tried to please themselves."" Around half of the victims trafficked into the UK are being forced to work in the sex industry. The other half face labour exploitation - working under the radar for little or no money, often in places we all visit. Emilie Martin heads up the Salvation Army's anti-trafficking unit. She said: ""It's opening your eyes… if something doesn't feel right. ""For example, when you get your car washed, if your car wash is doing it for £5 but 20 to 30 people are washing cars those individuals aren't getting minimum wage. Then if there are caravans at the back of the car wash, they are living on site and can't leave the area of work. ""When you go to a nail bar, if the person will not engage in eye contact, she can't speak, someone is floating around, it's cash only, clearly something isn't right."" Increasingly young vulnerable Albanians are being targeted by trafficking gangs via social media. Some organised criminal gangs run fake employment agency accounts, posting jobs such as waitressing and hairdressing which do not exist. Both the UK and US governments have published reports this year saying poverty and corruption are fuelling the problem. Albania's deputy interior minister, Rovena Voda, admitted there was a high level of corruption, but insists the government is now vetting police and judges. She said: ""We are under the process of vetting the police so that we will have this pure triangle - police, prosecution and courts - vetting of them all - because sometimes victims of trafficking fear police are corrupt and exchange information with criminals and their life will be at a big risk. ""Victims can trust us. They can trust Albanian institutions. We are here to help them. My door is open for every one of them. We are here to try to assist them in all the kinds of things they will need. Please trust us."" A number of UK charities offer help to victims, including Unseen, which runs the Modern Slavery Helpline. It has seen a spike in calls during the first quarter of 2018 - with 605 potential victims calling in June alone. 70,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Rachel Harper, the helpline's manager, told Sky News callers are often in difficult situations: ""Around 10% of our calls are from victims specifically. ""They might be held in a residence and feel they can't leave or feel trapped and call us from a back room and they don't want anyone else around them to know they are on the phone and they are calling discreetly."" The UK government has committed £150m to tackle modern slavery in source and transit countries, including more than £33m primarily focused on high-risk countries where the majority of victims are trafficked from. :: The Modern Slavery Helpline number is: 08000 121 700."

Police have issued an appeal calling for anyone who saw the theft take place to get in touch. Inspector Gill Lundberg said: ""Stealing from emergency service workers trying to help someone is a despicable act.

The vicar's local 13th century Church of St Michael's in Tidcombe was targeted on the evening of 10 October. A gang, armed with Stanley knives, climbed up scaffolding and hacked off around 20 tonnes of the metal within an hour. While the scaffolding was up for essential maintenance work, the lead was not insured. It is thought it would have fetched £5,000 to £6,000 when sold as scrap for cash, but replacement and repairs will cost £50,000 to £60,000. Rev Heber-Percy said people were ""broken-hearted"", and added: ""I think that's one of those things that perhaps people aren't aware of - these buildings are paid for, maintained and loved by the community, not by the Church of England."" Many scrapyards follow the law and do not buy metal for cash, and insist on ID - but others ignore the rules. ""What we need is the industry to step up and say 'hang on, we know what's going on, we need to be asking the questions, we know what's coming through our gate and if it does come though our gate, we should alert the authorities and not take it',"" said former police officer Robin Edwards. ""There's no requirement under the legislation to actually ask where the material came from so if you go to a scrap dealer with some material they see that as an opportunity to make some money so they won't ask the question - they will take it no questions asked."" Churches are easy targets, often in isolated, rural locations, with few people around and little or no surveillance. Metal thefts from churches have increased by a third in the past two years, with an average of 37 incidents every month in the UK. In Baydon, a few days after the theft in Tidcombe, lead was stolen from the roof of the church of St Nicholas, leaving around £35,000 of damage. Parishioners are already trying to raise half a million pounds for repairs, to preserve the 12th century building. ""We've had water coming through beams at the top,"" said church warden Tina Evans. ""It's pouring on to tarpaulin, on to the floor, the whole floor was covered with 10 buckets and mops and things. ""We're devastated, we work hard, everyone puts heart and soul into collecting money... we have reported it, we've had a crime number but no visit from police, no questions. It's a shame - we're in a rural village, I know they're stretched but we'd feel at least they care."" 68,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Wiltshire Police said All Saints Church in All Cannings and St John's Church in Pewsey also had lead stolen from roofs last month. Detective Constable Cerys Powell said: ""We are keeping an open mind as to whether all these incidents are linked and our enquiries are ongoing. We are looking into any potential CCTV footage from each area and would ask anyone with information to get in touch via 101."""
2018-11-18,"Police chiefs have warned illegal raves are a ""growing problem"" after forces revealed they are tackling hundreds across Britain each year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181118195317/https://news.sky.com/story/police-warn-of-growing-illegal-rave-problem-as-numbers-soar-11496151,"More than 680 reports of unlicensed music events were recorded last year - up 9% on the previous 12 months - amid a rise in nightclubs shutting down, a Sky News investigation has found. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said illegal raves were ""inherently unsafe"" and officers had to consider the safety of residents when deciding whether to shut events down. It comes after police faced criticism for failing to stop a massive illegal rave in the Welsh village of Brechfa, which reportedly attracted more than 1,000 people in May. Caroline Evans, who lived near the illegal rave site, said police failed to act quickly enough to stop the event growing. She told Sky News: ""There was a lot of mess - human faeces, drug bags, cans and bottles all over the floor. By the time the police arrived, it was already well-established. ""The rave was reported to police in the early hours but officers didn't get to the main junction where people were parking their cars until the next afternoon."" Sky News asked each of the UK's 45 territorial police forces for the number of illegal raves reported in the last three years. Just 14 forces in England and Wales provided annual figures, meaning the actual number of illegal raves is likely to be much higher. Overall, the number of reports of illegal raves rose to 682 in 2017, compared with 628 in 2016. In London, the Metropolitan Police said there were 133 unlicensed music events in 2017 - nearly double the 70 recorded the previous year. In one case this year, Jordan Gharib, 26, was jailed for 21 months for violent disorder after several police officers were injured at an illegal rave in Barking, east London, in June. Devon and Cornwall, South Yorkshire, Gwent, Cambridgeshire, West Midlands and Northamptonshire were among the other forces to record illegal raves in their areas. Separately, Merseyside Police said it recorded 108 crime incidents related to raves, including complaints about noise and anti-social behaviour, between 2015 and April 2018. Chief constable Ben-Julian Harrington, the NPCC's lead for sporting and planned events, told Sky News: ""It is clear that unlicensed music events are a growing problem and they pose a real challenge to communities and police forces. Officials feared the rise in dance music culture - but were more worried about noise nuisance than the use of illegal drugs ""Unlike licensed events, unlicensed music events are inherently unsafe. They lack safety provisions such as stewarding, security, fire regulation and medical support while regularly attracting a large number of people who cause damage and disturbance. ""Forces must balance the nuisance or damage caused with the overall safety of the local community, those attending and the police officers or other agencies who may need to respond."" DJ and student Stephane Massa, who regularly attends unlicensed music events in London, said he ""hates being made to feel like a criminal"". ""People may think that because there is no police or security that it goes wild but it really isn't like that,"" he told Sky News. ""I think people are actually quite discreet and respectful. Most people genuinely don't have any intention to harm anyone or their surroundings. ""Obviously there are some people who push the boundaries - but that is the same in every nightclub in the country. ""A lot of the time the only problem is people not picking up litter after themselves."" The increase in illegal raves comes as the number of nightclubs in London fell by 8% between 2014 and 2017, according to figures from data firm CGA. Meanwhile, the number of nightclubs across the rest of Britain - outside of the capital - dropped 6% from 2012 to 2017, CGA said. More than 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, which represents clubs and restaurants, said ""excessive and intrusive"" licensing controls had put ""huge pressures on businesses"". She said: ""If nightclubs are being squeezed and forced to close or increase their prices, then customers will naturally gravitate towards the alternatives that come in the form of illegal raves. ""The reasons behind an increase in the number of illegal raves may be complex, but this worrying trend is only going to be made worse if more nightclubs become unprofitable or inaccessible."" Stephane Massa tells Sky News why he believes people have the wrong idea about unlicensed music events Jeremy Abbott, digital editor at dance music magazine Mixmag, said the increasing popularity of illegal raves was a ""worrying trend"". He said: ""Clubs are more expensive than ever, the same goes for drinks prices in clubs. On the flip-side, it's worryingly easy to get your hands on drugs in London alone and the strength of ecstasy has sky-rocketed. ""It's an easy alternative to clubbing in the city and with many venues being shutdown it's a popular alternative. ""It's a worrying trend as of course these parties can't be properly policed or regulated so crime and risk of drug-related illness is higher."""

But in a statement on Friday night, the company's board said that, despite ""considerable interest"", none of the offers had delivered ""sufficient value"". They added: ""As a result, the board has concluded that there is no value in the ordinary shares of the company. ""The board has resolved that the best remaining option is for the company and its principal subsidiaries to be placed into administration."" In an email to staff, Johnston chief executive David King said that, subject to court approval, the company's business and assets would then be sold to a newly-incorporated group of companies controlled by investors who own Johnston's debt. He said that the new business would have ""much lower debts"" and the new owners ""intend to provide new money to carry us forward"". It was hoped the transfer would be completed within 24 hours, he said. Meanwhile, he said, the company's operations would ""continue uninterrupted"" and employees should ""turn up for work as normal"". The newspapers and websites would continue to be published and suppliers would be contacted in order to re-establish trading relationships, he added. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The company reportedly has a £40m pension deficit and Mr King said the pension scheme would not be transferred and the Pension Protection Fund would be notified. Shadow culture secretary and deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, said the news marked a ""grim day for local newspapers and another deeply worrying one for local democracy"". Alex Sobel, MP for Leeds North West, also raised concerns about the situation faced by Johnston, which owns The Yorkshire Post and the Yorkshire Evening Post, saying: ""Local papers raising local and regional issues are vital for our democracy."" The i had been a rare success story in Britain's flagging national newspaper market, which has been wrestling with an accelerating shift of readers on to digital platforms. The title launched in 2012 as a sister newspaper to The Independent's print edition, and was bought by Johnston Press for £24m four years later. Nevertheless, its circulation in August of just over 244,000‎ copies was 10% lower than the previous year. With 2,000 employees and more than 200 titles, Johnston Press remains one of the biggest employers of journalists in the UK but the growth of digital platforms such as Facebook and Google, and the rise of 'citizen journalism', have cost it dearly."
2018-11-18,"A kennel that housed more than 70 greyhounds has been found in a ""horrendous"" state.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181118195317/https://news.sky.com/story/claw-marks-and-faeces-inside-kennel-housing-70-greyhounds-11555707,"Celia Cross Greyhound Trust, a rescue charity for greyhounds, bought Hillside Kennels in Guildford, Surrey, on 31 October. When staff entered the site, they found faeces and claw marks on the walls, as well as reporting an ""overpowering"" smell. A video posted live on to Facebook and images taken at the kennels by the Trust show strips of fly paper clogged up with dead flies, broken doors covered in dirt, dust and cobwebs, piles of dirt on the floor, and worn down walls with deep scratches and stains. Entire chunks of the wall appear to have been scratched away and patches of plaster have been rubbed away. Recently used bedding can be seen on the floor as well as dog faeces. The Trust already owns kennels adjacent to Hillside Kennels. When Jane Thompson, Celia Cross Greyhound Trust kennel manager and trustee, inspected the vacant premises, she said: ""I wasn't expecting the kennels to be in great condition... we could smell them from our own property. ""The stench was overpowering and the foul kennels were in a dangerous state of disrepair. This neglect must have been going on for some time."" Nick Weston, head of campaigns for the charity League Against Cruel Sports, visited the kennels on 2 November and told Sky News: ""There are no words for it other than horrendous. ""The smell alone was appalling. I walked into one of the rooms and the smell just hit me like a wall. It smelled of everything: urine, faeces, damp. It was a hellish mixture of smells."" The kennels had been rented by greyhound trainer Tony Taylor, who says he kept 72 dogs at the site. A number of the dogs were still active racing dogs. Last year, Mr Taylor was given a year's notice to move on and told Sky News he removed the last of his dogs from Hillside kennels on 28 October this year. Mr Taylor says he has only seen some of the photos taken by the Trust and believes ""quite a few of the pictures are from a block we shut down about three-and-a-half years ago because you couldn't put a dog in there really"". Sky News sent Mr Taylor all of the video and photos to look at and verify, but he did not reply. The trainer says he allowed someone else's dogs to be kept in the block and a person was left to clean the kennels. In response to claims of smells of urine, faeces and damp, Mr Taylor said: ""Normally we kept it fairly clean to be honest with you, but when I left I did leave about nine or 10 dogs to be rehomed."" Mr Taylor says when he left he did not see any faeces, adding: ""I could smell a little bit of pee but it didn't smell very strong to me."" Asked what state he would say all the kennels were in when he left: ""To be honest with you they did need work."" Mr Taylor was given a grant of up to £40,000 from the industry regulator the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) but opted to spend the money on his other kennels in Catford, as he knew he would be vacating the Guildford kennels. He told Sky News: ""It was just impossible to have enough money to do both. The dogs were looked after, they were cared for, they had nice beds. It did need a lick of paint and a few wooden struts need replacing and things like that but I just didn't have the money to do it. ""It was safe as far as I was concerned... [if a kennel] looked horrible and it didn't look safe for a dog, I didn't use it."" He added: ""The welfare of my dogs comes paramount to me or I wouldn't be doing this. I've been doing this all my life. I love the dogs."" The GBGB said it inspected the kennels and gave guidance on how to improve conditions. It said it monitored the site closely while the kennels were still in use. Mr Taylor has not faced any disciplinary action from the GBGB. Mark Bird, managing director of GBGB, told Sky News: ""As the regulator for licensed greyhound racing, we demand the highest standards of welfare from everyone involved in our sport. ""We have very strict guidelines on how dogs should be treated and what conditions they should be housed in. ""We conduct a minimum of two unannounced visits to residential kennels each year and are prepared to take the strongest action when we find that conditions are not up to standard. ""This includes suspending trainers with immediate effect."" 68,000 people have signed our petition - have you? The GBGB said it is introducing a number of measures to maintain kennel standards, including developing a new code of practice."

Around one in eight people living with HIV are unaware they have the virus, while 43% of those diagnosed last year were already at a late stage, meaning damage to the immune system had begun. Late diagnosis is associated with a tenfold increase in the risk of short-term mortality.

The prince has advocated for more widespread use of HIV testing for years and was even tested live on Facebook two years ago. The move saw a fivefold increase in the number of orders for HIV tests from sexual health and HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust. Prince Harry said: ""We won't bring an end to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus until testing is seen as completely normal and accessible for everyone. ""Two years ago, I took a test and the whole process was actually really easy; the result came back within just a few minutes. ""This is such a pivotal time in the fight against HIV.

Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the charity was ""thrilled"" to have Harry's support. He added: ""As His Royal Highness says, we protect ourselves from cold and flu at this time of year - so let's protect ourselves against HIV by getting tested and knowing our status. ""It's an ambitious aim, but we have a real opportunity to get to zero new HIV infections in the UK."" Public Health England chief executive Duncan Selbie said: ""HIV testing and treatment is free and available to all. ""You can take a test in your own home or at sexual health services, GPs, healthcare and community settings nationwide. ""In many cases the test involves a simple finger prick and results are ready within minutes."""

He added that St Albans was ""prepared to monitor the Russians as they entered the Channel, taking over the watch from the French warships"". Commander John Cromie, the commanding officer of HMS St Albans, said: ""In this instance the interaction between St Albans and Marshal Ustinov has proven both cordial and professional, reflecting the mutual understanding of customs that exist between professional mariners.

The commanding officer of the Royal Navy's aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has spoken of the ""eye-watering"" level of Russian naval activity in the Atlantic region in recent years. Before setting sail from Portsmouth in August, Captain Jerry Kyd said: ""The increase in Russian activity we have seen in the last couple of years is frightening and for national security reasons it just underlines why we need to maintain a balanced, strong and able, capable fleet."" St Albans monitored the new Russian warship Admiral Gorshkov last Christmas. At the beginning of the year, frigate HMS Westminster was dispatched to keep track of two Russian frigates and their support vessels returning to the Baltic after operations in the Middle East. On 7 August, Type 45 destroyer HMS Diamond sailed from Dover, Kent, to monitor the Russian destroyer Severomorsk and the Marshal Ustinov. The RAF is also involved in monitoring Russian activity.

Speaking at the first news conference since its discovery by the specialist American survey ship Ocean Infinity, naval captain Enrique Balbi said the working theory was that the vessel had imploded close to the seabed. It was located at a depth of around 907m (2,975ft) in the waters off the Valdes Peninsula and was surrounded by a field of rubble, with underwater turbulence making visibility difficult. Military ships will be deployed to the scene - hundreds of miles from its last reported position - to obtain high-res images and information from the submarine, which had 44 crew members on-board at the time it disappeared. Teams will dive down to whatever is left of the San Juan during an operation that is expected to last about seven hours, but defence minister Oscar Aguad has warned that the country ""does not have the means to recover the wreckage"". The vessel is thought to be scattered in pieces on the ocean floor. News of its discovery was met with both relief and sadness, with relatives of the crew react having gathered outside the naval base in Mar del Plata where the submarine was based to mark one year since it disappeared. Some spoke of the hope they felt that their loved ones would still be found alive. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? President Mauricio Macri has promised a full investigation into what happened to the submarine, which lost contact with the navy as it passed the San Jorge Gulf about 500 miles (800km) northwest of the Falkland Islands. It had set-off from the town of Ushuaia on the Tierra del Fuego archipelago - the southernmost tip of South America. When contact with the vessel was lost, it was said to have had seven days worth of air - but had been taking on water through its snorkel. The German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine dated back to the mid-1980s and had been most recently refurbished in 2014, when it was cut in half as its engines and batteries were replaced. Experts said even the smallest mistake during the cutting process can lead to accidents later."

With the end in sight, he decided to take a power nap, missed his alarms and overslept and crashed into the Caribbean archipelago of Guadeloupe. Mr Thomson, 44, woke at around 1.45am on Friday to find he had run aground on rocky cliffs on the northernmost tip of Grande Terre island and used his boat's motor to pull clear. The captain saved his IMOCA class monohull, named Hugo Boss, from being wrecked, and crossed the finish-line first, but was handed a 24-hour penalty by the race jury for using the engine. The sanction means Thomson almost certainly will not win the race and could even drop out of top three. The Gosport-born sailor, who appeared remarkably composed despite his misfortune, told reporters in Guadeloupe the punishment was fair, because ""I don't think I should win the race after hitting Guadeloupe"". His remark was greeted with spontaneous applause from his audience. Mr Thomson had been sleeping in 20 to 40 minute bursts every two to four hours during the race, and had an alarm clock wired to a loud horn to wake him up. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? In case he was still asleep five minutes later, a shockwave watch was designed to deliver a mild electric shock. Unfortunately, he slept right through the horn on Thursday, and the watch failed to work because it was not fully charged. Mr Thomson said it was ""very frustrating, but it could have been worse. I have my boat and as you can see I'm all in one piece. ""I'm going to keep a brave face, keep smiling, come back and do it all again. Ultimately we're here to try and win theVendee Globe in 2020 and there's some great stuff we've learned that we can take forward."" The likely winner is Paul Meilhat on SMA and Thomson said: ""I hope Paul will win...and I look forward to welcoming him tomorrow. He should be the winner""."

2018-11-18,"Theresa May will come out fighting in a Sky News interview, hitting back at Tory MPs bidding to remove her and cabinet ministers demanding a better Brexit deal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181118195317/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-to-hit-back-at-brexit-plan-critics-on-sophy-ridge-on-sunday-11557066,"Under more scrutiny and pressure than ever before, the prime minister will be appearing on Sophy Ridge On Sunday at the start of a week, which if it goes wrong for her, could see her lose her job. Mrs May is under attack on three fronts: In what will be seen as a challenge to the PM's authority, Mrs Leadsom told Sky News: ""There is still more to be done and we do still have more time before the EU Council at the end of the month. ""So I'm absolutely committed to getting the Brexit that 17.4 million people voted for."" But writing in the Sun on Sunday ahead of appearing on Sky News, Mrs May bluntly slapped down her cabinet colleague and insisted there is no more that can be done to get a better deal. ""There is no alternative plan on the table,"" she wrote. ""There is no different approach that we could agree with the EU. ""The course I have set is the right one for our country and the only one that will work. ""The path before us is not easy, but with determination and hard work, I know we can deliver a deal in the national interest."" All the draft Brexit agreement details, including what will happen to Northern Ireland and whether UK citizens can remain in the EU Mr Raab, interviewed in The Sunday Times, claimed: ""If we cannot close this deal on reasonable terms we need to be very honest with the country that we will not be bribed and blackmailed or bullied and we will walk away. ""I think there is one thing that is missing and that is political will and resolve. I am not sure that message has ever landed."" Only one person, the 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, knows just how many Tory MPs have written to him demanding a vote. But more MPs are going public about calling for Mrs May to go because of her Brexit policy, with Zac Goldsmith becoming the latest to announce he has written to Sir Graham. Mr Goldsmith is among at least 23 MPs who say they have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, he said that under the PM's plan ""in effect, Britain would remain in the EU, but without having any say"". He added: ""Had that been the choice, I personally would have voted to Remain. ""The withdrawal agreement we have been presented with is unacceptable to Leave and Remain voters alike. ""It has close to zero chance of making it through parliament and with only five months remaining, we cannot afford to waste any more time on it."" Earlier, Tory MP Simon Clarke told Sky News: ""I think that a new leader is required to bring about that change of policy. I think there is still time for one final attempt to bring about a better deal. ""If that isn't the case we need to be preparing with the intensity and the urgency for no-deal, which frankly the government has not shown during the course of the last year, which it should have shown. ""I know when I see a policy which has become so inextricable form the person that the two can no longer be divorced and we're deluding ourselves frankly if we think otherwise - it's time for a new approach."" And as Labour steps up campaigning in marginal seats like Mansfield, Jeremy Corbyn - who will also be interviewed on Sophy Ridge On Sunday - and his closest allies are on the attack too. ""We're saying to the government: 'Get real, you've got to get real',"" the shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News. 68,000 people have signed our petition - have you? ""Theresa May needs to wake up to the fact that her deal will not go through parliament. We know that now. At the same time, no-deal is not an option, because parliament won't support it. So we've got to have proper negotiations. If she can't do it, we can do it."" There is good news for Mrs May, however, in a ComRes poll for the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror suggesting 47% of voters think she should remain as prime minister until after Brexit, while 31% think she should resign and 53% don't want a second referendum. But the same survey - and another poll by Opinium in The Observer - also suggest support for the Conservatives has fallen and they are trailing Labour after the turmoil of the past few days. :: Watch the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn on Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday at 9am."
2018-11-20,"British involvement in the successful search for a missing Argentine submarine has been described as ""invaluable"", Sky News can reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181120004055/https://news.sky.com/story/royal-navy-help-in-hunt-for-missing-argentinian-submarine-invaluable-11558234,"Forty-four sailors were in the ARA San Juan when it disappeared in the South Atlantic on 15 November 2017, prompting an international search. Several nations, including the UK, spent two months helping Argentina look for the vessel before the search was called off. But now it has emerged that the Royal Navy provided data and analysis that allowed the marine survey firm Ocean Infinity to pinpoint the area where the submarine would be. It was found last Friday, 800 metres down, several hundred miles from its last reported position. The British co-operation to find an Argentinian navy ship comes after years of frosty relations following the 1982 war between the two countries over the Falkland Islands. Ocean Infinity chief executive Oliver Plunkett told Sky News how difficult it was to find the sub, even with the help from the UK military. He said: ""When we start... we have to understand where is the right place to look. ""The Royal Navy, through the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, were incredibly helpful in facilitating us obtaining information, providing their insights from the search work they had done. ""We got help with understanding how submarines work, how they are likely to behave, they really gave an incredible amount of time and insight to help us structure our search. ""It was extremely valuable. If you imagine, we were looking for an object approximately 60 metres long, lying on the ocean floor, that had suffered a catastrophic event. ""So, to be able to find it needed a huge amount of input and support. Their help was truly invaluable."" He said the Navy told them to zero in on an area of about 3,000 sq km, which they then surveyed using underwater remotely-operated vehicles which map the sea bed using sonar. It gave them 24 'targets' to look at in more detail - features on the ocean floor that could be a submarine, or could turn out to be rocks or other geological features. The survey ship, Seabed Constructor, was just hours from giving up and going home when the 24th feature turned out to be the sub they were looking for. Mr Plunkett, who is from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: ""I was quietly at home. ""We have a protocol of communication. The first message goes to the Argentine naval admiral, who told the commander of the navy, who told the minister of defence, who told the president. While that was going on, I got the second phone call. ""It was a complete mix of emotions, from excitement to relief to thinking about what to do next. ""Because the careful management of that information - ultimately so that families of the crew members get to find out directly rather than seeing it on Twitter - is the single most important thing, to make sure they are treated in the most appropriate way."" He said the finding of the sub is up there with the rediscovery of the Titanic, as a technical achievement, because of its size and position. British involvement in the hunt for the San Juan is a small positive to come from the tragedy  ""Not to devalue the finding of the Titanic, but the Titanic was nearly 300 metres long - five times the size of the submarine and sitting almost proud on the sea bed,"" he said. ""If I compare that to finding something that is one fifth the size, that looks like rocks surrounded by rocks, I think this is a tremendous achievement. And while people have found things on the sea bed before, the depth of this adds to that challenge."" The firm, which is Anglo-American with mostly British senior management and shareholders, is going on to hunt for a ship, not far from where it found the San Juan, called the Stellar Daisy, which went down in 2017 carrying iron ore while on a voyage from Brazil to China with the loss of 24 lives. 70,000 have signed our petition - have you? But Mr Plunkett says he also hasn't given up hope that one of the firm's other previous missions will one day be completed - Ocean Infinity was involved in the unsuccessful hunt for missing passenger jet MH370. ""We covered an area of 120,000 sq km, five times the area we have covered in this latest search, and that followed on the back of (another) search that covered 120,000 sq km,"" he said. ""It must be in that area of the southern Indian Ocean somewhere,"" he added. If people keep looking for it, ""logically,"" he said, they will one day find it."

Some 50% of men think being a man is more difficult than it was for their ancestors, with 24% saying it is the same and 26% less difficult. Women are split - 39% think it is more difficult, 39% less difficult, with 22% saying it is just as difficult as for previous generations. Both genders think issues facing men are given less priority than issues facing women - 72% of men say women's issues are given priority, and 57% of women agree. But men and women alike are unconvinced by the need for an International Men's Day - two thirds of both men (63%) and women (67%) think it is unnecessary. The results come after women across the globe shared their personal stories of sexual harassment as part of the viral #MeToo movement - a hashtag that went viral on social media in October 2017. It demonstrated the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace, and followed soon after the sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Last month, US President Donald Trump said it was ""a very scary time for young men in America"" in the wake of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh being accused of sexual assault and other misconduct. Mr Kavanaugh denied the allegations made against him and was sworn in as the 114th Justice of the Supreme Court following a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and an FBI investigation. The year of 2018 also marks 100 years since British women won the right to vote - with women's marches across the UK gaining much media attention. 70,000 have signed our petition - have you?"

They will be released before MPs vote on whether to accept or reject a final deal on the divorce terms. Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, made the concession in a bid to avoid defeat in parliament on the finance bill. The law contains changes to taxes and duties announced in the budget. A Sky source said there was ""comfortably"" enough MPs to defeat the government if it did not adopt the amendment and suspected soft Brexiteers in the Treasury were ""sympathetic"" to it. Mr Jenrick promised the ""baseline"" for the comparison would be the UK's current relationship with the EU. He told the Commons on Monday: ""The analysis will consider a modelled 'no deal' scenario - or WTO terms - a modelled analysis of a free trade agreement scenario and a modelled analysis of the government's proposed deal. ""And in each case these will be compared against the status quo of the current institutional arrangements within the EU.""

A party source told Sky News that Prime Minister Theresa May was ""acting cavalierly"" and warned her not to expect ""business as usual""."
2018-11-20,Britain's biggest gambling groups will hold talks on Tuesday about an unprecedented series of voluntary curbs on their advertising amid mounting political pressure for a crackdown on their industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181120004055/https://news.sky.com/story/gambling-giants-slash-odds-on-tv-advertising-crackdown-11558305,"Sky News has learnt that the board of the Remote Gambling Association (RGA), which counts Bet365, Betfred, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and William Hill among its members, will meet to discuss the advertising code to which they are supposed to adhere. Reviewed on an annual basis, Tuesday's agenda is understood to contain the most rigorous set of measures to restrict television ads ever considered by the gaming industry. The proposals to be discussed include a complete ban on pre-watershed advertising by gambling companies; restricting the number of gaming ads to one per commercial break; and banning the 'in-play' ads during live broadcast of football and other matches. Sources said that the RGA board meeting was unlikely to deliver a consensus among the body's roughly 35 members, and would require further consultation before recommendations are made to the group that polices the industry's voluntary advertising code. Nevertheless, the talks underline the acute awareness within the multi-billion pound gambling industry that meaningful action needs to be taken in an attempt to see off the threat of potentially more draconian legislation. Last week, the Government caved in to demands for swifter reforms to Fixed Odds Betting Terminals after ministers had indicated that a clampdown would not come into eff‎ect until next October. That decision triggered Tracey Crouch's resignation as the sports minister, a move applauded by MPs on all sides of the Commons, and ignited a fresh row about the policy. The issue of advertising restrictions has been the subject of fierce debate for many years, but has intensified as the volume of commercials aired by bookmakers has proliferated as they have sought to capture share of the faster-growing digital gambling market. Some gaming companies have publicly declared‎ their support for new curbs, with GVC, the owner of Ladbrokes, saying last month that it supported a move to ban gambling ads around live football prior to the 9pm TV watershed. However, the company declined to move unilaterally, with people close to it insisting that it was right not to ‎do so on the grounds that it risked being put at a competitive disadvantage. Sky, the parent company of Sky News, has also sought to take a leadership position on the issue of problem gambling, announcing recently that from next summer, it will allow a maximum of one gambling ad per commercial break. The company also said it would develop its AdSmart technology to allow customers to block gambling ads when viewing on Sky and Virgin Media TV platforms from June 2020. The RGA declined to comment on the agenda for Tuesday's board meeting."

The government also conceded to Labour MP Chuka Umunna's bid to force it to publish analysis comparing the ""costs and benefits"" of current EU terms with its own plan, and a no-deal divorce. Earlier this evening, senior Leave campaigning MPs headed to Downing Street for an hour-long meeting with Mrs May, to lobby her to change the draft deal before it is finalised. Sky News' deputy political editor Beth Rigby said the fact the group did not stop on their way out of Downing Street to speak to waiting media is being taken in some quarters as a sign the meeting may have been constructive. She added: ""There is a bit of a division now between one ERG Brexiteer group... and another group in the ERG that doesn't think it's the right time - and I'm told they would like to wait a bit to watch the prime minister's withdrawal agreement bill fail in the House of Commons - and then trigger the vote of confidence. ""So some splits in the ERG as to when to put those letters in... it perhaps explains why we haven't got the full number (of 48) quite yet."" Ahead of a summit on Sunday where EU leaders are set to sign off on the withdrawal agreement, both London and Brussels have been at pains to point out that it cannot be renegotiated. Mrs May said the draft plan had been ""agreed in full"" by both sides."

2018-11-20,What a difference a year makes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181120004055/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-applauded-for-looking-beyond-brexit-in-cbi-speech-11558061,"At the 2017 CBI conference, 12 months ago, Theresa May received a chilly reception from a sullen business audience irritated by what was widely perceived as her anti-business stance. Her comments about citizens of the world being citizens of nowhere went down especially badly with the globe-trotting battalions of big business. :: Determined May fights back with speech to business leaders Today's speech was in stark contrast. The PM received a warm reception and was applauded both after her speech but also during the question and answer session. The message from the room was clear - the Brexit deal she and her government has negotiated has gone down well with employers and now they just want to get on with it. The one speaker during the question and answer session to criticise her Brexit deal, on the grounds that it would tie the economic fate of the UK to an EU that does not want the UK to be a successful competitor post-Brexit, attracted a low rumble of criticism for his trouble. 60,000 people have signed our petition - have you? It has been common to hear from business people today how much they respect Mrs May's resilience in the face of opposition from her own backbenchers and from some cabinet colleagues; how she is admired, even, for sticking doggedly and tenaciously to the task in hand and for not allowing herself to be blown off-course. ""Do you think she'll get the deal through parliament?"" has been the most frequently-discussed subject on the conference fringes, answered invariably by the rejoinder: ""Let's hope so"". There were not too many people in this audience who believe ""no-deal"" is better than a bad deal. While Brexit is inevitably the main focus for concern, with the audience firmly on her side, Mrs May felt confident enough to hint at the wider challenges facing the economy, such as widening the skills base, fostering more start-ups, maximising the benefits to the UK of the so-called 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' and exploiting the UK's lead in areas such as fintech. While she still faces an almighty challenge in getting her Brexit deal through - a challenge in which business is very clearly on her side - it was just possible, today, to detect how Mrs May is starting to think about a world beyond Brexit."

Cambridgeshire Police took two Staffordshire Bull Terriers from the property in Wykes Road, and two people have been arrested on suspicion of child neglect. A 28-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man have been bailed until 15 December. Police say the dogs were taken to police kennels."

South Western Railway (SWR) told passengers not to travel as none of its trains were running between London Waterloo - the UK's busiest railway station - and Surbiton in the southwest of the capital. Separate problems with engineering works saw Southern and Thameslink services also disrupted. SWR warned passengers to expect delays and further cancellations until the end of the day due to the earlier disruption. The operator has already been hit with a spate of issues involving signal and points failures and a long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains, which has seen strikes add to the disruption. At 10.45am, 269 SWR trains - 75% of all its services - were cancelled or more than 30 minutes late, according to data from the rail information website trains.im. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union called for Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to resign over the ""Monday mayhem"" and the ongoing railway ""crisis"". The RMT union's general secretary, Mick Cash, said: ""The chaos into Waterloo this morning is just another example of the fragmentation and division on Britain's privatised railways where maintenance schedules and budgets are hacked to the bare bones while private operators like SWR are left with a free hand to rob the network blind in the name of profit. ""What we need is reintegration and a coherent system with all elements of the rail operation working together in one publicly-owned framework, with investment rather than exploitation as the watchword. ""While the crisis on our railways deepens, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is markedly absent while he ponders his self-interest and a possible resignation from the May government. He should go, and he should go now."" Passengers watchdog Transport Focus called for a review into the problems uncovered by Network Rail's work. Its chief executive Anthony Smith said: ""While engineering and improvement works need to be done, such late notice of the fundamental problems on the approaches to Waterloo this morning is unacceptable. 70,000 have signed our petition - have you? ""A quick, thorough review of the problems uncovered in the engineering works and the passenger information put out should be carried out and published so that lessons can be learned. In the meantime, passengers should claim for compensation and make sure their voice is heard."" Mr Grayling's department said it ""shared the frustrations of passengers"" trying to get into London. ""The disruption is unacceptable, and we are seeking an urgent explanation from Network Rail as to why their engineering works at Surbiton have overrun,"" said a Department for Transport spokesman. ""In the meantime, we would urge passengers to check with their operator before attempting to travel."""

By Monday morning more than 2,000 people had taken refuge in shelters, officials said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Images showed glowing fast-flowing lava spewing out of Fuego's crater. There were also clouds of hot ash and gas, with further dangerous flows expected, said Juan Pablo Oliva, head of Guatemala's seismological, volcanic and meteorological institute Insivumeh. Fuego, which is about 19 miles (30km) south of Guatemala City, is one of Central America's most active volcanoes. In June, its explosive flows killed 194 people and left at least 234 missing, although organisations supporting nearby communities insist there are thousands missing. In October more ash and lava started spewing, prompting warnings for those living nearby. The current eruption from the 3,763m (12,346 ft) volcano is the fifth so far this year. 70,000 have signed our petition - have you?"

Visitors will be able to ride in glass pods rotating on the outside of the building for a 360-degree view of the capital. There will also be viewing galleries featuring sky bridges and internal glass slides. The project has been proposed by architects Foster and Partners and expects to attract one million visitors a year. Sir Norman Foster said the structure, shaped like a bud on top of a 787ft stalk, is ""in the spirit of London as a progressive, forward-thinking city"". ""It offers significant benefits to Londoners and visitors as a cultural and social landmark with unmatched educational resources for future generations,"" he added. The tower, which would be located next to the Gherkin, will include an education facility offering 20,000 free places a year for pupils in London state schools to teach national curriculum topics. Despite its peak being a few feet lower than the Shard, designs suggest the Tulip will have a higher viewing platform than the UK's tallest building. If it gets the green light from the City of London Corporation, the Tulip would be built by Bury Street Properties - part of the Brazilian banking billionaire Joseph Safra's empire which purchased the Gherkin in 2014 for more than £700m. His son Jacob J Safra said the proposed skyscraper's ""elegance and soft strength complements the iconic Gherkin"". ""We are confident in London's role as a global city and are proud to offer its schoolchildren a state-of-the-art classroom in the sky to appreciate London's history and dynamism,"" he said.

He slammed ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson for his ""stupid haircut"" and branded UKIP's Nigel Farage ""another p***k in a suit"". ""Theresa May, bless her, just got that job by default,"" Dyer told The Big Issue magazine. ""Boris Johnson running around with his stupid haircut spouting b******s. ""Young people look and think: 'If these are the people running the country, why shouldn't I go and loot and riot?'"" He continued: ""They just don't give a f***. This us against them-type vibe has got worse. ""We are living in an age of food banks. How the f*** did that happen? Seriously."" Dyer turned his fire on Mr Cameron over his decision to call the 2016 EU referendum. The UK voted to leave by 51.9% to 48.1%. ""[Politicians] are floundering around. They have been given this thing called f****** Brexit because of one man. ""One man.

His intervention comes amid a crucial week for Mrs May, who faces the threat of a confidence vote if enough MPs call for her to go. The prime minister told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday she had not been told the 48-letter trigger point had been reached. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee and only man who knows how many letters have been submitted, told Sky News he would announce ""expediently"" if and when the threshold is met."

""Out of any given venue at any time there will be hundreds of thousands of extra pairs of eyes and ears who are really useful to us,"" Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth told Sky News. The national coordinator for the police's protect and prepare strategy is also reassuring people they should still get out and about. ""We want people to feel empowered about what they report to us, we don't want them to be worried, we want them to look at things,"" Mr Aldworth said. ""If they feel uncomfortable about it, however insignificant please do come and talk to us and we'll worry about what it is. ""We'll take the worry out of Christmas for you on this respect - and we'll deal with those matters."" 70,000 have signed our petition - have you? The message comes as the Counter Terrorism Policing Network is launching its largest ever winter advertising campaign, reminding the public of how they can help tackle the terrorist threat. The security messaging will be on display at key shopping locations and Christmas events. When Sky News spoke to shoppers at Kingston-upon-Thames Christmas market, they found many who said they would not know what to do in the event of an attack. ""I haven't been trained in any emergency response thing, so I wouldn't really know,"" said stallholder Tessa. Others agreed that they would welcome more advice. ""People need to be a lot more aware of how to deal with a situation,"" said one customer. ""Because most people would probably think just run but you don't know where you're meant to run to and who you're meant to tell."" That's why police want retailers and businesses in crowded areas to draw up a ""60 Second Security Plan"" - a checklist of questions for staff, such as where people can hide, how the store can be locked down, and where the exits are. David Ward is regional chair of Cross Sector Safety and Security Communications, which works to disseminate news and security messages to businesses. ""From the larger organisations, [it might mean] carrying out desktop exercises and actually carrying out a mock attack to understand how to react,"" he said. ""For smaller businesses, being aware how they can escape from their premises, how they can look after each other, how they can shut their shop down or their office down very quickly. ""Things we wouldn't have thought about 20 years ago but unfortunately we now have to be far more aware of."" Officers say retailers being prepared could help prevent unnecessary concern - and help customers know what to do. Mr Aldworth said: ""Last year on Oxford Street we saw a fight at a Tube station cause panic when people believed that a terrorist attack had occurred."" Officers eventually found no evidence of any shots fired. ""In the rush to keep themselves safe, some people suffered serious injuries and businesses were severely disrupted. By working alongside those businesses, we have learnt from that experience and I believe our 60 second check will better prepare us to deal with something similar in the future,"" Mr Aldworth said. Police say if something does happen, getting away is the key priority. Mr Aldworth added: ""Some people stop to take photographs, videos and upload it onto social media videos and such like. ""We don't advocate that you do that. We want you to get away from potential danger. ""If we don't know what it is then you probably don't either. Get away from it, run, hide and tell. The quicker we know about it the quicker we can get there and deal with it."" Police and MI5 are running more than 700 live terrorism investigations as they confront a threat that is seen as unprecedented in scale, with Britain hit by five attacks last year and another 17 having been foiled since March 2017.

His associate, Connor Allsopp, 21, was sentenced to eight months in jail for his lesser role in the hack. In court, Judge Anuja Dhir QC said it was a tragedy to find ""two individuals of such extraordinary talent"" in the dock. She told the pair: ""You were both involved in a significant, sophisticated systematic hack attack in a computer system used by TalkTalk. ""The prosecution accept that neither of you exposed the vulnerability in their systems, others started it, but you at different times joined in."" The court had heard that the 2015 hack had cost the company £77m, although this figure was reached by the company's chief financial officer and not an independent body. TalkTalk was fined a record £400,000 for its shoddy security practices over the incident. At the time, an investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) declared that insufficient security at the company allowed customer data to be accessed ""with ease"". The ICO found that TalkTalk could have prevented the data breach in October 2015 if the firm had taken basic steps to protect customers' information. ""For no good reason, TalkTalk appears to have overlooked the need to ensure it had robust measures in place despite having the financial and staffing resources available,"" the ICO report concluded. 70,000 have signed our petition - have you? The hack saw the personal details of 156,959 customers accessed, including their names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses.

A Parole Board spokesman said: ""We can confirm that a panel of the Parole Board gave a negative decision in the parole review of John Worboys following an paper hearing in October 2018. ""Under current legislation Mr Worboys will be eligible for a further review within two years. The date of the next review will be set by the Ministry of Justice."" Worboys has 28 days to request a hearing to dispute the decision. Worboys picked up women late at night in his job as a London taxi driver, telling them he was celebrating winning the lottery or a casino win before plying them with sedative-laced champagne. He then sexually assaulted or raped them. Police say there could be 105 victims of Warboys between 2002 and 2008, before he was caught. In August, Worboys is believed to have been questioned by police over fresh allegations of sexual assault, by ""a number of women"". He was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years, but last year the Parole Board decided it was safe to release him. In March, when he was set to be freed, two of his victims successfully blocked his release. There was an outcry from his victims and the public, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan bringing a challenge with the two victims via a judicial review. After the High Court overturned the board's decision, its chairman, Nick Hardwick, quit saying he was ""sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case"" but that he was not on the decision panel at the time. He admitted that the panel should have taken into consideration the alleged crimes for which Worboys has not been convicted of. 70,000 have signed our petition - have you? Although police believe Worboys committed more than 100 similar crimes, the CPS decided not to overload the indictment by prosecuting him for every attack. Dozens of women were told the prosecution would be more powerful if the court heard only the strongest cases. Justice Secretary David Gauke admitted responsibility for the decision which nearly led to the black cab rapist's release, after he decided not to challenge it."

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez revealed he would no longer vote against the Brexit deal, saying the UK and EU had agreed to demands for guarantees over the status of Gibraltar in future negotiations. Mr Sanchez claimed the agreement allowed Spain to talk about ""co-sovereignty"" of the territory in the coming years. But in a sharp response, Mrs May said: ""The UK's position on the sovereignty of Gibraltar has not changed and will not change. ""I am proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar."" Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell hailed the agreement over Gibraltar as ""the most important"" since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, under which the territory was ceded to the UK. Spain's decision to pressure the UK on Gibraltar does not bode well for the future But Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, used a live TV address to dismiss the Spanish government's claims, comparing Mr Sanchez to the country's former fascist dictator General Franco. ""The government of the UK has been completely firm in its resolve and in our support,"" Mr Picardo said. ""What you have heard from the Spanish prime minister today was not a reflection of any new position, however much he tried to present it as such."" The diplomatic spat which threatened to derail the Brexit process was resolved after emergency talks involving Mr Sanchez, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. As a motto for tomorrow, the words of Freddie Mercury, who passed away exactly 27 years ago: ""Friends will be friends, right till the end"". The British government wrote to Mr Tusk to say that it would not interpret its withdrawal treaty as meaning that a future EU-UK trade treaty would automatically apply to Gibraltar - but it would seek the best deal for the territory. ""We will always negotiate on behalf of the whole UK family, including Gibraltar,"" Mrs May said. ""We have worked through the withdrawal issues for Gibraltar in a constructive and sensible way."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake claimed the PM had ""caved in"" and ""appears to have cast the people of Gibraltar aside"". ""She has conceded that Gibraltar won't necessarily be covered by a future trade deal, simply another example of why what she has negotiated is completely unacceptable,"" he said. Mr Tusk said the Brexit deal reached by negotiators from the UK and Brussels ""found the best possible compromise"" and he would recommend that they approve it. In a tweet, he quoted Queen's song Friends Will Be Friends to sum up the mood for Sunday's summit, saying: ""Friends will be friends right till the end."" Have you signed our petition? Ahead of the EU summit, Mrs May also faced domestic difficulties as the Democratic Unionist Party held its conference in Belfast, where Boris Johnson made a guest appearance. The former foreign secretary - viewed as a potential leadership rival to Mrs May - said the UK was on the verge of ""making a historic mistake"", adding: ""Unless we junk this backstop, we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us - a satellite state."" Mr Johnson set out a series of demands, including a commitment in the withdrawal agreement for a ""super Canada"" trade deal, a provision to withhold ""at least half"" the £39bn divorce bill until trade talks are concluded, and a dedicated cabinet minister for no-deal planning. In her conference speech, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""The reality is that if we are to secure a better outcome than is currently on offer, then the only option is to look beyond this current draft withdrawal agreement and work in the time ahead for an improved outcome."""

She will chair a meeting of her cabinet and face the Commons on Monday after EU leaders endorsed the deal and made it clear it was not up for renegotiation. Mrs May will tell MPs ""with absolute certainty"" that ""there is not a better deal available"". More than 85,000 people have signed our petition - have you? At a historic summit in Brussels on Sunday, the leaders of the remaining 27 member states took less than 40 minutes to approve the deal, which had taken 18 months to negotiate. :: Getting Brexit deal through Commons will be Herculean job Confirming she would put it to a Commons vote before Christmas, Mrs May said: ""It will be one of the most significant votes that parliament has held for many years. ""On it will depend whether we move forward together into a brighter future or open the door to yet more division and uncertainty. ""The British people don't want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal done that fulfils the vote and allows us to come together again as a country. ""I will take this deal back to the House of Commons, confident we have achieved the best deal available and full of optimism about the future of our country. ""In parliament and beyond it, I will make the case for this deal with all my heart and I look forward to that campaign."" She added: ""This is a deal that's the result of what has been tough and difficult negotiations over a significant period of time and as has been said this is the deal that's on the table, this is the best possible deal, it's the only possible deal."" However, she is facing a tough task in securing the backing of MPs, with more than 80 of her own backbenchers publicly stating they will join other political parties in opposing the deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has admitted that the parliamentary arithmetic was ""looking challenging"", but argued that ""a lot can change over the next two weeks"". Former Conservative Party leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said he ""certainly won't"" support the PM's deal, arguing ""far too much has been given to the EU"". He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""I don't believe that, so far, this deal delivers on what the British people really voted for, take back control of your borders, your laws, your money. I think it has ceded too much control."" As well as the withdrawal agreement, the EU leaders also approved a political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU post-Brexit. But Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who represents Wigan - which voted Leave - said the document ""offers no guide as to what the future holds for the UK"". She told Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""It's just too big a gamble for MPs like me to take with our constituents' futures."" Asked if she would be supporting the deal, she said: ""Well I'd hoped that it would be, but in all honesty no... it's inconceivable now that when this comes before parliament in just a few days time that I'll be voting for it."" Speaking on the same programme, Communities Secretary James Brokenshire argued that MPs should back the deal or risk taking the UK ""back to square one with more uncertainty, more division"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed Labour will vote against the agreement, branding it a ""bad deal"" for Britain. He said: ""It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds."" Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said there were no circumstances under which her party would vote for the deal as it stood. She also warned her party would ""review"" the arrangement which has seen it prop up the minority Tory government if the Brexit deal was backed by parliament. Appearing on The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Foster said: ""I believe we should use the time now to look for a third way, a different way, a better way."" However, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has warned that there could be no return to the negotiating table if the deal was rejected. He said: ""This is the deal. It's the best deal possible and the EU will not change its fundamental position when it comes to these issues. ""Those who think by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal."" Irish leader Leo Varadkar said: ""There isn't a plan B. What's being put in front of EU parliament and House of Commons is a deal. Any other deal really only exists in people's imagination."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte added: ""This is the deal on the table. I don't think there is anything more now."""
2018-11-25,An 88-year-old woman has become the oldest person ever to sue an employer for age discrimination after she was sacked from her job as an NHS secretary.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181125211455/https://news.sky.com/story/woman-88-sues-nhs-for-age-discrimination-after-losing-job-as-secretary-11563098,"Bosses at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading dismissed Eileen Jolly in January last year over claims she did not properly use a computer system. The NHS trust has admitted she was unfairly dismissed because she was not given the opportunity to appeal, but it said the decision to dismiss her was not made on the basis of her age. Mrs Jolly says an internal report into her work compiled by a manager included ""unpleasant"" remarks about her age and health. She said: ""I felt as though he had assumed that at my age and because of my health I was a liability and incapable of change and had to go."" She was particularly upset when one colleague was quoted saying: ""It was always a concern that you could walk in and find Eileen dead on the floor."" Mrs Jolly, who has a heart condition and walks with a stick, told an employment tribunal that she had not taken a day off sick in 10 years even though she had a cardiac arrest at work in 2004 and had to be resuscitated by a doctor. She said: ""It had been my intention to continue to work for as long as I could - until I was at least 90 years old."" Her boss, breast surgeon Brendan Smith, said Mrs Jolly was a ""reliable and meticulous"" employee who was being made a ""scapegoat"" for management failings. Have you signed our petition? He accused hospital managers of bullying and said: ""Eileen was at the bottom of the tree. I think they made an example of her because heads had to roll."" Mrs Jolly was accused of not uploading details of women waiting for non-urgent breast reconstruction surgery to a new database - an error partly blamed for 14 women having to wait more than a year for surgery. Mrs Jolly says she had not received adequate training to use the electronic patient record system and had assumed that Mr Smith had uploaded the patients' details while she kept her own version of the waiting list in her drawer. When the error was discovered she was suspended and a tribunal hearing in Reading heard that a report compiled by the trust manager found she had ""fundamental misunderstanding of her role"". It concluded that she had broken her contract by failing to ensure that all patients on the database receive treatment. The report added that she had been dismissed ""on grounds of capability"" for a ""catastrophic failure"". Mrs Jolly, who has worked for the NHS in Berkshire since 1991, said: ""It was humiliating. I felt degraded. I felt as if I was being escorted off the premises in case I did something I shouldn't."" Mrs Jolly's barrister Mark Green said her sacking showed her bosses were guilty of ""insidious stereotyping about elderly people"". Paul Wilson, representing the Royal Berkshire Health Foundation, said that the fact Mrs Jolly had been given a permanent contract in 2012 showed that the trust did not practise age discrimination. The tribunal deferred judgement until a later date."

More than 85,000 people have signed the petition - have you? ""He consciously, deliberately and repeatedly advanced towards danger, moving people to safety and treating casualties,"" the award stated. The father-of-one from 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards helped treat people with gunshot wounds and guided others to safety. He said the honour came as a ""total surprise"" as ""anyone in the military would have done the same"". ""To me it just felt like the right thing to do, because people were there and needed my help. I just did not want to walk away and leave them. ""If I ever need help, I hope and pray that someone would help me."" Trooper Woodward, from Beeston, Nottinghamshire, was visiting the gambling mecca when Steven Paddock started firing from his hotel room. He witnessed ""a lot of chaos"" and heard people ""screaming, shouting, looking for loved ones"". One of the people he helped was a man in his 30s who had been shot in the back and was struggling to breathe. ""I tried to reassure him that I wasn't going to leave him,"" he said. ""I stayed by him, and a few moments passed and there was no response from him - I found out that he had passed away."" Six soldiers from the same regiment helped in the wake of the shooting and were praised by the prime minister for helping victims."

He still believes Brexit is the ""wrong decision"". Not the view of Theresa May, who dutifully says she has a ""clear mission"" to make Brexit happen. That's one step closer with the EU's official endorsement, but she still has the Herculean job of getting parliament to back her. Opposition appears to be growing. Despite last-minute meetings with veteran Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, he's confirmed it would be ""very, very difficult to support"". And hopes that Labour MPs from large Leave areas would vote for the deal are fading after Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said it would be ""inconceivable"". So Theresa May has just weeks to persuade parliament. Have you signed our petition? She's embarking on a massive PR push across the country, but will it be enough to give her the numbers? Too early to say, but it's looking increasingly difficult. If her deal is voted down, the UK will enter uncharted waters, and all bets are off as to what would happen next."

Mr Francois, who is calling for a no confidence vote in the prime minister, said Sir John could list his political principles ""on the back of an old postage stamp"". His caustic letter claims the award is a sign of ""absolute desperation by a government which has effectively abandoned Brexit... to the extent that it is now reduced to handing out knighthoods to malleable colleagues, in a doomed attempt to stave off an almost certain defeat on the meaningful vote"". Sir John had been a vocal critic of Theresa May's plans for the Irish backstop but is not thought to have submitted a no confidence letter, and has yet to say he will rebel in the meaningful vote. The MP for South Holland and the Deepings held a number of ministerial positions from 2001 to 2018, when he lost his job in the department for transport. Theresa May is planning a charm offensive across the UK to try and win support for her deal. The parliamentary arithmetic is currently looking shaky, with her DUP allies, Labour and up to 85 of her own MPs threatening to vote down her plan. Have you signed our petition? Labour MP Jo Stevens, a supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain, said: ""This stinks of cronyism. It seems that in order to pass its unpopular Brexit deal, the government is willing to hand out knighthoods left, right and centre.""

It's bitterly cold and amid the darkness and the swell of the sea the coastguard search for more than two hours. We are following closely behind with a local skipper. Even on this big catamaran the Channel waters are turbulent, it's hard to imagine being out here in a tiny dinghy. We're looking for a flashing SOS light coming from the stranded boat and eventually out of the darkness a dinghy appears. It looks like there are eight or so suspected migrants on board. The coastguard and British border force are here, but we are in French waters now so the suspected migrants are picked up by the French authorities. A coastguard helicopter appears overhead and we're soon told to leave the area. Seeing this rescue first-hand is a grim reminder of the dangers of these attempted crossings. The darkness makes it impossible to see in any direction and I can't see how anyone could make it far without proper navigation. Have you signed our petition? Previously many migrants have been treated for hypothermia when they are picked up and it's easy to see why. I'm well prepared in thermals and inside a covered boat, but it is bitterly cold out here. And this scene isn't unique. More than 100 migrants have been rescued off the Kent coast this month alone. On Friday, a boat was saved with eight men on board claiming to be Iranian, and on Thursday another two boats were rescued with 14 on board. Some say there may be a Brexit factor here, as it's thought more migrants could be attempting the journey in case border security gets tougher. Skipper Craig Burns says: ""It's incredibly dangerous, imagine making that journey in a tiny dinghy... I've never seen so many rescues here, if this carries on it's only a matter of time before we're picking up dead bodies."""

Numbers in the Forest of Dean, which is home to Britain's largest wild boar population, rose from 100 in 2008 to 1,635 this year - and they have now emerged across Wales and the south of England. Last week, the UK's chief veterinary officer warned African swine fever poses a risk to the UK - including its pig farming industry. The highly contagious virus, which has been found in more than 100 wild boar in Belgium, is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of pigs in Europe. The animals, which are up to 2ft 6in tall and weigh between 57kg and 95kg, are also responsible for damage to property, injuries and even deaths. In 2015, a man was killed after a wild boar ran out in front of his car, one of many traffic accidents they have been involved in. Earlier this year, Clive Lilley had the end of a finger bitten off by a boar while walking his dog. Meanwhile, a graveyard, a cricket pitch and a school playing field have been damaged by roaming herds. Animal rights activists have criticised the trust's decision to cull the boar. Have you signed our petition? Drew Pattern, of the Forest of Dean Wild Boar Cull Saboteurs, told The Times: ""There are 37,000 acres in the Forest of Dean and there is plenty of space for the boars.

Nearly 500 of the animals were culled last year, one of the repeated culls that have failed to prevent numbers increasing."

They have been named after the fluorescent jackets worn by protesters, which motorists must keep in their cars by law. In the capital on Saturday, hundreds descended on the Champs Elysee, where officers used cordons to stop them from advancing to the presidential palace nearby and deployed water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protesters. Some of the protesters were singing the national anthem, while others brandished placards demanding the resignation of President Emmanuel Macron and calling him a ""thief"". Eventually, words turned to action for some demonstrators who were spotted tearing up paving stones to throw at police as fires were lit in the streets. Interior minister Christophe Castaner denounced protesters from the far-right and accused National Front leader Ms Le Pen of encouraging them. ""Marine Le Pen urged people to come to the Champs Elysees, and there are members of the ultra-right putting up barriers,"" Mr Castaner said. ""They have responded to Marine Le Pen's call and want to take the institutions of state. We want people to be responsible. ""The right to demonstrate is a fundamental right and we will protect that, but we cannot protect those carried away by violence... those who only want to protest should pull back from this violence and denounce it."" Ms Le Pen rejected the accusation that she had egged on protesters and said she had ""never called for any violence whatsoever"". She accused the government of ""organising the tension"" and seeking to make her a scapegoat. Meanwhile, opposition parties on both the right and left accused the government of trying to reduce the protests to just the sporadic scenes of violence while turning a deaf ear to the demonstrators' grievances. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the radical left France Unbowed party who attended a separate march on Saturday protesting about violence against women, tweeted that the action on the streets was ""a mass protest of the people"" against the government's policies. Officials say 24 people were injured in the clashes, including five officers. Sixty-nine people were arrested. Mr Macron condemned the violence. Thanking the police on Twitter, he carried on to say in a tweet: ""Shame on those who attacked them. Shame on those who have abused other citizens and journalists. Shame on those who tried to intimidate the elect. No place for this violence in the Republic."" Protesters are opposed to the taxes that Mr Macron introduced last year on diesel and petrol, which are designed to encourage people to use more environmentally friendly forms of transport. The price of diesel has risen 23% in the past 12 months, while Mr Macron's approval rating has sunk as low as 21% in recent opinion polls. Have you signed our petition? Away from the capital, highways have been blocked - with burning barricades and convoys of slow-moving trucks obstructing access to fuel depots, shopping centres and factories. Two people have been killed in the protests so far, including a 62-year-old woman who was run over after a motorist panicked after her car was surrounded by demonstrators. A poll this week indicated that 73% of people in France have expressed support for the protests, which have been characterised as a grassroots movement lacking in clear leadership. Last weekend's demonstrations attracted an estimated 250,000 people. Mr Macron has admitted that he has ""not succeeded in reconciling the French with their leaders"" and had ""not given them enough consideration"", but is standing firm and refusing to rescind the fuel taxes."

In an open letter to Education Secretary Damian Hinds, Ms Noble is calling on the government to make the learning of a creative art subject compulsory for GCSE students in England and Wales. The number of teenagers being entered for a creative art subject at GCSE has dropped by more than a quarter in the past five years, according to Ofqual. The Royal Albert Hall in London is one of the most famous venues in the world, with everyone from The Beatles and Elton John to Adele and Jay-Z having performed there.

Last year, a report by Labour highlighted a lack of support for subjects such as art and drama in schools, as well as costly audition fees and projects that pay performers ""poverty wages"", as major causes of what it described as a ""class-shaped hole"" in the industry.

The newspaper says Franklin bought the home in 1993 but nearly lost it in 2008 due to unpaid property taxes. Have you signed our petition? Her 4,148-square-foot Colonial-style house in suburban Detroit's Bloomfield Township is still listed for $800,000 (£623,904). Franklin estate personal representative Sabrina Garrett-Owens said ""there are no other properties"" that were owned by the Queen of Soul. Tributes flooded in for the ""boundary breaking"" soul legend after her death, with Barack Obama and wife Michelle describing her as ""divine and unmatched"". Another former US president, Bill Clinton, said in a joint statement with wife Hillary that Franklin was ""one of America's greatest national treasures"". In a statement, her family labelled her as ""the matriarch and rock of our family"", and said her death was ""one of the darkest moments of our lives"". They thanked fans around the world for their ""compassion and prayers"", adding: ""We have felt your love for Aretha and it brings us comfort to know that her legacy will live on."" Her Detroit funeral, which was more of a celebration, lasted more than seven hours and featured a wide array of tributes, with her close friend Stevie Wonder among the performers."
2018-11-25,"The number of young people suffering strokes is ""rising dramatically"", according to the Stroke Association.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181125211455/https://news.sky.com/story/dramatic-rise-in-young-people-suffering-strokes-charity-11562936,"The charity says the average age of stroke victims has been falling in recent years and predicts the number of 45-year-olds and above being affected will increase by 59% by 2035. Strokes are a life-threatening medical condition that occur when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. The damage can have different effects. Mechanical engineering student David Noblet, 28, from Nottingham, suffered a stroke exactly one year ago. He told Sky News that at first he shrugged off the symptoms. ""I had a really strong headache, I remember my eye sort of closing with the pain. Thought nothing of it really, so just went to bed. Got up in the middle of the night and just went to get a drink and felt my left arm was really weak. I just thought I was tired, went back to sleep, woke up and basically I was half-paralysed,"" he said. David was told by doctors he may not be able to walk again. ""You think of an old person suffering from a stroke, it was a big shock really... I was thinking has it really happened to me because I was fit and healthy before,"" he said. Following intensive rehabilitation over the past year, David is now walking again and has returned to continue his studies. Although the average age for men suffering a stroke is 74, there is research to suggest more young people are being affected. Juliet Bouverie, CEO of the Stroke Association, said: ""The reality is that people are having strokes earlier in their life. So that we know globally in 1990, about a quarter of all survivors were of working age. ""We are seeing the overall number of strokes and the rate in younger people increasing. So for people aged 45 and over, we've seen a dramatic rise in the rate of first-time strokes. ""Our big message is we want young people to be aware that stroke isn't just something that affects older people. It can affect people of all ages."" According to the charity, there are more than 400 childhood strokes each year in the UK - with 25% of those occurring in children aged 11 and over. Have you signed our petition? Dr Pankaj Sharma, from the charity Different Strokes, says the lifestyle of younger people may be playing a part in the number of strokes increasing. ""High blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, those kind of risk factors are well-recognised in stroke,"" he said. ""As the population of young individuals starts getting unhealthy, they're eating worse foods, obesity rates are undressing, diabetes is increasing in the young population, those risk factors are now shifting from the elderly population down to the younger ones and that's probably why stroke is increasing in young individuals."" Around 40,000 people died of a stroke in the UK in 2015. It is the fourth biggest killer in the UK and the biggest killer in Scotland."
2018-11-25,An asylum seeker who claimed he was 15 and joined a Year 11 class at a secondary school is now being treated as an adult. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181125211455/https://news.sky.com/story/asylum-seeker-who-claimed-to-be-15-and-joined-school-is-an-adult-11561810,"An investigation was launched earlier this month when children at Stoke High School in Ipswich raised concerns about the age of a new student, who enrolled in September. The question of his age came to light when students sent Snapchat photographs of the man with the caption ""how's there a 30-year-old man in my maths class?"" The Home Office has now confirmed that an age assessment, completed by the local authority, has verified that the man is over the age of 18. A spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled."" Parents were furious over the incident - with the Mirror reporting that some students were pulled out of school as a result of the man's presence in the classroom. One mother said: ""The question is, how didn't the Home Office or the teachers see what was blindingly obvious to everyone else? ""Heads need to roll and us parents won't rest until we get a full explanation of what went wrong."" Students reportedly discovered photographs on Facebook where he appeared to have a beard and drink beer. The man, who is believed to be from Iran, was suspended from the school and could be deported as he is now being processed as an adult asylum seeker. Have you signed our petition? In 2016, 580 child asylum seekers - of a total 9,800 applications - had their status challenged by the Home Office. In 61% of those 580 cases, it was decided that the child was over 18. If there is a doubt about someone's age as part of an immigration case, the Home Office can arrange for social workers to undertake an age assessment. The claimant must be treated as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour ""very strongly suggests that they are significantly over 18 years of age"". Assessments of physical appearance can include indicators of age such as height, build, facial hair and voice pitch when there is no reliable documentary evidence to support their claimed age. The age of teenage asylum seekers became an issue of national scrutiny in 2016 when unaccompanied child migrants were admitted to the UK. MP David Davies tweeted photographs of them saying ""these don't look like 'children' to me"". Groups working with child migrants say child asylum seekers are left traumatised by invasive age checks built on a culture of disbelief toward those claiming sanctuary in the UK."
2018-11-25,Gibraltar is more vulnerable to Spanish pressure after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181125211455/https://news.sky.com/story/has-spain-really-scored-a-victory-over-the-uk-on-gibraltar-11562481,"That is basically what a note published by Tim Barrow, the UK's ambassador to the European Union, conceded on Saturday. The last-minute admission ahead of a landmark summit of EU leaders on Sunday morning was not - as Spain might have you believe - thanks to seven intense days of pressure from the Spanish government over Gibraltar, led by threats to ""veto Brexit"". It was instead merely the clearer articulation of a reality set in motion from the moment the UK said it planned to leave the EU. Have you signed our petition? Put simply, any future trade deal that London strikes with Brussels will not automatically apply to its overseas territories, such as Gibraltar. The same terms and conditions will likely be mirrored across the ""whole UK family"" but there can be - as spelt out in the letter from Mr Barrow to a senior EU official - ""no obligation or presumption"". Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish prime minister, attempted to portray the comments as a triumph for him and his government after their threats to derail the summit in Brussels, where EU leaders are due to endorse the Brexit deal. He is either deliberately playing political games - particularly ahead of regional elections early next month - to win support from hardliners in his country who regard Gibraltar as rightly belonging to Spain. Or Mr Sanchez and his advisers have misunderstood the meaning of the withdrawal agreement, which all along provided the potential for the Rock to be dealt with separately to UK-EU future relationship talks. Madrid had claimed article 184 of the 585-page document meant Gibraltar would be included in such discussions. This prompted Mr Sanchez to demand an assurance this would not be the case and that Spain could agree the territory's fate with the UK alone. The Gibraltar row has overshadowed the countdown to the Brexit summit on the European side, threatening European unity on the UK's withdrawal. It has triggered a frenzy of diplomatic activity between London, Madrid, Gibraltar and Brussels that culminated in Saturday's choreographed climb down. The UK published its short, legalistic letter on Gibraltar along with a statement from Fabian Picardo, chief minister of the Rock, who reiterated how his people will ""stick with Britain"". Moments later, Mr Sanchez made a public statement on the issue, though his triumphalist tone contrasted starkly with the UK's neutral language. ""We have received sufficient guarantees to be able to reach a solution to a conflict that has lasted more than 300 years between the United Kingdom and Spain,"" Mr Sanchez told reporters in Madrid. The issue of Gibraltar will not derail Sunday's talks but Spain's decision to use the issue to pressure the UK during this crucial week does not bode well for the future."

Sky News reporter Ali Fortescue said conditions were bitterly cold with treacherous conditions on the water. More than 100 migrants are believed to have tried to get to the UK in the past month using small dinghies to cross the Channel. Have you signed our petition? On Thursday, another two boats were saved with 14 aboard and on Saturday morning French authorities rescued five migrants in French waters. Most are wearing little more than a tracksuit or a coat, with some suffering from hypothermia by the time they're picked up. The spike in the number of cases is believed to reflect a belief that the UK border will be shut after Brexit next March."

2018-11-25,Theresa May has written a letter to the nation setting out her intention to make the UK's exit from the EU work for both Leave and Remain supporters.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181125211455/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-mays-heart-and-soul-letter-to-the-country-ahead-of-brexit-summit-11562913,"In it she writes the withdrawal agreement, which has now been formally endorsed by European leaders, will work ""for our whole country and all of our people"". :: Theresa May's letter in full When I became your prime minister the United Kingdom had just voted to leave the European Union. From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me - a duty to fulfil on your behalf: to honour the result of the referendum and secure a brighter future for our country by negotiating a good Brexit deal with the EU. Throughout the long and complex negotiations that have taken place over the last year and a half, I have never lost sight of that duty. PM @theresa_may's letter to the nation #BackTheBrexitDeal pic.twitter.com/jdclptDbTu Today, I am in Brussels with the firm intention of agreeing a Brexit deal with the leaders of the other 27 EU nations. It will be a deal that is in our national interest - one that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted 'Leave' or 'Remain'. It will honour the result of the referendum. We will take back control of our borders, by putting an end to the free movement of people once and for all. Instead of an immigration system based on where a person comes from, we will build one based on the skills and talents a person has to offer. We will take back control of our money, by putting an end to vast annual payments to the EU. Instead, we will be able to spend British taxpayers' money on our own priorities, like the extra £394 million per week that we are investing in our long-term plan for the NHS. And we will take back control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. In future, our laws will be made, interpreted and enforced by our own courts and legislatures. We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the common agricultural policy, that has failed our farmers, and out of the common fisheries policy, that has failed our coastal communities. Instead, we will be able to design a system of agricultural support that works for us and we will be an independent coastal state once again, with full control over our waters. The deal also protects the things we value. EU citizens who have built their lives in the United Kingdom will have their rights protected, as will UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU. A free trade area will allow goods to flow easily across our borders, protecting the many skilled jobs right across the country that rely on integrated supply-chains. The issue of Gibraltar will not derail Sunday's talks but Spain's decision to pressure the UK does not bode well for the future Because our European friends will always be our allies in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the deal will ensure that security co-operation will continue, so we can keep our people safe. As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I have from day one been determined to deliver a Brexit deal that works for every part of our country - for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for our Overseas Territories like Gibraltar, and also for the Crown dependencies. This deal will do that. Crucially, it will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - so people can live their lives as they do now. It is a deal for a brighter future, which enables us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. Outside the EU, we will be able to sign new trade deals with other countries and open up new markets in the fastest-growing economies around the world. With Brexit settled, we will be able to focus our energies on the many other important issues facing us here at home: keeping our economy strong, and making sure every community shares in prosperity; securing our NHS for the future, giving every child a great start in life, and building the homes that families need; tackling the burning injustices that hold too many people back, and building a country for the future that truly works for everyone. On 29 March next year, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. Have you signed our petition? We will then begin a new chapter in our national life. I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country. It must mark the point when we put aside the labels of 'Leave' and 'Remain' for good and we come together again as one people. To do that we need to get on with Brexit now by getting behind this deal. Parliament will have the chance to do that in a few weeks' time when it has a meaningful vote on the deal I hope to strike today. I will be campaigning with my heart and soul to win that vote and to deliver this Brexit deal, for the good of our United Kingdom and all of our people."

A police spokesman said there were no life-threatening injuries and the road was cleared within a couple of hours.

Surrey Police said in a tweet: ""If on the M25 near the RTC between Jnc 6 and 5 please obey the lane closures.

Kensington Palace said: ""Windsor is a very special place for their royal highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate."" The move means they will be 20 miles away from William, Kate and their three children: George, Charlotte and Louis. However, the couple's office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace. The Sun reported that Frogmore Cottage has been undergoing a large refurbishment to transform it from staff accommodation into a family home.

Mr Mnangagwa, who took over from Mr Mugabe a year ago when he faced military pressure, said: ""He can no longer walk but we will continue to take care of him."" Mr Mugabe had been due to return to Zimbabwe on 15 October but was feeling too unwell to travel. The president did not give further details about Mr Mugabe's condition, but he is now expected to return to the African nation on 30 November. Mr Mugabe was the world's oldest head of state before his dramatic exit following 37 years in power. During that time he led the country from independence into repression and economic collapse. Have you signed our petition? For years, Zimbabweans who saw their ageing leader nod off during events speculated how long he would stay in office, while his wife vowed that he could rule from the grave. In a rare public appearance in July, Mr Mugabe slumped behind a bank of microphones during a news conference and didn't leave his chair until reporters left. The president, who was fired by Mr Mugabe when he was his deputy, became a key player in bringing about his exit from power. Mr Mugabe supported an opposition leader in Zimbabwe's historic election in July but in September said he accepted Mr Mnangagwa's win. At the time, he added: ""All of us are now duty-bound to rally behind the government."" Mr Mnangagwa has vowed to revive Zimbabwe's weak economy by trying to attract desperately needed foreign investment."

The group pointed to what it called an ""extraordinary loophole"" in legislation in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which allows wealthy hunters who poach endangered species to bring back trophies from their kills. ""UK hunters have killed literally hundreds of elephants, hippos, leopards, zebras and lions - and then brought home their trophies and body parts for show,"" CBTH spokesperson Eduardo Goncalves said. ""As well as tusks and mounted trophies, UK hunters bring home 'souvenirs' from their elephant-hunting expeditions that include trunks, feet, ears and tails."" Around 2,500 trophies have been brought home by hunters in the last decade, 400 of which were from endangered species. More than 85,000 people have signed our petition - have you? Between 2007 and 2016, there were 922kg of elephant tusks and an additional 147 tusks. With each tusk weighing between six and eighth kilograms this equals two tonnes in total. As well as hunters exploiting the loophole, poachers may pose as those with these special privileges to expose and sell items like rhino horns. ""Letting people kill them because they think it's entertaining is just insane,"" conservationist Bill Oddie said, adding the loss of a handful of animals could have a ""tsunami affect in small populations of animals"". A cross-party group of MPs including Zac Goldsmith and Jeremy Corbyn have backed the group's calls for an urgent ban on the import of hunting trophies. Mr Goncalves called the trade in animals ""grotesque, uncontrolled slaughter on a massive scale"". ""It's pushing threatened species to the brink of extinction,"" he said. ""The government wants to be seen as a global leader on wildlife and animal welfare. If it's serious about this, it should commit to an immediate ban on imports."""
