2018-03-01,Prince William is set to become the first British Royal to make an official visit to the Occupied Palestinian Territories.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/prince-william-to-visit-israel-jordan-and-palestinian-territories-11271688,"The Duke of Cambridge is scheduled to go there in the summer as part of a Middle East tour that will also include Israel and Jordan. It will also be the first ever official visit to Israel by a member of the British Royal Family, according to the Times of Israel. The trip will be the most sensitive that the prince - who is now a full-time Royal - has ever undertaken. Kensington Palace said the tour was ""at the request of Her Majesty's government and has been welcomed by the Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian authorities"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the visit as ""historic"", adding: ""He will be welcomed here with great affection. ""I have ordered the Foreign Ministry director general to coordinate preparations for the visit to ensure its success."" Israel President Reuven Rivlin tweeted that the arrival of Prince William on the country's 70th anniversary of independence was a ""very special present"". Meanwhile, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said it was an ""important and unique opportunity to promote diplomatic and cultural ties in the region"". In 2016, William's father, Prince Charles, attended the funeral of ex-Israeli president and prime minister Shimon Peres, but it was not considered a formal royal visit. Last year, it was reported there were plans for Charles to visit Israel in an official capacity but the trip was apparently cancelled over fears it would anger the UK's Arab allies. The Queen's cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, visited the St John eye clinic in the Occupied Palestinian Territories in 2007, but this was not considered an official visit."
2018-03-01,"Ken Livingstone has been suspended from Labour for an ""unknown"" period of the time after anti-Semitism claims.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/ken-livingstone-suspended-by-labour-again-with-no-time-limit-11271959,"The former London mayor is facing disciplinary action following several controversial outbursts about Hitler. He was previously serving a two-year suspension that was due to be lifted in April, but had that lengthened for ""no exact time limit"" on Thursday. The decision was taken by officers on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, but signed off by the party's outgoing general secretary Iain McNicol in his last official act. :: Labour 'betraying' Jewish community over Livingstone It comes at an important time for Labour, with the grassroots-led Momentum founder John Lansman announcing he will challenge the Unite union official Jenny Fornby for the top role. A Labour spokesperson told Sky News: ""Ken Livingstone has been administratively suspended from the Labour Party, pending the outcome of an internal Party investigation. ""That suspension starts on the date that his membership suspension applied by the National Constitutional Committee ends on 27 April 2018."" A Labour source denied reports the suspension was ""indefinite"" but said its length was ""unknown"". Mr Livingstone will now face a ""full investigation"" into complaints made against him - including several filed since the start of 2018. In February, he was criticised for appearing on Iranian state broadcaster Press TV on Holocaust Memorial Day during a segment asking: ""Has the Holocaust been exploited to oppress others?"" He was suspended by Labour in April 2016, when he claimed Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler supported Zionism in the 1930s. Mr Livingstone later said he ""regretted"" the disruption his comments caused but added: ""I believe what I said is true."""

""We're working as hard as we can to get this sorted out. ""We know that our gravy is a big favourite!"" The chicken shortage was sparked when KFC switched its delivery contract from Bidvest Logistics to DHL last month, causing what the firm called ""teething problems"". Stores were forced to close, sparking panic among bargain bucket buyers and fried chicken fans. Police in east London said they had received calls from frustrated customers, while police in Manchester received a ""ridiculous"" 999 call from an irate customer complaining that one of the restaurants was closed."
2018-03-01,"Successive British governments failed to protect children who were sent to live abroad from sexual abuse for decades, according to a high-profile report.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/successive-governments-failed-to-protect-child-migrants-sent-abroad-from-sex-abuse-report-11271792,"The conclusions were by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) which has been looking into child migration programmes as well as abuse claims in the UK. Thousands of British children were taken to former colonies, mainly Australia and Canada, between the 1920s and 1970s. Most were from deprived backgrounds and already in care when they were promised the chance of a better life. But the report heard from witnesses who said 'care' regimes where they were sent included ""physical and emotional abuse, neglect and sexual abuse"" against children as young as five. Some witnesses told the inquiry of the ""constant hunger, medical neglect and poor education"" they faced abroad. The IICSA, chaired by Professor Alexis Jay, also found children were lied to about their family background, including whether their parents were alive or dead. The investigation into child migration programmes is the first of 13 investigations under way by the IICSA to be published. The report made three recommendations: :: It recommended all child migrants are financially compensated by the Government through a redress scheme. :: It called on all organisations involved in implementing migration programmes to offer apologies to child migrants. :: It called for better preservation of child migrants' records. The report said the Government has not yet made any financial payments to individual former child migrants. It's thought there are around 2,000 child migrants still alive. In 2010, the then prime minister Gordon Brown issued a national apology to those affected by the programmes, saying ""successive governments have failed in a duty of care"". In response to the report, a Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The child migration policy was misguided and deeply flawed. ""Successive governments have accepted that the policy of child migration was wrong."" The 2010 national apology has been reaffirmed in each subsequent year. Over ¬£9m has been made available to former child migrants to help them be reunited with their families. ""We will carefully consider the findings of the inquiry's report and respond in due course"", said the spokesperson. The Catholic Church in England and Wales has reiterated ""the expressions of regret and apologies"" it made during the inquiry. It added: ""All sexual abuse of children and vulnerable people is both criminal and harmful and the Church condemns without reservation any such action or behaviour."""

The red alert, which stays in place until 10am on Thursday with up to 40cm (16in) of snow expected in some areas, signals ""risk to life is likely"", according to the Met Office website. ""Red: Extreme weather is expected. Red means you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the weather,"" it states. ""Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely. You must avoid dangerous areas and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities."" Forecaster Craig Snell warned the freezing conditions would grip the UK for another 48 hours. ""The red warning is our highest tier, we don't often see a red warning - the last one was back in 2016 up in Shetland and Orkney and that was for strong winds,"" he said. ""The last time we had the red snow warning was back in 2013 and that was for South Wales - they do not get issued that often."" He said a red warning for snow has never before been issued for Scotland, England or Northern Ireland. Amber snow warnings have been issued for the north-east of England and the central belt of Scotland to be in place between 10am and 8pm on Thursday. An amber snow and ice warning has also been issue for southwest England and south Wales from 12pm on Thursday until 8am on Friday. Yellow snow warnings remain in place for most of Thursday for vast swathes of southern, central and northern England as well as Northern Ireland and Wales. All schools, community centres and libraries in Edinburgh have been closed in response. Plymouth Council said more than 80 schools would remain shut on Thursday along with 50 in Newcastle and 103 across Devon. Mr Snell warned there could be winds of up to 50 to 60mph in southwestern parts of the UK, bringing about ""blizzard-like conditions"". The treacherous conditions has already lead to deaths around the UK. On Wednesday, a man in his 60s died after being pulled from a lake in London that he had fallen into. Disruption to travel is expected to continue throughout rush hour on Thursday. Gatwick Airport said it was ""expecting a large number of cancellations and delays to flights"". Edinburgh Airport said most airlines had cancelled flights from the airport until lunchtime. Police around the country have advised motorists to avoid driving if possible. Mr Snell said: ""Generally many places on Thursday will struggle to get anywhere near -1C (30F), a few people will come up above, but many of us will be firmly below freezing."""
2018-03-01,"A young woman has been mauled to death by a lioness at a wildlife reserve made famous by a world-renowned ""lion whisperer"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/woman-mauled-to-death-at-lion-whisperer-reserve-in-south-africa-11271136,"The 22-year-old was visiting a camp run by Kevin Richardson at the Dinokeng Game Reserve in Gauteng, near Johannesburg, when she was attacked on Tuesday morning. She had been accompanying a friend for an interview with the manager of the camp, and the pair were taking photos as they prepared to leave before the lioness encountered her. It had been pursing an impala at the ""Big Five"" reserve, which is home to lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and buffalo. Mr Richardson, who has appeared in several documentaries and films as a result of the relationships he has developed with big cats and hyenas, said he was ""saddened and shocked"" to hear of the incident. ""Myself and an experienced colleague took three lions walking in the reserve, as we do on a weekly basis, as part of their exercise and stimulation regiment,"" he explained. ""We assessed the landscape for other Big Five animals and as per procedure sent out a notification that we were walking in the reserve. ""One of the lionesses charged off after an impala and must have run 2 to 2.5km, where she encountered the 22-year-old outside the car. ""I am devastated and my heart goes out to this young woman's family."" Paramedics were called at about 11am but the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. She has not been identified but is believed to be South African, according to local media. Fans of Mr Richardson and the reserve have shown their support for his work on social media, with many expressing hope that the animal would not be euthanised. In 2015, Mr Richardson defended a decision by The Lion Park - another reserve near Johannesburg - to spare the life of a lioness who mauled a tourist through an open window of a car she was travelling in. He said it would have been unfair to put it down because the animal acted instinctively, and it was instead moved to an enclosure not accessible by visitors. Dinokeng Game Reserve has 13 predator enclosures and a large central area in which the animals are rotated through every few weeks, with several camping options for those who wish to visit. Model and actress Cara Delevingne is among its previous guests, having taken part in an advertising shoot there in December. She posted about her visit on Instagram, describing it as ""the most incredible experience""."
2018-03-01,A man has been convicted of causing death by careless driving after a teenage boy was killed in a crash involving a ¬£1.2m Ferrari.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/man-convicted-after-teenager-killed-in-ferrari-crash-11271973,"Alexander Worth, 13, was in the F50 supercar with Matthew Cobden when the businessman lost control at the wheel at a reported 40mph in Hampshire in August 2016, Winchester Crown Court heard. The trial was told Cobden, 39, who was keeping the vehicle at his car storage business, offered to give the teenager a ride after the boy's father asked him whether Alexander could have a picture. The pair then drove along a quiet farm road with good weather conditions and visibility, jurors were told. The Ferrari ""accelerated uncontrollably"" in North Warnborough, causing it to flip and throw the pair, who were not wearing seatbelts, from the vehicle, the court heard. Thomas Wilkins, prosecuting, said: ""Alexander died when the defendant's car drove off the right-hand side into a long fence post which launched the vehicle into the air, flipping it and turning it through 270 degrees. ""No other vehicle was involved and the prosecution say that the fatal incident was caused by a simple driver error - in other words, Mr Cobden's driving fell below that required of a careful and competent driver."" Cobden, who faces jail, broke down in tears while giving evidence, saying: ""It's something I think about all the time, if I had done, things could have been different."" Describing the crash, he said: ""I didn't do anything stupid, I was just trying to do my job. The next thing I remember is being out of the car."" The Ferrari involved in the crash was described as ""the nearest you can get to a Formula One car on a public road"" as the model can go from 0mph to 60mph in less than four seconds. The court also heard Cobden, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said he had not experienced any difficulties with the vehicle before the crash, and ""ample evidence"" suggested the car had been in good working order earlier that day. Cobden denied causing death by careless driving and said the car, which was due to be sold at auction and had been taken out that day for a photoshoot, had a mechanical defect. His defence team said Ferraris were ""temperamental cars"" and a latent error caused the car to lose control. They argued the engine was sometimes prone to only using six of the 12 cylinders and the car accelerated uncontrollably when all of the cylinders suddenly kicked in. But the prosecution said the supercar was well-maintained and the accident was caused by driver error. Cobden is due to be sentenced on 26 March."

The huge tailbacks were caused after lorries became jack-knifed and accidents disrupted the flow of traffic. ""Terrified"" driver Lesley Forster, who was stranded near Haggs in central Scotland, told Sky News: ""The first hour was fine but its just been chaos, we never saw a gritter, there's no emergency services, nothing."" She said a local had ""come out with a wee sledge walking along with fruit and water"" for drivers and said ""he could not go to bed and leave us all sitting out here"". She added: ""There was no problems (in Edinburgh) and it's only when I hit this M80... in the morning, every time at night there's a problem here."" Another driver, Jim Elder, who was stranded 19 miles from Glasgow for nine hours, said traffic had only started moving slowly in the early hours of Thursday morning. He told Sky News: ""We knew that this would be the worst bit but it far exceeded what we thought was going to be expected and we also didn't expect the amount of stuck cars, break downs and accidents."" Mr Elder said he was ""hopeful"" of getting to Glasgow and finding a hotel but admitted he might have to spend the night sleeping in his car. Peter Heath, deputy assistant chief officer at Scottish Fire & Rescue Service (SFRS), said emergency services were now at the scene. ""SFRS teams are on site at the M80 to support the drivers in the red warning area. Bottled water and food being given out,"" he tweeted. ""We are working with Police Scotland and partners to help keep things moving and offer support."" He said his colleagues would be out ""all night"" and warned drivers to stay off the roads. People had been told to avoid driving after the Met Office issued a red snow warning for Scotland on Wednesday. The red alert warns that ""risk to life is likely"" and people ""should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the weather"". Traffic Scotland had also reported accidents on other major routes including the A1, A74(M) and M8 - as well as the M80. Scottish MSP and Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has since said he would be holding talks with employers after people were left stranded while travelling for work. He told Reporting Scotland: ""Some employers have been extremely flexible, but clearly some haven't. ""There will be some conversations I'll be having after this weather event because I have seen HGVs that are carrying home furniture, stationery and piping. ""Now, I'm not convinced that that is all necessary and many of the incidents we've seen have involved a loss of traction from HGVs."""
2018-03-01,Mortgage approvals bounced back from recent lows at the start of 2018 - but other signs suggested the housing market and wider economy remained subdued.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/home-loans-tick-higher-amid-sluggish-market-and-subdued-prices-11271879,"Bank of England figures showed the number of home loans approved for house purchases rose to 67,478 in January. It was a sharper rise than expected and comes after the figure fell to a one-year low of 61,692 in December. But separate figures from lender Nationwide showed an unexpected 0.3% month-on-month fall in house prices in February. That brought the year-on-year figure for price increases down to 2.2%, slowing sharply from 3.2% in January. A further tranche of economic data, this time from the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), showed growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to an eight-month low in February. The latest figures come after official data last week revised down annual GDP growth for 2017 to 1.7%, confirming that the UK's expansion cooled off in the year after the vote to leave the EU. It meant the UK's annual growth was the slowest out of the G7 group of seven leading economies. This has been largely attributed to a squeeze on consumers following the Brexit vote - which resulted in a slump in the pound, pushing up the price of imports and driving up inflation. There has been some benefit to manufacturing, as the weakness of sterling tends to help UK exporters pricing their goods for overseas sale. But the trend of strongly rising house prices in recent years has been weakened - at a time when consumer confidence is also fragile amid uncertainty about Brexit negotiations. In recent months, a Bank of England interest rate rise last autumn and signs of more to come this year may further be weighing on the minds of would-be house buyers. Cuts to stamp duty in the autumn Budget could have partly cushioned the effect. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said the sharp rebound in mortgage approvals in January suggested December's fall may have been a ""knee-jerk reaction to the Bank of England raising interest rates in November"". But he added: ""The latest survey evidence largely points to still weak housing market activity early on in 2018."""

On advice from her predecessor David Cameron, Mrs May quipped: ""The weather has been rather bad in West Oxfordshire and sadly David couldn't make it because he is snowed into his wheely shed. ""But, I was able to catch up with David over the phone and, as ever, he had some excellent advice. 'Don't worry about Boris, don't worry about the Chancellor; worry about ambitious female home secretaries'. Lovely to see you here tonight Amber."" On trying to dodge the dinner, she joked: ""Last year, I was looking forward to this event so much that I called a General Election to get out of it. I can't pull that stunt two years in a row. Or can I? ""I am after all going walking in Wales at Easter. ""But no, of course not, I wouldn't miss this for the world. Because, after all, what says 'Theresa May' more than a comic speech at a boozy dinner in a room full of journalists. ""I feel absolutely right at home."" Recalling one canvassing encounter, she said: ""I remember, in my time as a politician, one canvassing trip particularly sticks in my memory. ""I was at the open door of a caravan and there was clearly some activity within, so I knocked and there was no answer. ""But, the activity persisted. It looked like there was someone lying down. So I knocked again, again there was no reply and I put my head around the door and there was indeed someone lying down. ""It was not one person but two, and it was not the best time to ask them if they were going to vote Conservative. ""I have to say they were giving a whole new meaning to the phrase 'deep and special partnership'."" On the digital prowess of Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, she said: ""So enthusiastic is Matt for the UK's digital future that I think he's transcended into a higher state of existence. ""He's thrown off the surly bonds of flesh and blood - Matt Hancock actually is now an app. ""He only talks to me by way of alarming phone notifications. 'Matt Hancock would like to track your location'. 'Matt Hancock would like to access your photos'. And, perhaps most worrying of all, 'there is a fault with Matt Hancock'. ""But, other ministers are following his lead. The Boris Johnson app is great for extending your vocabulary, but it does contain some adult content. ""The Philip Hammond app is like a drier, less frivolous version of LinkedIn. ""Tonight, I can reveal I am even working on my own app. ""It does provide GPS directions to your nearest wheat field, real-time tracking of Priti Patel's air travel, and the instant allocation of all household chores into girl jobs and boy jobs."" And, on the two Jeremys, she told journalists: ""Last year, cinema goers were wowed by a brilliant film from the makers of The Thick of It and Veep, called The Death of Stalin. ""It told the story of an ageing socialist demagogue, who maintains his power through a sinister personality cult whilst rewriting history and crushing all internal dissent. I know we're all very sorry Jeremy Corbyn can't be here tonight. ""Jeremy declared he'd be PM by Christmas and, if that day ever comes, there will be a few changes around here. I'd be breaking rocks in John McDonnell's re-education camp on the Isle of Man, along with Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and other undesirables. ""And you'd all be adjusting to a new reality too, catching up with the latest government initiative trailed exclusively to Skwawkbox, doing your best to keep on the right side of Press Commissar Milne; if you don't know him he's like a posh Alistair Campbell without the warm and cuddly side. ""But, of course, whatever else, Jeremy Hunt would still be Health Secretary."""

He also revealed the Government would not put into effect a law that would force media organisations to pay legal costs in libel cases whether they won or lost. Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act would be repealed ""at the earliest opportunity"", he said. Mr Hancock revealed he had informed the inquiry's leader Sir Brian Leveson it was being wound up, hailing the ""significant progress"" made by the media and police. He confirmed there would be no part two - which would have examined illegal action by media organisations, and relations between journalists and the police. ""The world has changed,"" he announced. Responding, Labour's shadow culture secretary and deputy leader Tom Watson called it a ""bitter blow to the victims of press intrusion"". He accused newspapers of ""helping write"" Mr Hancock's statement, and said the minister would ""prosper politically"" from the move. Tory MPs who backed some policies recommended in the inquiry ""didn't mean it"", Mr Watson added. ""They were waiting for the wind to change, waiting for the fuss to die down, waiting for a time when they could as quietly as possible break their promises,"" he said. The inquiry was launched in 2011 by then prime minister David Cameron, in the wake of the phone hacking scandal."

The companies said they could combine their content side-by-side for the first time by integrating the Netflix app into Sky Q. Netflix programmes would be promoted alongside that of Sky's - bringing together Sky shows such as Britannia, Billions and Big Little Lies with The Crown, Stranger Things and Black Mirror. The deal builds on Sky's investment programme in Sky Q and a similar agreement announced this week with music streaming service Spotify. Just before Christmas, Sky and BT announced a cross-supply deal following years of talks as both were under pressure to bolster their offerings amid the challenge posed by the likes of Netflix and Amazon. The deal with Netflix was announced as Sky's future ownership remains uncertain in a sector facing profound change amid changing viewing habits. Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said: ""The exciting new features coming to Sky Q will enable Sky customers to access even more of the best entertainment delivered over the best product platform. ""By placing Sky and Netflix content side-by-side, along with programmes from the likes of HBO, Showtime, Fox and Disney, we are making the entertainment experience even easier and simpler for our customers. ""Our recent announcements mean we will extend our leadership in delivering customers the best viewing and user experience in Europe."" His counterpart at Netflix, Reed Hastings, added: ""With this innovative new partnership and Netflix's stellar line up of original content from across the world, Sky's customers will be able to seamlessly access and enjoy all the best entertainment in one place."""

He also said Theresa May's demands for Brexit were ""literally not going to happen"" in a dramatic intervention ahead of the PM's next showpiece Brexit speech on Friday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today show, Mr Blair said: ""What she thinks is that it's possible to get the EU to give us access to Europe's markets without the same obligations that the rest of Europe has in the single market. ""That is not possible. It's not a question of a tough negotiation or a weak negotiation, it literally is not going to happen. He added: ""I find it not just disappointing but sickening that people should really be prepared to sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit."" And Mr Blair cautioned that despite Jeremy Corbyn's call for Britain to stay in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, Labour would ""very soon find that we've got to move further in order to escape the dilemma ourselves"". He will give his own speech on Thursday, following on the heels of John Major, the Conservative prime minister he ousted in 1997. Mr Blair will aim his address at Brussels, telling EU leaders that they ""share the responsibility to lead us out of the Brexit cul-de-sac"". He is expected to call for them to set up a ""parallel path"" to Brexit, which gives Britons the option to stay in a ""reformed"" EU. There may be just ""weeks"" left to do so, Mr Blair will declare, buoying Remainers with the optimism that ""in these times in politics anything can happen"". It will come hours after Theresa May hosts EU Council President Donald Tusk in Downing Street for talks on the draft Withdrawal Agreement. On Wednesday, she said the terms laid down by Brussels could not be accepted by ""any UK prime minister"". Mr Tusk has already hit back in a speech to business leaders, saying he will ask Mrs May for a better solution to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland than it staying in a ""common regulatory area"". ""No-one has come up with anything wiser,"" he claimed."

Criminals caught carrying acid in public for a second time face a minimum six-month jail term, with under-18s being told they will be handed a four-month detention and training order. The guidelines also spell out how under-18s could face tougher punishments if they film their crimes to post them on social media. Public concern over the use of acid as a weapon has intensified following a spate of recent incidents. Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, was jailed in December for 20 years for an acid attack in a nightclub which injured at least 22 people. On Monday, John Tomlin is due to be sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court for a horrific acid attack on two cousins in Beckton, east London, last June. One of the victims, Jameel Muhktar, told Sky News the assault had ""destroyed"" his life and he remained in ""severe pain"" months afterwards. Stores selling products containing dangerous levels of corrosive substances were asked to sign up to a voluntary ban for under-18s in January under a new government plan. Some of the country's largest retailers including Wickes, B&Q, Screwfix and Tesco signed up to the list of commitments, which includes checking the age of buyers both in store and online. The Home Office said it was making good progress on implementing its action plan to tackle the use of corrosive substances in violent attacks. A spokesman added: ""We will shortly announce our response to last year's consultation on new legislation banning sales of corrosives to under-18s and introducing a new offence for possessing corrosive products in a public space. ""In the meantime we have put in place a set of voluntary commitments with retailers to restrict access to most harmful products."""

2018-03-01,"As the UK endures days of severe cold weather, a significant build up of ice due to freezing rain could make conditions even worse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-freezing-rain-what-you-need-to-know-11271739,"Freezing rain is expected to fall over some areas of southern Britain from late on Thursday evening to the early hours of Friday. Here's what you need to know. What is freezing rain? It is rain that has become ""supercooled"" as it falls from the sky. It starts as snow, ice or hail high up in the atmosphere, but as it travels down it melts through a layer of warmer air, then refreezes again through a layer of colder air near the surface. Why is it so dangerous? As soon as it hits the ground it turns to ice. The ice is very clear, often referred to as black ice, because it is so difficult to see, making it treacherous for pedestrians and drivers. Although we hear about black ice a lot, it's not usually as a result of freezing rain. What usually happens is the rain falls onto already frozen surfaces, or wet surfaces which then freeze as temperatures drop below 0¬∞C overnight. Can is cause a lot of damage? It has the potential to. Freezing rain, when it falls onto surfaces, can be very dangerous. If it hits power lines or tree branches, depending on how much rain there has been, the weight of the ice can cause them to break off because they can't support the weight. It can also make it pretty difficult to open your car door if there is enough of it. Have we ever had freezing rain in the UK? It is a very rare occurrence in the UK. The conditions needed for freezing rain to occur are very specific, and it usually happens when the air is extremely cold, like it is now. What precautions should people take? The best thing people can do is take extra care when travelling. As it is so hard to see, it's difficult to judge just how icy road surfaces are. The RAC's road safety spokesman, Pete Williams, says freezing rain is ""arguably the most treacherous of all conditions for motorists"". They urge people not to drive unless necessary, but say those who do need to should check they have plenty of fuel and oil and check their tyre treads. They also encourage drivers to make sure their lights are working and check they have screenwash."

Their talks came a day after the Prime Minister rejected EU proposals to establish a ""common regulatory area"" between the bloc and Northern Ireland after Brexit. As he sat alongside Mrs May in Number 10, in front of photographers, Mr Tusk told the Prime Minister: ""I'm absolutely sure that after your so-called red line, we'll I'm not happy with it, you know, but of course, but it's natural that you have maybe different point of views when it comes to the essence of Brexit. ""Anyway, after your decision on no customs union and no single market it's some kind of breakthrough and we can start our substantive negotiations immediately."" Mr Tusk also apologised for his lateness to a lunch of poached lemon sole, followed by chocolate pavlova, joking that his ""transport was not frictionless"" as the UK is gripped by freezing temperatures. Earlier in the day, the European Council President had dismissed Mrs May's hopes for post-Brexit trade between the UK and EU to be ""as frictionless as possible"". An EU source described Mr Tusk's meeting with Mrs May as ""an open and honest debate in a good atmosphere about the real political difficulties ahead of us"". They said the ""main focus was on the content of, and process towards, the future relationship post-Brexit"" with the European Council president having taken note ""of the repeatedly stated UK red lines and recalled that the red lines will shape the future relationship"". Their talks also touched on the planned Brexit transition period and Northern Ireland, while Mr Tusk confirmed all other 27 EU member states were giving their ""full support"" to the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, the source added. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Tusk and the Prime Minister ""held a positive and constructive meeting"", where they looked forward to the European Council summit later this month. Mrs May was ""clear"" the UK is ""fully committed"" to turning December's agreement on the first phase of Brexit negotiations - on key divorce matters - into a legal text ""as soon as possible"", and is ""steadfast"" in her commitment to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, the spokesperson added. However, the Prime Minister was also said to have told Mr Tusk the draft legal text presented by the EU on Wednesday was ""unacceptable"" due to its impact on the ""constitutional integrity"" of the UK. Mrs May also briefed the European Council president on the contents of her major Brexit speech on Friday and expressed her hope EU leaders ""would engage with this thinking constructively"", the spokesperson added. On Thursday morning, in a speech in Brussels, Mr Tusk said the EU acknowledged Britain's ""red lines"" to quit the bloc's single market and customs union ""without enthusiasm and without satisfaction"". But he added the EU would ""treat them seriously with all their consequences"". ""There can be no frictionless trade outside of the customs union and the single market,"" he said. ""Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit. By nature."" He also revealed he would be asking the Prime Minister for ""a better idea"" than the EU plan she has rejected for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""Until now, no-one has come up with anything wiser than that,"" Mr Tusk said. Mr Barnier also called on Britain to provide ""better ideas"" on how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, ""while preserving the integrity of the single market"". Speaking to a business conference in Brussels, the European Commission official added: ""We are ready to look at them in a very constructive way."" Mr Barnier also warned Britain the EU ""cannot and will not compromise on its founding principles"" during negotiations on a future EU-UK relationship. ""I recognise the political temptation to avoid making a choice or to downplay the cost of Brexit, or indeed to pretend that the UK could obtain a free trade deal with the EU with all the benefits of the single market without the obligations,"" he said. ""Abandoning such ideas will enable us to begin building an ambitious future partnership based on the foundation of realism and in the interests of our citizens and our businesses, and this is my objective."" He also warned ""certainty"" on the Brexit transition period may only come ""early next year"". On Wednesday, Mrs May insisted ""no UK prime minister could ever agree"" to a plan for a ""common regulatory area"" between the EU and Northern Ireland, included in a 118-page document set out by Mr Barnier on Wednesday morning. The proposal would see such an area established in the event a EU-UK agreement on a future relationship fails to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Under the plan, Northern Ireland would remain an effective part of the EU's customs union, align with the EU on VAT, abide by Brussels rules on state aid, and remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. But the Prime Minister insisted the EU scheme, if implemented, would ""threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK"" by creating a border in the Irish Sea. It has also sparked angry accusations that Brussels is trying to ""annex"" Northern Ireland. On Friday, Mrs May will flesh out the Government's position on the future EU-UK trade relationship ahead of the second phase of Brexit negotiations. It follows a two-hour Cabinet meeting on Thursday, where ministers were described by Downing Street as having ""agreed on the speech as being a real step forward"" after a ""genuine discussion ahead of the text being finalised"". Next week, Mr Tusk will set out the EU27's own guidelines on a post-Brexit trade agreement."

""This is a bizarre and twisted crime that could have resulted in the death of a Queens woman, whose only fault was that she shared similar features with the defendant,"" said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. He added that both women have dark hair, the same skin complexion and speak Russian. Mr Brown said that in August 2016, Nasyrova, visited the Forest Hills, Queens, home of the 35-year-old victim with a cheesecake. ""The woman ate the cheesecake, fell ill and laid down,"" Brown said. ""Before passing out, the woman's last memory is of seeing the defendant sitting beside her inside her home."" The following day, a friend found the victim unconscious in her bed, ""dressed in lingerie with pills scattered around her body as if the woman had attempted to kill herself,"" Brown said. Returning home following her discharge from hospital she discovered that her passport, employment card, a ring and cash had disappeared from her home. After she reported the thefts, detectives tested the cheesecake and discovered it contained the Russian tranquiliser Phenazepan. Nasyrova fled to the US in 2014 from Russia where she is wanted in connection wit the killing of a 54-year-old woman whose remains were found were found burned and buried two miles from her home in Krasnodar."

However following a meeting between Policing Minister Nick Hurd and Alfie's parents a Home Office spokesman said that ""every option"" was being considered to help him. Alfie can suffer up to 30 seizures a day. His parents, Hannah Deacon and Drew Dingley, want to give him medical cannabis, which he was treated with in the Netherlands last year. Alfie's use of cannabis treatment is said to reduce both the severity and the frequency of his clusters of seizures, coming once every 27 days rather than every 7-10 days. It has been claimed the youngster faces ""early psychosis and a premature death"" if he has to revert to the steroid-based treatment he received before travelling to the Netherlands. One of the possibilities being considered to help Alfie is a ""trial"" of medical cannabis supervised by his doctors. The Home Office spokesman said: ""The Government has a huge amount of sympathy for the rare and difficult situation that Alfie and his family are faced with. ""The Policing Minister wants to explore every option and has met with Alfie's family to discuss treatments that may be accessible for him. ""No decisions have been made and any proposal would need to be led by senior clinicians using sufficient and rigorous evidence.""

2018-03-01,"Marriage rates among opposite-sex couples are at a record low, according to official figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/marriage-rates-among-opposite-sex-couples-at-record-low-11271997,"Experts say many people are focusing on other priorities like their education, starting a family or buying a house. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for 2015 - the latest years for which statistics are available - show there were 21.7 marriages per thousand unmarried men and 19.8 marriages per thousand unmarried women in England and Wales. This is the lowest level since the data started being collected in 1862. The number of marriages between opposite-sex couples - 239,020 - was the smallest in a calendar year since 2009. However, those in older age groups seem to be bucking the trend. Marriage rates for opposite-sex couples exchanging vows in 2015 were lower at all ages compared with 10 years ago, except for men aged 65 and over and women aged 55 and over. Nicola Haines from the ONS said: ""Marriage rates for opposite-sex couples are now at their lowest level on record following a gradual long-term decline since the early 1970s. ""The number of marriages between opposite-sex couples decreased by 3.4% in 2015, compared with 2014. ""Despite this overall decline, marriages at older ages rose; the number of weddings increased for men aged 50 and over and women aged 35 to 39 years and 45 and over."" Harry Benson, research director at the Marriage Foundation, said the figures should be a ""deep cause for concern"". He added: ""Britain already languishes in shame at the bottom of the developed world league table for family stability, almost entirely due to the trend away from marriage and formal commitment."" Relate chief executive Chris Sherwood said the research suggests many people see little difference between marriage and living together. ""It's not entirely clear why marriage rates among opposite-sex couples are at an all-time low but it could be that the rising cost of marriage is a deterrent,"" he said. ""It's also possible that many people are now prioritising other things over getting married, such as education, starting a family, buying a house and going travelling. ""This could also be a reason for the rising average age of marriage."" There were 6,493 marriages between same-sex couples in 2015, with a further 9,156 turning their civil partnership into a marriage. The average age at which people choose to tie the knot continues to rise. For opposite-sex couples it was 37.5 years for men and 35.1 years for women. It was slightly higher for same-sex couples, standing at 40.6 years for men and 37.0 years for women. The statistics also reveal that there were falls in both civil (1.6%) and religious (8%) ceremonies among opposite-sex couples compared with 2014. Same-sex couples mostly marked their marriages through civil ceremonies, with only 44 religious ceremonies in 2015, the figures show."

The icy blast has been made worse by the arrival of Storm Emma, which is set to intensify snowfall. :: LIVE: Red weather alert for Wales and South West National Grid said there was a shortfall of around 50 million cubic metres and it could limit use in non-essential industry later in the day and into Friday unless further supplies could be secured. The requirement is aimed at keeping home boilers burning and maintaining gas-generated electricity. Its statement read: ""National gas demand today is high and due to the extreme weather conditions, there have been gas supply losses overnight. ""At 5.45am this morning we issued a 'Gas Deficit Warning' to the market. ""This is an indication to the market that we'd like more gas to be made available to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the national gas network. ""We are in communication with industry partners and are closely monitoring the situation."" The energy operator's warning was made 24 hours after Sky News reported a doubling in the cost of wholesale gas for immediate delivery on Wednesday morning. Experts pointed to a series of factors, including the weather, for prices reaching 12-year highs of 190p per therm. The main one was the growing reliance the UK has on gas pipelines from overseas as storage dwindles - making wholesale costs more prone to market developments. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, closed the country's largest storage facility off the Yorkshire coast last year on safety grounds. Supply issues this week, including an outage at a gas processing plant in Norway, have combined with technical problems at some UK gas terminals to knock imports. After the National Grid alert, the cost spiked at 200p per therm and prompted warnings that homes and businesses potentially faced higher bills to account for the crunch. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ""Behind today's gas deficit warning is a 'perfect storm' of unrelated short-term issues - freezing conditions, diminished Dutch gas production due to earthquake concerns, weather-related issues curbing imports from Europe, and a global LNG (liquified natural gas) market in which supplies are being pulled to Asia by higher prices. ""But underlying it is another set of issues that speak to a failure by successive Governments to map out a secure gas future in the way that they have done so successfully for electricity. ""Allowing Centrica to close the UK's only big long-term gas store without consideration for supply during cold snaps, failing to develop a coherent plan for low-carbon heating, and above all a head-in-the-sand approach to improving energy efficiency in homes have all put households and businesses at risk of shortages and price spikes."""
2018-03-01,"If scriptwriters at Universal Studios, Disney or Twentieth Century Fox were to come up with a storyline of the kind engulfing each of their parent companies just now, it would be dismissed as too far-fetched.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180301174415/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-cabbie-convinced-comcasts-boss-to-reach-for-the-sky-11269684,"The parents of the trio - Comcast, Walt Disney Co and 21st Century Fox - find themselves embroiled in a multi-billion dollar tangle at the centre of which sits Sky plc, the owner of Sky News. In December 2016, Fox said it wanted to buy the remaining 61% of Sky that it does not already own. That deal has been snarled in the UK regulatory process with Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, due to rule by June on whether it should be allowed to go ahead. :: Comcast challenges Fox with ¬£22.1bn Sky bid interest Assuming it does, Sky would be taken over by Fox, before being sold on to Disney as part of a wider deal involving all of Fox's entertainment assets. At the time, Comcast, America's biggest cable operator, also expressed an interest in buying those assets from Fox. It was even thought to be prepared to pay more than Disney. But Rupert Murdoch, the executive co-chairman of Fox, calculated that Comcast would have a tougher time getting a deal past US competition regulators than Disney - and Comcast walked away. Another factor was that, with Mr Murdoch's family receiving shares as part-consideration, Disney shares were more attractive in view of Comcast's shareholder structure - which effectively gives the Roberts family, which founded the company, control of it. Since then, two things have happened. The first is that Comcast's board has, according to reports, given serious consideration to reviving its interest in Fox's entertainment assets. The second is that, in the recent round of auctions for live TV rights for the Premier League, Sky emerged with a great result. In the next three year cycle, from 2019-22, it will be paying ¬£200m less per season than in the current 2016-19 cycle. That has prompted some minority shareholders in Sky to argue that Fox needed to sweeten its terms from the 1075p-per-share it agreed to pay back in December 2016. They include Crispin Odey, one of the City's best-known fund managers and Elliott, a notoriously aggressive US hedge fund. Enter Comcast. The US giant has today waded in with a 1250p-a-share offer that values the whole of Sky at ¬£22.1bn - compared with the ¬£18.5bn Fox was prepared to pay. It has said that, while it would like to own all of the shares in Sky, it will be satisfied with 50% plus one share and that its takeover is not dependent on Fox selling its existing 39.1% stake in Sky. Crucially, it is promising to increase Sky's investment in UK TV and film production, as well as pledging to continue broadcasting news under the Sky brand - a guarantee Fox, too, has made along with promises to maintain the independence of Sky News. Comcast's intervention raises a number of questions for investors. The first is how Fox will respond. Sky's share price has shot up by more than a fifth, to 1330p, implying that investors expect Fox to come back with a higher offer. But Mr Murdoch might yet decide to alter the terms of his existing deal with Disney to exclude Sky from the sale. The second is Comcast's motivation. Is it simply interested in Sky, as it says, as a platform to grow its business in Europe? Or is this part of an attempt to get Fox back around the negotiating table in order to try and gazump Disney? A third question is how Disney itself reacts. It might choose to launch a takeover bid of its own for Sky which it, too, covets as a way of reducing its dependence on the US. Both Disney and Comcast have different reasons for wanting to do these deals. In the case of Disney, it wishes not only to widen its geographic spread, but also to acquire - with Fox's entertainment assets - a greater array of film and TV assets with which to take on internet giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. In the case of Comcast, it too wishes to diversify away from the US, where cable subscribers have been ""cord-cutting"" in their droves. In response it has launched its own ""over-the-top"" streaming service, just as Disney and Fox have with Hulu, to try and get around this - but that service requires content. Hence the interest in both Sky and in Fox's entertainment assets. One fascinating dimension to this story - again, back to the Hollywood analogy - is the cast of characters it brings together. Mr Murdoch built Fox into one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, founding Sky along the way, but also owns - via News Corporation - some of the world's most famous newspaper titles, including The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post. It all started from a single newspaper in Adelaide and several members of Mr Murdoch's family have gone on to be executives either at Fox, Sky or News Corp. Comcast, too, is very much a family concern. Now the world's biggest broadcasting and cable television company, following its 2011 takeover of NBC Universal and its 2016 acquisition of Dreamworks Animation, it was built by Ralph Roberts from a single cable company in Tupelo, Mississippi. His son Brian is now chairman and chief executive of Comcast and the Roberts family exerts control of the business. And there is history, too, between Mr Roberts and Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive. Comcast sought to buy Disney in 2004 for $54bn. Disney rejected the offer and Comcast walked away. Mr Iger, who has called Sky a ""crown jewel"", scuppered Mr Roberts's ambitions on that occasion. It would be ironic were Mr Roberts to now do the same to him. The final characters, were this being turned into a film, would be the ordinary members of the public. Mr Roberts told reporters this morning that, during a recent visit to London, a taxi driver had spoken to him favourably and in detail about Sky in comparison with rival cable service Virgin Media. He was then impressed by a demonstration of the Sky Q service in a shopping mall by a Sky sales rep. Those two events, apparently, helped convince him to bid."

An NZSIS document dated 9 November 1981 confirms ""the possibility that a firearm was discharged in the vicinity of the Queen"". It states it is ""highly likely although it may not have been aimed directly at the Queen or the Royal Party"". However, another secret document from 1997 responds to allegations in a newspaper from a former detective who claimed senior police officers attempted to cover up the assassination attempt. The document reads: ""Lewis did indeed originally intend to assassinate the Queen, however did not have a suitable vantage point from which to fire, nor a sufficiently high-powered rifle for the range from the target."" The 1981 document also references media reports of the time and fears held by officers. ""Current police investigations into the shots have been conducted discreetly and most media representatives probably have the impression that the noise was caused by a firework of some description,"" it stated. ""There is a worry, however, that in court the press may make the connection between the date of the offence and the Queen's visit."" The documents were released following a Freedom of Information request. Lewis, who had already been charged along with his accomplices with 15 counts of burglary and one of armed robbery, was later charged with possessing a firearm and discharging it in a public place. In a document from 1985, officials said Lewis was still considered a threat to the Queen. ""Lewis is still considered unstable by police and is regarded as a potential threat to Her Majesty The Queen when she visits next year,"" they wrote. And in 1995, after he was released from prison, officials said police were still ""paying close attention"" to Lewis ahead of another royal visit. It said police were ""sceptical, given the almost psychopathic nature of some of his past activities"" despite Lewis claiming to be a ""reformed character"".

The UK still faces a ""severe"" threat from international terrorism, meaning an attack is ""highly likely"". Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""Despite the change which has been made today, there remains a real and serious threat against the United Kingdom from terrorism and I would ask the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police regardless of the threat level."" :: How the UK's terror threat levels work The decision to reduce the terror threat from Northern Ireland to the second-lowest level was taken by the security service based on latest intelligence, Ms Rudd added. The threat level to Northern Ireland from terrorism based in the country itself remains ""severe"". There are five threat levels - low, moderate, substantial, severe and critical. They are decided based on a range of factors including intelligence, terrorist capability, and timescale. The UK had faced a ""substantial"" terror threat from Northern Ireland - meaning there was a ""strong possibility"" of an attack - since May 2016. Then-home secretary Theresa May said at the time the move reflected ""the continuing threat from Dissident Republican activity"". Last September the UK's threat level from international terrorism was reduced from critical to severe, meaning an attack is considered highly likely rather than imminent.

A day earlier he had been involved in a row at the Newton Arms in Staining near Blackpool at around 12.20am, police said. A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Marx suffered ""blunt head trauma"", which police believe he sustained during the ""altercation"" at the pub. Three men from Blackpool, aged 29, 54 and 29, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, Lancashire Police said. It is understood the three men had previously been arrested before being released on bail last year. One of the 29-year-old suspects has also been arrested on suspicion of wounding after a second person was hurt during the altercation, police said. Detectives are also trying to trace a man who may have spoken to Mr Marx at Winston's Bar in Blackpool at around 1am on 7 October. Police have released an image of the man but say he is not a suspect in the case. Detective chief inspector Gareth Willis said: ""These are tragic circumstances and sadly a man has lost his life.

Speaking in a state-of-the-nation speech, Mr Putin warned that Moscow would regard a nuclear attack on its allies as an attack on Russia itself and would respond swiftly. ""We would consider any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies to be a nuclear attack on our country. The response would be immediate,"" he told the audience of Russian politicians and senior officials. Mr Putin said the weapons made NATO's US-led missile defence system ""useless"" and signalled the end to Western efforts to check Russia's nuclear ambitions. ""I want to tell all those who have fuelled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country's development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened,"" Mr Putin said. ""You have failed to contain Russia."" He said the development of the new weapons was in response to the US withdrawing from a Cold War-era treaty that banned missile defences and Washington's moves to develop a missile defence system. Mr Putin told the audience that the US had ignored Moscow's complaints, adding ominously: ""No one has listened to us. You listen to us now."" Mr Putin claimed the high-speed cruise missile, which was tested late last year, has an unlimited range and can penetrate any missile defence. The high-speed underwater drone can carry a nuclear warhead and target both aircraft carriers and coastal facilities, the President also claimed. He added that the names for the two weapons had not yet been chosen and suggested the country's defence ministry could run a nationwide contest to pick the names. A new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) called Sarmat is also under testing and has a range and number of warheads exceeding the capabilities of its predecessor, Mr Putin added. Another new weapon mentioned in the speech was Avangard, which Mr Putin described as an intercontinental hypersonic missile that would fly towards targets at 20 times the speed of sound and strike ""like a meteorite, like a fireball"". The speech in Moscow was accompanied by videos and computer images of the new weapons, which were shown on large screens in the conference hall. ""No one in the world has anything like that,"" he said. ""It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new."""

He urged people to take a ""more literal interpretation of the word 'essential'"" when it comes to travel and reminded drivers there had been ""so many warnings that this weather was coming"". ""Colleagues have been rescuing hundreds of stranded motorists overnight and the icy roads are treacherous,"" he said, adding to his previous warning that ""if we have to rescue you this may put another's life in danger"". Police had declared a major incident after hundreds of drivers needed rescuing from the A31, connecting Hampshire and Dorset. More than 100 cars and lorries were also trapped for 17 hours overnight on the A303 between Ilminster in Somerset, and Mere in Wiltshire. Meanwhile, high on the Pennines, on the M62, the military was called in to help rescue vehicles between Rochdale and Lancashire. Drivers and passengers spent up to 18 hours on the carriageway, where temperatures were below zero and wind speeds reached 90mph. Volunteers took hot drinks, food and blankets to those left stranded. Meanwhile, NHS staff have been praised for taking ""extraordinary measures"" to ensure patients are taken care of. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said employees had walked miles in the snow, dug vehicles out of drifts and slept in hospitals. One paramedic in London attended an emergency call on a bicycle. Mr Steven said: ""Once again the NHS is showing that we are there for people when they need us and that's all down to our staff, so a huge thank you to everybody across the NHS who is going the extra mile for people at this highly pressurised time."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a ""blunt"" message to haulage firms for continuing to send drivers out despite official warnings to avoid non-essential journeys. ""I saw some branded HGVs in pictures yesterday and given the branding on them I would struggle to say that their transport was unavoidable,"" she said. The AA reported 30% fewer journeys on Thursday compared with the same day last week. ""It's the kind of drop we might see on Christmas Day,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Almost a third of drivers did get the warnings and took sensible action by not venturing out. ""I think where people did go out they probably didn't think the conditions would be as bad as they were."" Thursday was its busiest March day ever, with 30,000 calls to its breakdown line."

The 25-year-old plotted to target landmarks including Big Ben, the Queen's Guard and Westfield shopping centre, using guns and a car packed with explosives. He groomed children as young as 11 at the Ripple Road mosque in Barking, showing them a violent IS video to give a more ""holistic"" view of the group and swearing them to secrecy, the court heard. One victim told police that Haque had aimed to gather an army of 300 men. ""Umar has been teaching us how to fight, do push-ups, given strength and within six years he was planning to do a big attack on London,"" the boy said. ""He's training us now so by the time I'm in Year 10 we will be physically strong enough to fight."" A self-styled teacher with no formal qualifications, Haque was able to access 250 young people over five years at two schools and at the Ripple Road Madrassa, potentially attempting to radicalise 110 of them. Parents at the fee-paying Lantern of Knowledge Islamic school in Leyton were ""horrified"" when it emerged that Haque had been teaching their children religious studies and PE. After he was found guilty, Haque shouted ""I want to say something"" and was dragged from the dock by officers. ""You will clearly see Islamic State establish itself in the Arabian peninsula and that droughts will affect Europe and America,"" he yelled. The plot was pursued with the help of others. Abuthaher Mamun, 19, and Muhammad Abid, 27, were convicted of attempting to help the would-be terrorist with fundraising and support. In bugged conversations, Haque was recorded telling conspirators they were ""here to cause terror"" and saying he had been inspired by the 2017 Westminster Bridge attack. ""We are a death squad sent by Allah and his messengers to avenge my Arab brothers' blood,"" he said. Handwritten notes presented in court revealed a hit list of targets including Transport for London, Shia Muslims, Heathrow, City banks, the media, embassies and Britain First. Giving evidence, Haque said the hoped-for attacks were ""hypothetical"", and the other accused men said they did not believe his terrorism intentions were serious. Commander Dean Haydon, of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command, said work was ongoing to safeguard 35 children who were ""almost paralysed with fear"" following Haque's attempts to radicalise them."
2018-03-02,Theresa May has used a landmark speech on Brexit to hit back at the EU's refusal to offer Britain a bespoke deal after it leaves the bloc.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180302230229/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-defends-cherry-picking-a-brexit-deal-in-mansion-house-speech-11273198,"She stood firm in calling for a different relationship than Canada, Norway and Turkey have with the EU, declaring: ""If this is cherry picking, then every trade agreement is cherry picking."" The Prime Minister lampooned the favoured phrase of Brussels' chief negotiator Michel Barnier in a bid to flesh out her Brexit vision. She repeated a ""hard fact"" that Britain would leave the EU customs union and single market. ""Life is going to be different,"" she said. ""In certain ways, our right to each other's markets is going to be different to what it is now."" But Mrs May called for ""reciprocal binding commitments"" on some policy areas and voiced hopes the UK would still stay signed up to a number of EU agencies. That includes the European Medicines Agency, which is relocating its headquarters from London to Amsterdam because of Brexit. Alas I have not been able to listen in person as I hoped as I have been delayed by our common European winter weather - on which we will remain in full alignment #RoadtoBrexit pic.twitter.com/X5RoFXpmir The PM also claimed negotiators were ""close to an agreement"" on the terms of an implementation period, despite Mr Barnier warning this week that it was still not a given. And she struck a conciliatory tone by saying neither side would get ""exactly what we want"" from the talks, and signalling Britain would not fight losing EU passporting rights. On the contentious issue of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), Mrs May said its jurisdiction in Britain ""must end"". She called for a third party court to be set up that would resolve trade disputes, instead. Despite her efforts to quell fears of a hard border in Ireland, she accidentally began a sentence: ""To achieve a hard border-."" She then corrected herself: ""To avoid a hard border‚Ä¶"" Mrs May backed ""new technology"" to help keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic as 'soft' as possible. The speech was well received by her confidence and supply partners the DUP, with the party's leader Arlene Foster ""particularly welcoming"" a commitment to ""strengthen"" the UK union. The EU's chief negotiator also ""welcomed"" Mrs May's words. Michel Barnier said: ""Clarity about the UK leaving the single market and customs union and recognition of trade-offs will inform EU Council guidelines re: a future free trade agreement."" Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson posed with thumbs up and a copy of the speech, having been stranded in Hungary due to the snow. But not everyone in Europe was content. Manfred Weber, a key ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and chair of the biggest political group in the European Parliament, which will have to sign off the final deal, said the speech made him ""even more concerned"". ""I don't see how we could reach an agreement on Brexit if the UK government continues to bury its head in the sand like this,"" he said. Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, also claimed there was ""nothing new"" on preventing a hard border. Mrs May's speech was meant to conclude a mini-series by ministers. However another one, by Chancellor Philip Hammond on hopes for a financial services deal, was announced for next week."

2018-03-02,"If scriptwriters at Universal Studios, Disney or Twentieth Century Fox were to come up with a storyline of the kind engulfing each of their parent companies just now, it would be dismissed as too far-fetched.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180302230229/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-cabbie-convinced-comcasts-boss-to-reach-for-the-sky-11269684,"The parents of the trio - Comcast, Walt Disney Co and 21st Century Fox - find themselves embroiled in a multi-billion dollar tangle at the centre of which sits Sky plc, the owner of Sky News. In December 2016, Fox said it wanted to buy the remaining 61% of Sky that it does not already own. That deal has been snarled in the UK regulatory process with Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, due to rule by June on whether it should be allowed to go ahead. :: Comcast challenges Fox with ¬£22.1bn Sky bid interest Assuming it does, Sky would be taken over by Fox, before being sold on to Disney as part of a wider deal involving all of Fox's entertainment assets. At the time, Comcast, America's biggest cable operator, also expressed an interest in buying those assets from Fox. It was even thought to be prepared to pay more than Disney. But Rupert Murdoch, the executive co-chairman of Fox, calculated that Comcast would have a tougher time getting a deal past US competition regulators than Disney - and Comcast walked away. Another factor was that, with Mr Murdoch's family receiving shares as part-consideration, Disney shares were more attractive in view of Comcast's shareholder structure - which effectively gives the Roberts family, which founded the company, control of it. Since then, two things have happened. The first is that Comcast's board has, according to reports, given serious consideration to reviving its interest in Fox's entertainment assets. The second is that, in the recent round of auctions for live TV rights for the Premier League, Sky emerged with a great result. In the next three year cycle, from 2019-22, it will be paying ¬£200m less per season than in the current 2016-19 cycle. That has prompted some minority shareholders in Sky to argue that Fox needed to sweeten its terms from the 1075p-per-share it agreed to pay back in December 2016. They include Crispin Odey, one of the City's best-known fund managers and Elliott, a notoriously aggressive US hedge fund. Enter Comcast. The US giant has today waded in with a 1250p-a-share offer that values the whole of Sky at ¬£22.1bn - compared with the ¬£18.5bn Fox was prepared to pay. It has said that, while it would like to own all of the shares in Sky, it will be satisfied with 50% plus one share and that its takeover is not dependent on Fox selling its existing 39.1% stake in Sky. Crucially, it is promising to increase Sky's investment in UK TV and film production, as well as pledging to continue broadcasting news under the Sky brand - a guarantee Fox, too, has made along with promises to maintain the independence of Sky News. Comcast's intervention raises a number of questions for investors. The first is how Fox will respond. Sky's share price has shot up by more than a fifth, to 1330p, implying that investors expect Fox to come back with a higher offer. But Mr Murdoch might yet decide to alter the terms of his existing deal with Disney to exclude Sky from the sale. The second is Comcast's motivation. Is it simply interested in Sky, as it says, as a platform to grow its business in Europe? Or is this part of an attempt to get Fox back around the negotiating table in order to try and gazump Disney? A third question is how Disney itself reacts. It might choose to launch a takeover bid of its own for Sky which it, too, covets as a way of reducing its dependence on the US. Both Disney and Comcast have different reasons for wanting to do these deals. In the case of Disney, it wishes not only to widen its geographic spread, but also to acquire - with Fox's entertainment assets - a greater array of film and TV assets with which to take on internet giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. In the case of Comcast, it too wishes to diversify away from the US, where cable subscribers have been ""cord-cutting"" in their droves. In response it has launched its own ""over-the-top"" streaming service, just as Disney and Fox have with Hulu, to try and get around this - but that service requires content. Hence the interest in both Sky and in Fox's entertainment assets. One fascinating dimension to this story - again, back to the Hollywood analogy - is the cast of characters it brings together. Mr Murdoch built Fox into one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, founding Sky along the way, but also owns - via News Corporation - some of the world's most famous newspaper titles, including The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post. It all started from a single newspaper in Adelaide and several members of Mr Murdoch's family have gone on to be executives either at Fox, Sky or News Corp. Comcast, too, is very much a family concern. Now the world's biggest broadcasting and cable television company, following its 2011 takeover of NBC Universal and its 2016 acquisition of Dreamworks Animation, it was built by Ralph Roberts from a single cable company in Tupelo, Mississippi. His son Brian is now chairman and chief executive of Comcast and the Roberts family exerts control of the business. And there is history, too, between Mr Roberts and Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive. Comcast sought to buy Disney in 2004 for $54bn. Disney rejected the offer and Comcast walked away. Mr Iger, who has called Sky a ""crown jewel"", scuppered Mr Roberts's ambitions on that occasion. It would be ironic were Mr Roberts to now do the same to him. The final characters, were this being turned into a film, would be the ordinary members of the public. Mr Roberts told reporters this morning that, during a recent visit to London, a taxi driver had spoken to him favourably and in detail about Sky in comparison with rival cable service Virgin Media. He was then impressed by a demonstration of the Sky Q service in a shopping mall by a Sky sales rep. Those two events, apparently, helped convince him to bid."

One motorist said a gritter ""slid sideways"" and got stuck in the snow itself. Avon and Somerset Police said about 40 people travelling from London had been among those stranded through the night. They included a baby, elderly and vulnerable people, and some requiring medication. Thomas Hamilton said he left his home in London at 6pm and was heading to a friend's farm when he got caught up, coming to a ""standstill at the start of the A303 around midnight"". He was only 10 miles from his destination when he got stuck. Wiltshire Council has described it as a ""major incident"", urging people not to travel in the area. South Western Railway said it would be closing down by 8pm on Friday, and urged people not to travel. High on the Pennines on the M62, meanwhile, the military was called in to help rescue vehicles. Police said the motorway was closed ""indefinitely"" between Rochdale in Lancashire and Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. Drivers and passengers spent up to 18 hours on the carriageway, where temperatures were below zero and wind speeds reached 90mph. Volunteers from Milnrow, Rochdale, took hot drinks, food and blankets to those left stranded, and Butterworth Hall was used as an emergency centre. Its chair, Irene Davidson, told Sky News conditions had been ""horrendous"", and that staff from the Highways Agency deserved ""medals"". Ms Davidson said she and her fellow volunteers fed as many people as they could, before having to turn back when conditions became ""too treacherous"". Those arriving at the hall were ""frozen"" and ""near to years"", she added, their phones not working because batteries had run out. But not everyone has been so community-spirited. Rochdale Council tweeted: ""Heard reports someone in a grey transit-type van is trying to cash in on people stranded in traffic near the M62 motorway by selling cups of tea for ¬£1. These are not council staff and we (and volunteers) are handing out drinks for free.""

Kent Police said it had received more than 100 calls to crashes in just 30 minutes. In Devon, a gritter overturned on the A379 near Shaldon. Devon County Council said that ""fortunately"", no one had been harmed. The freezing weather has left several people dead and hundreds stranded amid closed roads and cancelled flights.

""I am sure that you planned not just the killing of one person but rather mass murder. ""In my judgement, I must pass an indeterminate sentence. Your actions show a total disregard for human life. ""I cannot foresee a time when I can be confident that your danger will have ended or decreased sufficiently to enable me to pass a determinate or extended sentence."" Gunton, who turns 18 in April and suffers from an autism spectrum disorder, was arrested at his home in the Llantrisant area of south Wales on 30 June last year. The judge told the court that police had also found a ""terrorist's kit"" in his room: a rucksack with a knife, hammer and suicide note inside. In the note, Gunton had called himself a ""soldier of ISIS"". Instagram posts showed that Gunton had planned to launch his attack on 30 June, the day he was arrested. The boy had used Google Maps to research Cardiff's Castle quarter, a shopping centre, the city's Central Library and the New Theatre, the court heard. He had also conducted ""virtual surveillance"" of targets such as a Justin Bieber concert at Principality Stadium. Gunton was also convicted of two counts of encouraging terrorism by posting extremist material on Instagram, and two charges of possessing Islamic State propaganda magazines. Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Lloyd Gunton's behaviour over many months leaves no doubt that he intended to kill and maim as many people as possible in an attack reminiscent of the incident on Westminster Bridge. ""He was also posting extremist content online that could have encouraged others to commit terrorist acts and downloading instructions on how to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks."""
2018-03-02,Michael Gove has warned water companies that they must change their conduct or face tougher regulation.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180302230229/https://news.sky.com/story/michael-gove-water-companies-must-clean-up-their-act-or-face-tougher-regulation-11272867,"In a speech to bosses of the UK's main water suppliers, Mr Gove said the industry had not been ""acting sufficiently in the public interest"". He said: ""Some companies have been playing the system for the benefit of wealthy managers and owners, at the expense of consumers and the environment. ""They have shielded themselves from scrutiny, hidden behind complex financial structures, avoided paying taxes, have rewarded the already well-off, kept charges higher than they needed to be and allowed leaks, pollution and other failures to persist for far too long."" And he claimed he was ""prepared to consider changes to the regulatory framework"" if companies continued to ""drag their feet"". :: Thames Water looking to sluice away bad reputation The Environment Secretary said that shareholders of the nine large English regional water and sewage companies received ¬£18.1bn between 2007 and 2016. That represented almost all of the ¬£18.8bn profit made by the companies, of which three paid no tax last year. One company, Thames Water, has paid no tax for the last decade, Mr Gove said. He claimed some companies had used ""multi-layered corporate structures of dizzying complexity"" and ""financial engineering"" to minimise tax obligations and reduce transparency. Responding to Mr Gove's comment at the same conference, Water UK chief executive Michael Roberts said water companies had delivered major improvements since the 1990s. He added: ""Operating in the public interest means operating to the highest standards. 'Doing nothing' is not a viable option. ""Thankfully, I do not believe that 'doing nothing' accurately captures the current mood of water companies. ""In fact, companies are already working with others to reinforce how we operate in the public interest, through our actions and words."" Labour has pledged to renationalise railways, water, energy and the Royal Mail, partly in response to similar concerns over large profits and low taxes that Mr Gove highlighted in his speech. The Environment Secretary acknowledged that industry conduct had increased public support for nationalisation. But he said he considered it a ""terrible backward step"", saying he believes private markets are the best way to meet customer needs."
2018-03-02,"The UK steel industry has warned Donald Trump's plans for steep US tariffs on steel imports would ""seriously undermine"" its competitiveness.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180302230229/https://news.sky.com/story/trump-steel-tariff-plan-sparks-wall-street-jitters-and-trade-war-fears-11272238,"The announcement by the US President sparked an immediate threat of ""countermeasures"" from Europe and sent world stock markets plunging amid fears of a global trade war and higher costs for US manufacturers. Mr Trump tweeted ""trade wars are good"" hours after explaining that his measures were a response to decades of ""disgraceful"" unfair trade policies - the US steel industry suffering from cheap Chinese steel coming on to the market, driving down prices. The President did not specify whether his plan would apply worldwide or just to major world players such as China and India but it was enough for UK producers to warn of a devastating impact if the country was targeted. The announcement of proposals for a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% levy on aluminium came despite apparent internal White House wrangling over the strategy. Mr Trump summoned US industry executives on Thursday and told them: ""What's been allowed to go on for decades is disgraceful. ""You will have protection for the first time in a long while and you're going to regrow your industries. ""We're going to build our steel industry back and our aluminium industry back."" Mr Trump had earlier tweeted that many US industries had been ""decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy"". Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! Richard Warren, head of policy at UK Steel, responded: ""Whilst we still await the precise detail of these measures, and there is still a lingering hope that these tariffs may not target the UK and EU, President Trump's comments do indicate the introduction of blanket measures to restrict the import of all steel imports regardless of their origin. ""This would be a unilateral, and extremely blunt, approach to what is a complex global problem of overcapacity in the steel sector. ""This requires a coordinated global approach. Whilst we all too well understand the frustrations of the US sector, measures such as these smack of short-termism, protectionism and would be rife with unintended consequences for global trade and for the users of steel in the US. ""At a UK level, our sector exports some ¬£360m worth of high-value steel products into the US each year, almost 15% of our exports. ""These measures, would seriously undermine our ability to compete in this market."" The industry body also warned of risks to competitiveness without any tariffs on UK exports because it expected that steel diverted from the US would find its way to other markets, including Britain. A steel trade war could prove catastrophic for UK producers at a time when the sector is still recovering from its own crisis - also created by increased global production - that saw a flood of cheap steel from China force prices down. The Unite union demanded Government action to ensure there was no impact on the UK. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We don't yet know if the UK will be included in any tariffs. ""We are working across Government to get to the bottom of this."" European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker also reacted with horror to the threat, saying the move appeared to be a ""blatant intervention to protect US industry"" and ""could only aggravate matters"". Shares in American steel makers rose in response to the tariff announcement but manufacturers such as Boeing fell on fears their costs would be hit by the decision, helping drive the wider stock market sharply lower. The Dow Jones closed 1.7% down on Thursday while Asian markets later followed suit with Japan's Nikkei shedding 2.5% on Friday. China's main Shanghai Composite was just 0.6% lower while the FTSE 100 followed the risk-off mood - shedding 1% by lunchtime. Imposing the tariffs is likely to escalate tensions with China and other trading partners, and critics fear they will retaliate with trade penalties of their own. China has already threatened to curb imports of US soybeans in retaliation while the European Union has said it will consider action as well. Senator Pat Roberts, who chairs the Senate's agriculture committee, said: ""Every time you do this, you get a retaliation."" US car makers and other companies that use steel or aluminium could also be hit, as the tariffs would push up their costs."

In its 14th annual report, it warns of a ""surging threat"" of right-wing plots in the same week that a senior counter-terror officer revealed that four extreme right-wing plots were foiled last year. Its chief executive Nick Lowles said the UK was facing a ""surging threat"" and that he feared more violence in 2018. He said: ""This rising terrorist threat is the consequence of the increasingly confrontational tone of online far-right rhetoric, combined with the almost universal extreme-right belief that a civil war between Islam and the West is coming, as well as the growing influence of hard-line European Nazis living in the UK."" The report also highlighted the case of Finsbury Park terrorist Darren Osborne. It emerged at his trial that he had been influenced by extreme right-wing propaganda online. :: Finsbury Park terror attack: 'Brainwashed' killer had online links to far right :: Neo-Nazi guilty of plotting gay pride machete attack Security Minister Ben Wallace said the report ""shines a light on the growth of intolerance across the UK and Europe"" and said that the government's Prevent strategy was working. He added the Government could take further action of proscribing groups. The proscription means that being a member of or inviting support for a violent extremist organisation is a criminal offence, carrying a sentence of up to 10 years' imprisonment. He added: ""This Government did not hesitate to proscribe a neo-Nazi group, National Action, when the evidence was enough and we will not hesitate to take further action."" National Action was made a banned group in December 2016. A major Government review of last year's terrorism attacks recommended a new approach by MI5 to managing domestic extremism, particularly extreme right-wing groups, where their activity meets the definition of terrorism."

Three other men, arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of manslaughter, are still being questioned. They are from the East Midlands, East Anglia and the North West. Officers have refused to comment on reports that the blast, shortly after 7pm on Sunday, was caused by an illegal alcohol distillery. The explosion was followed by a large fire. Once the flames were out, human remains were recovered from the ruins of the building, which contained a supermarket and a two-storey flat. The victims have been named as Mary Rajoobeer, 46, and her two sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17. Also killed were 18-year-old Leah Beth Reek, who was Shane's girlfriend, and 22-year-old Viktorija Ljevleva. Another five people were taken to hospital. Specialist officers are continuing to sift through the wreckage. The scene is expected to remain cordoned off for several more days at least."

Two men were taken, unconscious, to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi on Sunday, the Daily Nation reported. Both were admitted to ward 5A, which covers general surgery and trauma patients without fractures. One needed surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain, while the other simply required nursing and medication to heal a swelling to his head, caused by trauma. The clot had been spotted on a CT scan, but after the patients' identification tags got mixed up, the wrong man was wheeled into surgery, the newspaper said. Surgeons only discovered the mistake after failing to find a clot in the brain of the man whose head they had opened. Fortunately, both patients are said to be in a good condition. The one who had the clot might not now need surgery because his condition has improved significantly. The Daily Nation said it was not identifying the two men to respect their privacy. The hospital's chief operating officer, Lily Koros, said in a statement that the neurosurgeon, ward nurse, theatre receiving nurse and anaesthetist had been suspended. ""The management has suspended the admission rights of a neurosurgery registrar and issued him with a show-cause letter for apparently operating on the wrong patient,"" Ms Koros said."

Mr Carney agreed that the growth of cryptocurrencies had followed the pattern of previous financial bubbles. He said: ""It has all the hallmarks of a bubble.

But Mr Carney said the blockchain technology that has been developed in parallel with new currencies was ""exciting and interesting""."

Warwick Crown Court heard the 53-year-old, who worked there along with his former partner, wanted to go out in what prosecutors called ""a blaze of glory"" after struggling with the breakdown of their relationship. After storming in, the ""angry and volatile"" Clarke - who had drunk vodka and taken painkillers before the incident - seized two hostages. Horrified customers, including children as young as five, ran for their safety. The court heard that during the ordeal - which did not end until 6.30pm - he put the shotgun to the back of a man's head and told him: ""If you don't go, you are not going to see tomorrow."" He also told his friend and work colleague Josh Steedman that he would ""decapitate"" his ex-partner's new boyfriend if he showed up at the venue. Clarke used the male hostages as ""human shields"" when confronted by armed police, telling them that one false move would mean they all ended up ""like spaghetti, because our body parts will be all over the floor"", the trial was told. In mitigation, Colin Charvill admitted that Clarke ""was acting in a most bizarre way"", but said he ""did not intend to physically hurt anyone"" and wanted to engineer a situation in which he could talk to his ex-partner. Sentencing Clarke, judge Andrew Lockhart QC told him: ""On the afternoon of Sunday 22 October, you brought terror to the MFA Bowl. ""Your selfish actions have deeply affected many people. ""You wanted to put into effect your dreadful scheme to commit as you said 'suicide by cop'. ""It was planned hostage-taking in a place you knew where children would be present."" Clarke had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of false imprisonment, possessing a prohibited firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and possessing a samurai sword and a knife."
2018-03-02,Not since Muhammad Ali fought Joe Frazier had there been such a tough brawl to predict than that of this year's Oscars.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180302230229/https://news.sky.com/story/the-oscars-will-a-brit-be-crowned-best-actor-and-should-they-be-11272972,"What started off as a sure win for Gary Oldman for his portrayal of former British prime minister Winston Churchill now seems challenged by not one, not two, but three other stars. One of them, and the strongest challenger by far, is Daniel Day-Lewis in his last-ever (he says) role as irritable couturier Reynolds Woodcock in Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread. As of 3pm on Friday, odds were still largely in favour of Oldman picking up the award, but controversy surrounding the actor's past threatens the podium. Oldman was accused of domestic violence in 2001 by his then wife Donya Fiorentino who, in an interview with the New York Daily News, said Oldman had beaten her with a telephone. However, charges were never filed and the actor denied any accusations, calling them ""lies and half-truths"". The issue was forgotten, only to emerge again years later, when the actor decided to tackle every controversial issue on the agenda in an interview with Playboy magazine. From defending Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade - ""The policeman who arrested him has never used the word 'n*****' or 'that f******* Jew'?"" - to regretting living in a time when he no longer can call American politician Nancy Pelosi ""a f****** useless c***"", Oldman's shocking interview gave him bad press in Hollywood. This wasn't even that long ago, and the actor seems again to be reaching for the statuette. But in the #MeToo era, this could prove problematic. The Academy may have been slow to recognise its mistake - being too focused on keeping James Franco out of the list - but it would be wise to avoid giving Oldman the prize if it is a politically correct ceremony they want. That substantially increases the odds for first time contenders Timothee Chalamet and Daniel Kaluuya. The two rising stars have been praised for their roles as a gay teenager and a black man running scared from white supremacists. Needless to say, both topics would fare far better with the critics, who are expecting this ceremony to reflect the winds of change flurried by the #MeToo campaign and the Time's Up movement. Day-Lewis, on the other hand, has in his favour the fact that he is retiring from cinema forever (he says), and this could be the Academy's last shot an honouring one of the greatest artists of our generation. It also happens to be the year's best role - but that's not how Oscars are won. Not anymore."

""I opened the passenger door and knelt in the snow to deliver the baby."" The Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS) land-based crew arrived soon after the birth, after initially being unable to locate the family on the side of the road. A regular North East Ambulance crew then arrived, keeping the newborn warm, cutting the cord and taking her on to Darlington Memorial Hospital for further care. Sienna is now getting plenty of skin-to-skin contact with her mum Daniella, as well as sleeping on a special mattress filled with warm water to regulate her temperature.

Jamie Ramstein said cycling through snowy days in his job as a medical courier was ""non-stop risk"" and sometimes ""really dangerous"". The 31-year-old added: ""I had a taxi nearly knock me off my bike and an ambulance rush past me. My bike parts started to freeze... My vision was reduced by about 75%. ""On my way home I just started crying. It was so much emotion and relief."" :: Workers' rights: Who is right? Mr Ramstein said he loves his job, which he has had for four years, and that despite the tough conditions his day riding in the snow was enjoyable. The fact he would miss his day's pay of ¬£100 if he did not cycle was his main reason for venturing out. ""I basically can't afford to take a day off at the moment,"" he explained. Most cycle couriers in London are paid a rate per job or per day - an arrangement that means they are able to decline or accept work, and be flexible in choosing the hours they are on the road. Many say this means more freedom for workers, allowing them to be their own boss and work for a range of different businesses. Others praise companies such as Deliveroo or Uber for creating jobs that otherwise would not exist. However, recent reports and lawsuits have highlighted the lack of benefits for workers who are not officially classed as employees - including sick pay. Megan Brown, a courier for Deliveroo and a representative for the IWGB union, said the lack of protection forces workers to make tough decisions between safety and money. ""It's a case of assessing, on the day, how brave I'm feeling,"" the 25-year-old told Sky News. ""I want to work, if only to stop my worries about money. But I have to look after my safety.""

It had issued the alert 24 hours earlier as the extreme weather combined with Storm Emma to bring horrific conditions to most parts of the UK on Thursday. :: LIVE: Hundreds stranded on road and rail The warning was essentially an appeal for fresh within-day supplies - which, according to energy data firm ICIS, helped tip wholesale costs to their highest level for 20 years at 350p per therm on Thursday afternoon. Without those new supplies, factories could have been asked to scale back their work to ensure home heating and power was maintained. :: Perfect storm for gas as energy demand surges Experts believed that the surge in demand witnessed on Thursday would continue to ease into the weekend, though National Grid said it was not complacent. ""The 'gas deficit warning' issued yesterday (Thursday) was withdrawn at 4.45am this morning and we are currently not expecting to issue another today,"" it said. ""The market has continued to respond over the last 24 hours and we have seen an increase of supplies into the network. ""As the extremely cold weather continues we expect to see high demand on the gas network, so we are continuing to monitor developments closely. ""Protecting customer supplies is always our first priority and we would like to reassure them that this high demand has not affected their domestic gas supplies."" A lack of gas storage and pipeline disruption, especially in Norway, have hit imports and exacerbated the price spike - forcing extra costs on energy providers though most will have hedging strategies to limit the damage. E.ON - one of the so-called ""big six"" household suppliers - became the first energy supplier to announce bill increases since the weather hit. It said on Thursday night it was removing a number of discounts from April as part of industry efforts to make tariffs easier to understand though critics of the sector said it amounted to a rise in bills of between ¬£20 and ¬£50 annually. Kevin Pratt, consumer affairs expert at the price comparison service MoneySuperMarket, said: ""Energy bills will go up for many of its customers. ""With the UK in the grip of its most severe weather in decades, it's devastating news for customers who will see their prices jump from April onwards. ""Most importantly, customers on standard variable tariffs with E.ON or any supplier should be aware that, if they shop around, they'll probably find a fixed rate tariff that could save them a substantial amount each year - maybe ¬£250 or more. ""That's a level of saving far beyond that promised by the forthcoming Government price cap."""

On the contentious issue of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), Mrs May said its jurisdiction in Britain ""must end"". She called for a third party court to be set up that would resolve trade disputes, instead. Despite her efforts to quell fears of a hard border in Ireland, she accidentally began a sentence: ""To achieve a hard border-."" She then corrected herself: ""To avoid a hard border‚Ä¶"" Mrs May backed ""new technology"" to help keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic as 'soft' as possible. The speech was well received by her confidence and supply partners the DUP, with the party's leader Arlene Foster ""particularly welcoming"" a commitment to ""strengthen"" the UK union. The EU's chief negotiator also ""welcomed"" Mrs May's words. Michel Barnier said: ""Clarity about the UK leaving the single market and customs union and recognition of trade-offs will inform EU Council guidelines re: a future free trade agreement."" Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson posed with thumbs up and a copy of the speech, having been stranded in Hungary due to the snow. But not everyone in Europe was content. Manfred Weber, a key ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and chair of the biggest political group in the European Parliament, which will have to sign off the final deal, said the speech made him ""even more concerned"". ""I don't see how we could reach an agreement on Brexit if the UK government continues to bury its head in the sand like this,"" he said. Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, also claimed there was ""nothing new"" on preventing a hard border. Mrs May's speech was meant to conclude a mini-series by ministers. However another one, by Chancellor Philip Hammond on hopes for a financial services deal, was announced for next week."

2018-03-03,"For decades weather forecasts have been reserved for government agencies like the Met Office or NOAA in the US, using huge supercomputers to crunch satellite, radar and other data.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180303233723/https://news.sky.com/story/tech-startups-use-cloud-computing-for-better-weather-forecasts-11273996,"But a wave of tech startups is opening up weather predictions, thanks to cheap components and cloud computing power, which could make forecasting much more accurate. ""The world observing system is under an enormous amount of pressure and I would go as far to say inadequate to deliver the necessary data for accurate weather forecasts,"" says Peter Platzer, the chief executive of Spire. Spire, founded in 2012, runs its own constellation of satellites - 58 small cubesats in orbit all around the globe monitoring the temperature, pressure and moisture of the air. It sells that data to big weather agencies including NOAA. Mr Platzer adds: ""For weather, the world is starved for information and that in turn starves weather forecasting models for the much needed input to create accurate forecasts. ""And the reason why we don't have enough data is that the global observing system is shrinking, is driven by technology that was built at the same time."" Others are taking a terrestrial approach. ClimaCell, founded in 2015, takes meteorological data from communications networks on the ground, like mobile phone networks, and combines it with radar and satellite data. :: Sky Views: Weather forecasts - 'one of mankind's greatest creations' ""We're looking at multiple ways to sense the environment using software only,"" ClimaCell's CEO Shimon Elkabetz says, explaining that its sensors can spot rain and snow that radar might miss. Then it comes up with a six-hour forecast. The idea is to create a bottom up weather report, rather than top down. Other startups up like Jupiter, Earth Networks, Understory and Riskpulse are combining sensors and data analytics to deliver new types of weather reports. :: Flood risks and black ice alerts follow Storm Emma's snow Two things have driven the boom. First, cheap, capable components - the result of the mobile phone revolution started by the iPhone in 2007. That's true for ground-based sensors but also helpful for building satellites that are much smaller than traditional ones. The CubeSat standard of 10cm3 modules, which emerged in 1999, has also driven satellite innovation. Second, abundant computing power available on the cloud from giants like Amazon and Google means small companies can tackle weather. ""Meteorological startups are by definition a data intensive startup,"" Mr Elkabetz says. Advances in machine learning may spur further improvements. According to Mr Platzer: ""I firmly believe a step change is happening. ""It's somewhat absurd that we have built computers that can be tuned to beat humans at every single game there is but we still can't forecast the weather and prepare people that there's going to be 14 inches of snow."""

The helicopter operated by Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters crashed in a section of the Grand Canyon outside the national park where air tours are not as highly regulated. Mr Udall, 31, was on honeymoon with his wife Ellie Milward. The newlyweds both died in hospital, with just days between them. Their friends, Britons Becky Dobson, her boyfriend Stuart Hill and his brother Jason Hill, died at the crash scene. The Udalls are asking for in excess of $195,000 (¬£141,000) in damages, as well as punitive damages and a jury trial. Their lawyer Gary Robb said: ""Mr and Mrs Udall deeply grieve for the loss of their son but their primary motivation now is to prevent anyone else from having to suffer the deadly burn injuries as their son did. ""If this helicopter had been properly equipped with a crash-resistant fuel system, it would have allowed this young man to walk away injury-free."" Papillon directors Brenda Halvorson and Elling Halvorson, president Geoff Edlund and chief operating officer John Becker are among those named in the lawsuit. The lawsuit comes after it was announced Papillon would fit 40 of the crash-resistant tanks to its fleet in the wake of the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the cause of the crash with a preliminary report concluding the helicopter made at least two 360-degree turns before crashing. Aviation experts said that indicates the tail rotor wasn't operating properly. Investigators will interview witnesses, survivors, the helicopter operator and manufacturer before issuing a full report which is expected sometime in 2019."

2018-03-03,"If scriptwriters at Universal Studios, Disney or Twentieth Century Fox were to come up with a storyline of the kind engulfing each of their parent companies just now, it would be dismissed as too far-fetched.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180303233723/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-cabbie-convinced-comcasts-boss-to-reach-for-the-sky-11269684,"The parents of the trio - Comcast, Walt Disney Co and 21st Century Fox - find themselves embroiled in a multi-billion dollar tangle at the centre of which sits Sky plc, the owner of Sky News. In December 2016, Fox said it wanted to buy the remaining 61% of Sky that it does not already own. That deal has been snarled in the UK regulatory process with Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, due to rule by June on whether it should be allowed to go ahead. :: Comcast challenges Fox with ¬£22.1bn Sky bid interest Assuming it does, Sky would be taken over by Fox, before being sold on to Disney as part of a wider deal involving all of Fox's entertainment assets. At the time, Comcast, America's biggest cable operator, also expressed an interest in buying those assets from Fox. It was even thought to be prepared to pay more than Disney. But Rupert Murdoch, the executive co-chairman of Fox, calculated that Comcast would have a tougher time getting a deal past US competition regulators than Disney - and Comcast walked away. Another factor was that, with Mr Murdoch's family receiving shares as part-consideration, Disney shares were more attractive in view of Comcast's shareholder structure - which effectively gives the Roberts family, which founded the company, control of it. Since then, two things have happened. The first is that Comcast's board has, according to reports, given serious consideration to reviving its interest in Fox's entertainment assets. The second is that, in the recent round of auctions for live TV rights for the Premier League, Sky emerged with a great result. In the next three year cycle, from 2019-22, it will be paying ¬£200m less per season than in the current 2016-19 cycle. That has prompted some minority shareholders in Sky to argue that Fox needed to sweeten its terms from the 1075p-per-share it agreed to pay back in December 2016. They include Crispin Odey, one of the City's best-known fund managers and Elliott, a notoriously aggressive US hedge fund. Enter Comcast. The US giant has today waded in with a 1250p-a-share offer that values the whole of Sky at ¬£22.1bn - compared with the ¬£18.5bn Fox was prepared to pay. It has said that, while it would like to own all of the shares in Sky, it will be satisfied with 50% plus one share and that its takeover is not dependent on Fox selling its existing 39.1% stake in Sky. Crucially, it is promising to increase Sky's investment in UK TV and film production, as well as pledging to continue broadcasting news under the Sky brand - a guarantee Fox, too, has made along with promises to maintain the independence of Sky News. Comcast's intervention raises a number of questions for investors. The first is how Fox will respond. Sky's share price has shot up by more than a fifth, to 1330p, implying that investors expect Fox to come back with a higher offer. But Mr Murdoch might yet decide to alter the terms of his existing deal with Disney to exclude Sky from the sale. The second is Comcast's motivation. Is it simply interested in Sky, as it says, as a platform to grow its business in Europe? Or is this part of an attempt to get Fox back around the negotiating table in order to try and gazump Disney? A third question is how Disney itself reacts. It might choose to launch a takeover bid of its own for Sky which it, too, covets as a way of reducing its dependence on the US. Both Disney and Comcast have different reasons for wanting to do these deals. In the case of Disney, it wishes not only to widen its geographic spread, but also to acquire - with Fox's entertainment assets - a greater array of film and TV assets with which to take on internet giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. In the case of Comcast, it too wishes to diversify away from the US, where cable subscribers have been ""cord-cutting"" in their droves. In response it has launched its own ""over-the-top"" streaming service, just as Disney and Fox have with Hulu, to try and get around this - but that service requires content. Hence the interest in both Sky and in Fox's entertainment assets. One fascinating dimension to this story - again, back to the Hollywood analogy - is the cast of characters it brings together. Mr Murdoch built Fox into one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, founding Sky along the way, but also owns - via News Corporation - some of the world's most famous newspaper titles, including The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post. It all started from a single newspaper in Adelaide and several members of Mr Murdoch's family have gone on to be executives either at Fox, Sky or News Corp. Comcast, too, is very much a family concern. Now the world's biggest broadcasting and cable television company, following its 2011 takeover of NBC Universal and its 2016 acquisition of Dreamworks Animation, it was built by Ralph Roberts from a single cable company in Tupelo, Mississippi. His son Brian is now chairman and chief executive of Comcast and the Roberts family exerts control of the business. And there is history, too, between Mr Roberts and Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive. Comcast sought to buy Disney in 2004 for $54bn. Disney rejected the offer and Comcast walked away. Mr Iger, who has called Sky a ""crown jewel"", scuppered Mr Roberts's ambitions on that occasion. It would be ironic were Mr Roberts to now do the same to him. The final characters, were this being turned into a film, would be the ordinary members of the public. Mr Roberts told reporters this morning that, during a recent visit to London, a taxi driver had spoken to him favourably and in detail about Sky in comparison with rival cable service Virgin Media. He was then impressed by a demonstration of the Sky Q service in a shopping mall by a Sky sales rep. Those two events, apparently, helped convince him to bid."

The two people killed were not students or staff, police said. There were no other injuries. On Saturday police arrested 19-year-old suspect James Eric Davis Jr following an intensive day-long search that included more than 100 police officers, some heavily armed in camouflage uniforms. Davis Jr was arrested without incident after an individual spotted him on a train passing through the north end of campus shortly after midnight. CMU Police Lieutenant Larry Klaus said officers had contact with the suspect the previous evening, when he had been taken to hospital ""due to what police believe might have been a drug-type incident, an overdose or bad reaction to drugs"". The university identified the two dead as Davis' mother Diva Davis and father James Davis Sr, a part-time police officer in the Chicago suburb of Bellwood. A spokesman for Davis's school district in Illinois said he had graduated high school in 2016. Halie Byron, 20, who lives about 10 minutes' walk from Campbell Hall, described how she had locked herself in her house during the shooting. She said: ""It's scary thinking about how easy a shooter can come into a college campus anywhere - a classroom, a library."" Parents hoping to collect their children for spring break were told to go to a local hotel instead. Jordyn Hermani, editor of Central Michigan Life, said on Facebook Live on Friday afternoon: ""The university is being evacuated building by building, except for the fourth floor of Campbell Hall, as it's a crime scene."" University president George Ross said: ""This has been a tragic day...The hurting will go on for a while."" Central Michigan University has some 23,000 students in Mount Pleasant, about 70 miles north of Lansing, the state's capital. The shooting comes two weeks after 17 people were shot dead at a Florida high school, sparking a renewed debate over gun violence in the US."

He was convicted of preparing for terrorist acts after a nine-day trial at Birmingham Crown Court late last year, but today was given a life sentence, Judge Mark Wall QC told the court that Gunton had been ""within hours of committing an act of atrocity on the streets of Cardiff"". He added: ""It is not possible to estimate how many people would have been murdered or seriously injured by your actions, as the attack was foiled before you could undertake it. ""I am sure that you planned not just the killing of one person but rather mass murder. ""In my judgement, I must pass an indeterminate sentence. Your actions show a total disregard for human life. ""I cannot foresee a time when I can be confident that your danger will have ended or decreased sufficiently to enable me to pass a determinate or extended sentence."" Gunton, who turns 18 in April and suffers from an autism spectrum disorder, was arrested at his home in the Llantrisant area of south Wales on 30 June last year. The judge told the court that police had also found a ""terrorist's kit"" in his room: a rucksack with a knife, hammer and suicide note inside. In the note, Gunton had called himself a ""soldier of ISIS"". Instagram posts showed that Gunton had planned to launch his attack on 30 June, the day he was arrested. The boy had used Google Maps to research Cardiff's Castle quarter, a shopping centre, the city's Central Library and the New Theatre, the court heard. He had also conducted ""virtual surveillance"" of targets such as a Justin Bieber concert at Principality Stadium. Gunton was also convicted of two counts of encouraging terrorism by posting extremist material on Instagram, and two charges of possessing Islamic State propaganda magazines. Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Lloyd Gunton's behaviour over many months leaves no doubt that he intended to kill and maim as many people as possible in an attack reminiscent of the incident on Westminster Bridge. ""He was also posting extremist content online that could have encouraged others to commit terrorist acts and downloading instructions on how to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks."""
2018-03-03,Not since Muhammad Ali fought Joe Frazier had there been such a tough brawl to predict than that of this year's Oscars.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180303233723/https://news.sky.com/story/the-oscars-will-a-brit-be-crowned-best-actor-and-should-they-be-11272972,"What started off as a sure win for Gary Oldman for his portrayal of former British prime minister Winston Churchill now seems challenged by not one, not two, but three other stars. One of them, and the strongest challenger by far, is Daniel Day-Lewis in his last-ever (he says) role as irritable couturier Reynolds Woodcock in Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread. As of 3pm on Friday, odds were still largely in favour of Oldman picking up the award, but controversy surrounding the actor's past threatens the podium. Oldman was accused of domestic violence in 2001 by his then wife Donya Fiorentino who, in an interview with the New York Daily News, said Oldman had beaten her with a telephone. However, charges were never filed and the actor denied any accusations, calling them ""lies and half-truths"". The issue was forgotten, only to emerge again years later, when the actor decided to tackle every controversial issue on the agenda in an interview with Playboy magazine. From defending Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade - ""The policeman who arrested him has never used the word 'n*****' or 'that f******* Jew'?"" - to regretting living in a time when he no longer can call American politician Nancy Pelosi ""a f****** useless c***"", Oldman's shocking interview gave him bad press in Hollywood. This wasn't even that long ago, and the actor seems again to be reaching for the statuette. But in the #MeToo era, this could prove problematic. The Academy may have been slow to recognise its mistake - being too focused on keeping James Franco out of the list - but it would be wise to avoid giving Oldman the prize if it is a politically correct ceremony they want. That substantially increases the odds for first time contenders Timothee Chalamet and Daniel Kaluuya. The two rising stars have been praised for their roles as a gay teenager and a black man running scared from white supremacists. Needless to say, both topics would fare far better with the critics, who are expecting this ceremony to reflect the winds of change flurried by the #MeToo campaign and the Time's Up movement. Day-Lewis, on the other hand, has in his favour the fact that he is retiring from cinema forever (he says), and this could be the Academy's last shot an honouring one of the greatest artists of our generation. It also happens to be the year's best role - but that's not how Oscars are won. Not anymore."

The 31-year-old added: ""I had a taxi nearly knock me off my bike and an ambulance rush past me. My bike parts started to freeze... My vision was reduced by about 75%. ""On my way home I just started crying. It was so much emotion and relief."" :: Workers' rights: Who is right? Mr Ramstein said he loves his job, which he has had for four years, and that despite the tough conditions his day riding in the snow was enjoyable. The fact he would miss his day's pay of ¬£100 if he did not cycle was his main reason for venturing out. ""I basically can't afford to take a day off at the moment,"" he explained. Most cycle couriers in London are paid a rate per job or per day - an arrangement that means they are able to decline or accept work, and be flexible in choosing the hours they are on the road. Many say this means more freedom for workers, allowing them to be their own boss and work for a range of different businesses. Others praise companies such as Deliveroo or Uber for creating jobs that otherwise would not exist. However, recent reports and lawsuits have highlighted the lack of benefits for workers who are not officially classed as employees - including sick pay. Megan Brown, a courier for Deliveroo and a representative for the IWGB union, said the lack of protection forces workers to make tough decisions between safety and money. ""It's a case of assessing, on the day, how brave I'm feeling,"" the 25-year-old told Sky News. ""I want to work, if only to stop my worries about money. But I have to look after my safety."" She says she earns around ¬£8.30 an hour, adding: ""It's a pretty poor wage to be making these kind of decisions."" :: Gig economy firms ""let off the hook"" by report Deliveroo told Sky News that rider safety was a priority, and said in adverse conditions riders were offered bonus payments and given shorter distances to ride.

The large blast happened last Sunday evening on Hinckley Road - destroying a building that contained a supermarket and a two-storey flat. The victims have been named as Mary Rajoobeer, 46, and her two sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17. Also killed were 18-year-old Leah Beth Reek, who was Shane's girlfriend, and 22-year-old Viktorija Ljevleva. Two men who were arrested on Friday, both of them in their 30s and from East Anglia, are still being questioned by detectives. Leicestershire Police says they were detained on suspicion of conspiracy to cause an explosion and for offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The force has refused to comment on reports that the explosion may have been caused by an illegal alcohol distillery. Specialist officers are continuing to sift through the wreckage in search of clues, with the scene expected to remain cordoned off for several days at least."

Warwick Crown Court heard the 53-year-old, who worked there along with his former partner, wanted to go out in what prosecutors called ""a blaze of glory"" after struggling with the breakdown of their relationship. After storming in, the ""angry and volatile"" Clarke - who had drunk vodka and taken painkillers before the incident - seized two hostages. Horrified customers, including children as young as five, ran for their safety. The court heard that during the ordeal - which did not end until 6.30pm - he put the shotgun to the back of a man's head and told him: ""If you don't go, you are not going to see tomorrow."" He also told his friend and work colleague Josh Steedman that he would ""decapitate"" his ex-partner's new boyfriend if he showed up at the venue. Clarke used the male hostages as ""human shields"" when confronted by armed police, telling them that one false move would mean they all ended up ""like spaghetti, because our body parts will be all over the floor"", the trial was told. In mitigation, Colin Charvill admitted that Clarke ""was acting in a most bizarre way"", but said he ""did not intend to physically hurt anyone"" and wanted to engineer a situation in which he could talk to his ex-partner. Sentencing Clarke, judge Andrew Lockhart QC told him: ""On the afternoon of Sunday 22 October, you brought terror to the MFA Bowl. ""Your selfish actions have deeply affected many people. ""You wanted to put into effect your dreadful scheme to commit as you said 'suicide by cop'. ""It was planned hostage-taking in a place you knew where children would be present."" Clarke had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of false imprisonment, possessing a prohibited firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and possessing a samurai sword and a knife."

Listeria is a commonly found bacteria, and although most people do not fall ill after eating contaminated foods, it poses a serious threat to the vulnerable. At least 15 cases of listeriosis have emerged since the outbreak began last month - and further cases are expected to emerge because symptoms can take six weeks to develop. Dr Vicky Sheppeard, from New South Wales Health, said: ""All 15 cases are elderly people, and most of them have significant underlying health conditions. ""We can confirm that 13 of the 15 cases consumed rockmelon before the onset of their illness. People vulnerable to listeriosis should discard any rockmelon purchased before 1 March.""

His father Brett has told Sky News the family had been taking their eight-year-old son to Spain for private scans every four months since he underwent pioneering brain surgery in the Czech Republic in Autumn 2014. Specialists at Southampton General Hospital wanted to treat Ashya with intense chemotherapy and radiation, which his parents Naghmeh and Brett thought would leave their then-five-year-old with permanent disability. So without medical permission they fled to Spain where they had a home, with a view to going to Prague for proton therapy with Ashya. His mother and father were arrested by Spanish police at the request of the British authorities. But they were ultimately allowed to take Ashya to Prague. There, he underwent a series of short bursts of proton therapy, in which a concentrated beam of energy is used to kill the tumour without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. It worked, and Ashya has been recovering ever since. Ashya's father Brett told Sky News: ""Because of the treatment, with the recurrence of the cancer we kind of feel we're out of the woods with that now. ""All these worrying about his MRIs, and looking at him and thinking what sort of future he might have, you know how long or how short, we feel a lot more confident about the future we can actually start making a few plans now for the future. ""We feel at last we can... take a deep breath and move on a bit now."" From being unable to speak or walk unaided, he can now ride a bike and is going to school and playing football with his friends. Brett and Naghmeh had been wary of putting Ashya back into the care of the cancer team they had fallen out with so publicly three-and-a-half years ago. But now specialists in Southampton have reviewed the latest scans and reportedly confirm that so far there is no recurrence of the cancer in Ashya's brain."

He faces life in prison. His lawyer argued during the trial that he had been framed. Prosecutors said McCall snatched Eliza De La Cruz from her mother's arms at a Long Beach home on 3 January 2015 after his friend followed the woman home from a bus stop. McCall also shot the girl's mother, father and uncle with a gun using a silencer made from potatoes the court heard. All three survived. The baby was tied up in a plastic rubbish bag and dumped in a bin in San Diego County. She died from asphyxiation. McCall stole the infant because his friend needed a newborn after falsely telling her married boyfriend that she had had twins, prosecutors said. Weeks later McCall made a failed attempt to steal a four-month-old boy in an attack in which the mother was beaten with a baseball bat in an El Segundo motel, authorities said. The mother of the dead child testified during McCall's trial. Jacqueline Honorato said she pleaded with the kidnapper not to take her baby. She told the court: ""I couldn't do anything to stop him."" She tried to chase him and said she heard the voice of a woman telling the baby ""I'm your new mommy"". ""Did you ever see her the baby again?"" the prosecutor asked. In tears she replied: ""No."" McCall's friend, Giseleangelique Rene D'Milian, pleaded no contest to murder and attempted murder in January and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

The 25-year-old plotted to target landmarks including Big Ben, the Queen's Guard and Westfield shopping centre, using guns and a car packed with explosives. He groomed children as young as 11 at the Ripple Road mosque in Barking, showing them a violent IS video to give a more ""holistic"" view of the group and swearing them to secrecy, the court heard. One victim told police that Haque had aimed to gather an army of 300 men. ""Umar has been teaching us how to fight, do push-ups, given strength and within six years he was planning to do a big attack on London,"" the boy said. ""He's training us now so by the time I'm in Year 10 we will be physically strong enough to fight."" A self-styled teacher with no formal qualifications, Haque was able to access 250 young people over five years at two schools and at the Ripple Road Madrassa, potentially attempting to radicalise 110 of them. Parents at the fee-paying Lantern of Knowledge Islamic school in Leyton were ""horrified"" when it emerged that Haque had been teaching their children religious studies and PE. After he was found guilty, Haque shouted ""I want to say something"" and was dragged from the dock by officers. ""You will clearly see Islamic State establish itself in the Arabian peninsula and that droughts will affect Europe and America,"" he yelled. The plot was pursued with the help of others. Abuthaher Mamun, 19, and Muhammad Abid, 27, were convicted of attempting to help the would-be terrorist with fundraising and support. In bugged conversations, Haque was recorded telling conspirators they were ""here to cause terror"" and saying he had been inspired by the 2017 Westminster Bridge attack. ""We are a death squad sent by Allah and his messengers to avenge my Arab brothers' blood,"" he said. Handwritten notes presented in court revealed a hit list of targets including Transport for London, Shia Muslims, Heathrow, City banks, the media, embassies and Britain First. Giving evidence, Haque said the hoped-for attacks were ""hypothetical"", and the other accused men said they did not believe his terrorism intentions were serious. Commander Dean Haydon, of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command, said work was ongoing to safeguard 35 children who were ""almost paralysed with fear"" following Haque's attempts to radicalise them."

Weighing 10lbs 1oz, she arrived moments before assistance arrived, and was welcomed into the world by her dad who knelt by the car's passenger door to help his wife. Sienna is the couple's third child, and Mr Waring said: ""Having been present at the birth of our two other children, I just copied what I had seen then. ""I opened the passenger door and knelt in the snow to deliver the baby."" The Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS) land-based crew arrived soon after the birth, after initially being unable to locate the family on the side of the road. A regular North East Ambulance crew then arrived, keeping the newborn warm, cutting the cord and taking her on to Darlington Memorial Hospital for further care. Sienna is now getting plenty of skin-to-skin contact with her mum Daniella, as well as sleeping on a special mattress filled with warm water to regulate her temperature. Labour Ward sister, Anne Hodgson, said: ""We have no cause for concern and they're both doing really well despite their experience."""
2018-03-04,"For decades weather forecasts have been reserved for government agencies like the Met Office or NOAA in the US, using huge supercomputers to crunch satellite, radar and other data.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180305002448/https://news.sky.com/story/tech-startups-use-cloud-computing-for-better-weather-forecasts-11273996,"But a wave of tech startups is opening up weather predictions, thanks to cheap components and cloud computing power, which could make forecasting much more accurate. ""The world observing system is under an enormous amount of pressure and I would go as far to say inadequate to deliver the necessary data for accurate weather forecasts,"" says Peter Platzer, the chief executive of Spire. Spire, founded in 2012, runs its own constellation of satellites - 58 small cubesats in orbit all around the globe monitoring the temperature, pressure and moisture of the air. It sells that data to big weather agencies including NOAA. Mr Platzer adds: ""For weather, the world is starved for information and that in turn starves weather forecasting models for the much needed input to create accurate forecasts. ""And the reason why we don't have enough data is that the global observing system is shrinking, is driven by technology that was built at the same time."" Others are taking a terrestrial approach. ClimaCell, founded in 2015, takes meteorological data from communications networks on the ground, like mobile phone networks, and combines it with radar and satellite data. :: Sky Views: Weather forecasts - 'one of mankind's greatest creations' ""We're looking at multiple ways to sense the environment using software only,"" ClimaCell's CEO Shimon Elkabetz says, explaining that its sensors can spot rain and snow that radar might miss. Then it comes up with a six-hour forecast. The idea is to create a bottom up weather report, rather than top down. Other startups up like Jupiter, Earth Networks, Understory and Riskpulse are combining sensors and data analytics to deliver new types of weather reports. :: Flood risks and black ice alerts follow Storm Emma's snow Two things have driven the boom. First, cheap, capable components - the result of the mobile phone revolution started by the iPhone in 2007. That's true for ground-based sensors but also helpful for building satellites that are much smaller than traditional ones. The CubeSat standard of 10cm3 modules, which emerged in 1999, has also driven satellite innovation. Second, abundant computing power available on the cloud from giants like Amazon and Google means small companies can tackle weather. ""Meteorological startups are by definition a data intensive startup,"" Mr Elkabetz says. Advances in machine learning may spur further improvements. According to Mr Platzer: ""I firmly believe a step change is happening. ""It's somewhat absurd that we have built computers that can be tuned to beat humans at every single game there is but we still can't forecast the weather and prepare people that there's going to be 14 inches of snow."""

Helen Pankhurst, the great-granddaughter of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, also attended and said ""right across the board, in every sphere, there's work to be done"". She added: ""I think we are living in a world where there are some dinosaurs that are trying to take us back. ""And there are those that are moving together, trying to say 'that's not the way we want this world to look', and moving us forward, and looking at issues around inequality and naming prejudice and all sorts of forms of entitlement, that just shouldn't be part of the scene of the 21st century.""

When asked about Donald Trump's recent admission that he does not consider himself a feminist, she said: ""It's irrelevant. I think what we need to be focusing on is the number of men and women who are supportive of change and of equality and all the beautiful and wonderful things that happen. ""And we need to fight against people like him who represent old ideas, dated ideas, ideas that actually put people into boxes and don't allow people to thrive. Why should we allow that?""

Tory grandee Ken Clarke was caught on a microphone describing Mrs May as a ""bloody difficult woman"" in 2016. Her tweet was accompanied by a screenshot of Google's search results for the phrase, as her Wikipedia profile is the top result. Marchers wore sashes with the suffragettes' famous slogan ""deeds not words"" and gathered outside the Houses of Parliament before setting off on the route to Trafalgar Square. Activist Bianca Jagger was cheered when she called for the gender pay gap to be closed. Sadiq Khan said there were not enough women in Parliament and boardrooms across the country. Wearing a ""deeds not words"" sash, he said: ""I'm a feminist, I'm a proud feminist. ""I think if you're in a position of power and influence and you think it's wrong that women get paid less than men, you think it's wrong there's discrimination against women still, you think it's wrong that simply by virtue of being born a boy you have more chances than a girl - you should be a feminist. Actor Michael Sheen has said he would ""absolutely"" take a pay cut if it meant being paid the same as an actress. He said he had turned up in solidarity to demand a more equal society for everyone, adding that equal rights were ""incredibly important to me""."

It is part of her proposals to get more properties built and ""restore the dream of home ownership"" to millions across the country amid a lack of supply. Mrs May will stress she ""cannot bring about the kind of society I want to see, unless we tackle one of the biggest barriers to social mobility we face today"" - the lack of affordable housing. The PM will say at a national planning conference in London: ""I want to see planning permissions going to people who are actually going to build houses, not just sit on land and watch its value rise."" Mrs May will claim some developers are discouraged from constructing houses after getting planning permission due to a ""perverse incentive"" for bosses' bonuses, which are based on profits and share prices rather than how many properties they build. She wants to break the ""vicious circle"" where most people can only get on the property with their parents' help. Mrs May will say: ""If you're not lucky enough to have such support, the door to home ownership is all too often locked and barred."" And she will talk personally about how getting her first home with her husband Philip made it easier for her to play an active role in society. It showed that providing more housing will allow more people to have a stake in their community and its future, she will argue. Downing Street said the new rules will see about 80 of last year's Housing White Paper proposals implemented to ""make the system fairer and more effective by streamlining the process, cutting red tape and ending barriers to building"". Mrs May will also announce a nationwide standard for how many homes councils need to plan for in their area, with affordable homes prioritised for ""key workers"" such as nurses, teachers and firefighters. She will also commit to keep existing protections so authorities can only change green belt boundaries if they can prove they have explored every other reasonable option for building the homes their community needs. Labour's housing spokesman John Healey said: ""The Prime Minister should be embarrassed to be fronting up these feeble measures first announced a year ago. After eight years of failure on housing it's clear her Government has got no plan to fix the housing crisis. ""Since 2010, home-ownership has fallen to a 30-year low, rough sleeping has more than doubled, and deep cuts to housing investment have led to the lowest number of new social rented homes built since records began."""

With temperatures set to reach as high as 9C (48F) in parts of England over the weekend, dozens of flood warnings have been put in place for north east and south west. The Environment Agency has put 16 flood warnings in place across England, meaning that flooding is expected and people should take immediate action. There are 34 flood alerts in place across the UK, meaning that people should be prepared for flooding. Six flood alerts are in place for Wales, where water levels are set to surge. Rain falling onto snow and freezing overnight conditions also threatens treacherous driving conditions for many. Met Office yellow warnings for snow and ice have been extended across much of the country, with warnings in Scotland lasting late into Monday evening. In parts of Scotland and Wales - where the snow is still thick - some towns remain completely cut off by snowdrifts. An elderly couple and their dogs had to be dug out of a secluded farm house near West Linton by police Scotland and a mountain rescue team after they became trapped by 12ft snow drifts on Saturday. Dozens of wedding guests were unable to get to a wedding in South Wales after becoming stuck in snow in Ebbw Vale.

Many friends that did make the couple's big day had to dig their way out of the snow. One man in Greater Manchester had a lucky escape after trying to move a tree branch from an 11,000-volt power line. Electricity North West dubbed him ""the luckiest man alive"". In Ireland, which still has orange and yellow alerts for snow and ice in place, tens of thousands of homes have been left without water and power. Some roads remain blocked by up to 8ft (244cm) of snow, and people are being warned to avoid all but essential travel. The Irish Coast Guard and the RNLI issued a joint call for people to exercise caution in coastal areas, where high tides and easterly winds could result in flooding and ""extreme danger"" on exposed piers and coastlines. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned people to continue to take extreme care, saying: ""While things are improving, we don't want to lull people into a false sense of security."" While most airports are now open, a baby hare had a lucky escape when she was pulled from the snow by a member of staff at Dublin Airport. A video of the leveret - which has been named Emma - being rescued was posted on the airport's Twitter feed has now been viewed nearly 70,000 times. While some roads, including the A66 in Cumbria and County Durham, remain closed due to snow, many rail services are resuming service, albeit with revised timetables. The train track at Dawlish on the South Devon coast was also forced to close on Saturday due to high tides. Military help is still in place for affected areas still battling to clear away heavy drifts of snow. Photos of empty shop shelves across the UK were shared on social media, with supermarkets feeling the effect of cancelled deliveries earlier in the week. Despite the freezing temperatures and snow covered ground, brave swimmers still took to the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park in London for their regular weekend swim."
2018-03-04,People across the UK are being urged to use as little water as possible after thawing temperatures cause pipes to burst.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180305002448/https://news.sky.com/story/use-as-little-water-as-possible-public-urged-11276700,"Residents of some parts of London and the South East said they had been without water for more than 24 hours by Sunday night, with little indication of when supplies would return. Midlands provider Severn Trent said some water had been cut in the Birmingham area due to ""unprecedented"" leaks, which would take an unknown amount of time to fix. Some schools in the area warned they may have to close as a result of the disruption. Suppliers in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, as well as the North West, Yorkshire and the South West, also warned of shutoffs thanks to burst pipes following the recent freeze and thaw. In a joint statement on Sunday, four South East companies said they were experiencing ""exceptionally high levels of demand"" and Thames Water said 12,000 homes were without water. They urged those who still had access to avoid all but essential water use. Taking short showers rather than baths, being careful to turn taps off and only running washing machines and dishwashers with a full load ""will make a real difference"", the statement said. Companies also asked that customers check their pipes for bursts and call a plumber if necessary, explaining that outdoor taps were especially vulnerable. The problems are caused by pipes damaged by frozen water in the low temperatures, but some suppliers warned that the thaw could also cause ground movement that would further damage infrastructure. Distribution sites have been set up in London for customers to collect bottled water. We have dozens of Thames Water teams working hard to fix all the leaks following the big freeze. Our engineers are working round the clock to keep the water flowing. pic.twitter.com/3EJXhtdYMs On Twitter, angry customers contacted their providers to complain about the cut off supply and call for further information. South London resident Natasha Prayag told Sky News she was without water late into Sunday night, after her supply was cut off on Saturday evening. She said she had travelled to her family's house to shower and had been helped by friends who delivered bottled water, as most nearby shops had sold out. ""I've been OK,"" she said, but shared concerns for the ""elderly and sick who cannot venture out to collect water"" from a station more than a mile away. In the joint statement, water companies said they ""sincerely apologise"" to those experiencing problems. ""We are putting as much extra water as we can into our local networks and fixing leaks and bursts as quickly as possible,"" it said. On Sunday night services for vulnerable customers were being prioritised and locations for the distribution of bottled water set up. London's water collection points are located at Hampstead No 1 Pond Car Park in North London, and the Homebase on Woodgate Drive, Streatham Vale."
2018-03-04,Tourist boats could be banned from entering the world famous bay where the blockbuster film The Beach was set.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180305002448/https://news.sky.com/story/famous-location-for-dicaprio-film-the-beach-being-destroyed-by-tourists-11275464,"Thai officials are considering enforcing the restriction in Maya Bay between June and September to protect the reef. Up to 5,000 people a day visit the small stretch of sand on the island of Koh Phi Phi Leh, arriving on hundreds of boats which have damaged the delicate coral. Tour guide Adam Gardener has lived and worked in the area for three years and says some tourists and operators don't respect the environment. He told Sky News: ""They throw full on trash bags off the boats here sometimes, they bring the boats right in regardless if the boats are knocking corals and destroying everything. There's just not a lot of respect for Koh Phi Phi anymore."" The powder white sands and crystal waters are some of the most famous in the world after being used as the backdrop for Danny Boyle's 2000 film The Beach starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Its popularity over the last 18 years has taken its toll on the environment with reports up to 80% of the coral in the bay has died. Some has been destroyed by anchors being dropped on it, people standing on it and pollution from sun cream and gasoline. Tourism is vital to the local economy, more than two million people visited the Koh Phi Phi National Park last year generating millions of pounds. Every visitor who steps on the beach is charged an entrance fee of 400 Thai baht (¬£10). The President of Phi Phi Tourist Association, Watrapol Jantharo, rejected reports that the beach will be totally closed, instead telling Sky News that tourists would have to access it from the other side of the island. Local conservationist and diver Andrew Hewett supports the plan to restrict access but said the area would need regular breaks if it was to recover. His team have been growing and replanting coral a few minutes from Maya Bay where the water is now teaming with life. He warned it was important to ensure the environment at the alternative entrance wasn't also damaged. ""My concern is with the amount of boats in Maya Bay right now is whether there's going to be enough room in this particular bay for that many the boats,"" he said. This isn't the first time Thai authorities have restricted access to areas being damaged by tourism. In 2016, Koh Tachai, an island in the famous Similan national park in southwest Thailand, was closed for an ""indefinite period"". Marine experts from Bangkok are due to visit Maya Bay in the coming days before a final decision is announced."

2018-03-04,Donald Trump has threatened to increase taxes on European cars if the EU retaliates against tariffs on steel and aluminium.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180305002448/https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-threatens-tax-on-european-cars-if-eu-retaliates-against-steel-tariff-11275534,"The US President said he would slap a tax on cars from the continent after the European Commission's president said on Friday the bloc would tax American goods, mainly from strong Republican states. Jean-Claude Juncker said plans to put tariffs on products such as Kentucky bourbon, Levi's jeans and Harley-Davidsons had not been finalised. He said they would treat the products ""the same way"" the US wants to handle tariffs on European metals. In retaliation, Mr Trump tweeted on Saturday night: ""If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. ""Big trade imbalance!"" He also hit out at ""very stupid"" trade deals by earlier administrations and said other countries ""laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!"" It is not clear whether a European car tariff would include British-made cars such as Aston Martin or Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Indian company Tata but produced in the UK, after Brexit. The tit-for-tat row started when Mr Trump announced on Thursday that he would impose stiff tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imports from anywhere in the world. His announcement shocked many industry executives but meant he was following up on a key campaign promise of ""America first"". Shortly after the statement, Mr Juncker told German media: ""None of this is reasonable, but reason is sentiment that is very unevenly distributed in this world."" Richard Warren, head of policy at UK Steel, said he hoped the metal tariffs did not apply to the UK and accused Mr Trump of ""short-termism"" and protectionism, adding there would be unintended consequences for global trade and steel users in the US. Almost 15% of the UK's high-value steel products - about ¬£360m - are exported to the US annually, he added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman warned the tariffs could lead to a global trade war which ""can't be in anyone's interest"". Australian, Canadian and other American trade partners also launched retaliatory threats. The US already has a 2.5% duty tax on European cars against the 10% tax which the EU levies on American-made cars. Despite Mr Trump's bravado, his threat to further tax cars and metals may be difficult to pull off. The current tax on European cars was decided through complicated international negotiations so to increase it the President may have to pull the US out of the World Trade Organisation."
2018-03-04,"Brussels could reject Theresa May's plan to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic post-Brexit, according to Ireland's deputy prime minister.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180305002448/https://news.sky.com/story/eu-could-reject-northern-ireland-border-proposals-republics-deputy-pm-suggests-11275705,"Mrs May is adamant that a soft border can be maintained on the island of Ireland through technological solutions and placing no new restrictions on the cross-frontier trade from smaller businesses. But Simon Coveney has cast doubt on the feasibility of this, saying he is ""not sure that the European Union will be able to support"" the plan because of worries about safeguarding the integrity of the bloc's single market. ""While of course we will explore and look at all of the proposed British solutions, they are essentially a starting point in negotiations as opposed to an end point,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Mr Coveney said that if an agreement cannot be struck, the backup plan of full British alignment with the EU's customs union and single market rules that Mrs May has ""committed clearly"" to would have to be enforced. The comments come on the heels of Mrs May's keynote Brexit speech on Friday, which was intended to flesh out her vision for leaving the EU. In it, she rejected as ""unacceptable"" proposals from Brussels to keep customs union arrangements in Northern Ireland. The PM accepted the UK's ""responsibility"" to help keep a soft border with the Republic - setting out in detail how she believed this could be achieved through technological means or a broader trade deal. But Mr Coveney said: ""This isn't a question of either side wanting to put up borders, but if you have to protect a functioning single market, just the same way Britain wants to protect its own single market, well then you have to understand that if goods move from one customs union to another then there needs to be some checks, unless there is some mechanism that is negotiated and put in place that prevents that."" Reacting to the Irish deputy PM's comments, a senior British Cabinet minister said the UK's border plans could be altered to placate EU concerns. When asked if the backup border plan was inevitable, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""I'm much less pessimistic than you are. Clearly we are at the start of a negotiating period and will want to sit down with our EU partners and work through where their concerns, whether legal or technical, are and see how we might together address this."" Also speaking to the BBC on Sunday, the Prime Minister said her overall Brexit plan for Britain to align with EU rules to allow for ""frictionless"" trade while retaining the leeway to diverge from them was ""ambitious"" and ""credible"". Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News' Sunday with Paterson show that the PM's Brexit speech was more about trying securing a ""limited truce"" within the her own party than ""the interests of the country"". ""We've already seen today that truce has begun to unravel. Michael Heseltine's statement this morning about the speech, what did he describe it as? Phrases and generalisations and platitudes. ""We're seeing an attack on Boris Johnson by Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister's own policy adviser. So I don't think the truce is going to last very long."" Downing Street has denied reports Mr Barwell was behind the leak of a memo written by the Foreign Secretary, in which he wrote that the Government's focus should be on preventing the Irish border becoming ""significantly"" harder."
2018-03-04,"If scriptwriters at Universal Studios, Disney or Twentieth Century Fox were to come up with a storyline of the kind engulfing each of their parent companies just now, it would be dismissed as too far-fetched.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180305002448/https://news.sky.com/story/how-a-cabbie-convinced-comcasts-boss-to-reach-for-the-sky-11269684,"The parents of the trio - Comcast, Walt Disney Co and 21st Century Fox - find themselves embroiled in a multi-billion dollar tangle at the centre of which sits Sky plc, the owner of Sky News. In December 2016, Fox said it wanted to buy the remaining 61% of Sky that it does not already own. That deal has been snarled in the UK regulatory process with Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, due to rule by June on whether it should be allowed to go ahead. :: Comcast challenges Fox with ¬£22.1bn Sky bid interest Assuming it does, Sky would be taken over by Fox, before being sold on to Disney as part of a wider deal involving all of Fox's entertainment assets. At the time, Comcast, America's biggest cable operator, also expressed an interest in buying those assets from Fox. It was even thought to be prepared to pay more than Disney. But Rupert Murdoch, the executive co-chairman of Fox, calculated that Comcast would have a tougher time getting a deal past US competition regulators than Disney - and Comcast walked away. Another factor was that, with Mr Murdoch's family receiving shares as part-consideration, Disney shares were more attractive in view of Comcast's shareholder structure - which effectively gives the Roberts family, which founded the company, control of it. Since then, two things have happened. The first is that Comcast's board has, according to reports, given serious consideration to reviving its interest in Fox's entertainment assets. The second is that, in the recent round of auctions for live TV rights for the Premier League, Sky emerged with a great result. In the next three year cycle, from 2019-22, it will be paying ¬£200m less per season than in the current 2016-19 cycle. That has prompted some minority shareholders in Sky to argue that Fox needed to sweeten its terms from the 1075p-per-share it agreed to pay back in December 2016. They include Crispin Odey, one of the City's best-known fund managers and Elliott, a notoriously aggressive US hedge fund. Enter Comcast. The US giant has today waded in with a 1250p-a-share offer that values the whole of Sky at ¬£22.1bn - compared with the ¬£18.5bn Fox was prepared to pay. It has said that, while it would like to own all of the shares in Sky, it will be satisfied with 50% plus one share and that its takeover is not dependent on Fox selling its existing 39.1% stake in Sky. Crucially, it is promising to increase Sky's investment in UK TV and film production, as well as pledging to continue broadcasting news under the Sky brand - a guarantee Fox, too, has made along with promises to maintain the independence of Sky News. Comcast's intervention raises a number of questions for investors. The first is how Fox will respond. Sky's share price has shot up by more than a fifth, to 1330p, implying that investors expect Fox to come back with a higher offer. But Mr Murdoch might yet decide to alter the terms of his existing deal with Disney to exclude Sky from the sale. The second is Comcast's motivation. Is it simply interested in Sky, as it says, as a platform to grow its business in Europe? Or is this part of an attempt to get Fox back around the negotiating table in order to try and gazump Disney? A third question is how Disney itself reacts. It might choose to launch a takeover bid of its own for Sky which it, too, covets as a way of reducing its dependence on the US. Both Disney and Comcast have different reasons for wanting to do these deals. In the case of Disney, it wishes not only to widen its geographic spread, but also to acquire - with Fox's entertainment assets - a greater array of film and TV assets with which to take on internet giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. In the case of Comcast, it too wishes to diversify away from the US, where cable subscribers have been ""cord-cutting"" in their droves. In response it has launched its own ""over-the-top"" streaming service, just as Disney and Fox have with Hulu, to try and get around this - but that service requires content. Hence the interest in both Sky and in Fox's entertainment assets. One fascinating dimension to this story - again, back to the Hollywood analogy - is the cast of characters it brings together. Mr Murdoch built Fox into one of the world's biggest entertainment companies, founding Sky along the way, but also owns - via News Corporation - some of the world's most famous newspaper titles, including The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post. It all started from a single newspaper in Adelaide and several members of Mr Murdoch's family have gone on to be executives either at Fox, Sky or News Corp. Comcast, too, is very much a family concern. Now the world's biggest broadcasting and cable television company, following its 2011 takeover of NBC Universal and its 2016 acquisition of Dreamworks Animation, it was built by Ralph Roberts from a single cable company in Tupelo, Mississippi. His son Brian is now chairman and chief executive of Comcast and the Roberts family exerts control of the business. And there is history, too, between Mr Roberts and Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive. Comcast sought to buy Disney in 2004 for $54bn. Disney rejected the offer and Comcast walked away. Mr Iger, who has called Sky a ""crown jewel"", scuppered Mr Roberts's ambitions on that occasion. It would be ironic were Mr Roberts to now do the same to him. The final characters, were this being turned into a film, would be the ordinary members of the public. Mr Roberts told reporters this morning that, during a recent visit to London, a taxi driver had spoken to him favourably and in detail about Sky in comparison with rival cable service Virgin Media. He was then impressed by a demonstration of the Sky Q service in a shopping mall by a Sky sales rep. Those two events, apparently, helped convince him to bid."

Sir Roger ran the world's first ever sub-four minute mile in May 1954 at the Iffley Road track in Oxford. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011. A statement released on behalf of his family said: ""Sir Roger Bannister died peacefully in Oxford on 3 March 2018, aged 88, surrounded by his family who were as loved by him as he was loved by them. ""He banked his treasure in the hearts of his friends."" The athlete ran his record-breaking mile two years after finishing fourth, and setting a British record, in the 1,500m at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki. He then made it his mission to be the first person to run a mile in less than four minutes. With little training and while practising as a junior doctor, he went on to run a mile in three minutes and 59.4 seconds. After the announcer Norris McWhirter declared ""the time was three..."" the crowd cheered so loudly his exact time was not heard. His record only lasted 46 days, with Australian rival John Landy running a mile in three minutes 58 seconds in Finland the following month. Seb Coe, double Olympic 1,500m gold medallist and president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, led tributes to Sir Roger, saying it was ""a day of intense sadness"". Olympic gold medal relay sprinter Darren Campbell said: ""Thank you for the inspiration and everything you represented."" Prime Minister Theresa May said Sir Roger would be ""greatly missed"". British-South African endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh quoted the athlete, saying: ""We are all special."" Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed. ‚ÄúHowever ordinary each of us may seem, we are all in some way special, and can do things that are extraordinary, perhaps until then ‚Ä¶ even thought impossible.‚ÄùRIP Sir Roger Bannister pic.twitter.com/8jkVCVlZkX Sir Roger went to the University of Oxford, where he studied medicine, then joined St Mary's Hospital Medical School in west London as a junior doctor before becoming a neurologist. On the 50th anniversary of his record-breaking achievement, he said he was prouder of his contribution to academic medicine, in which he researched responses of the nervous system, than running the first sub-four minute mile. The humble athlete put his 1954 performance down to his inside leg measurement and his capacity to absorb oxygen. Sir Roger was knighted for his service as the first chairman of the Sports Council, now Sport England, in 1975. For some the word legend doesn't quite cut it. Rest in peace Sir Roger Bannister. pic.twitter.com/ZW3Y8qkvGh This is a day of intense sadness both for our nation and for all of us in athletics.   There is not a single athlete of my generation who was not inspired by Roger and his achievements both on and off the track. https://t.co/8lcErw8Oad As part of his role he initiated the first testing for anabolic steroids use in sport, and helped increase government funding of sports centres. He was awarded honorary degrees from four different universities and a doctorate from Oxford Brookes University. In 2004, he was made an honorary freeman of the London Borough of Harrow, where he was born. He was also an honorary fellow of his alma maters, Exeter College and Merton College at the University of Oxford. In last year's New Year Honours, he was appointed Member of the Companions of Honour for services to sport. Sir Roger is survived by his wife, artist Moyra Jacobsson, daughter of the Swedish economist Per Jacobsson, who was managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

His father Brett has told Sky News the family had been taking their eight-year-old son to Spain for private scans every four months since he underwent pioneering brain surgery in the Czech Republic in Autumn 2014. Specialists at Southampton General Hospital wanted to treat Ashya with intense chemotherapy and radiation, which his parents Naghmeh and Brett thought would leave their then-five-year-old with permanent disability. So without medical permission they fled to Spain where they had a home, with a view to going to Prague for proton therapy with Ashya. His mother and father were arrested by Spanish police at the request of the British authorities. But they were ultimately allowed to take Ashya to Prague. There, he underwent a series of short bursts of proton therapy, in which a concentrated beam of energy is used to kill the tumour without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. It worked, and Ashya has been recovering ever since. Ashya's father Brett told Sky News: ""Because of the treatment, with the recurrence of the cancer we kind of feel we're out of the woods with that now. ""All these worrying about his MRIs, and looking at him and thinking what sort of future he might have, you know how long or how short, we feel a lot more confident about the future we can actually start making a few plans now for the future. ""We feel at last we can... take a deep breath and move on a bit now.""

An overhaul of planning laws will see the creation of new rules to give councils targets for how many homes they should build each year. They will take into account local house prices, wages and the number of ""key workers"" like nurses, teachers and police officers in the area. Higher targets will be set for areas with higher ""unaffordability ratios"", Mr Javid told the Sunday Times. If councils fail to deliver on the target they will be stripped of planning powers with independent inspectors taking over. Prime Minister Theresa May, who will launch the plans on Monday, has made housing a key domestic priority. Mr Javid told the newspaper: ""We have a housing crisis in this country. ""We need a housing revolution. The new rules will no longer allow nimby councils that don't really want to build the homes that their local community needs to fudge the numbers."" He told councils: ""We are going to be breathing down your neck day and night to make sure you are actually delivering on those numbers."" The Housing Secretary added: ""At the moment there is nothing in the system that checks to see they are actually delivering. ""There's no comeback or sanction and that is going to change."" Mr Javid said homes would not be built on green belt but any area outside ""naturally protected land"" would be free for construction. He also revealed plans to build new towns between Oxford and Cambridge. ""Along that corridor there's an opportunity to build at least four or five garden towns and villages with thousands of homes,"" he said. And he said rules will be relaxed for homeowners who want to add storeys to their houses. John Healey MP, Labour's shadow secretary of state for housing, said Britain's housing crisis was the ""fault of Whitehall, not town halls"". ""Since 2010, home-ownership has fallen to a 30-year low, rough sleeping has more than doubled, and the number of new homes being built still hasn't recovered to pre-recession levels,"" he said. ""In the week he's surrendered ¬£800m of unspent housing funds to the Treasury, more buck-passing from Sajid Javid isn't going to cut it. It's time the Tories changed course, and backed Labour's long-term plan to build the homes the country needs."""

The large blast happened last Sunday evening on Hinckley Road - destroying a building that contained a supermarket and a two-storey flat. The victims have been named as Mary Rajoobeer, 46, and her two sons Shane, 18, and Sean, 17. Also killed were 18-year-old Leah Beth Reek, who was Shane's girlfriend, and 22-year-old Viktorija Ljevleva. Two men who were arrested on Friday, both of them in their 30s and from East Anglia, are still being questioned by detectives. Leicestershire Police says they were detained on suspicion of conspiracy to cause an explosion and for offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The force has refused to comment on reports that the explosion may have been caused by an illegal alcohol distillery. Specialist officers are continuing to sift through the wreckage in search of clues, with the scene expected to remain cordoned off for several days at least."

But the spectre of perhaps the thorniest issue in the negotiations - the future status of the Northern Ireland border - has threatened to rear its head once more. Mrs May's disclosure that Britain is looking at the customs arrangements between the US and Canada as a potential way of solving the border issue provoked raised eyebrows from some MPs. When it was pointed out by shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman that there were ""armed customs guards"" at the US-Canada frontier, Mrs May said arrangements ""in a number of countries"" were being examined. Irish PM Leo Varadkar - who earlier ruled out formal three-way border talks between the UK, Ireland and the EU - later said a US-Canada option would not be acceptable. While Mr Varadkar said he did not want to comment directly because he had not heard Mrs May's comments, he talked about his trip to the US-Canada border. ""I visited the US-Canada border, I visited it back in August, and I saw a hard border with physical infrastructure, with customs posts, people in uniforms with arms and dogs and that is definitely not a solution that is one that we can possibly entertain,"" Mr Varadkar said. Mrs May's Commons address was the first time she had faced MPs since hitting back at the EU's refusal to offer Britain a bespoke Brexit deal in a keynote speech on Friday. In it, she stood firm in calling for a different relationship to that which Canada, Norway and Turkey have with the EU, declaring: ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade agreement is cherry-picking."" Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Mrs May said: ""We cannot escape the complexity of the task ahead. ""We must build a new and lasting relationship while preparing for every scenario. ""But with pragmatism, calm and patient discussion, I am confident we can set an example to the world. ""Yes, there will be ups and downs over the months ahead, but we will not be buffeted by the demands to talk tough or threaten or walk out - and we will not give in to the counsels of despair that this simply cannot be done, for this is in both the UK's and EU's interests."" She added: ""My message to our friends in Europe is clear: you asked us to set out what we want in more detail, we have done that; we have shown we understand your principles; we have a shared interest in getting this right, so let's get on with it."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May's Brexit speech had ""barely papered over the cracks"" within her party and accused the PM of presiding over ""20 wasted months"" since the June 2016 referendum. He claimed bravado had given way to bickering, with the ""arrogance"" of some of her Cabinet ministers thinking that sorting out Brexit would be the ""easiest deal in history"" being replaced by ""debilitating infighting"". Responding, Mr Corbyn said his opposite number had still not got a grip on the Brexit negotiations. ""We've seen set-piece speech after set-piece speech and yet the Prime Minister still cannot bring clarity to these negotiations and still cannot bring certainty to British businesses or workers. ""The Prime Minister's speech on Friday promised to unite the nation, but it barely papered over the cracks in her own party."" Mr Corbyn said the Government had so far offered ""no real solution"" on Northern Ireland and had instead ""rehashed an already discredited Government idea"" to use a combination of technology and goodwill to ensure there is no hard border. ""We've had 20 months of promises, soundbites and confusion,"" said Mr Corbyn, rounding off his attack. ""However people feel about Brexit, it's clear to them this Government is nowhere near delivering a good deal for Britain."""

This accounted for 44.9% of the world total. The nearest competitor is Canada, with 80.7 tonnes. Some 2.1 tonnes was exported from the UK, making it responsible for 67.7% of the world total, followed by the Netherlands (16.4%). A drug policy reform lobby group has criticised the UK government, saying they have ""consistently refused to allow medical cannabis in the UK on the basis that it has 'no therapeutic value'"". Steve Rolles, Transform's senior policy analyst said: ""It is scandalous and untenable for the UK government to maintain that cannabis has no medical uses, at the same time as licensing the world's biggest government approved medical cannabis production and export market. ""UK patients are either denied access and suffering unnecessarily, or are forced to buy cannabis from the criminal market. ""Countries with proper access to medical cannabis do not have this problem, as standardised cannabis products are in the hands of doctors and pharmacists."" A significant part of the UK's legal cannabis production goes towards a cannabis-based medicine called Sativex, produced by GW Pharmaceuticals. It is available on prescription for patients such as those suffering the effects of multiple sclerosis, but it is only on the NHS in Wales. Alfie Dingley, aged six, is a British boy who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy, something his parents say can be treated with cannabis oil. Alfie, from Kenilworth, returned from the Netherlands last month, where he had been receiving this treatment. His parents want the Government to let him use the medication in the UK but it is banned."

The then 18-year-old lured Leonne to a secluded spot near Lordens Hill in the Dinnington area of Rotherham in January last year and stabbed her 28 times. Judge Paul Watson QC said the two had become friends about a year before and had been at a party together two days before her death on 15 January, 2017. Following his arrest, Heeley, who pleaded guilty to murder last month, said he always knew he would kill someone and later told staff at a secure mental hospital that he had enjoyed it. He said: ""I like that I have done it, I just do. I like killing. Knowing I have killed someone satisfied me. ""I'll go to prison or hospital, but probably prison. If that's what it takes to stop me killing people, that's where I need to go."" A member of the public discovered the body, with a post-mortem examination finding that Leonne had died as a result of multiple stab wounds. In sentencing, Judge Watson said it was a ""pre-planned, brutal and pitiless killing of an innocent young girl who had her whole life ahead of her"". The court heard how he had grabbed Leonne by the throat before stabbing her, and that he ""heard voices telling him to kill her and had demons inside him"". Heeley, who said he was ""cheered up"" by thinking about killing and ""hitting people on the head with hammers"", had not been diagnosed with a mental illness but may have an emerging personality disorder, the court heard. Leonne's family have paid tribute to their ""beautiful and amazing daughter"", with father Darran Weeks describing her as ""full of life and loved by everyone around her"". He continued: ""She was taken away from me by the evil act of a cold-hearted killer. This destroyed me. As a father I wasn't there to protect my daughter and I felt helpless. ""As a dad, I never expected to bury my daughter and this was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life."" Her mother, Paula Appley, added: ""My whole family has fallen apart. Both Levi, Leonne's twin, and Millie her little sister are struggling, unable to lead a normal life. ""No amount of time her murderer spends in prison will bring her back. We will all have to live with our loss for the rest of our lives."""

2018-03-05,The charities' watchdog has received reports of 80 current and historical cases of safeguarding concerns - including child sex abuse - since the Oxfam scandal broke.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180306050238/https://news.sky.com/story/charity-commission-receives-80-cases-in-wake-of-oxfam-sex-scandal-11277172,"Last month, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt wrote to 179 aid organisations and charities to demand assurances they are taking steps to prevent abuse of vulnerable people. Of those, 26 charities have made serious incident reports to the Charity Commission, totalling 80 incidents ""broadly related"" to safeguarding issues and covering ""a wide spectrum"" of alleged incidents. Seven of those organisations presented cases that have been reported within the current financial year. The reports are now being assessed by the Charity Commission's new taskforce, with the detail of the allegations or the charities involved not being revealed. The watchdog also disclosed, beyond those charities Ms Mordaunt wrote to, they have seen ""broadly a doubling of serious incident reporting compared to usual levels"", in the wake of allegations against Oxfam last month. ""We are now receiving around 100 a week, and the increase relates specifically to reports of safeguarding issues or incidents, again covering a wide spectrum in terms of their nature and levels of seriousness,"" a spokesperson said. These are also being assessed by the taskforce. Ms Mordaunt, speaking at a safeguarding summit on Monday, described it as a ""wake up call"" for charities and aid organisations. On 9 February, The Times newspaper first published allegations that Oxfam covered up claims that senior aid workers had used prostitutes, some of whom may have been underage, while responding to Haiti's devastating earthquake in 2010. The scandal sparked a series of further allegations against Oxfam along with other charities and aid organisations. Ms Mordaunt said: ""My message to those who have sought to exploit this sector and the human tragedy in which it operates, is this - we will all share information we have with law enforcement. ""We will find you. We will bring you to justice. Your time is up."" Ms Mordaunt added her department ""will put in place new, enhanced and specific safeguarding standards"" for those organisations they work with, which will determine whether they receive Government funding. ""These standards will include an assessment of codes of conduct, how organisations identify and respond to incidents, and how their risk management places safeguarding and beneficiaries at the very core,"" she said. ""That assessment will set the bar at a level of the very best - a bar that we will continue to push higher - from our work here today and in the time to come. ""Our standards will be world-leading. They will be tough and exacting. Organisations should not bid for new funding unless they are prepared to meet these tough new standards. ""We will not approve funds to them unless they pass our new standards. ""We will also start to apply these new standards to organisations we have ongoing work with."" Oxfam, which received ¬£31.7m from the Government last year, has announced it will not bid for any new Government contracts in the wake of its scandal. The Cabinet minister also asked if the Oxfam scandal - or claims women in Syrian refugee camps were forced to offer sexual favours in return for UN aid - would have persisted if ""victims' voices were listened to"". ""We need to find a way to hear the voices of the people we serve, so we can respond when they tell us they are being mistreated,"" she said. Also speaking at the summit, newly-appointed Charity Commission chair Baroness Stowell said the watchdog is ""committed to working constructively"" with Ms Mordaunt's department and charities to ""identify practical solutions to stop sexual exploitation and abuse""; as well as ""drive up safeguarding standards and - crucially - to rebuild public trust"". ""As we now look ahead, it's vital we don't allow the shorthand, technocratic word of ""safeguarding"" to let us forget what the failings are that we are talking about,"" she said. ""And in this context, it is aid workers sexually abusing the most desperate and vulnerable people they were sent to support. ""In some cases, your own staff and volunteers taken advantage of by those in positions of trust and power. ""And charities abusing their trusted status by failing to put the welfare of the blameless ahead of their corporate reputation."""

The issue has also affected suppliers in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, as well as the North West, Yorkshire, the South West and the Midlands, which is where the affected JLR plants are based. :: What to do if a water pipe bursts in your home On Monday, Cadbury confirmed it has halted production at its manufacturing site in Bournville. A spokesman told The Sun: ""While we have no water supply to our manufacturing site in Bournville, our supply of chocolate is not immediately impacted as we currently have sufficient stock available to manage through this hopefully short disruption."" The came after JLR said it ""cannot say"" when production at the Solihull plant in Birmingham, which employs 10,000 people, will resume, with production at the Castle Bromwich site, which employs 3,000, to close from Tuesday morning. A spokesman for water company Severn Trent confirmed: ""Due to the recent thaw we've experienced, our teams aredealing with a huge number of burst pipes across our region which is putting pressure on our network. ""As well as bringing in extra teams and tankers, and ramping up production at our treatment works so we can continue to keep schools, hospitals, homes and vulnerable customers on supply, we've worked closely with JLR to manage their water usage, which helps us prioritise household supplies. ""We'd like to thank them for their support as we look to get everything back to normal for our customers."" :: RAF air drops supplies to 'isolated' Cumbria after days of snow The announcement came shortly after Welsh Water confirmed it had 4,500 customers whose water supply had been affected, with more water pumped into the network in the last day than the peak period last summer. ""We are mobilising additional staff to help protect supplies by finding and fixing over 200 leaks a day - more than three times the usual amount,"" a spokesman added. ""We are also asking customers to help protect water supplies by not leaving taps - internal or external - running and reporting any leaks or bursts out on roads and highways directly to the company."" :: Thousands of starfish wash up on beach after big freeze Meanwhile, affected water companies, including Thames Water and South East Water, have united in asking customers to avoid all but essential water usage. Some of the advice is to take short showers rather than baths, being careful to turn taps off, and only running washing machines and dishwashers with a full load. The problems - which also forced a number of schools to close on Monday - have been caused by pipes damaged by frozen water in the low temperatures that spread across the country last week. Some suppliers have warned that the thaw could also cause ground movement that would further damage infrastructure."

""Across the board we must come together to ensure the homes are being built,"" the Prime Minister said, at a major house building site at the location of the old West Ham football ground at Upton Park, east London. ""What I'm worried about is the fact that we have a generation now - of young people particularly - who worry about not being able to own their own home, about getting their foot on the housing ladder. ""And, for me, the British dream is each generation has a better future than the last. For many people I think they fear that opportunity is not theirs. ""That's why the Government is putting such an effort into building the number of homes that we need in this country. ""For too many years we simply haven't built enough homes."" :: How wealthy is your region? Mrs May also said wealth inequality was ""an issue"" arising from the accumulation of property wealth, through rising house prices, for an older generation. The Prime Minister highlighted how this is occurring at the same time as young people ""just don't feel that they're going to be able to share that in the future"". Asked whether a country where housing outcomes were determined by parents' property situations could be a truly meritocratic nation, Mrs May said: ""I want this to be a country where how far you get in life is about your abilities and willingness to work hard and that's what we want to see. ""Today, we do see people's opportunities being restricted because of the problems we see the housing market."" :: Why have some regions been left behind? But, the Prime Minister rejected the notion the governments in which she had served since 2010 were to blame for a halving in spending on housing development from ¬£11bn in 2009/10 to ¬£6bn last year. She also declined an invitation to implore Tory councillors to stop voting against new homes. ""Not every request for planning permission is going to be right,"" Mrs May said, adding there was ""no single answer"" to the issue. Asked whether she regretted her infamous assertion made at the 2016 Conservative Party conference that ""if you're a citizen of the world you're a citizen of nowhere"", the PM defended her remarks ""What I was talking about with the citizens of nowhere was the importance of people being rooted in their community,"" she said."

It was alleged that he disclosed the names of several dozen Russian agents working in Europe. He was later given refuge in the UK as part of a spy swap. He and a woman in her 30s - believed to be known to him and also critically ill - were found ""unconscious on a bench"" at The Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, police said. Sky News' defence correspondent, Alistair Bunkall, said it was fair to assume the security services were ""involved"" in the investigation. He said toxicology tests were not expected back on Monday night. Neither Mr Skripal nor the woman had any ""visible injuries"", Wiltshire Police's temporary Assistant Chief Constable, Craig Holden, said. They are in intensive care at Salisbury District Hospital. While a major incident has been declared and ""extensive inquiries"" are under way, detectives are as yet ""unable to ascertain whether or not a crime has taken place"", Mr Holden said. A counter-terrorism incident has ""not been declared"", but officers have access to a ""wide range of specialist resources and services"", he said. Mr Holden said a risk to the wider public does not ""currently"" exist. Anyone with information should call 999. Mr Skripal, a former colonel within Russian military intelligence, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006. He was one of four convicts given a pardon, and one of two sent to Britain after a spy swap in July 2010 - described as the largest since the Cold War. As part of the deal, 10 Russian sleeper agents were expelled from the United States. A spokesman for the Russian embassy said: ""Neither relatives nor legal representatives of the said person, nor the British authorities, have addressed the embassy in this regard."" Anyone exposed to the unknown substance has been decontaminated, ""as is standard practice in situations like this"", a spokesman for Public Health England (PHE) said. ""Scientists from PHE's Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards will continue to assist the response and review information as it becomes available,"" he added. In 2006, Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko died after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210 at a London hotel. In 2016, a public inquiry concluded that his killing had ""probably"" been carried out with the approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin."

Instead of reading ""Time's Up"", Ms Watson's tattoo says ""Times Up"". Some have questioned whether the tattoo is real, or simply a temporary piece to make a statement. Others backed her decision to get rid of the apostrophe, with one tweeter suggesting it would look ""weird just floating there"". The apostrophe is also missing from the movement's hashtag on social media, as they do not yet support punctuation marks. Ms Watson has been a vocal and leading supporter of the Time's Up movement, which seeks to end sexual harassment in Hollywood. :: Oscars: Time's Up built to last in Hollywood and beyond Normally a massive fan of Emma Watson, but not sure about how I feel about that fringe - and that ‚Äòtattoo‚Äô. pic.twitter.com/LRkIHorrbv In a post on Instagram about the movement last month, Ms Watson wrote: ""All of us are responsible for creating change, whatever industry you work in.

In early 2017, the centrist moderates who run the majority of countries that make up the European Union were just getting used to the idea of Brexit, and there were rumblings of trouble elsewhere. So-called populists were riding high in the up-coming elections in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. Could it happen? Le Pen in France? Wilders in The Netherlands? Hofer in Austria? And what about the AfD in Germany? :: Italian coalition dealing won't be pretty No one had even begun to think about Italy, after all, no election was set there. The Northern League (as the League was then known) was Italy's main offering of a hard-right party but it was predominantly a secessionist campaigner and not a player beyond the north. A comedian with big hair was running a disruptive movement called 5-Star. It appeared to be growing in popularity - but no one was taking it particularly seriously. The biggest debate was over whether 5-Star was left wing or right. Could it be both? Neither? It confused the establishment centrists. It didn't conform to the norms of the political spectrum. What did all this populism and polarisation mean? They didn't know because they didn't take enough notice of what was happening. Then the elections began and on the face of it, all was tickety boo. Mr Juncker and his ilk sighed relief after each vote. In The Netherlands, a hard-right Geert Wilders government was never a genuine prospect because of the country‚Äôs proportional representation system. The centrists prevailed. In France, voters chose a European integrationist - the young, dynamic Macron who has quickly established himself as the new driver of an EU with apparently renewed confidence. In Austria, the race for the presidency was close and rerun. But the liberal green candidate beat the far-right man with a Nazi past. And in Germany, the continent‚Äôs senior stateswoman prevailed, wounded and limping for several months, but with another centrist pro-EU grand coalition now just weeks away. And so ""phew"" said the establishment. Mr Juncker made his speech: ""The wind is back in Europe‚Äôs sails."" Hardly. The centrist liberals like Macron, Merkel, Rutte, Van Der Bellen did not prevail because the radical populists failed. On the contrary - they won in spite of significant gains by the populists and they won because they mimicked some of the populists' policies. Close behind each centrist success was a populist runner-up. From Athens to Barcelona, Calais to Catania, Rome to Paris, it is so easy to find disenfranchised people looking for something different. Their gripes are the same: they feel forgotten and not listened to. Their worries are almost always the economy and immigration and whether you call them racist or honest, they are voting with their feet. In the Netherlands, Mr Wilders' anti-immigration and eurosceptic views were ""eloquently"" articulated and they resonated. In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party is now a central part of a right wing coalition government. In France, Le Pen lost but still made it to the second round of the election with historic gains. In Germany, despite all its history, a far-right party will, this month, become the official opposition party. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) will be boosted by official opposition funding and seats on influential parliamentary committees. :: Strong results for anti-establishment in Italy Then came Italy this weekend. Here, the populists didn't just make gains, they won. Of all the EU establishment's possible nightmare scenarios for Italy, one of the worst materialised. The League and the 5-Star Movement are euro-sceptic, anti-immigration and led by untested radicals. Results suggest as many as one in three people voted for the 5-Star Movement. The League could be the largest party in the centre-right coalition, which may get the arithmetic to form a government. As populists they have both promised their voters the earth but may struggle to deliver. They have been chosen by the voters to fix a broken system but have said little about their alternative. And if you are looking for a clear demonstration of why people feel they're up against a broken system, glance back to Germany. In last September's federal election, the German public roundly rejected the centre-left SPD party, giving it a kicking at the polls. It performed worse than it has ever done. And yet, the messy nature of democracy has put the SPD back in government. This weekend they agreed to form a coalition with Mrs Merkel‚Äôs conservatives. That will only add frustration to those who think their vote doesn't count for much and their view isn't heard. Politics is polarised and fragmenting in pretty much every EU country. For Mr Juncker to say otherwise is plain wrong. Reacting to his far-right party's victory in Italy, Matteo Salvini said he needed to thank Mr Juncker. ""Every time he speaks, I get more votes,"" he said, with glee and sarcasm. In Italy, the wind is in his sails."

In the Commons, Thames Water was criticised for failing to contact residents and tell them how they could collect bottles of water. Labour's Chuka Umunna, who represents Streatham, said he was ""astounded"" at the lack of a Government statement on the issue, adding that ""at the very least"" there should be ""some kind of public inquiry"".

""Yesterday over 20,000 homes across London and... many others across the rest of the country were left without water. ""My consistency is served by Thames Water. While the snows, the freeze, the thaw has posed huge challenges, Ofwat this afternoon has said that these companies have fallen far short in forward planning, giving the right support and communication to people."" Labour colleague Helen Hayes, who represents the neighbouring constituency of Dulwich and West Norwood, told the Commons: ""Thousands of my constituents have been without water over the weekend, some since last Thursday. ""During that time they have been unable to contact Thames Water by telephone or via the website and they have not received any information on when supply will be restored or how to obtain bottled water."" She added: ""This is a national crisis in our water industry and it is clear that the industry is not fit for purpose."" As well as properties in London, thousands of premises in the South East, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, the North West, Yorkshire, the South West and the Midlands have been affected. Both Jaguar Land Rover and Cadbury have seen production at UK plants hit as a result. Many customers across the UK have been urged to use as little water as possible while the problems are fixed."

Wiggins' use of triamcinolone to treat an allergy ahead of the Tour was made public in 2016 when Russian hackers targeted the World Anti-Doping Agency. It emerged that the British cycling hero had obtained Therapeutic Use Exemptions, or TUEs, before the Tour in 2011 and 2012 and before the 2013 Giro d'Italia, so he could legally take the steroid before racing. The report states: ""We believe that this powerful corticosteroid was being used to prepare Bradley Wiggins, and possibly other riders supporting him, for the Tour de France. ""The purpose of this was not to treat medical need, but to improve his power to weight ratio ahead of the race. ""In this case, and contrary to the testimony of David Brailsford in front of the committee, we believe that drugs were being used by Team Sky, within the WADA rules, to enhance the performance of riders, and not just to treat medical need."" Responding to the report, Wiggins said: ""I find it so sad that accusations can be made, where people can be accused of things they have never done which are then regarded as facts. ""I strongly refute the claim that any drug was used without medical need. ""I hope to have my say in the next few days and put to my side across."" Triamcinolone is used to treat severe allergies and asthma, but has been found to reduce weight and help muscles recovery more quickly after exercise. The MPs are now calling for it and the painkiller Tramadol to be banned from sport by WADA. Wiggins no longer rides for Team Sky and now runs his own team. Team Sky said in a statement that they ""strongly refute"" the claim that medication has been used to enhance performance. A spokesman added: ""The report also includes an allegation of widespread Triamcinolone use by Team Sky riders ahead of the 2012 Tour de France. ""Again, we strongly refute this allegation. ""We are surprised and disappointed that the committee has chosen to present an anonymous and potentially malicious claim in this way, without presenting any evidence or giving us an opportunity to respond."" He added that Team Sky is committed to ""creating an environment where riders can perform to the best of their ability, and do it clean""."
2018-03-05,"Samsung's S9 was always going to be the only Android phone that could compete with the hype and fanfare around Apple's launch of the iPhone X - but now that both mobiles are out, how do they compare?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180306050238/https://news.sky.com/story/the-samsung-s9-vs-the-iphone-x-how-do-they-compare-11277161,"Immediately the ¬£999 iPhone X is considerably more expensive than the ¬£739 smartphone offered by Samsung, but both come as premiums to their previous generations. This hasn't manifested in a size change for Samsung. Just like the S8, the S9 measures 5.8in (14.6cm) from corner to corner - the standard method for measuring rectangular smartphones. The iPhone X has a 5.8in display too, well up on the 4.7in display on the iPhone 8 - and even larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, which measures only 5.5in from corner to corner. The iPhone's ""edge-to-edge"" screen had been highly anticipated, but the ""notch"" in its front was widely seen as aesthetic misstep. The S9 is the sleeker phone, and Samsung's design team have finally done away with the rear location of its fingerprint sensor, which constantly caused the phone's users to smudge the lens. A fingerprint sensor is completely missing from the iPhone X, however, which is 11 grams heavier than the rival smartphone. In other areas, Samsung retains the classical port for a headphone jack - something which iPhone users have been missing for a number of models. Following Apple's lead, the Samsung S9 also aims to offer a facial recognition-based unlocking system. Researchers have found that Samsung's facial unlocking mechanism doesn't function as well as Apple's - a detail seemingly confirmed by Samsung in not allowing the security feature to be used with Samsung Pay. The S9 is the flagship Android for the next generation of Android's augmented reality (AR) capabilities - a subject of great delight and investment for most vendors. Last August, both Google and Apple showcased new AR tools available for Android and iOS devices, allowing users to digitally superimpose objects onto the world around them through their phones. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook described the iPhone X as ""the future of smartphones"", and stressed in August how AR was ""big and profound"" and was ""one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it."" Meanwhile, marvel indeed at both the Samsung S9's and the iPhone X's feature allowing users to animate emojis with their facial expressions. Apple calls this feature an ""animoji"" while the S9 lets users create an ""AR emoji"" - although the AR emojis are closer to avatars which the S9 generates from a photograph of the user's face."

""Britain needs to go on a diet,"" said Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE. ""The simple truth is on average we need to eat less. ""Children and adults routinely eat too many calories and it is why so many are overweight or obese. ""Industry can help families by finding innovative ways to lower the calories in the food we all enjoy. ""It is not an attack on overweight folk, it is about getting more options and extending knowledge and more choices."" PHE is also launching a campaign to encourage people to control calories, proposing a ""rule for thumb"" of 400 calories for breakfast and 600 each for lunch and dinner. They say major fast-food chains including McDonalds, Subway and Greggs have signed up to the ""400-600-600"" plan and agreed to ""signpost"" customers towards lower-calorie options. ""We are talking to big companies that make the big-selling products, both ready meals and out-of-home food,"" said chief nutritionist Alison Tedstone. ""A few healthy options at the end of a menu will not end the obesity crisis. ""We need the everyday products to change."" Research by PHE estimates that some children eat between 290 and 500 unnecessary calories every day, the equivalent of an extra meal. Processed food, ready meals and those eaten away from the home account for 50% of all calories consumed, and 19% of those eaten by children. Producers have been asked to cut the calories in 13 processed food categories including pizzas, savoury snacks, soups, meats, potato and pasta meals, and ""composite"" salads such as hummus. Suppliers will be encouraged to ""reformulate"" their recipes to cut calories or reduce portion size to meet the targets, which are voluntary. Last year PHE launched a similar sugar reduction program which, combined with a new levy on soft drink and the food program, will target 50% of the calories consumed by children. PHE estimated the programs could save the NHS ¬£4.8bn over the next 25 years, a further ¬£4.2bn in social care costs and prevent 35,000 early deaths. Obesity and related conditions including Type 2 diabetes and some cancers cost the NHS ¬£6bn every year, as well as ""keeping people out of work, stifling their earnings and wider economic productivity""."

Ms Maiklem shared the pictures on her London Mudlark Facebook page, which prompted other people to post their own photographs.

Responding to his Facebook post, Natalie Garrett wrote: ""Thankfully there are millions of starfish around the Kent coast and they breed like rabbits, but it's sad to see this kind of scene."" The Marine Conservation Society said on its website: ""The cause appears to be a combination of the extreme cold (where shallow water has frozen, or come close to freezing) and the depth at which storm waves have penetrated. ""UK marine life is usually well-suited to cope with cold. Soft bodied anemones thrive in fast-moving currents, and crab and lobster tend to move from the shore into deeper water to avoid storms.

2018-03-05,"London is by far the most unequal region in Britain, with a greater slice of the nation's poorest and richest residents than anywhere else.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180306050238/https://news.sky.com/story/revealed-london-is-the-most-unequal-place-in-the-uk-11275891,"New research for Sky News, carried out by the Office for National Statistics, has revealed that the value of property owned by households in the capital has gone above ¬£1tn for the first time, with more than a fifth of London households having total wealth of more than ¬£1m. But almost exactly the same proportion of Londoners live in the poorest households, with total wealth of under ¬£20,000. The term wealth includes the value of equity you have in a property, as well as savings, pension pot and possessions. Sky News analysis shows pronounced regional variations, with households in South East England having more than double the wealth of those in the North East. Scottish and Welsh households have, on average, more money than regions in the North of England or in either the West or East Midlands. Our research shows that the poorest households in Britain are single-parent families in Wales and London. In both regions, couples with dependent children have 20 times the household wealth of single-parent families. The richest are those inhabited by pensioners in London and the South East. And there is one slice of society that now has median average wealth of well over ¬£1m: households in the South East with no children, and where one resident is above pension age and the other below it. Their average wealth is ¬£1,139,000 - the highest in the country. Across London and the South East, about one in five households has a wealth of more than ¬£1m - a much higher proportion than anywhere else in the country. These two regions now account for 43% of the value of all properties across the UK, even though they only include around a quarter of the nation's households. That means that people who own, or partly own, a property in either of those regions are very likely to have more property wealth than their counterparts in the rest of the country. For the first time, our analysis has confirmed that London households now own property worth more than ¬£1tn, and it is that property wealth that has boosted the capital's bank accounts, as well as sharpening the distinction between the city's haves and have-nots. High property values also mean that the cost of living in the South East is higher than the rest of the country. As part of our research, we looked closely at differences across the nation. An economic model, called the Gini Coefficient, is used to analyse inequality in societies around the world. It runs from 0, where everything is owned equally, to 1, which means one person owns everything. We already know that Britain as a whole scores 0.62, but what about the different regions? Sky News commissioned the ONS to use that method to build a picture of inequality across Britain. What we discovered if that London is the most unequal place in the country with a Gini score of 0.67. At the other end of the scale, the South West of England comes out as the most equal region - it scores 0.56. But the single most unequal slice of the entire British economy is actually the property market in the North East of England, which returns a remarkable Gini score of 0.97, suggesting that huge amounts of property wealth is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of people."

As a result, she has an eight-page criminal record with prostitution convictions, despite being a juvenile when she was first convicted. She is one of a group which took their fight to the High Court to prevent offences they were trafficked into from showing on DBS checks completed by employers. The High Court has now ruled that being forced to disclose these convictions is ""disproportionate, a breach to right to private life and unlawful"". Ms Broadfoot told Sky News: ""I feel absolutely amazing, this has been a really long battle. I have experienced a lot of ill health due to the documents, so not only the abuse but the problems of reliving it. ""Now I can move on and have a dignified life."" Ms Broadfoot said she had previously only applied for jobs with friends because they would understand the full picture, but said she knew of other victims who felt unable to apply for work because of their past. She said: ""It is incredible for all the women who were silenced, for all those who live in misery because they are frightened of it coming up, this is fabulous. ""We may have won the battle but we have not won the war. ""I think we have got to fight the law to get the focus onto the pimps and traffickers, the people who are committing these crimes."" Ms Broadfoot is now continuing her work on the issue through her Build a Girl project, and said she is focused on campaigning for better sex and relationships education within schools. She said: ""I would love to see my project rolled out nationally. The survivor voice is crucial in the way we approach issues. I have met amazing professionals, but there is a missing piece, we should be valued. ""We should be teaching boys and girls about healthy relationships, not waiting to mop up the misery when they are abused."" She added the focus shouldn't be on the ""scary stuff"", but on ensuring young people know the boundaries. After the ruling, the lawyer for the three women who brought the case, Harriet Wistrich, said: ""This is an important judgment. ""Although there were only three claimants in this case, the judgment will benefit all women in these circumstances and has the potential to bring about real change for a sex trade survivors who should never have been criminalised in the first place."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We have noted the decision of the court. We will now be considering the details of the court's decision. ""The protection of children and other vulnerable groups remains a key priority of this Government and the Disclosure and Barring scheme is a vital part of these efforts."" Last month, the Home Office announced it was launching a ¬£13m fund to assist youth workers, police, nurses and other professionals to form protective relationships with children and young people at risk of sexual exploitation, gang crime or relationship abuse.

Speaking after a meeting of top football officials in Zurich, Mr Glenn said it was ""highly divisive"" and attempted to justify the charge against Guardiola by including the Jewish religious symbol and the Nazi icon among a list of ""political symbols"" that the FA did not want displayed on ""football equipment"". :: FIFA lifts ban on poppies on football kits ""We have re-written Law 4 of the game so that things like a poppy are okay, but things that are going to be highly divisive, and that could be strong religious symbols, it could be the Star of David, it could the hammer and sickle, it could be a swastika, anything like Robert Mugabe on your shirt, these are the things we don't want,"" he explained. ""And, to be honest, and to be very clear, Pep Guardiola's yellow ribbon is a political symbol, it's a symbol of Catalan independence, and I can tell you there are many more Spaniards, non-Catalans, who are p***** off by it. ""All we are doing is evenhandedly applying the laws of the game. Poppies are not political symbols, that yellow ribbon is. Where do you draw the line? Should we have someone with a UKIP badge, someone with an ISIS badge?"" :: New UKIP logo lands party in Premier League copyright row Simon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, said: ""I have no problem with the FA clarifying Law 4 and specifying that all religious symbols are prohibited on a kit if that is the case, but, in explaining that decision, the CEO of the FA's examples are ill judged and in poor taste,"" he said. ""The Star of David is a Jewish religious symbol of immense importance to Jews worldwide. To put it in the same bracket as the swastika and Robert Mugabe is offensive and inappropriate."" Mr Glenn has since made a personal apology to the Jewish Leadership Council and anti-racism organisation Kick It Out, which Mr Johnson said had been accepted. :: FA has 'lost the trust of the public' He added: ""I spoke to Martin Glenn today. I explained why his comments yesterday has caused such serious offence. ""Martin apologised, explained the context for his comments and stated that he did not intend to cause offence, which I accepted. We have agreed to meet soon along with the CST (Community Security Trust, a charity which supports British Jews). I have thanked the FA for their apology and I am glad that this has been dealt with swiftly."" Mr Glenn had been speaking ahead of the deadline for Guardiola to respond to his charge, which is 6pm on Monday. Last week the Spaniard said he will only stop wearing the ribbon if Manchester City officials ask him to, or if it adversely affects his side's Premier League-leading form. He said: ""When men and women put on a red (pink) ribbon it's because of the support for the breast cancer initiative. The same as when I wear the prostate cancer badge. The idea is the same."""
2018-03-05,Relatives of those who died in the Grenfell fire last June have been allowed inside the tower.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180306050238/https://news.sky.com/story/nephew-of-grenfell-tower-victim-returns-to-uncles-flat-for-first-time-since-fire-11277765,"Karim Mussilhy today traced the final steps of his uncle, Hesham Rahman, who lived on the top floor of the tower. He told Sky News his story.  I wanted to go up to his flat to say a prayer where he died. I went up alone because other members of my family weren't able to make the journey and this is the only way they could have seen his final resting place properly. We were wearing a helmet, a mask, a forensic suit with wellies and two pairs of gloves and we had everything taped to us so nothing could get in or out. I went up with nine other people - a safety officer, paramedics, psychiatrists, police officers and my family liaison officer. As soon as we got to the staircase, I just remember thinking ""oh my God this is tiny"". And I couldn't comprehend how people were going up or down these stairs. If I was to stand next to someone side by side, we'd struggle to walk up together. So I was really, really scared and I almost didn't do it but I just kept trying to think ""be strong, this is for the family"". We started with the fourth floor where the fire had started and you couldn't really tell a fire had started there, as far as I could tell on the staircase. It just looked really dirty but everything looked fine. And it sort of got worse bit by bit up until the 10th floor, and after that it was just blackness. The 11th floor and every floor after that it was like someone had painted the walls black. The higher you got the darker it got. You could see some of the light fixtures had melted. I could even see people's hands, fingerprints sliding across the wall. Whether they were from people on the way down, I don't know. :: Grenfell: The victims Every step I took, I just kept thinking who was on this floor, who made it out, who am I stepping over, am I stepping over where someone was resting in their final moments? I knew my uncle was on his sofa in his last moments but I couldn't get to it as it wasn't safe - there were cracks on the floor, there were no walls, it was just one big room. I said a prayer, I had a cry and then I remembered that he wouldn't want me to cry, he always hated that. I tried to compose myself as much as I could but I could feel their terror, I could feel their helplessness. A video emerged on social media and you could hear him comforting a young girl, no older than five or six. This girl was calling out for her Dad, saying that the fire was making her scared. And then you can hear my uncle saying to her ""don't cry, don't be scared, it's going to be okay"". My family is holding on to that so, so much. It makes us feel like he was a hero in some way. He didn't want me in his flat crying being upset. That I felt 100%. My uncle hated it. Like he said in one of his poems, he doesn't want tears or flowers. Just smiles of the memories we had together. :: Long Read: Grenfell: Britain's fire safety crisis I think he would have appreciated why I went up and did what I did but I got a sense that he didn't want me there for too long. And as soon as I got that feeling, I had to leave. I remember when I came out they were taking off my stuff and I was shaking. People were talking to me from every angle and I was just numb. My brain was just trying to process what I'd experienced. I felt for the first time, I got a feeling of actually understanding what it was like. It was painful. Blackness, death and terror, that's all I kept feeling. Helplessness. People scared and helpless with no way out. These people lost their lives in the most horrific way and I still don't feel people understand fully. It's important people know why we are screaming and shouting and saying our voices are not being heard. It's important people understand this isn't just a fire, this is bigger than Grenfell Tower now. Everyone in this country should be looking at what is going to happen now because no one should ever have to go through this, no one should be unsafe in their homes. Today was definitely one of the worse I've had. That night of the fire, getting the phone call that he'd never made it out and that he wasn't in any hospital, and today. These were the worst days. I don't want to go through it again. My uncle was a kind man. I learnt how to be a kind and decent human being through him. People say time heals and it gets easier, but on this occasion, it's definitely not getting easier. It's made things more real. If I have to go into this mass graveyard of terror and death for you guys to come and get a glimpse of what I experienced to keep us talking about it so that people actually do something, then I will. Thoughts and prayers are great but we need action now. We need a change because I tell you now if nothing happens there will be another Grenfell Tower."

2018-03-06,Porn star Stormy Daniels is suing US President Donald Trump in relation to an alleged affair.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/porn-star-stormy-daniels-sues-donald-trump-11279436,"Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claims she had sex with Mr Trump once before the pair embarked on a platonic relationship that lasted for years. She alleges that, as a result of her efforts to talk about their relationship, she was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement and was paid $130,000 (¬£93,000). Ms Daniels, from Texas, wants a California judge to invalidate the agreement, however, saying it is ""null and void and of no consequence"" because Mr Trump did not sign it. The papers, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claim that the two began an ""intimate relationship"" in the summer of 2006 in Lake Tahoe and this continued ""well into the year 2007"". Mr Trump announced his intention to run for president in 2015 and has denied having an affair with Ms Daniels. In October 2016, a video was published with Mr Trump making lewd remarks about women, prompting a number of women to come forward to talk about their encounters with him. Ms Daniels had ""likewise sought to share details concerning her relationship and encounters"" with him, the papers say. Her efforts to publicise her experience came to the attention of Mr Trump and his campaign, including Michael Cohen, who worked for the Trump Organisation from 2007 and is currently the president's personal attorney. According to Ms Daniels, Mr Cohen had ""aggressively sought to silence (her) as part of an effort to avoid her telling the truth"". He had prepared what is described in the court papers as ""the Hush Agreement"" just weeks before the 2016 presidential election, using aliases for both parties (Ms Daniels was called Peggy Peterson and Mr Trump was David Dennison). But Mr Trump did not sign the agreement, something Ms Daniels claimed was done ""purposely...so he could later, if need be, publicly disavow any knowledge of the Hush Agreement and (her)"". In February this year, Mr Cohen had talked publicly about using his own money to pay Ms Daniels, an action that her lawsuit alleges were a breach of the agreement's conditions. He said he had paid $130,000 (¬£93,000) out of his own pocket to Ms Daniels, whose alleged affair with Mr Trump happened before he was elected. Mr Cohen claimed he was never reimbursed for the payment in 2016 and neither the Trump Organisation nor Mr Trump's campaign team were involved."
2018-03-06,"MPs have called for a public inquiry after 20,000 homes in London were left without water.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/furious-mps-demand-water-industry-inquiry-after-thousands-left-without-water-11277991,"Homes and businesses affected are having to use bottled water while work continues to fix leaks and repair burst pipes following a thaw in temperatures after last week's cold weather. In the Commons, Thames Water was criticised for failing to contact residents and tell them how they could collect bottles of water. Labour's Chuka Umunna, who represents Streatham, said he was ""astounded"" at the lack of a Government statement on the issue, adding that ""at the very least"" there should be ""some kind of public inquiry"". We're pumping an extra 500 million litres of water a day ‚Äì the equivalent of 200 Olympic swimming pools ‚Äì through its network to bring all customers back into supply - more info on what we're doing here: https://t.co/UfECIulsdw pic.twitter.com/kLALZZbdyr Raising a point of order, Mr Umunna said: ""Over the last few years there have been several major water leaks, burst water mains causing severe disruption to my constituents meaning that they can't wash, they can't cook, they can't do the basic things we take for granted. ""Yesterday over 20,000 homes across London and... many others across the rest of the country were left without water. ""My consistency is served by Thames Water. While the snows, the freeze, the thaw has posed huge challenges, Ofwat this afternoon has said that these companies have fallen far short in forward planning, giving the right support and communication to people."" Labour colleague Helen Hayes, who represents the neighbouring constituency of Dulwich and West Norwood, told the Commons: ""Thousands of my constituents have been without water over the weekend, some since last Thursday. ""During that time they have been unable to contact Thames Water by telephone or via the website and they have not received any information on when supply will be restored or how to obtain bottled water."" She added: ""This is a national crisis in our water industry and it is clear that the industry is not fit for purpose."" As well as properties in London, thousands of premises in the South East, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, the North West, Yorkshire, the South West and the Midlands have been affected. Both Jaguar Land Rover and Cadbury have seen production at UK plants hit as a result. Many customers across the UK have been urged to use as little water as possible while the problems are fixed."
2018-03-06,"The government has indicated to Sky News that British consumers may have to pay roaming and data charges when travelling in the EU after Brexit, unless a deal can be reached.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/roaming-charges-may-be-back-after-brexit-11279406,"British travellers have not had to pay these charges on their mobile phone bills since June 2017, when they were abolished after changes to European regulation. The costs were considerable- an estimated ¬£350 million per year. Last week the Prime Minister confirmed that the UK would leave the EU's Digital Single Market (DSM). The DSM aims to eliminate digital regulatory barriers between EU member states, including data roaming charges. The PM said in her Mansion House speech: ""The UK will not be part of the EU's Digital Single Market, which will continue to develop after our withdrawal from the EU."" ""This is a fast evolving, innovative sector, in which the UK is a world leader. It will be particularly important to have domestic flexibility, to ensure the regulatory environment can always respond nimbly and ambitiously to new developments."" Until last week, the government had not confirmed that Britain will be leaving the DSM. Last night, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport confirmed to Sky News that this would likely entail the restoration of roaming charges, unless a deal could be reached.A government spokesman said: ""The Government is committed to securing the best deal for British consumers. ""Arrangements on mobile roaming would be subject to any negotiations, however, a future partnership between the UK and EU is clearly in the interests of both sides.""The government also said that consumers will have become accustomed to enjoying their mobile phones without extra charges for over two years by Brexit day and that this would ""drive consumer expectation and behaviour"".They also pointed to the fact that two operators, Vodafone and Three, have publicly committed to not reimposing charges. However, this idea has not been viewed favourably by most telecoms companies. In late 2016, Sharon White, Chief Executive of OfCom said that leaving the EU without putting alternative arrangements in place would mean ""our mobile operators may be exposed to unfair costs, and our people and businesses could end up paying more than our European neighbours"". The House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee has also said they don't believe that mobile operators will be able to choose not to reimpose charges - technical reasons will mean their operating costs will be pushed up considerably after being pushed out of the European regulatory framework. In terms of finding other arrangements, there really is no precedent for extending roaming charge abolition to non-EU countries. One suggestion has been a bilateral agreement between the EU and the UK, but EU Commissioner G√ºnther Oettinger told the European Parliament that a standalone UK-EU roaming agreement would be in breach of World Trade Organisation rules. Another idea has been adopting the status quo into a Free Trade Agreement, however, no free trade agreement to date has incorporated roaming regulation. That is even the case with Switzerland which enjoys extensive economic links and integration with the EU. The only countries which enjoy travelling without roaming charges in the EU are countries like Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein but they are in the single market through membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the PM has ruled this out for Britain. British travellers may have to start thinking about leaving their phones on airplane mode beyond the tarmac of the runway."
2018-03-06,"More than 131 years after being thrown overboard, the world's oldest message in a bottle has washed up on a beach in western Australia.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/worlds-oldest-message-in-a-bottle-found-on-coast-of-western-australia-11278657,"The bottle was found by Tonya Illman and Grace Ricciardo in the dunes near Wedge Island in January. Weeks of research and correspondence crafted a Sherlock-style web of clues that traced the historic note back to 19th century Germany. The survival of the document has been heralded as a miracle, as the bottle was found wedged in the sand and without a lid after heavy rain and strong winds on the island, some 112 miles north of Perth. Mrs Illman and her husband Kym placed the note in an oven to dry it out before unravelling it to reveal a set of coordinates and a date of 12 June 1886. Mr Illman's German was not quite good enough to deduce much more of the text, other than the letters ""aula"" in a naming field, which he guessed might mean the ship was called Paula. From there the real investigative work began, and three days later the couple received confirmation from a curator of maritime archaeology at the Western Australian Museum that a boat named Paula was listed in an 1883 Lloyds Register, with a home port of Marseille. It was a 320-ton German barque ship, later found to be on a voyage from Cardiff to what is now known as Indonesia. But the French port listed in the register appeared to contradict the port written on the note, which started with an ""E"". It was suggested that the vessel could have been sold to new owners after 1883 and moved to a new home, and that theory was given merit by German maritime historian Christine Porr. She advised the Illmans that one of her contacts had found mentions of Paula, along with a captain ""O Diekmann"", in an 1887 journal of German Marine Meteorology. Another reference to Paula was found in an 1886 Registrar Veritas, which listed ""Haverkamp"" as captain, and confirmed the home port as Elsfleth in Germany. Further evidence was provided by the German Maritime and Hydrographic Agency, who confirmed the wording and printing were identical to messages held in their archives for the year 1886. With the Australian museum having determined that the note was ""consistent with cheaply made 19th century paper"", the German agency concluded that it was genuine. As luck would have it, the note turned out to have originated from the agency itself, which back in 1886 was known as Deutsche Seewarte. The bottle - thought to have originally held gin - was thrown overboard alongside many others during a decades-long research programme to produce drift maps. According to agency archives, the last one to have been found was picked up in Denmark in January 1934 - and it was a match for the format of the one found on the Australian coast. ""This has been the most remarkable event of my life,"" said Mrs Illman. ""To think that this bottle has not been touched for nearly 132 years and is in perfect condition, despite the elements, beggars belief."" Her husband added: ""It certainly consumed me for the first week. ""It was like solving a giant puzzle - and now that it's been confirmed as legitimate, I can't wait to share our excitement with others."" Once confirmed by Guinness World Records, it will beat the existing record for the world's oldest message in bottle by 23 years. That was found at Amrum Island, Germany, in April 2015, more than 108 years after it was released into the North Sea by the Marine Biological Association in November 1906. A one shilling reward was offered for its return."

""Children and adults routinely eat too many calories and it is why so many are overweight or obese. ""Industry can help families by finding innovative ways to lower the calories in the food we all enjoy.

PHE is also launching a campaign to encourage people to control calories, proposing a ""rule for thumb"" of 400 calories for breakfast and 600 each for lunch and dinner. They say major fast-food chains including McDonalds, Subway and Greggs have signed up to the ""400-600-600"" plan and agreed to ""signpost"" customers towards lower-calorie options.

Some 2.1 tonnes was exported from the UK, making it responsible for 67.7% of the world total, followed by the Netherlands (16.4%). A drug policy reform lobby group has criticised the UK government, saying they have ""consistently refused to allow medical cannabis in the UK on the basis that it has 'no therapeutic value'"". Steve Rolles, Transform's senior policy analyst said: ""It is scandalous and untenable for the UK government to maintain that cannabis has no medical uses, at the same time as licensing the world's biggest government-approved medical cannabis production and export market. ""UK patients are either denied access and suffering unnecessarily, or are forced to buy cannabis from the criminal market. ""Countries with proper access to medical cannabis do not have this problem, as standardised cannabis products are in the hands of doctors and pharmacists.""

2018-03-06,Shamed former Co-operative Bank boss Paul Flowers has been banned from the financial services industry by the City watchdog - five years after the lender nearly collapsed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/former-co-op-bank-boss-paul-flowers-banned-by-city-watchdog-11278328,"Mr Flowers, who chaired the bank for three years, was forced to step down following allegations he bought and used illegal drugs, and claimed inappropriate expenses. The ruling from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) came as the Treasury announced an investigation into the oversight of the bank between 2008 and 2013 - described by a leading MP as ""hugely overdue"". Mr Flowers had faced accusations of incompetence after the lender was found to have a ¬£1.5bn black hole in its finances, resulting in it having to be rescued by US hedge funds. The former Methodist minister was later fined ¬£400 after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine, ketamine and crystal meth - leading him to being dubbed ""the Crystal Methodist"" in the press. An investigation by the FCA has now found that he used his work phone to make a number of inappropriate telephone calls to a premium rate chat line. It also revealed that he had used his work email account to send and receive ""sexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages"" and to discuss buying and using cocaine, GHB and ketamine, despite having previously been warned over his conduct. The watchdog concluded that Mr Flowers ""demonstrated a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services"". It also said he had shown an unwillingness to comply with the standards of the FCA and other legal and professional requirements, demonstrating a ""lack of integrity"". In its ruling, the FCA said Mr Flowers had explained that his actions, in June 2013, had ""occurred in the context of difficult personal circumstances and pressures he was under at the time"". But the FCA said it did not consider that these ""provide an adequate explanation or justification for his misconduct"". A former board member at the bank told the watchdog his behaviour was ""ridiculous"" and ""a million miles away from the values of the Co-operative Society"" as well as contradicting the ""strong ethical image of the bank"". Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and oversight at the FCA, said: ""Mr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. ""These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals."" The FCA launched its investigation into Mr Flowers in the autumn of 2015. Watchdogs have also censured two Co-op Bank executives since the lender's near collapse. Mr Flowers was removed from the list of Methodist ministers last year. With the conclusion of the FCA's investigation, the Treasury has appointed Mark Zelmer, a former leading official at Canada's financial watchdog, to lead an independent review into the regulatory supervision of the lender in the run-up to its near collapse."

Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of counter terrorism policing, said that while events in Salisbury were being taken ""extremely seriously"", officers did not think there was any current risk to the wider public. :: LIVE: May leads security meeting after Russian spy's suspected poisoning Theresa May chaired a meeting of the National Security Council on Monday. The PM and senior ministers were also updated following another meeting of senior government officials earlier in the day, Downing Street said. :: Who is Russian double agent Sergei Skripal? Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in intensive care at Salisbury District Hospital. He was convicted in Russia of spying for MI6 in 2006, and later given refuge in the UK as part of a spy swap. Yulia currently works for Pepsico in Moscow, according to her Facebook account, after moving to Britain for a few years in 2010. A picture has emerged of what is believed to be Mr Scripal and his daughter shortly before they were found ""unconscious on a bench"" at The Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. A witness who saw them has spoken to Sky News. She said: ""They were just slumped. They were comfortable, they weren't in any pain or anything. Lifeless, if you like. ""When you walked past, they didn't even acknowledge that you've walked past. They just stayed slumped.""

The Russian embassy, meanwhile, has accused the media of ""launching a new phase of the anti-Russian campaign ongoing in the UK"". ""Readers are offered various speculations which ultimately lead to a vilification of Russia,"" it claimed. In a statement, the embassy added that the police and other British authorities had not provided it with ""any official information regarding this incident"". ""The Foreign Office has not given any notifications either,"" it said. It urged British authorities to ""step in immediately"" to ""end the demonisation of Russia"". But Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs the case of Mr Skripal and his daughter had ""echoes"" of the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Mr Litvinenko, a Russian dissident, was fatally poisoned in London in 2006. Answering an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Johnson said that ""should evidence emerge that implies state responsibility, then Her Majesty's Government will respond appropriately and robustly"". Russia was ""in many respects a malign and disruptive force"", he added. :: Burgers and tea: How poison is hitman's weapon of choice Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, the Russian embassy said he had spoken ""in such a manner as if the investigation was already over and Russia was found responsible for what happened in Salisbury"". A former associate of Mr Litvinenko claimed the incident in Salisbury bore the hallmarks of a state-ordered assassination. Historian Yuri Felshtinsky said that ""poisoning is the method of choice for the FSB"" (Russia's Federal Security Service). But Andrey Lugovoy, who was one of two men accused of poisoning Mr Litvinenko, told Sky News that Russia ""had no interest in Skripal any more - that's why he was swapped"". ""I said and I repeat now that neither I nor the Russian secret service killed Litvinenko,"" he added."
2018-03-06,The proportion of young women studying science in further education is dramatically lower compared to girls in schools. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/wanted-more-budding-female-scientists-to-tackle-gender-gap-11278649,"Here, Dame Mary Archer, chair of the Science Museum Group, explains how famous figures from history can inspire a new generation of female scientists. I have always loved science. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by understanding what things are made of and motivated by curiosity to find out for myself. I did my first experiment at the age of seven. It involved a worm and I'm afraid the worm did not come off very well. Children are naturally curious and investing in this instinct ensures the best training for scientists. Their work is to carefully interrogate ideas in methodical ways to make breakthroughs that have the potential to help us live better, healthier and more fulfilling lives. It is interesting and noble work and the prospect of being a scientist led me to study chemistry at university. But that is where I became unusual. Children are roughly 50/50 when it comes to gender and all children who go to school study science to some level. :: Vote: Who is Britain's most influential woman? But when you look at the numbers choosing to study sciences in further education, the proportion of young women drops dramatically. This is something we are working hard to address across the Science Museum Group but we have to do more. More to increase gender equality in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) careers in the UK. It is critically important for our economy and to develop crucial industries for the next generation. When you look at the history of STEM, there are tales of intrepid endeavours and amazing discoveries. Most of the best known are by men, with only a handful of female names remaining in the public consciousness. But I think of inspirational women like Ada Lovelace, the 19th century mathematician who worked on a general purpose computer, or Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space and still the only one to complete a solo space flight. Amy Johnson, the first female pilot to fly solo from Britain to Australia whose illustrious career set many records, and British Nobel Prize-winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, whose discoveries are essential for modern medicine, are also names that immediately come to mind. In recent decades, we have seen a growth in the opportunities for women to establish long and successful careers in science and the number of individuals and organisations working to support this increase. Films like Hidden Figures and people like Moumita Dutta at the Indian Space Research Organisation help young women to see formidable female role models in space science. Initiatives like the Year of Engineering and the Science Museum's Engineer Your Future gallery show that women are leading and contributing to some of the most valuable scientific and technological advancements of the day. But we can and must do more to help girls and young women feel that science is truly for them. :: Dame Mary Archer is chair of the board of trustees of the Science Museum Group."

And as Sergei Skripal and his daughter fight for life in hospital in Salisbury, Theresa May is likely to be quizzed by MPs at Prime Minister's Questions about the suspected poisoning and other deaths. The Cobra meeting, which will be attended by senior Cabinet ministers, police and intelligence chiefs, comes less than 24 hours after a hastily-arranged meeting of the National Security Council in Downing Street. The crisis has also plunged Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson into a major diplomatic row with Vladimir Putin after he told MPs Russia was ""malign"" and suggested England could boycott this summer's World Cup. The MP for Salisbury, John Glen, attempted to reassure alarmed constituents in the normally tranquil cathedral city by tweeting: ""My thoughts and prayers this evening are with my constituent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. ""We still do not know all the facts but we do know that a terrible human tragedy took place on the streets of Salisbury on Sunday. ""The Government is now doing all it can to find out exactly what happened. ""The National Security Council met today (Tuesday) and the Home Secretary is chairing the Cobra committee tomorrow morning. ""No stone will be left unturned in the investigation and bringing those responsible to justice."" :: Who is Russian double agent Sergei Skripal? The call on the Home Secretary to order a probe into earlier suspicious Russian-linked deaths comes from senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee. In a letter headed ""Review of deaths with allegations of state responsibility"", Ms Cooper steps up pressure on the Government for an inquiry following exchanges with the Foreign Secretary in the Commons earlier. ""I asked the Foreign Secretary to discuss with you a review by the National Crime Agency (NCA), or another appropriate entity, into 14 deaths that have not been treated as suspicious by the UK police, but have - reportedly - been identified by United States intelligence sources as potentially connected to the Russian state,"" Ms Cooper writes. ""The Foreign Secretary agreed to discuss this with you, and I am writing to request a response on these matters as soon as possible."" :: Burgers and tea: How poison is hitman's weapon of choice In her letter, Ms Cooper quotes a report claiming US intelligence has informed the British Government that a Russian whistleblower - Alexander Perepilichnyy, who died in Surrey in 2012 - was likely killed under orders by the Russian state. She also suggests that a further 13 people, including an associate of Alexander Litvinenko, Boris Berezovsky, were also likely killed on British soil. But she complains: ""Yet the UK authorities have ruled out suspicious circumstances in these cases, often concluding that suicide or natural causes was the explanation."" :: Boris Johnson called pathetic over 2018 Russia World Cup threat :: Is spy 'poisoning' Russia vendetta or rogue mission? Ms Cooper points out that the Foreign Secretary noted the Perepilichnyy case in his answer to her question in the Commons, calling it one of a number of ""deeply troubling cases"". And she adds: ""You will be aware of reports of considerable concerning evidence about many of the 14 cases that raises serious doubts about the decisions made in each case to treat them either as suicides, natural causes or accidents. ""This reported evidence raises questions over the robustness of the police investigations. ""Surely a review of all these cases and the decisions made on them, in light of this further reported evidence, carried out by the NCA, would be a prudent course of action to ensure that - as the Foreign Secretary said today - no attempt on an innocent life on British soil should go un-investigated or unpunished."""

""Eventually the pains got so bad I thought I better go and see my GP. Maybe if I'd got it earlier and stopped it at the prostate, I'd be in a much better state."" The disease has spread to his legs, hips, pelvis and ribs.

""And a really positive message to come out of your experience: 'Go to the doctor get the test'."" Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Unlike other forms of cancer, it can develop slowly and without symptoms. An increased need to go to the toilet, or difficulty urinating, usually means the disease has spread. The cancer's cause is unknown, but it is most common in men who are more than 50 years old."

Witnesses said they heard a loud bang and saw flames, sparks and smoke pouring out of the station in Windsor Road. As it happened the area was plunged into darkness as all electricity was cut off to homes and businesses in the seaside resort near Redcar. Homes in Redcar, Teeside and Hartlepool were also affected. Tereena Haddow, who runs Saltburn Vets just metres away from the substation, ran outside and filmed the sparking building as plumes of smoke flew from it. She told the GazetteLive: ""We thought it was thunder at first. My husband came in though and said we better leave. ""Everyone is stood around stunned and people can't see.

The 30-year-old, who became the youngest ever Super League player when he played for St Helens aged just 16, fought off officers who struggled to arrest him for 50 minutes. At one point, an officer had him in a headlock and delivered a stun directly to his body but Moore was still able to fight them off. He grabbed the wires from the Taser, which had been deployed, and ripped them from his body. Moore then managed to grab the weapon, pointing it in the face of one officer, and shouted: ""You're getting it now!"" The terrified officer fought with Moore to release it from his hand and another officer struck him numerous times. He eventually dropped the Taser and following a further struggle was finally detained. Moore, of Lowton, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and three counts of assault. He was jailed for one year and 11 months on Tuesday and disqualified from driving for two years. Moore earned two England caps during a career which included stints with Castleford Tigers, Huddersfield Giants and the London Broncos. He last played for the Bradford Bulls before being released at the end of last season. Police dashcam footage captured Moore's black Mercedes overtaking a lorry at around 100mph on a stretch of roadworks near Boothstown where the speed limit was 30mph. He continued to accelerate at speeds of more than 150mph before speeding into a housing estate in Leigh and colliding with the wall of a house. The pursuit in the early hours of 15 October 2016 continued until it reached a dead end. As one officer went to arrest the suspect, Moore elbowed him and he ran off. Officers caught up with Moore but he resisted arrest for almost an hour, fighting them off until they were eventually able to handcuff him. Detective Constable Lynsey Watson-Perry said: ""In all their careers, the officers at the scene had never been so scared nor witnessed such a violent individual that had so much strength to fight. ""Moore knew exactly what he was doing, using his size and experience on the rugby field to evade officers in a desperate struggle that threatened both the safety of officers and innocent members of the public."""

Mr Cameron was told by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA) that he should not contact ministers or officials to discuss issues relating to genomics unless invited to do so by the Government. The ban is in place for two years from Mr Cameron's last day in ministerial office - the day he left 10 Downing Street on 13 July 2016. The former Conservative Party leader announced his work with California-based Illumina last month. In an article in The Times newspaper, Mr Cameron hailed the firm's ""incredible"" work while also describing the impact of his late son Ivan's diagnosis with a rare neurological disorder. He said: ""We were bowled over by the heroic attempts of doctors and nurses to treat and care for Ivan, but we were also reminded of how little we know about conditions such as epilepsy and some of its rare syndromes."" While in office, Mr Cameron set up Genomics England in 2013 to deliver the 100,000 Genomes Project, which aims to sequence 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients with rare diseases and their families, as well as patients with common cancers. Government-linked Genomics England has since entered into a ¬£77m partnership with Illumina. In a response to Mr Cameron's request for advice on his position with Illumina, ACOBA said neither the Cabinet Office or Department for Health have any concerns about the ""propriety of this appointment"". ACOBA also noted how the Department of Health found no evidence Mr Cameron had any involvement in the award of the Government contract to Illumina or held any direct meetings with the firm while in office. Mr Cameron assured the body that his role, which takes two to three days of his time per month, would not see him take part in contract negotiations between the firm and Genomics England. He also said he would not lobby ministers on the company's behalf. However, explaining their reasons for his lobbying ban, ACOBA judged Mr Cameron's ""status and influence"" as a former prime minister meant it would ""not be appropriate"" for him to instigate engagement with ministers and government officials. Mr Cameron has also been told he should not drawn on ""any privileged information"" available to him while in ministerial office, or advise any company on a bid for a government contract for the same two-year period since he left 10 Downing Street. Prior to becoming prime minister, Mr Cameron described lobbying as the ""next big scandal waiting to happen"" and set up a new register for lobbyists while in government. A number of Mr Cameron's former aides, who worked with him in Downing Street, have gone on to work in the lobbying industry. The Illumina role is the only position for which Mr Cameron is explicitly banned from contacting ministers or officials unless invited to do so. Since quitting as prime minister, Mr Cameron has also taken up other paid and unpaid roles with the UK-China Fund, the ONE campaign, First Data Corporation, the Council on Foreign Relations, the LSE-Oxford Commission on Growth in Fragile States, Alzheimer's Research UK, and the National Citizen Service. He has also registered with the Washington Speakers Bureau to give keynote speeches around the world."

Her appointment caused controversy last week because of Ms Bergdorf's previous social media comments, which had already led to her being sacked from a L'Oreal advertising campaign last year. In a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday, the activist described her ""great sadness"" at her resignation, which she blamed on ""endless attacks on my character by the conservative right-wing press and relentless online abuse"". Ms Bergdorf insisted she will ""refuse to be painted as a villain"", adding: ""I wanted my appointment to be something positive and exciting for the community, but instead it has turned into nasty tabloid fodder, blown out of all proportion."" The unpaid role on the LGBT advisory board saw Ms Bergdorf join other activists on the informal, consultative group, which does not have a formal role within the Labour Party. She added: ""I accepted a place on the board because I felt that it would be an exciting and effective way of helping to shed light on issues that I felt were being overlooked and hopefully push needs forward. ""I will not allow myself to be centred in this negative narrative, but more importantly I don't want to stand in the way of the board serving as a positive catalyst for change within the UK's LGBT communities."" She thanked Ms Butler for being ""nothing but supportive"". Ms Bergdorf's appointment saw Conservative Party vice chair Helen Grant write to Ms Butler - urging her to ""reconsider"". The Tory MP highlighted ""concerning language"" in Ms Bergdorf's past comments, which included a Facebook post in the wake of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where an anti-racism protester was killed at a white supremacist rally last year. At the time, Ms Bergdorf wrote: ""Honestly I don't have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people."" L'Oreal subsequently announced they had ended their partnership with Ms Bergdorf, their first transgender model in the UK, as her comments were ""at odds with our values"". Following the row over her appointment to the Labour advisory board, Ms Bergdorf attempted to explain her previous remarks, including her branding of suffragettes as ""white supremacists""; her claim gay Tories are ""a special kind of d***head""; and her suggestion ""white people are socially conditioned to be racist"". In a string of Twitter posts last week, Ms Bergdorf said: ""On gay male Conservatives, whereas the language that I used was strong and perhaps I wouldn't use that turn of phrase now. ""I do continue to be confused by how somebody who identifies as a gay male can actively support a political party such as the Conservatives."" She also claimed the initial conditions placed on female enfranchisement, a centenary being celebrated in the UK this year, ""stood in the way of working-class women and largely women of colour"". Seeking to explain her comments ""that racism is a system that white people are socialised into"", Ms Bergdorf wrote: ""I believe that racism isn't always conscious and that yes, society does unconsciously centre and prioritise whiteness, which leads to unconscious bias and ultimately racism."" A spokesperson for Ms Butler MP: ""Dawn values diversity of experiences and opinions from a wide range of stakeholders. ""Dawn is committed to challenging all forms of discrimination and will continue consulting her LGBT+ stakeholder group because she believes it is crucial to hear from those with lived experience of prejudice and to develop closer links with the LGBT+ community in her role as shadow minister for women and equalities."""
2018-03-06,"The number of open licences for weapons given to Saudi Arabia has increased considerably since Theresa May became Prime Minister, according to government figures analysed by Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-accused-of-using-secretive-deals-to-sell-arms-to-saudi-arabia-11278466,"The country has been leading a coalition of nine Arab countries in airstrikes against Yemeni rebels and their allies since 2015 - and more than 10,000 people are thought to have died. Between July 2016 and September 2017, 50 open licences have been issued - compared with the 32 issued in the 15 months before Mrs May entered Downing Street. This is an increase of 56%. Open weapon sale licences have been described as ""secretive"" by campaign groups because they allow an uncapped number of items to be sent to another country for five years. There is no requirement to declare who the end user of the military items are, the licence's value cannot be provided until the end of the five-year period, and campaigners claim there is no obligation for the Government to publish the total afterwards. The spike in deals done through open licences has coincided with a decrease in the use of standard licences, where the value of a sale is known from the outset. A licence must be issued in order for the UK to supply weapons to a foreign body. Although the reported sales of weapons under Mrs May are less than her predecessor David Cameron, they could be significantly higher because the value of sales through open licences during her premiership is not known. Analysis from the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) found 257 items were traded in 2016 - rising by 175% to 707 in the first nine months of 2017. Andrew Smith, from the Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: ""By arming and supporting the Saudi regime the UK Government is complicit in the abuse of Saudi people and the terrible atrocities taking place in Yemen. ""When the Government uses open licences it makes a secretive industry even less transparent. We don't know how many arms are being sold in secret, or how much money is really being spent. ""The fact that these licences are becoming even more common is definitely a cause for concern. It is impossible for the government to stand up for human rights and democracy at the same time as it is promoting arms sales to human rights abusers and dictatorships."" The news comes on the eve of Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, visiting the UK. During the trip, he will meet Mrs May and senior members of the Royal Family. More than a third of Britons are opposed to his visit, according to a Populus poll commissioned by CAAT - and protests are due to take place on Wednesday evening. Human rights groups are critical of the Crown Prince for his role in the conflict in Yemen, which has plunged the country into a humanitarian crisis. In the year before the conflict began, the number of standard licences for UK arms exports rose by a third - from 124 in 2014 to 165 in 2015. Over that period, spending by Saudi Arabia soared from ¬£80m to ¬£2.84bn. A Department for International Trade spokesperson told Sky News: ""The UK Government takes its export control responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world. ""We rigorously examine every application on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, with risks around human rights abuses being a key part of our licensing assessment. ""We will not grant a licence if doing so would be inconsistent with these criteria and have suspended or revoked licences when the level of risk changes."""
2018-03-06,"As Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia fight for their lives in a Salisbury hospital, the finger of blame in the Western press invariably points towards the Kremlin.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180307060212/https://news.sky.com/story/is-spy-poisoning-russia-vendetta-or-rogue-mission-11278359,"""It didn't take them long,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, adding that Mr Skripal's was a ""tragic case"" and that Moscow was ready to co-operate with the British authorities if only the British were to ask. But as with so much in Russia, nothing is self-evident. Why - eight years after Mr Skripal was pardoned by then president Dmitry Medvedev - should he become a target? :: CCTV shows 'persons of interest' in spy investigation Old grudges die hard in the world of espionage and of course President Putin, as a former KGB officer himself, knows that well. But Mr Skripal had been working as a double agent back in the 1990s. These would have been very old grudges. Andrei Soldatov, an author and expert on the Russian secret services, tweeted earlier: ""If true, it's against all rules - Skripal didn't defect. He was swapped, and for that - pardoned."" If this is indeed a targeted assassination attempt, proving how far up the food chain it goes will be difficult. :: LIVE: Kremlin denies 'poisoning' Russian MI6 spy Obvious parallels are being drawn with the case of Alexander Litvinenko, who wrote a letter on his death bed in 2006 charging Vladimir Putin with his death. ""You may be able to shut one man up,"" he wrote. ""The noise of protest all over the world will reverberate in your ears, Mr Putin, to the end of your life"". It was not for another 10 years that the UK's public inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's murder at least partially backed up that claim. Sir Robert Owen concluded that it had been an FSB operation ""probably approved"" by the agency's then director Nikolai Patrushev and Mr Putin. :: Who is Russian double agent Sergei Skripal? ""It is known that the Russian government pursues vendettas,"" says Nikita Petrov, a historian and specialist on the Soviet security services. ""Even if the Russian government is innocent in this situation, it can never be entirely free from suspicion."" The view in Russia is that this is a provocation by the West. Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun, the two men suspected of poisoning Mr Litvinenko, have both been saying as much. ""The Britons suffer from phobias. If something happens to a Russian, they immediately start looking for a Russian trail,"" Mr Lugovoi told Russian news agency Interfax. He is now a member of the Russian parliament and was awarded a state medal for ""services to the fatherland"" as the Litvinenko inquiry was taking place in London. It is certainly not inconceivable that Russian intelligence operatives could be at work bumping off inconvenient personnel on the orders of the Kremlin. Especially if they get the feeling they are not keeping quite the low profile they should. ""If Russians were behind it, it came out of Moscow,"" Russian security and politics expert Mark Galeotti told me. ""And therefore we can assume it was a state sanctioned hit."""
2018-03-07,Ministers have drawn up plans to build a prison in Nigeria to enable the government to transfer prisoners from Britain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-government-plans-to-build-prison-in-nigeria-11280517,"The proposed 112-bed wing, built to United Nations specifications in the Kiri Kiri prison in Lagos, is to be built as part of a compulsory prisoner transfer agreement. It will cost just under ¬£700,000, according to a statement submitted to Parliament by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Wednesday evening. ""As part of this agreement, eligible prisoners serving criminal sentences in Nigeria and the UK can be returned to complete their sentences in their respective countries,"" Mr Johnson said. It follows a deal reached between the two countries signed in 2014. But poor conditions in some prisons overseas have created a legal barrier to returning foreigners convicted in the UK. ""The Government believes that wherever possible foreign nationals should serve their sentences in their own country,"" a Foreign Office spokesperson told Sky News. ""Helping Nigeria to improve its prison conditions and increase prison capacity will enable us to transfer more prisoners to Nigeria, which will in turn free up prison places in the UK."" Deals to transfer prisoners in UK jails to their countries of origin have been made with Albania, Rwanda, Jamaica and Libya, and well as Nigeria. In 2015 the Government pitched an ambitious ¬£25m project to build a 1,500 bed prison in Jamaica, with the aim of sending more than 300 Jamaican inmates with sentences of more than four years there. But the Jamaican government rejected the deal, with local media quoting ministers as saying the offer was not beneficial to Jamaica and did not cover the prison's full cost. Mr Johnson said tenders for the planned Nigerian jail had been placed and suppliers identified, bringing the project's total cost to ¬£695,525 including support, monitoring and evaluation. The bill will be met by the CSSF (Conflict, Stability and Security Fund), he said. According to House of Commons statistics there were 320 Nigerian nationals in prisons in England and Wales at the end of 2016. Foreign nationals make up about 12% of the prison population compared to about 9% of the general population. The annual overall cost of a prison place in England and Wales is about ¬£38,000, according to the Ministry of Justice."

A Wiltshire Police officer, who was one of the first at the scene, is also in a serious condition. All three victims are in a coma in intensive care, Sky sources say. The Metropolitan Police, which is leading the investigation, said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: ""We are now treating this as a major incident involving an attempted murder by the administration of a nerve agent. ""We believe the two people who originally became unwell were targeted specifically."" The Kremlin has denied involvement but Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK ""will respond robustly"" if the attack is found to be ""the result of hostile activity by another government"". Hundreds of police officers are working on the case, examining thousands of hours of CCTV footage, and they will remain in Salisbury for several days, Mr Rowley said. :: What is a nerve agent and how does it work? Police have appealed for people who visited Salisbury town centre or the surrounding areas on Sunday afternoon to contact them. They have also asked members of the public with any relevant footage or images to come forward. Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said there was a ""low risk to the public"" and the sites Mr Skripal and his daughter visited have been secured. :: Is spy 'poisoning' Russia vendetta or rogue mission? Nerve agents, which are chemical weapons, have been used in assassinations and attacks in war zones in recent years. Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam was killed at an international airport in Malaysia last year in an attack using a nerve agent known as VX. Another well-known nerve agent, sarin gas, was used to kill more than 90 people in a rebel-held area in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria, drawing international condemnation of the Bashar al Assad regime. Mr Skirpal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found slumped on a bench at The Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. CCTV has emerged of Mr Skripal buying scratchcards, milk and bacon at a shop in Salisbury days before they were found collapsed. :: Burgers and tea: How poison is hitman's weapon of choice Home Secretary Amber Rudd chaired a COBRA meeting about the poisoning on Wednesday and is expected to update the House of Commons on Thursday. Mr Skripal was convicted in Russia of spying for MI6 in 2006, and later given refuge in the UK as part of a spy swap. Yulia currently works for Pepsico in Moscow, according to her Facebook account, after moving to Britain for a few years in 2010. The incident is putting more strain on the already tense UK-Russia relationship. In a press conference in Russia, Maria Zakharova of Russia's foreign ministry said the link was being made to whip up anti-Russia sentiment. She would not confirm if Mr Skripal was still a Russian citizen."
2018-03-07,A senior figure and ally of Jeremy Corbyn has called for the trade union link with the Labour Party to end.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/is-labour-heading-for-a-painful-and-bitter-split-facebook-post-lays-tensions-bare-11280163,"Christine Shawcroft, a long-time Labour activist, Momentum official and NEC member, wrote on her Facebook page: ""It's time to support disaffiliation of the unions from the Labour Party. The party belongs to us, the members."" Excoriating the trade unions, she claimed that union leadership ""stick it to the rank-and-file members time after time"". The message has laid bare the tensions which exist at the top of the Labour Party. You might think this is not so new - that Labour has been in the grip of a civil war ever since Jeremy Corbyn first stood for leader. But this is not a fight between factions of the Labour Party, it is left versus left and recently, at least, that really is new. All of this has come to a head over a job almost no one has heard of. A few weeks ago Iain McNicol, the general secretary of the Labour Party, resigned. The role is basically an organisational one, the person responsible for running the party on a day-to-day basis and getting it ready for elections. It is an important job, but Mr McNicol was not favoured by the leadership of the party. He was not on the left nor a Corbyn ally - and many in the leadership will have been pleased he decided to chuck in the towel. Up to now, most of the unions and especially the largest, Unite, had (on the surface at least) been working hand in glove with Momentum and the wider left of the party. That has now changed. Unite put up a candidate for the general secretary job, Jennie Formby, very quickly. It was assumed she would be the left's candidate. Then to the surprise of many, Jon Lansman, ally of Jeremy Corbyn and head of the grassroots group Momentum, decided to throw his hat into the ring. He said that he was applying ""to open up the contest and ensure we have a wide range of candidates"" - saying also (in a not so thinly veiled jab at the way unions do business) he wanted to see an end to ""the old machine politics"". The truth is this tension has been bubbling away for a while. As one source told me today: ""It has just been masked by success."" Perhaps with so many enemies slain and no common Blairite enemy to fight, there is less to bind the left and the unions together. But a clash was always coming, for two reasons. First, much of Momentum and the left see it as their mission to ""democratise"" the Labour Party and shift power in favour of its members. The unions, naturally, are not so in favour. They see themselves as the backbone of the Labour Party and as its primary financial benefactors protect their outsized influence in the party's structures with zeal. As one source told me: ""Union general secretaries have a constituency of members they have to deliver for and most members will stand some grandstanding as long as they get the basics right. If the party goes too far in shifting power they have difficulty justifying why they fund it."" Secondly, there are genuine differences in views about policy. Much of Momentum sees it as the role of Labour to transform capitalism as we know it. The trade unions' aims have always been narrower. As one source said: ""Look, the unions when it comes down to it care about union rights, decent pay and working conditions. They don't have much truck with endless debates on dismantling the economic system."" Trident probably demonstrates this split better than any other issue. On the one hand, I doubt there are many members of Momentum who would back retaining the UK's nuclear weapons. They see it as morally and politically indefensible. But union officials - whatever their private views - know they have members who work at Faslane, making the submarines and in the nuclear industry more widely. It‚Äôs the same with Heathrow or fracking. Give a trade unionist the choice between jobs and radicalism, and they‚Äôll choose jobs every single time. That is, after all, what they are for: they are duty bound to protect their members' interests, exactly the sort of bread and butter ""machine politics"" Mr Lansman dislikes. Moreover in the long sweep of Labour history, trade union and left wing tension is not unusual. For much of the period from the general strike to the 1970s, they were generally seen as being on the right of the party. In the 1980s, many on the left blamed the union general secretaries for siding with Denis Healey against Tony Benn in the 1981 deputy leadership contest. Intriguingly some have whispered to me that this is a grudge still felt by Lansman and others around him. Why does all of this matter? Well, perhaps it shows that the Labour left is not quite as invulnerable as everyone thought. The Unite and Momentum alliance has proved a potent one. It has helped elect Jeremy Corbyn twice. If they drift apart, or worse come to blows, it may lay the groundwork for someone from another wing of the party to make new alliances and seize control in future. We are a long, long way off that but these are the first glimmers that it may be possible. Jeremy Corbyn - who has backed the Unite candidate in the general secretary contest - will have to navigate these new splits with skill. As long-time Labour watcher Kevin Maguire wrote recently: ""The seismic disputes in the coming years for the heart and soul of Labour may prove to be not between a Jeremy Corbyn cult and its enemies, or wider left versus right clashes but the collective industrial movement up against individual political activists.‚Äù Perhaps the great Ernest Bevin, a union man himself, got it right when he said: ‚ÄúThe most conservative man in the world is the British trade unionist when you want to change him."" The Labour left may - slowly, but surely - be about to realise just how wise these words were."
2018-03-07,The proportion of young women studying science in further education is dramatically lower compared to girls in schools. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/wanted-more-budding-female-scientists-to-tackle-gender-gap-11278649,"Here, Dame Mary Archer, chair of the Science Museum Group, explains how famous figures from history can inspire a new generation of female scientists. I have always loved science. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by understanding what things are made of and motivated by curiosity to find out for myself. I did my first experiment at the age of seven. It involved a worm and I'm afraid the worm did not come off very well. Children are naturally curious and investing in this instinct ensures the best training for scientists. Their work is to carefully interrogate ideas in methodical ways to make breakthroughs that have the potential to help us live better, healthier and more fulfilling lives. It is interesting and noble work and the prospect of being a scientist led me to study chemistry at university. But that is where I became unusual. Children are roughly 50/50 when it comes to gender and all children who go to school study science to some level. :: Vote: Who is Britain's most influential woman? But when you look at the numbers choosing to study sciences in further education, the proportion of young women drops dramatically. This is something we are working hard to address across the Science Museum Group but we have to do more. More to increase gender equality in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) careers in the UK. It is critically important for our economy and to develop crucial industries for the next generation. When you look at the history of STEM, there are tales of intrepid endeavours and amazing discoveries. Most of the best known are by men, with only a handful of female names remaining in the public consciousness. But I think of inspirational women like Ada Lovelace, the 19th century mathematician who worked on a general purpose computer, or Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space and still the only one to complete a solo space flight. Amy Johnson, the first female pilot to fly solo from Britain to Australia whose illustrious career set many records, and British Nobel Prize-winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, whose discoveries are essential for modern medicine, are also names that immediately come to mind. In recent decades, we have seen a growth in the opportunities for women to establish long and successful careers in science and the number of individuals and organisations working to support this increase. Films like Hidden Figures and people like Moumita Dutta at the Indian Space Research Organisation help young women to see formidable female role models in space science. Initiatives like the Year of Engineering and the Science Museum's Engineer Your Future gallery show that women are leading and contributing to some of the most valuable scientific and technological advancements of the day. But we can and must do more to help girls and young women feel that science is truly for them. :: Dame Mary Archer is chair of the board of trustees of the Science Museum Group."

They recovered ground later to close the day 1.6% lower. The group also said it was axing around a third of its 450-strong central office team as part of cost-cutting efforts. It came as separate figures showed the number of homes on the market hit a fresh record low last month and the latest data from Halifax showed house price growth slowing. Countrywide said it had suffered ""another disappointing year"" for sales and lettings, pointing to a ""flawed"" shake-up of the business as well as challenges for the wider sector. It said: ""The internal issues were further exacerbated by the tough 2016 comparatives owing to changes in the stamp duty regime and the uncertainty in consumer confidence as a result of UK's decision to exit the European Union."" The group plunged into the red for 2017 ‚Äì down from a ¬£19.5m profit the year before ‚Äì largely thanks to more than ¬£200m written off against the value of its businesses. But even stripping out these one-off charges, pre-tax profit still more than halved to ¬£25m. The results come after chief executive Alison Platt stepped down following a profit warning earlier this year. Executive chairman Peter Long said Countrywide's business ""pipeline"" for 2018 was significantly below its level at the same time last year and would ""take time"" to recover. He said that would result in a reduction in earnings in the first half of the year of ¬£10m and it looked unlikely that this shortfall would be recovered. The update came as latest figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed average property stock levels per branch on estate agents books fell to 42, a new low. RICS added that in ""another sign of the increasingly challenging market environment"" the average time for a sale to complete from listing had risen from 16 and a half to 18 and a half weeks, over the past year. On Wednesday, lender Halifax reported that annual house price growth had slowed to 1.8% in February, the slowest pace since March 2013."

City advisers have been asked to pitch to work on an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming weeks, although The Fragrance Shop is unlikely to make its stock market debut - if it presses ahead with such a move - until next year. The chain trades from nearly 215 stores, selling brands including Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Yves Saint Laurent. Founded in 1994, it bucked the trend of an embattled retail sector by posting a 5.6% increase in like-for-like sales during the six weeks to December 31. It said its bestselling products during the peak trading period included Emporio Armani's Stronger With You and Miss Dior by Christian Dior. Its performance, and potential IPO plans, have emerged during one of the most brutal periods for the high street for many years. In the last fortnight alone, Maplin and Toys R Us have collapsed into administration, while New Look has confirmed plans revealed by Sky News earlier this year to close 60 stores as part of a restructuring deal with landlords. In total, the crises at the three chains have put approximately 6,500 jobs at risk. Other retailers, including Carpetright, House of Fraser and Mothercare, remain under pressure, with lenders becoming increasingly concerned about their exposures. Retailers are bemoaning the dual pressures of rising costs such as rents, business rates and other employer taxes, and the accelerating migration of consumers to digital channels. In a statement issued on Thursday, a spokesman for The Fragrance Shop said: ""Following strong year-on-year growth and positive Christmas 2017 trading figures, the business is exploring a number of strategic expansion opportunities available that will enable us to build on our success and continue to trade strongly within a challenging retail market. ""At this stage no definitive decisions have been made with regards what that will look like. ""As a family-run business, we are excited to continue our mission to be first for fragrance with this firmly at the heart of everything we do."" People close to the process cautioned that Mr Vadera could yet decide not to pursue any form of corporate action."

Pre-tax profit for 2017 slipped to ¬£81.2m, largely due to one-off accounting costs, while group sales surged 15% to ¬£1.2bn. But UK growth was slower than the previous year and the group's plans to add up to 75 new stores in 2018 is lower than the expansion seen in 2017. Shares rose 2%. Mr Wild said: ""The UK market moderated this year, after three years of very strong like-for-like growth. ""Consumers were more cautious and value conscious, and incomes were squeezed as wage inflation lagged broader cost inflation."" Mr Wild said the group had seen a poor performance of its ""Winter Survival Deal"" compared to previous years. But he added that overall sales improved in spite of this, as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turned to takeaways rather than eating out. He said: ""There's no doubt that the first thing you cut down on is eating out when you have less money to spend. ""With Domino's, you don't need to cook and you can also save on alcohol. ""The eating-at-home market is buoyant because of economic pressures on consumers."" Domino's said UK like-for-like sales were up 7.1% in the first eight weeks of 2018, accelerating compared with the growth seen over 2017. The results come as restaurants in the casual dining sector such as Byron, Prezzo and Jamie's Italian have fallen prey to the squeeze on consumers - forcing a series of closures. Domino's UK sales were helped by 95 new store openings in 2017 and it plans to open a further 65 to 75 stores this year, with an overall target of 1,600 stores. Domino also plans to open a 117,000 sq ft production, storage and distribution centre in Warrington this year."

Officials in Broward County are yet to announce whether they will be pursuing capital punishment. Jail records show Cruz is being held in solitary confinement. Although officers describe him as co-operative, they claim he avoids eye contact and ""often sits with a blank stare"". The document added that the teenager has requested a Bible to read in his single-person cell. At the grand jury hearing, a couple who had provided a home to Cruz prior to the massacre said they were shocked by his actions and could not have foreseen that he had the capacity to kill. James and Kimberly Snead had taken Cruz in following the death of his mother in November. Cruz has told investigators that he took an AR-15 rifle into the high school on 14 February and started shooting in classrooms. The indictment comes as Florida House in Tallahassee prepares to vote on new gun laws drawn up in the aftermath of the attack. The legislation would impose some restrictions on rifle sales and enhance communication between law enforcement agencies and school districts. US education secretary Betsy DeVos visited the school on Wednesday and said she wanted to hear survivors' suggestions for improving school safety. She said that arming teachers - a controversial idea proposed by Donald Trump - should be considered as an option but not a requirement."
2018-03-07,The poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia is being treated as attempted murder by nerve agent.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-a-nerve-agent-and-how-does-it-work-11280206,"As hundreds of detectives, forensic officers and analysts urgently investigate the cause of their illness, we take a closer look at the science behind the lethal toxins. A nerve agent works by interrupting the messaging from the brain down into the muscles. Sky News Science and Medical Correspondent Thomas Moore says: ""The muscles become paralysed and if the breathing muscles are affected victims can die by asphyxiation."" The victims of this suspected poisoning had difficulty breathing, and were described by witnesses as ""wheezing"". They were discovered unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury Maltings shopping centre vomiting, twitching and ""slumped"" together. Thomas Moore says further symptoms of nerve agent can include: ""Confusion and an abnormal heart beat. They can start within minutes or hours, depending on how long the victim was exposed to the chemical and the method of administration."" The two victims remain in a critical condition in quarantine in hospital. There are a number of options as to how the poison could have been administered. Thomas Moore says ""generally speaking it is a liquid hazard, to turn it into a gas you need heat. That doesn't seem likely in this instance"". Putting the liquid into a spray so it enters the body through the eyes or skin can be a very speedy way to administer the poison, and can lead to instant death. Secreting the liquid into a drink or into food are also possibilities, but would tend to have a slower effect than direct skin contact. There are many different types of nerve agent. Here are some of the most well-known: VX is an extremely toxic chemical compound that was originally developed for military use. Just 10 milligrams of VX, when absorbed through the skin, is enough to cause ""fatal disruption of the nervous system"" within 15 minutes. It is a clear, colourless liquid which is hard to detect. VX penetrates the skin and disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses. Those exposed to the agent experience convulsions, loss of consciousness, paralysis and fatal respiratory failure. It is believed to have been the substance used to assassinate Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 13 February last year. Sarin can turn your own body against you - and exposure has the potential to kill you within minutes. The brain uses neurotransmitters which tell your body what to do. Once they have done their job, they are usually destroyed by enzymes. Sarin gas stops the enzymes from doing this, which means the neurotransmitters keep delivering these messages. In effect, it means you lose control of your body - sending it into overdrive. Symptoms include convulsions, dilated pupils, vomiting, tightening of the chest and an uncontrollable bladder. This chemical weapon, like many others, was made illegal by the United Nations in 1997. Soman is an extremely toxic chemical liquid that is clear and colourless - although it goes yellow to brown as it ages - and gives off a vapour. Its smell has been described as similar to camphor or rotting fruit. It can be spread like an aerosol spray, or used to contaminate food or water. Soman prevents the nervous system functioning properly. It causes pain in the eyes, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, muscle twitching and loss of consciousness. It can kill quickly. If they do survive, research has shown a victim of Soman is likely to experience long-term psychological effects. The UN has classified Soman as a weapon of mass destruction. This heavy metal poison is colourless, odourless and tateless. It is used commercially as a metal element in electronics, the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. Known as the ""poisoner's poison"", it can be used in liquid form or in a powder to poison the victim. Historically used as a rat poison, its non-selective toxicity led to bans of the compound in the majority of countries. It is slow acting and painful, with an additional side-effect of hair loss. It is notoriously hard to trace. Organophosphate pesticides can cause similar symptoms and work in a similar way to nerve agents. These chemical compounds of phosphoric acid make up about 50% of the killing agents in chemical pesticides. After World War II large quantities were made and marketed as insecticides. Like nerve agents, they affect the brain's neurotransmitters and can cause disorientation, headaches and influenza-like symptoms. An antidote would need to be given to victims as soon as possible, in order to minimise any further damage to the muscles. Thomas Moore says: ""It may now be matter of supporting the patients and helping them breathe, hoping that their bodies can recover themselves."" Professor Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at Leeds University told Sky News: ""I am very pleased they have been able to identify a family of chemicals because this will be very helpful to the doctors looking after the individuals who have been affected. ""They have now got some guidance on what to do because there are some very specific treatment protocols when individuals are exposed to nerve agents."" Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said the event posed ""a low risk"" to the public, and that ""all the sites that the patients were known to have visited have been secured so the public are protected"". A business park in Amesbury, the bench where the victims were found in Salisbury, a Zizzi restaurant and a nearby pub called The Bishop's Mill have now all been cordoned off by police. Evidence is now being gathered, as police seek to establish the specific substance used and the agents behind the attack."
2018-03-07,"Brain-damaged baby Isaiah Haastrup, who was at the centre of a right-to-live legal battle, has died after his life support was withdrawn by doctors.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/brain-damaged-baby-isaiah-haastrup-dies-after-doctors-withdraw-life-support-11280641,"The one-year-old's father, Lanre Haastrup, posted images of his son's final moments with his family on social media on Wednesday night. He wrote: ""4 hours independent breathing and counting ... Jesus continue...."" This was followed by another Facebook post, saying: ""6 hours"". Around two hours later, Mr Haastrup announced his son had died at 7:50pm, adding: ""Thanks for the support."" Isaiah was born at King's College Hospital in London on 18 February 2017 with a severe brain injury after being deprived of oxygen at birth. Specialists caring for the ""profoundly disabled"" child argued he was ""ventilator-dependent"" and in a ""low level of consciousness"". They said Isaiah did not respond to stimulation and could not breathe or move independently. In January, the High Court gave doctors permission to stop treatment, against his parents' wishes. On Tuesday, judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, upheld that decision and rejected a ""last resort"" appeal by Mr Haastrup and Isaiah's mother Takesha Thomas. The couple, both 36, from south London, condemned the ruling, saying judges had ""decided to abandon justice"" when considering their son's case. They had argued throughout the legal fight that switching off Isaiah's life support was ""not their [judges] decision to make"" and that their son was responsive to their love. Images uploaded by Mr Haastrup showed them cradling, kissing and stroking their son before and after his death. ""Lord!! We thank you for Isaiah's life,"" wrote Mr Haastrup, who had been banned from visiting his son at the hospital after staff complained about his behaviour. Hospital bosses lifted the ban last month after Mr Haastrup raised concerns about never seeing Isaiah again."
2018-03-07,Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince has met with the Prime Minister and the Queen after Commons clashes over British involvement in the kingdom's conflict in Yemen.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-accuses-uk-troops-of-directing-yemen-war-as-saudi-crown-prince-visits-11279950,"Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, posed with Theresa May outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday afternoon ahead of talks between the pair. The visit came after lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace. As the 32-year-old prince's car drew up to Downing Street, protesters thronged the vehicle - with one man arrested for throwing an egg during the protest. Others used the hashtag #SaudiPrinceNotWelcome hashtag on social media to express their opposition to his visit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier prompted a political row by claiming ""British military advisers are directing the war"" in Yemen. A Saudi-led coalition has been conducting military operations there in an attempt to reinstate Yemen's official government after much of the country was seized by Houthi rebels. The conflict has attracted accusations of breaches of international law amid civilian casualties. Quizzing Theresa May about the UK-Saudi relationship at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn added: ""It cannot be right that her Government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes. ""Will the Prime Minister use her meeting today with the Crown Prince to halt the arms supplies and demand an immediate ceasefire in Yemen?"" The Labour leader's comments brought an immediate rebuttal, with Middle East minister Alistair Burt declaring Mr Corbyn's claim was ""just not true"". ""I perhaps know more about what our officers are doing than the Leader of the Opposition,"" he told the BBC. ""It's not true they are directing the war in Yemen. They've given advice in relation to how targeting is done, to make sure civilians are not involved. ""But, to say they're involved in the conduct of the war is simply untrue."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, a former armed forces minister, insisted the UK's armed forces ""go to great lengths and often put themselves in greater danger"" to uphold international humanitarian law. Responding to Mr Corbyn in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister told the Labour leader she was ""concerned about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen"". She highlighted how more than ¬£200m in aid made the UK the third largest humanitarian donor in Yemen. Mrs May added: ""I was pleased when I went to Saudi Arabia in December, I met with the Crown Prince, I raised with him them the need to open the port of Hodeidah to humanitarian and commercial supplies. ""I'm pleased to say Saudi Arabia then did just that. This vindicates the engagement that we have with Saudi Arabia, to be able to sit down with them. ""Their involvement in Yemen came at the request of the legitimate government of the Yemen. It is backed by the United Nations Security Council and, as such, we support it."" The Prime Minister stressed it is ""for all parties in the conflict"" to ensure humanitarian aid is able to get to those in need. Mr Corbyn highlighted millions facing starvation in Saudi Arabia's southwestern neighbour, and 600,000 children suffering from cholera. Earlier, the Labour leader urged the Prime Minister to call on the Crown Prince to halt ""the shocking abuse of human rights in Saudi Arabia"" during her meeting with him. In response, Mrs May claimed the UK's ""historic"" link with Saudi Arabia ""has saved the lives of potentially hundreds of people in this country"" and confirmed she would be raising human rights concerns with the Crown Prince. At the beginning of their exchanges, the Prime Minister had accused the Labour leader of ""mansplaining"" after he noted how Thursday is International Women's Day."
2018-03-07,There were a record 412 terror-related arrests in Britain last year - taking the figure above 300 for the first time.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/record-number-of-terror-arrests-in-2017-after-high-profile-attacks-11280791,"The figures for 2017 compare with 261 in the previous year, a rise of 58%. The Home Office says the increase is, in part, due to the large number of people held after three attacks in London and one in Manchester. There were also multiple arrests following the attempted bombing at Parsons Green Tube station in September last year. Of the 412 arrests, 135 resulted in a charge - of which 110 were terrorism-related - while 228 were released without charge. There were a record number of people of white people (145) and women (61) arrested. The year also saw a 37% increase in the number of Asian people (170) arrested. Some 27 of the arrests were people under the age of 18, a record number. The vast majority of those held in 2017 were linked to either international or domestic terrorism. There were 300 arrests in the international category, which covers suspected activity linked to or motivated by terrorist groups based outside the UK - such as Islamic State. In the domestic category, which relates to cases where there is no connection to either Northern Ireland-related or international terrorism, there were 71 arrests. This is thought to be attributable to an increasing focus on suspected right-wing activity. The Government's security minister Ben Wallace said the figures are ""testament to the breadth of work undertaken by the police, Security Service and wider judicial system in identifying and stopping terrorism in our communities and bringing those responsible to justice"". He added: ""The police and Security Service have been clear about the scale of the threat we face. ""We will continue to work with them and other agencies to ensure we have a broad response to all forms of terrorism both now and in the future."" Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""The sharp increase in the number of arrests reflects the rise in terrorist incidents that took place in 2017. ""But the threat has not gone away and the Tories' cuts to police numbers undermine police forces' ability to respond. ""Both the security services and counter-terrorism police are clear that community policing is in the frontline in the fight against terrorism, yet community policing has borne the brunt of Government police cuts."" Last month, Britain's most senior counter-terror police officer, Mark Rowley, revealed four extreme right-wing attack plots were foiled in 2017. Ten Islamist-linked plots have also been stopped since the Westminster attack in March 2017, the Met Police officer said. He added there are more than 600 live counter-terror investigations at any one time, focusing on more than 3,000 people of interest. Security agencies must also keep 20,000 individuals, who have previously featured in inquiries, under review."
2018-03-07,"When a live studio audience of 100 women came together in Sky Studios to debate gender parity, there was a lot to discuss.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180308124053/https://news.sky.com/story/a-sad-state-of-affairs-gender-equality-is-200-years-away-100women-told-11280204,"Pay and parenting, sex scandals and sexism, women versus women and the behaviour of men were all on the agenda - as well as the question of whether feminism had gone far enough. Audience members were shocked to learn that gender equality is still more than 200 years away, according to estimates by the World Economic Forum. ""That's a sad state of affairs,"" panellist and British Army Lieutenant Colonel Lucy Giles said. In an hour-long debate hosted by Kay Burley on the eve of International Women's Day, Sky News revealed the results of a Sky Data poll that showed a majority of people in the UK thought feminism had gone far enough - and that 40% believed it had gone too far. But a panel of high-flying women - including actress Michelle Collins, MP Rupa Huq, London Fire Brigade commissioner Dany Cotton and businesswoman Kate Hardcastle - described experiences of fighting a system that still makes life for women tough. Equal pay was a pressing issue for many in the studio. According to Sky's survey, 70% of people think men are paid more than women for the same work. Kate Hardcastle recalled being dismissed when she pointed out that her male colleagues were earning more. ""Employers themselves need to be far more responsible,"" she said, arguing that women were likely to undervalue their skills while men overestimate their abilities. Audience members questioned the inclusiveness of the feminist movement, with one speaker asking that minority women in the UK, and those from elsewhere around the globe, should be a bigger part of the conversation. Kellie Maloney said trans women were ""getting there slowly"" but were still ""a long way off being accepted in the community properly."" The #MeToo movement was a hot topic as well - and many panellists said men needed a bigger push to change their behaviour. ""Men will do what they can get away with"", MP Rupa Huq said - pointing out that while there is a system for addressing dodgy financial dealings, the same cannot be said for sexual misconduct. Dany Cotton said the problem of accountability was the same in many areas. ""What's the sanction?"" she asked. ""For a lot of men nothing actually happens. They don't lose out in the job world, they don't lose out anywhere."" ""There's no encouragement, there's no support, and they're seen as weak if they do change their behaviour."" Model and campaigner @chelseyjay speaks about her experience of social media and how important it is that women ""stick together"" #100women #PressForProgress #HereWeAre pic.twitter.com/SkWVqHg4Zo Sky's survey backed up concerns raised in the #100Women debate. In our poll, 10% of men said they had changed their public behaviour to avoid being called sexist, but not their attitudes. The vast majority of women in the audience said they considered themselves to be feminists. But many also said that they worried about women being pitted against each other - and failing to stand up for other women in the fight for equality. Model and campaigner Chelsea Jay said she felt that cruelty and judgement between women - especially on social media - was too normal and called for more solidarity between women facing similar struggles. ""Imagine if we all did stick together together, if we didn't put that hate out there,"" she said. ""We would literally be the living embodiment of the Spice Girls."""

Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, pointed to ""subdued"" consumer demand during a challenging year which also saw a costly shake-up including 1,440 redundancies. He said further pressure on profits was expected in coming months amid continuing economic uncertainty and fierce competition. Sir Charlie added that sales at its department stores had been ""significantly impacted"" by last week's snow. Pre-tax profit for the year to 27 January fell to ¬£103.9m while the employee-owned partnership's bonus scheme was cut to 5% of salary - down from 6% in 2016/17 and 10% the year before that. The bonus pot of ¬£74m to be shared by 85,500 workers compares to an ¬£89m pay-out the year before. Waitrose saw like-for-like sales grow by 0.9% but at the expense of a 42% dive in operating profits, as higher costs were not passed on in prices. John Lewis saw 0.4% sales growth and a slight uptick in profits. Overall partnership results were hit by ¬£73m in restructuring and redundancy costs plus a ¬£39m write-down in the value of Waitrose branches. The bottom-line figure compares to the prior year when it was boosted by a big one-off accounting gain linked to pension benefits. Sir Charlie said: ""As we anticipated, 2017 was a challenging year. ""Consumer demand was subdued and we made significant changes to operations across the partnership which affected many partners."" The chairman said that for the first five weeks of the new financial year, Waitrose like-for-like sales were up 2.4% but John Lewis saw a 3.4% fall amid the cold snap. He added: ""We expect trading to be volatile in 2018/19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. ""We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits."" He added that the company had chosen to cut the proportion of profits paid as partnership bonus in order to absorb the impact of tough trading ""while continuing to invest in the future and in strengthening our balance sheet""."

The two-year report by a committee of MP's concluded that Sir Bradley Wiggins used asthma medication to enhance his performance in the build up to his 2012 Tour De France win. The report found that Team Sky ""crossed an ethical line"" by using drugs to allegedly enhance the performance of Bradley Wiggins but did not break World Anti-doping Agency rules. Team Sky strongly denies the allegations as does Sir Bradley. Mr Lappartient told BBC Sport that the findings of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee ""could affect the global credibility of the sport"". Speaking at the UCI's headquarters in Switzerland, the Frenchman said the Cycling Anti-Doping Foundation (CADF) should use their powers of investigation to ""see if there is some violation of anti-doping rules"". He went on to say that it would be ""a disaster for the image of cycling"" if four-time Tour De France winner Chris Froome rode in this year's race while his doping case was unresolved. :: Sutton says Wiggins and Freeman need to give full explanation of asthma drug use Earlier this week, Sir Bradley issued a strong response to the allegations on Twitter, writing: ""I find it so sad that accusations can be made, where people can be accused of things they have never done which are then regarded as facts.

It includes proposals for the first legal definition of domestic violence, covering the many kinds of abuse suffered by victims from psychological to physical. For the first time, economic abuse will also be recognised. New domestic abuse protection orders will allow police and courts to act earlier when they suspect abuse is taking place, with tougher sentences for cases involving children. And a domestic abuse commissioner will be appointed to hold the Government to account. Mrs May said: ""The consultation we are launching today includes a number of proposals which have the potential to completely transform the way we tackle domestic abuse, providing better protection to victims and bringing more perpetrators to justice. ""We know that domestic abuse affects those from all walks of life. ""Victims can be young and old, male and female."" Domestic violence support charities have widely welcomed the consultation on the bill but want more certainty on funding for support services including refuges. Ahead of the announcement Sky News spent the morning in a refuge which is currently full. Olwen Kelly, has been running Swindon's Women's Aid for five years. She said: ""Women turn up all times of the day and the evening. ""When they arrive they'll only have the clothes that they're wearing, the children more often will be wearing their pyjamas and that's because they've been put into police cars because it's not safe for them to stay in their own home."" But Women's Aid is deeply concerned about Government proposals that could impact funding for refuges. At the moment housing benefit can be used to pay for the specialist accommodation. But the Government is considering stopping that and devolving housing costs to local authorities, meaning funding to house abuse victims could come out of the same pot of money as that for ex-offenders, the homeless and those coming off alcohol and drugs. Talking about her fears for her own refuge, Ms Kelly said: ""Locally we are going to have to vie for funding in order to make sure that this refuge continues. ""What it will ultimately mean is that more women will die, more women will lose their lives. ""In England we know already that two women a week die because of domestic violence."" Anne (not her real name) came to the refuge with her three children after her most recent partner psychologically abused her. She said the refuge has been a lifeline, adding: ""He would look through the windows, let himself into my house, knock on the door late at night, shout nasty things about me in the street. ""He would stand in the doorway all dressed in black and um, and not very nice things to deal with. ""My children were very scared. I needed the refuge. ""I've had some amazing support and I'll never forget what this place has done for me, I'll always be grateful."" This Government told Sky News it is still reviewing options on how refuges are paid for and it is committed to ensuring there is no postcode lottery."

The previous worst figure of 85.1% was recorded in December. With 85.3% of patients seen within four hours in January, it means the three lowest-ever figures for the NHS's headline target came in the last three months. With cold weather for much of February peaking last week, more than 1.8 million people attended A&E, up 5% on the same month last year. Attendances were also up in January and December. The NHS struggled to meet targets despite 22,800 more elective or non-urgent operations and procedures being postponed to help hospitals deal with pressure. NHS England said it freed up 1,400 beds. :: Admission waiting times at record levels Statistics for last week also underlined the challenges posed by cold weather, with bed occupancy running at 95.2%, its highest level all winter, an increase in ambulance diverts away from A&E departments, and more than 11,000 people facing ambulance handover delays of more than 30 minutes. A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""NHS staff continued to work hard in February in the face of a 'perfect storm' of appalling weather, persistently high flu hospitalisations and a renewed spike in norovirus. ""Despite a challenging winter, the NHS treated 160,000 more A&E patients within four hours this winter, compared with the previous year. ""The NHS also treated a record number of cancer patients over these most pressured months of the year."" The figures drew criticism from staff groups and opposition parties, with shadow health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth calling for an inquiry into the winter crisis. :: Britons need to diet, says watchdog He said: ""Performance has fallen back under pressure despite NHS England insisting it was better prepared than ever for this winter and the Government providing ¬£335m in emergency funding in the Budget."" The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said it was calling on patients to write to their MPs asking for action to address the serious challenges facing A&E departments. It said the ""unprecedented move"" was in response to the figures, which also showed the worst ever performance of 76.9% at major emergency departments. ""Performance that once would have been regarded as utterly unacceptable has now become normal and things are seemingly only getting worse for patients,"" said its President Dr Taj Hussan. ""Let's be very clear - the current crisis in our emergency departments and in the wider NHS is not the fault of patients,"" he added. ""It is not because staff aren't working hard enough, not because of the actions of individual trusts, not because of the weather or norovirus, not purely because of influenza, immigration or inefficiencies and not because performance targets are unfeasible. ""The current crisis was wholly predictable and is due to a failure to prioritise the need to increase healthcare funding on an urgent basis."" Health think tank The King's Fund warned that without extra funding the NHS faces an ""inexorable drift"" back to waiting times last seen in the 1990s.Richard Murray, director of policy, said: ""Coming in the midst of the longest funding squeeze in the history of the NHS and growing staffing shortages, the crisis we are seeing in our A&Es was sadly predictable. ""Unless the government finds significantly more money for the NHS, we face an inexorable drift back to the long waiting times we saw in the 1990s. ""The NHS cannot continue to rely on the motivation and goodwill of staff to paper over the cracks."""

It forecast up to 10cm (4ins) of snow in some areas and advised motorists to allow extra time for their journeys, warning slippery patches were likely to form on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths. Rail passengers have also been warned of potential disruption to train services. Snow Hazard warning   Motorists are advised to be careful this morning , snow is coming down quite hard in places across North Wales - particularly A487 Bangor /Caernarfon to  Portmadoc  and  A499 Portmadoc to Pwllheli .  A55 Halkyn and Bangor areas. North Wales Police tweeted to warn of the ""Snow Hazard"" and described the snowfall as ""coming down quite hard in places"". The force's road policing unit also urged motorists to clean their windscreens of snow and ice before setting off, and posted a picture of a van that had been stopped in Bryncir for failing to do so.

This pic is an example of what NOT to do (Van was stopped in #Bryncir this morning) #sillybilly pic.twitter.com/mgsdLL8XSC The warnings come as water companies say they have restored supplies to most customers after thawing temperatures caused pipes to freeze and burst and left more than 20,000 properties in London and the South East without water. The ""surprise"" fresh snowfall was welcomed by some on social media, while others vented their frustration. One person tweeted: ""Despite how much I might complain about the snow I actually really like it."" Another wrote: ""how was it literally ten whole degrees just yesterday and now I've woken up to snow on the ground again.""

2018-03-09,A vehicle recovery centre is being searched as part of the latest investigation into the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/russian-spy-poisoning-search-moves-to-skripals-car-11281990,"It is believed the building was searched overnight as Sergei Skripal's maroon-coloured BMW is inside. Former double agent Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in ""a very serious condition"" in hospital after they were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury on Sunday evening. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, 38, is in a serious condition but is now ""talking and engaging"" with people, Wiltshire Police's acting chief constable Kier Pritchard said. DS Bailey is believed to have been the first person at the scene, although there are now suggestions he may have become ill after retracing Mr Skripal's steps from his home in Salisbury. Sky News' crime correspondent Martin Brunt said there are suggestions police believe the spy, his daughter and DS Bailey were poisoned at the Russian's home. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, has said all the evidence points to the nerve agent attack being ordered by the Kremlin. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who yesterday called the attack ""brazen"", visited the scene in Salisbury and spoke to investigators this morning. :: Who and what could be behind the poisonings? Mr Skripal served four years of a 13-year sentence in Russia after he was caught spying for MI6 and was released as part of a spy exchange in 2010, when he was given refuge in the UK. Images have emerged today of Mr Skripal in Malta in 1985. A source close to the the Maltese foreign office confirmed to Sky News that Skripal was stationed to Malta in 1985 and served into the early 1990s as Cultural and Sports Attache within the Soviet Embassy in Malta. After he and his daughter were found the first area to be cordoned off was Zizzi's Italian restaurant in central Salisbury, where the pair dined on Sunday. :: What is a nerve agent and how does it work? Officers also widened the search area, placing forensics tents in front of and at the rear of Mr Skripal's home. They have also begun a fresh fingertip search of the house. Sky News' West of England correspondent, Rebecca Williams, said there was a lot of activity at the house and that it was a fast-moving investigation. She added that police are focusing on identifying a man and a woman seen yards away from where the pair collapsed. :: Russia row: How will UK respond to spy 'attack'? There is also a cordon around the graves of Mr Skripal's son, Alexandr, and his wife, Lyudmila, who died in suspicious circumstances in 2017 and 2012 respectively. So far there is no indication any bodies could be exhumed but it could be part of the investigation, Sky News understands. Detectives have not yet revealed what kind of chemical was used. But experts believe any possible compounds used ""are part of a type of chemical agent made specifically for warfare"", counter-terrorism expert Andy Oppenheimer told Sky News. Russian exile Valery Morozov told Sky News Mr Skripal had been in contact with the Russia and visited its London embassy once a month. Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with all the victims, and praised the response of the emergency services. She said the incident was ""a stark reminder, if ever one was needed, of the dangerous situations our emergency services face and the dedication and courage they display every day in order to keep us safe"". The Home Secretary threatened a ""robust"" response to the ""brazen and reckless act"" committed on UK soil. Ms Rudd said the poisoning ""was attempted murder in the most cruel and public way"". While she said speculation must be avoided, she said ""people are right to want to know who to hold to account"". She said the Government is ""committed to doing all we can to bring the perpetrators to justice - whoever they are and wherever they may be"". The Kremlin has insisted it is not involved, and said any allegations are a plot to whip up anti-Russian sentiment. President Vladimir Putin has yet to respond to the news that nerve agent was involved in the poisoning. :: Watch a special report about the Salisbury spy poisoning on Sky News at 2.30pm, 4,30pm and 6.30pm."

A Prison Service spokesman confirmed Imiela had died in custody at HMP Wakefield on Thursday. ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman,"" the spokesman added. Imiela is believed to have died of natural causes and his death is not being treated as suspicious. He had been referred for parole in January but a hearing was unlikely to take place within six months. The railway worker, from Appledore near Ashford in Kent, carried out a spate of horrific assaults on women and girls he had never met. He grabbed them and dragged them into a secluded area, threatening to kill them and hit them. After his 2004 conviction, Imiela's DNA was put on a police database. A cold case review into a sex attack that happened on Christmas Day 1987 found a match between Imiela and victim Sheila Jankowitz, who died in 2006. He was jailed for 12 years at the Old Bailey in March 2012 after being found guilty of rape, indecent assault and another serious sex offence against Ms Jankowitz. In January, a spokesman for the Parole Board confirmed the Ministry of Justice had referred Imiela's case for a parole review. The review is ""following the standard six-month process for all indeterminate sentence prisoners"", the spokesman said. It came a week after the decision to release black cab rapist John Worboys which is now the subject of a judicial review."

The minister, one of the most important figures in Saudi politics and energy markets worldwide, suggested that London had a strong chance of securing the international listing of the country's mega oil company, set to be one of the biggest public offerings in recent history. :: FCA offers olive branch over $1trn Aramco float In London alongside Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Mr AL-Falih, who is also chairman of Aramco, said that the company was still considering where to list its international shares. Insiders suggest it is mulling London and New York as potential locations, as well as Hong Kong and Tokyo. ""London is in contention,"" he said. ""London has always been an attractive destination for capital from around the world. ""It is the capital of the world. It couldn't be more central, more connected, or more welcoming of global citizens and businesses. It's always been attractive. ""All of the stakeholders from the government, the exchange itself and the financial sector have been extremely welcoming - of the kingdom as a whole, and of the Aramco listing."" The listing is regarded as one of the big prizes in international capital markets, with US President Donald Trump recently tweeting to encourage Aramco to list its shares in New York. But some in the square mile will take encouragement from Mr Al-Falih's warm words. The minister also denied that Brexit had dented Saudi Arabia's enthusiasm for investing in the UK. The country has committed to a $100bn investment plan in the coming years, with insiders suggesting that much of that money will come from its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. Mr Al-Falih said Brexit had meant the UK ""will be less constrained"". He said: ""(They will be) able to strike their own deals. I see it as a positive from a Kingdom perspective. I think the UK will be more free, and, depending on how it negotiates with the EU and us, it could be hugely net positive."""

The Cabinet minister promised a ""robust"" response once responsibility for the attack is established, but she told the House of Commons her current priority is on the immediate response to the incident. However, senior Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh used Ms Rudd's update to MPs on the poisoning to demand increased defence spending. He declared the Government's two per cent of GDP spend on defence as ""not enough"" in the face of the current threat from Russia. Sir Edward also claimed there is ""very strong"" circumstantial evidence against Moscow over the attack on former spy Mr Skripal and his daughter. ""Who else would have the motive and the means?"" he asked. ""Those of us who seek to understand Russia know that the only way to preserve peace is through strength. ""And, if Russia is behind this, this is a brazen act of war. Of humiliating our country."" Ms Rudd told Sir Edward ""there will come a time for attribution"", which would subsequently lead to ""consequences"". Earlier, in a statement to MPs, Ms Rudd called the use of a nerve agent on UK soil as ""a brazen and reckless act"". She added: ""People are right to want to know who to hold to account. But, if we are to be rigorous in this investigation, we must avoid speculation and allow police to carry on their investigation. ""The investigation now involves hundreds of officers following every possible lead to find those responsible. ""We are committed to doing all we can to bring the perpetrators to justice - whoever they are and wherever they may be. ""The investigation is moving at pace and this Government will act without hesitation as the facts become clearer."" Earlier on Thursday, Ms Rudd revealed to Sky News a police officer who was hurt in the attack is ""awake and engaging with people"", although Mr Skripal and his daughter remain in a ""very serious"" condition in hospital. Her fellow Cabinet minister, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, also declined to say whether Moscow was responsible for the Salisbury attack but branded Russia an ""ever-greater threat"" to the UK. ""Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it,"" he told ITV. ""We can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation."" Former Tory minister Nick Boles called on the Government to ""turn tough talk into action"" over Russia, posting on Twitter: ""I do not see how we can maintain diplomatic relations with a country that tries to murder people on British soil and puts the lives of British citizens at risk."" Former top UK diplomat Sir Christopher Meyer, who previously worked in Moscow, said any evidence of Russian state involvement in the Salisbury poisoning would require a British response. He told Sky News: ""You cannot tolerate a government assassination on British soil. It is absolutely beyond the pale and needs a reaction."""

Sir Christopher Wrey, the former UK ambassador to the US who has previously worked in Moscow, told Sky News: ""You could, if this is proven, take advantage of this horrible case and not only expel the ambassador, but drain the swamp of all these guys MI5 are tagging around the streets of London and wherever."" He added that the UK's response after the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 - when four Russian diplomats were expelled - ""probably was too weak"". :: Avoiding Russia's World Cup Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has suggested the UK's involvement at the World Cup in Russia this summer could be affected by the nerve agent attack. ""I think it would be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way and we would certainly have to consider that,"" he told the House of Commons. It was later clarified Mr Johnson was referring to the possibility that officials, dignitaries and ministers may not attend the World Cup, not that England would boycott the tournament. :: Sanctions Mr Johnson has also threatened fresh sanctions against Russia if it was responsible for the Salisbury poisoning. Britain has already backed tough UN and EU sanctions on Russia's economy to oppose its annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine. The sanctions targeted Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors, which are managed by the powerful elite around President Putin. :: Imposing 'The Magnitsky Act' The Government has introduced measures in the Criminal Finances Act, inspired by America's Magnitsky Act, to allow the assets of international human rights violators to be frozen. The US law was named after whistle-blowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow detention centre in 2009 after attempting to reveal a massive tax fraud against his British-based investment firm and the Russian state. The 37-year-old father-of-two was held for almost a year without trial and denied medical treatment. Home Secretary Amber Rudd indicated that the Salisbury incident may prompt further action. ""The Sanctions Bill is at the moment before the committee and I know there are people who are talking about wanting to put down amendments at report stage,"" she said. ""Of course what we have seen happening in the past few days may bring this more to the front."" :: Ending diplomatic ties Former Tory minister Nick Bold has urged Britain to break off diplomatic ties with Russia in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning. He said: ""I do not see how we can maintain diplomatic relations with a country that tries to murder people on British soil and puts the lives of British citizens at risk. ""It's time for us to turn tough talk into action."""

Restaurant chain Wagamama was named as the worst offender, followed by TGI Friday's and hotels giant Marriott. The Government fined the employers a total of ¬£1.3m after ¬£1.1m in back pay was identified for 9,200 workers. According to the Business Department, Stoke City failed to pay ¬£1,102 to seven workers. The club are owned by Denise Coates, the billionaire founder of betting firm Bet365, who paid herself more than ¬£200 million in 2016. A Stoke City spokesman said: ""Once this matter was brought to our attention we moved swiftly to repay the money to the members of staff concerned. ""The issue arose from our now historical practice of allowing staff to pay for tickets and retail merchandise voluntarily purchased from the club via deduction from their monthly salaries, for which the employees gave written permission for deductions to be made. ""Employees are now no longer permitted to purchase match or club lottery tickets or items from the club shop via such a wage deduction scheme.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove is on record as describing the levy as an ""exciting idea"", and he presented fellow ministers with reusable coffee cups made of bamboo when they met to discuss the Government's 25-year Environment Plan. However, in its official response to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee report, the Government said only that a ""latte levy"" was ""something we could consider amongst other policy options"". Instead it praised coffee chains which offer money off drinks to customers who bring in their own reusable cups, adding it would like all drink vendors follow suit. A second key recommendation from the committee - that disposable cups be banned from 2023 unless the industry reaches a target of recycling 100% of those put in recycling bins - was also dismissed. At the moment, only one in 400 disposable coffee cups is recycled, despite 90% of customers putting them in recycling bins. This is because they are made with paper that is infused with polyethylene, which cannot be handled by standard recycling mills. Takeout cups placed in general paper recycling bins are therefore likely to end up in landfill, with some 2.5 billion cups dumped this way annually. The Government said the 100% recycling target was unrealistic, because some cups put into recycling bins will always be rejected due to contamination from the drink itself or other waste items. Committee chair Mary Creagh accused ministers of failing to match previous ""warm words"" on reducing waste. ""The UK's throwaway culture is having a devastating impact on our streets, beaches and seas,"" she said. ""Our report recommended practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis. The Government's response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action."" The Wakefield MP accused the Government of ""ignoring the evidence"" from the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags, which cut their use by 83% in the first year. A Government spokesperson said claims it was not taking strong enough action were false. They said: ""Industry has a crucial role to play in making more products recyclable and we are working with them to reform our packaging waste regulations so producers are incentivised to take greater responsibility for the environmental impact of their products. ""But it is wrong to say government is not taking decisive action - we have set out our commitment to the environment in our 25 year plan, published in January, and we are looking at further ways to reduce avoidable waste and recycle more as part of our resources and waste strategy."" :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

Mr Trump had previously threatened ""fire and fury"" in response to threats from North Korea. Mr Trump also referred to the North Korean leader as ""Little Rocket Man"". But today, the US leader tweeted: ""Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearisation with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze. ""Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!"" It comes after South Korea's national security adviser Chung Eui-yong announced at the White House Mr Kim's desire to meet with Mr Trump following talks in Pyongyang on Monday. :: What will Trump get in return for Kim meeting? ""He (Mr Kim) expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,"" said the South Korean official. ""President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong Un by May to achieve permanent denuclearisation."" Mr Chung also said Mr Kim had vowed that his country would ""refrain from any further nuclear or missile test"" and that he was ""committed to denuclearisation"". He said North Korea understood routine military exercises carried out by the US and South Korea must continue and that there would be continuing pressure on the country until it makes ""concrete actions"". :: Donald v Kim: How their body language compares The White House confirmed a meeting between the two would be held ""at a place and time to be determined"". South Korean President Moon Jae-in said a meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim would be a ""historical milestone"" that will put the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula ""really on track"". Mr Moon also complimented Mr Trump for accepting Mr Kim's invitation for a summit, saying Mr Trump's leadership will be praised ""not only by the residents of South and North Korea but every peace-loving person around the world"". No serving US President has ever met with a North Korean leader and the two countries do not have formal diplomatic relations. The nations are still technically at war following the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty. The latest attempt to open a dialogue between the two countries comes after Mr Kim hit out at the US in his New Year's address and referred to the ""nuclear button"" on his office desk. Mr Trump later tweeted that he had a nuclear button too that was a ""much bigger and more powerful one than his, and my button works!"" Former US ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill said North Korea's invitation was ""quite extraordinary"". He told Sky News: ""I spent four years negotiating with the North Koreans as part of the six-party talks and I can tell you we never had a moment anything close to this. ""Certainly, the North Koreans have invited American heads of state before but this is the first time an American head of state has said 'sure I'll go' - so this is really quite extraordinary."" US Vice President Mike Pence said the move was ""evidence that President Trump's strategy to isolate the Kim regime is working"". ""Our resolve is undeterred and our policy remains the same: all sanctions remain in place and the maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes concrete, permanent, and verifiable steps to end their nuclear programme,"" he said. My statement on North Korea: pic.twitter.com/T4MghUgIGH Sky News correspondent Mark Austin said the timing of the meeting was ""bizarre to say the least"". ""He's had this invitation today, he's accepted it today and he's said he's going to meet by May. Now, by any standards, that is an incredibly quick decision to make on something as important as this,"" he said. He added: ""It may be that Donald Trump is anxious to get this photo call and get things moving... It will take months and months and months to come to any sort of deal with North Korea on this. The Americans will go in with acute suspicion and they'll be wondering why on earth there's been this sudden turn around by Kim Jong Un. ""It's all very odd and we should treat it with suspicion."" Downing Street welcomed the plans for direct talks. A spokesman said: ""We have always been clear that we want Kim Jong Un to change path and put the welfare of his people ahead of the illegal pursuit of nuclear weapons. ""We will continue to work closely with the US, South Korea and the international community to ensure that pressure on North Korea continues and sanctions are strictly enforced until Kim Jong Un matches his words with concrete actions. ""We will continue to monitor developments closely."" Russia and China also hailed the move as a ""positive"" step in the right direction. Leading Republican senator Lindsey Graham hailed Mr Trump's North Korea strategy and warned Mr Kim not to ""try and play"" the US President when they meet, with it being ""the worst possible thing you can do"". ""If you do that, it will be the end of you - and your regime,"" he added in a statement on Twitter."

No one else is wanted in connection with the incident and Ms Scourfield's family have been informed. The teenager will appear at Llanelli Magistrates' Court on Friday."
2018-03-09,A young girl has escaped with her life after being mauled by a lion in Saudi Arabia.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/girl-escapes-with-her-life-after-being-mauled-by-lion-in-saudi-arabia-11281364,"In a shocking video, the child and dozens of other youngsters are seen in a large cage, seemingly playing with what was supposed to be a ""trained"" lion. An adult, assumed to be the trainer, supervised them as they ran around in the enclosure. The six-month old animal cornered a girl dressed in a black top and chequered trousers, and, standing on its hind feet, attacked her, grasping her head with its paws and forcing her to the floor. The horrified girl, who was uninjured, shrieked - but only managed to escape after several adults dragged the animal off. The big cat was brought to entertain the Saudi children as a part of a spring festival in the port city of Jeddah, according to reports by local media. The cub's trainer and the festival's organiser have been detained, local authorities said. Trainer Faisal Ossairy said the lion ""seemed to have been attracted by the butterfly ribbon on the head of the girl"", according to Saudi Arabia's al Marsad news site. He also said the animal had been trained to be around humans and its claws had been removed. Footage posted on social media has quickly gone viral, with some users accusing the festival's organisers of neglecting the children's safety."
2018-03-09,"A transition deal which gives the UK continued influence over European Union rules is essential, industry chiefs representing millions of British workers will tell the Brexit Secretary next week.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/strike-brexit-transition-deal-urgently-bosses-to-tell-davis-11282054,"Sky News has seen the draft of a letter to be sent in the coming days to David Davis which warns that the need for comprehensive transitional arrangements is urgent to prevent major companies activating Brexit contingency plans. The letter, which is being coordinated by the CBI, is being circulated among leading industry bodies covering sectors such as chemicals, aviation, food, pharmaceuticals and retail. It will increase the pressure on ministers to secure an effective transition deal at a meeting of the EU Council ‚Äélater this month. In the draft letter, the industry groups‚Äé welcome recent speeches by Mr Davis and Theresa May, who have committed to agreeing the terms of an implementation period that would last for about two years after Brexit. However, they warn that finalising an agreement is now urgent because ""for many companies in our membership, the first quarter of this year is decision time for contingency plans"". ""Transitional arrangements that provide continuity and stability through protecting the benefits of the single market and customs union would be a welcome step in ensuring that many of those contingency plans do not have to be put in place,"" the letter states. The employers' groups outline two ways in which the Government can secure continued influence over European rules which affect the UK. The first, maintaining membership of or access to EU agencies and regulators, ""would support many of the country's high-value businesses working in extremely technical fields to influence rules that update very rapidly and outside the legislative process,"" according to the draft. Mrs May said in a speech last week that Britain would seek associate membership of EU agencies covering aviation safety, chemicals and medicine in return for an as-yet undetermined payment. While her remarks were welcomed by many UK-based executives, they have received a lukewarm response in Brussels, where many EU hardliners believe the request is an example of Britain's 'cherry-picking' approach to Brexit. The other approach outlined in the CBI-led letter describes a new mechanism under which the UK would have a say on future legislative changes. ""This could potentially be through the right for the UK Government to submit legal opinion on developments as legislation is passing through the European Parliament, or the continued clear permission for UK businesses to input into consultations,"" it says. ""This will be particularly important for sectors that do not have one single body that oversees the technical rules that govern their sector, but rather many rules."" Sources said on Friday that the letter was expected to be signed by associations whose collectively membership employs millions of private sector workers. They added that it would be sent to Mr Davis ahead of the EU Council meeting‚Äé, and probably as soon as next week. The CBI declined to comment."

2018-03-09,A former Russian spy and his daughter remain in hospital in comas after being poisoned in Salisbury.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/sergei-skripal-who-and-what-could-be-behind-poison-attack-11281026,"Mystery surrounds how they came into contact with a nerve agent and who could have administered it, as well as what their motive would have been. Police are treating the attack as attempted murder, and are investigating several sites around the cathedral city - with the ex-spy's home among the major crime scenes. What have they been poisoned with? Sergei Skripal and his daughter have been hit with a nerve agent, which interrupts the messaging between the brain and the body. Symptoms include confusion, an abnormal heartbeat, wheezing or problems breathing - and they were seen slumped together. Nerve agents include substances such as VX, which was used to kill Kim Jong Un's half brother Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia. Another is sarin - a gas which has been used as a chemical weapon. Meanwhile, soman is an extremely toxic chemical liquid that is clear and colourless - although it goes yellow to brown as it ages and gives off a vapour. It can kill quickly and is classed as a weapon of mass destruction. There's also thallium, a heavy metal known as the poisoner's poison. Police have not yet confirmed which agent was used, but it has been described as ""very rare"" agent, which could only have been produced by a few laboratories in the world. According to The Sun, one of these is the Yasenevo lab in Moscow. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a chemical weapons expert, told Sky News it is not sarin, or VX, and the other options are soman or tabun. He said: ""It could also be a boutique or exotic chemical weapon that was made for this attack. ""They know what it is, and they can treat it. With Porton Down on the doorstep, they couldn't be in a better place to be treated for this chemical attack."" How did this happen? It is not entirely clear how the pair came into contact with the nerve agent. Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited a few places in the city centre during the day, including a Zizzi restaurant, and then a pub, before they were found slumped on a park bench. They could have been spiked when they were dining or drinking - or they may have had the agent sprayed at them as they walked between the venues. Sky's Home Affairs Correspondent Mark White said: ""We are still unclear about how this nerve agent was administered. Was it sprayed in their face? Slipped into their food or drink? ""We simply don't know and obviously that will form part of the inquiry."" According to The Times, police are questioning whether Ms Skripal had been given a ""gift from friends"" which she had with her on Sunday when they succumbed to the agent. It could also be that Ms Skripal was collateral damage, and that only her father was meant to be attacked. Who could have poisoned them? The overarching theory is that the pair have been targeted by Russia, but whether this is a state sponsor or an individual is less clear. Mr Skripal had been working as a double agent back in the 1990s. It is understood he was part of a spy swap, which makes it less likely the Kremlin would still be interested in him as a targeted assassination. The Kremlin has insisted they are not involved, and said any link to them is a plot to whip up anti-Russian sentiment. An alternative is that the Skripals were targeted by someone with a personal grudge. Of course, it could also be a case of mistaken identity, where the pair were not the intended targets of the attack at all. Sir Christopher Meyer, the former UK ambassador to the US who is also a Russia expert having previously worked in Moscow, said: ""I would be surprised if anybody in the Kremlin would have organised an operation like this and didn't really care if they were discovered or not. ""I don't think that is true. ""You wouldn't use something as rare and as something to get rid of as a nerve gas, a nerve agent, unless you wanted to conceal your traces."" Was the assassin targeting Yulia? Police are understood to be investigating whether the agent was delivered to Ms Skripal as a gift from friends. Alexander Vissiliev, espionage historian, told Sky News: ""Every possibility should be investigated properly. From the point of view of an ex-KGB officer, killing someone, in espionage, doesn't make any sense in most cases. ""It usually brings a lot of unpredictable consequences and usually the damage is already done, so it doesn't make any sense to kill him. ""It looks like a Mafia thing to me, like it was arranged by a Mafia type clan. I would investigate his business dealings, if he had any, since he moved to Britain and his son and daughter too, if there are any. ""In 1990s in Russia, businessmen used to kill each other in Russia. Then they moved to Europe, and they moved location but the tactics didn't change. ""It may be connected to business."" Ms Skripal is also understood to have been a vocal critic of Vladimir Putin on social media. Why have they been poisoned? It is thought by some that Mr Skripal may have still been working as a spy, having not retired after he was offered refuge in the UK. If this is the case, that may have made him a target. Sir Christopher Meyer told Sky News there are some ""strange things"" about the Skripal case. He said: ""What did he do after he had asylum here in the UK? ""Did he continue to work against Russia? Because he might have done something, or been with some British intelligence agency, say, which was such that it enraged people in the Kremlin. ""That is a possibility, but we cannot diplomatically do anything until it is clear beyond all doubt that this was an operation undertaken by the Kremlin."" Sir Christopher also said that if Mr Skripal is viewed by Vladimir Putin as a ""traitor"" rather than simply an enemy, he may be a target. He added: ""It's very easy to say Sergei Skripal is one of those guys and so Putin has eliminated (him). But there are things that stop me making that leap. ""One is, if this guy was such a traitor, why - back in 2006... whenever it was - did he only get 13 years in a Russian jail? Because, normally, a traitor is shot. So, that's strange. ""The second thing is, he was part of a spy swap. I don't think there's any history of ever a Russian agent who's been part of a spy swap, in that case with the Americans, later being wiped out."" Who benefits from the poisoning? Alexander Vissiliev suggests one possibility is that Vladimir Putin is being framed by political adversaries. He told Sky News: ""It doesn't make sense for him to have someone killed but it means a lot to adversaries. ""This is a total political disaster for Russia, and for Putin personally, but for his adversaries it is a different story. ""We could be dealing with hyper patriotic veterans of the secret service who consider him (Putin) too liberal."" He also told Sky that this could be a business dealing not a political one, and that he would be investigating the business records of not just Mr Skripal, but his daughter. Sky's Moscow Correspondent was unable to find any trace of Ms Skripal as working for Pepsico in the city, which is where she lists her employment on social media. It could be that the spy was targeted to give a warning to anyone else thinking of crossing the Kremlin. Yuri Felshtinksy, a friend of Alexander Litvinenko, said: ""Poisoning is the method of choice for the FSB. ""This has all the hallmarks of a Putin assassination. He is warning anyone in the FSB never to defect, as they'll be hunted down and killed."""
2018-03-09,KFC has returned to its old delivery contractor to supply chicken to restaurants after hundreds of outlets were forced to close last month.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/kfc-goes-back-to-old-supplier-after-restaurant-delivery-crisis-11281283,"Bidvest Logistics had lost its KFC contract only for DHL and partner QSL to struggle with maintaining the flow of meat and other goods to the brand's 900 sites, in what were described as ""teething problems"". The vast majority of restaurants were shut at one stage, with KFC facing taunts of ""told you so"" at the time from union officials, who said they had warned the company in advance that Bidvest was best-placed to handle its business. On Thursday, Bidvest said it was ""delighted"" to confirm a new long-term agreement with KFC UK to supply 350 restaurants across northern England and Wales from later this month. It is understood that Bidvest workers made redundant when the contract originally transferred are to be offered their jobs back. The company's business unit director, Paul Whyte, said: ""As the UK's leading food service logistics specialist, we understand the complexities of delivering fresh chicken. ""KFC are a valued customer and we will provide them with a seamless return to our network."" In its statement, KFC confirmed it was yet to fully resolve the delivery problems but would not comment, for commercial reasons, on whether it had been forced to pay over the odds to get Bidvest back on board. The company said: ""Our focus remains on ensuring our customers can enjoy our chicken without further disruption. ""With that in mind, the decision has been taken in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics.""We've been working hard to resolve the present situation with QSL and DHL. This decision will ease pressure at DHL's Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible.""As it stands, over 97% of our 900 restaurants are now open for business, although there will be some limited menus before we are back to business as usual."" A spokesperson for DHL responded: ""We acknowledge KFC's decision to invite Bidvest Logistics to service its 350 restaurants in the north of the UK. ""In conjunction with our partners, we remain fully committed to delivering excellent service to KFC's remaining 550 restaurants across the UK."""

The retailer left 2,500 roles hanging in the balance when it missed a deadline to raise finances through a rescue deal - a move first reported by Sky News. The collapse sealed a horrific day for the high street as Toys R Us UK had confirmed its demise just an hour earlier - also succumbing to pressures on the sector including weak consumer confidence and high costs. PwC said on Thursday: ""Unfortunately, it has not been possible to secure a buyer for the business. ""While the administrators remain open to interest from potential buyers, it has been necessary to make a total of 63 redundancies at Maplin's head offices in London and Rotherham. ""All staff affected have been informed and will be paid up to and including their last day of employment."" ""The administrators thank the employees for the support, service and co-operation they have provided to the company, both before and during the administration. ""The administrators continue to review the position of Maplin stores and will provide further updates in due course. All 217 shops are currently open but Toby Underwood, joint administrator and PwC partner, added: ""The company is continuing to trade but due to a lack of interest we may be required to initiate a controlled closure programme. ""We still believe there is strong value in the company and we remain focused on doing all we can to preserve the business while we continue trying to achieve a sale."""
2018-03-09,The European Commission has demanded more than ¬£2.4bn from Britain over unpaid customs duties on cheap Chinese fashion imports.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/eu-demands-24bn-in-unpaid-customs-duties-from-uk-over-chinese-fashion-imports-11281225,"It relates to shoes and clothes that have arrived in UK ports from China since 2007. Their value was under-reported by importers to minimise the customs duties collected and subsequently paid to Brussels. The EU's anti-fraud office, OLAF, found that UK authorities took no action despite being informed of the risk of customs evasion and asked to take appropriate measures. Failing to stamp out the ""undervaluation fraud scheme"" meant a loss to the EU budget of ‚Ç¨2.7bn (¬£2.4bn), the commission calculated. A Government spokesperson told Sky News it does not recognise the estimate of alleged duty loss, adding: ""We take customs fraud very seriously and we continue to evolve our response as new threats emerge. ""We will carefully examine the formal notice from the Commission and respond in due course. The UK intends to continue to work closely with OLAF and the Commission on customs fraud. ""HMRC has a very strong track record for tackling evasion and rule-breaking of all kinds, securing a record ¬£28.9bn last year that would otherwise have gone unpaid."" A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May added in separate remarks that ""we believe the methodology used overestimates UK import values and is not suitable to produce an estimate of alleged customs duty undervaluation"". Revealing its decision, the European Commission said in a statement: ""Despite having been informed of the risks of fraud relating to the importation of textiles and footwear originating in the People's Republic of China since 2007, and despite having been asked to take appropriate risk control measures, the United Kingdom failed to take action to prevent the fraud. ""The United Kingdom is liable for the financial consequences of its infringements of EU legislation."" OLAF‚Äôs report, published last year, said UK importers evaded a ""large amount"" of customs duties through the use of fictitious and false invoices and incorrect customs value declarations. It said there was a ""dramatic"" increase in the scale of the fraud between 2011 and 2017."

In a study of 153 areas where EU laws intersect with devolved powers, the Government insists the ""vast majority"" of powers returning from Brussels will go straight to devolved governments on the first day the UK leaves the EU. It also says none of the existing powers held by Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh will be affected in any way. But the analysis does admit 24 policy areas are expected to require - in whole or in part - a UK-wide legislative framework after Brexit, which will result in a temporary restriction on devolved governments using new powers. The Government says this is to provide ""certainty"" to UK businesses while new legal systems are agreed. It comes amid a continuing battle between the Government and the devolved administrations over the EU Withdrawal Bill. Both the Scottish Government and Welsh Government have signalled their intent to push ahead with alternative Brexit legislation, in order to protect against what they claim is a Westminster ""power grab"" over the UK's exit from the EU. The Prime Minister has been told she faces a constitutional crisis if she does not win the consent of devolved administrations for the EU Withdrawal Bill. The analysis, published on Friday by the Cabinet Office, claims Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh will see new powers in areas such as water quality, carbon capture, HGV charging and hydrocarbon licensing. The document adds those areas where EU powers will return to Westminster for a temporary period are expected to include animal health, food safety and labelling, and chemical regulation. Despite agriculture being a devolved matter, the UK Government claims different regimes in these areas within the UK after Brexit could hinder the UK's ability to sign new trade deals, or potentially increase costs for companies and lead to confusion for consumers. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said: ""This is cast iron evidence that the EU Withdrawal Bill will deliver significant brand new powers for the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. ""The list we have published today shows how many EU powers that were controlled by Brussels, will, after Brexit, be controlled by the parliaments and assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. ""The vast majority of these new powers will be in the control of the devolved administrations on the day we leave the EU. ""There is a much smaller group of powers where the devolved governments will be required to follow current EU laws for a little bit longer while we work out a new UK approach. ""We are discussing with the devolved governments how this process will work but, as the UK government, we feel very strongly that we must have the ability to take action to protect the UK internal market which represents a huge investment to everyone in the UK."" Mr Lidington insisted the Government has ""moved a considerable distance to accommodate the concerns"" of devolved governments and urged them to ""engage in a similarly constructive manner"". However, the Scottish Government's Brexit minister Michael Russell said the Cabinet Office analysis ""simply confirms the UK Government's plans for a power grab"". He said: ""Under the EU Withdrawal Bill the UK will have the right to take control of any of the powers on this list. ""However, the publication of the categories demonstrates the threat is most immediate in key devolved areas such as agriculture, GM crops, fishing, environmental policy, public procurement, food standards and a range of other areas. ""Unless the bill is changed Westminster could soon be in control of these policies amounting to a major power grab and a re-writing of the devolution settlement the people of Scotland voted for so decisively."" He added the Scottish Government's will continue to proceed with their own EU Continuity Bill at Holyrood, in the absence of an agreement over the Westminster legislation. At a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Council of the UK Government and devolved administrations this week, Mr Lidington committed to tabling changes to Clause 11 of the EU Withdrawal Bill in order to ease devolution concerns, but was told the proposed amendments do not go far enough."
2018-03-09,Labour have suspended party members over comments made on a controversial Facebook group that Jeremy Corbyn used to be a part of.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-admits-being-member-of-controversial-facebook-group-11281462,"Sky News understands disciplinary procedures are under way over the Palestine Live group on the social network, amid allegations anti-Semitic posts were shared. Some of those reported to have made abusive comments, who are also Labour members, have been suspended from the party. But, not all of those accused of posting offensive messages about Jews on the group are registered with the party, Sky News has been told. Mr Corbyn has said he was signed up to the Palestine Live forum without his knowledge and later replied to messages on it, but added he was not fully aware of the group's content. ""I was joined on to that group without knowing it in probably about 2013/14,"" he said. ""I removed myself from the group in 2015. ""I replied by Facebook message to a couple of things about a suggestion on the vote on recognising Palestine, which I supported, and inviting a doctor to speak at an event. ""I have never trawled through the whole group. I have never read all the messages on it. I have removed myself from it. ""Obviously, any anti-Semitic comment is wrong. Any anti-Semitism in any form is wrong."" The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism has published screenshots of messages purported to have been posted on the group. Among the reported remarks are allegations about Israeli involvement in the 9/11 terror attacks, as well as links to postings from neo-Nazi groups. The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said there was ""no conceivable justification"" for Mr Corbyn's involvement in the group and that it would be filing a disciplinary complaint against him to the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn said Labour ""doesn't tolerate"" anti-Semitism ""in any form"", adding: ""Had I seen it, of course, I would have challenged it straight away but I actually don't spend all my time reading social media."" Speaking to Sky News on Friday, shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised ""firm action"" if any members of the Facebook group found expressing anti-Semitic views were also linked to the Labour Party. ""If any of those individuals are associated or members of the Labour Party, we will take firm action against them,"" he said. ""I know I've been criticised at times because I'm quite heavy on this, and I am heavy and so is Jeremy, we will not allow any racists within our party. ""Included in that racism is anti-Semitism. It is appalling and we will not accept it. ""So, I tell you, if we find any of those in that Facebook group were expressing anti-Semitic views, we will take action against them in the party."" Mr McDonnell also claimed Mr Corbyn ""immediately"" left the group when he discovered there were people expressing anti-Semitic views. But, a senior source within the Labour leader's office insisted Mr McDonnell's comments were ""not right"". Instead, Mr Corbyn left the Facebook group, along with others, as part of a ""routine"" review of his social media accounts when he was elected party leader in 2015 and it was not the case he saw anti-Semitic or offensive messages, the source added. Mr Corbyn was described as ""not an active participant"" of the group and merely replied to a small number of messages he was tagged in and received notifications about. It comes as former chief rabbi Lord Sacks called on the Labour leadership to do more to fight anti-Semitism. When asked what he would say to Mr Corbyn if he sat down with him, Lord Sacks said: ""I would want to see clearer signs of resolute action by a party and its leader before I would even sit down with them full stop."" Responding to Lord Sacks' comments, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: ""Jeremy Corbyn and the whole Labour Party condemns and campaigns against anti-Semitism in all its forms. ""We strengthened our rules last year to guarantee there is no place in Labour for prejudice or bigotry. Our party has deep roots in the Jewish community and is actively engaged with Jewish organisations across the country. ""We are campaigning to increase support and confidence in Labour among Jewish people in the UK."""
2018-03-09,"The EU Exit Analysis: Cross Whitehall Briefing may have been marked ""Official - Sensitive"" and ""Market Sensitive"", but the reality was that the 29-page document is deeply politically sensitive, for the Government and its strategy.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180309132922/https://news.sky.com/story/easy-to-see-why-government-wanted-to-keep-brexit-analysis-secret-11281647,"Of course some MPs will describe the numbers as garbage, others as proof that their concerns are inevitably true. It is the official work of cross-departmental economists, and its preamble reveals that it has been put together in a different way to the pre-referendum Treasury forecasts. It is modest about what can be predicted, but says the work was done to give a ""broad directional"" picture on the ""best available evidence"". Even if you don't believe the numbers, it provides some pointers and reveals some realities. Firstly on the issue of the past 24 hours - the City and financial services. Even with a Free Trade Agreement ""market access would be hampered almost to the same extent as the World Trade Organisation scenario"". It stresses the limitations ""of the current equivalency regimes"". These factors among others mean that ""London's status as a financial centre could be severely eroded"". This is far from the message offered only yesterday on the Chancellor's speech on Brexit and financial services. There is also some revealing internal analysis of the Government's unprecedented target relationship. The PM's ""Florence model"" out of the customs union could lead to ""high"" customs barriers and some ""low"" tariffs. Only the ""Customs Partnership"" option, described as ""blue skies"" by David Davis, would maintain zero customs barriers. A ""no deal"" outcome, even one mitigated ahead of time, would lead to ""high"" customs barriers, ""high"" trade barriers away from borders and ""high"" tariffs with the EU. Tariffs though, aren't the real problem. That was confirmed by the EU27 offer yesterday of a tariff free deal on goods. The entire report reads like a plea from the Civil Service for ministers to actually understand the concept of non-tariff barriers. Such barriers of regulation, employment, standards etc are the ""most material factor"" - ie the most damaging to the economy. As revealed by Sky News last month, when converted to an equivalent tariff, these numbers are huge in certain sectors - retail, defence, agriculture, food and drink, motor vehicles and chemicals. With no guide to how to model the increase in costs from leaving a free trade agreement, the analysis uses adjusted estimates on the effect of joining one. It is this that drives the rest of the bad news in the numbers. It is why the loss in trade from the introduction of new non-tariff barriers into European trade hugely outweighs the total impact of signing free trade deals with the US, Australia, New Zealand, the whole of the Trans Pacific Partnership, ASEAN, the Gulf Co-operation Council, China and India. It is 0.7% of GDP upside versus the downside of -3 to -10% of GDP from leaving the single market, customs union or leaving with no deal. This should not be surprising, even if it is fair to say that such specific long range predictions are difficult. The analysis is enumerating what is clear but not necessarily obvious. The single market is by its design (by British civil servants such as Lord Cockfield) meant to eliminate non-tariff barriers. Leaving the single market as a policy aim is also a policy to introduce non-tariff barriers into Britain's trade. These are the most important barriers for a service based economy. Modelling such barriers is difficult, but likely to fall within certain parameters. The impacts will hit sectors most exposed to European trade, and in turn regions such as the North East, West Midlands and Northern Ireland which have the highest concentrations of such trade. The mathematics does not support the notion that gains from free trade deals will outweigh more than a fraction of the trade losses from introducing barriers into trade with our biggest market. But even if they did, there would still be sectors that suffered badly from losing frictionless access to European markets, indeed from the loss of a continent of 440 million as a barrier-free home market. Clearly the June 2016 referendum result was not about economics. But there may be a small clue into the Government's thinking on the future relationship. In one of the final pages showing how there is no Brexit dividend (essentially the fiscal impact of non-tariff barriers alone outweighs the savings on EU budget payments), it says ""Swiss-style"" payments could be made into the EU budget, even in a free-trade relationship. So Switzerland it is. Even if you hate the numbers, the document is useful, and is clearly informing the PM's approach, for example following EU rules on chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Around 180 troops, including Royal Marines, RAF personnel and chemical specialists, have been deployed in Salisbury to help police with their investigation, as attention moved to the burial site of Mr Skripal's wife and son. Scotland Yard requested specialist help to remove vehicles and objects from scenes across the city amid fears of contamination. Officers in hazmat suits were sent to Salisbury's London Road cemetery, where a tent was erected over the memorial to Mr Skripal's son Alexander, who was cremated last year. Officers also sealed off the gravestone of Mr Skripal's wife Liudmila, who was buried there in 2012. Police say their deaths are part of the investigation into the poisoning of Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, who were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury on Sunday evening. :: Poisoned spy's friend: He was lonely after his son and wife died They remain in a serious condition in hospital, along with detective sergeant Nick Bailey, who was also exposed to the nerve agent. Sky News Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt said police believe all three victims may have been contaminated at Mr Skripal's house in Salisbury and ""ingested the poison some hours before they were taken ill"". Mrs Rudd, who visited the city centre and hospital where DS Bailey is being treated, warned the Government was ""committed to doing all we can to bring the perpetrators to justice - whoever they are and wherever they may be"". Russia's foreign minister said the country would consider helping UK authorities investigate the poisoning after the Kremlin denied involvement. Sergei Lavrov seemed to resent suggestions that Moscow was behind the nerve agent attack on the Skripals, calling such claims ""propaganda"". Salisbury's MP John Glen has sought to reassure his constituents that a ""whole range of tools are at our disposal"" once it is established who was behind the poisoning. Mr Glen was responding to some locals who had demanded ""decisive action"" over the incident. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury said in a Facebook post: ""Now is the time for cool heads and a rational examination of the facts. ""Once these are established, then, and only then, will an appropriate and proportionate course of action be taken. A whole range of tools are at our disposal depending on who has perpetrated this act, including a number of financial and economic levers."" Skripal served four years of a 13-year sentence in Russia after he was caught spying for MI6 and was released as part of a spy exchange in 2010, when he was given refuge in the UK. The circumstances of the attack, and its echoes of the fatal poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, have prompted questions over the Government's response if the evidence points to a state-sponsored assassination plot."

Mr Seely, who is also a former Soviet Union reporter for The Times, said the investigation needs to be balanced and facts need to be established before fingers are pointed. He told Sky News: ""Regardless of whether the Russians are involved in this case, they are fighting a new Cold War against us and you need to wisen up to that fact. ""This is very likely the Russians - you don't get nerve agent down the freezer aisle in Morrisons. ""This comes from one or two places in the world, and one of them is the Russians.

Police sergeant Nick Bailey, 38, is also in a serious condition. He is believed to have been the first person at the scene, although there are now suggestions he may have become ill after retracing Mr Skripal's steps from his home in Salisbury. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said all the evidence pointed to the nerve agent attack being ordered by the Kremlin. Home Secretary Amber Rudd warned the Government is ""committed to doing all we can to bring the perpetrators to justice - whoever they are and wherever they may be"". The Kremlin insists it is not involved. On Friday Russia's foreign minister said the country would consider helping UK authorities investigate the poisoning. Mr Skripal served four years of a 13 year sentence in Russia after he was caught spying for MI6 and was released as part of a spy exchange in 2010, then given refuge in the UK. Sergei Lavrov expressed resentment at suggestions that Moscow was behind the nerve agent attack on the Skripals, calling such claims ""propaganda"". ""What we see is only news reports ... saying that if it is Russia, then a response is going to be given that Russia is going to remember forever,"" Mr Lavrov said during a visit to Addis Ababa. ""That is not serious. This is propaganda fair and square and it is trying to raise tensions."" Mary Dejevsky, a former foreign correspondent, said she was shocked at ""how far people have gone in implicating Russia before there is the slightest bit of proof"". ""We should be finding culprits, not second guessing Russia before we've got any evidence at all,"" she told Sky News. Sunday's attack has drawn comparisons with the case of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with polonium at a London hotel in 2006. On his deathbed he accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind his radiation poisoning. Scotland Yard said the evidence suggested that the ""only credible explanation is one way or another the Russian state"" was involved. Russia refused to extradite the main suspect, former Russia agent Andrey Lugovoy, to the UK to face charges."

There may be some clues floating around in here."" Raymond Rickman, a family friend of the policeman said: ""Nick grew up next door to us. Super boy. Very nice. ""He's an example of the quality of the police that we have. They obviously do their job, which they‚Äôre trained to do, but I should think there are occasions where they step beyond that expectation,"" he told Sky News. Mr Rickman says he has been neighbours with the family for many years and that he thought Nick is a ""super boy"". ""He's everything one would expect a good, local chap to be. Always very communicative and supportive,"" he said, adding: ""I admire him intensely."" DS Bailey joined the police in 2002. He was familiar with Salisbury city centre as he had worked there as a member of the neighbourhood policing team. He spent two years building a case against Arthur Bonner, who sexually assaulted numerous victims over four decades between the early 1970s and 2014. Wiltshire's chief constable Keir Pritchard visited him in hospital. ""I very much hope Nick will be on his feet back at work very soon,"" he told the BBC. ""We desperately miss him.

Those taking part in an experiment were shown 16 pairs of images showing a woman made up for a night out and her make-up free. They were then asked to choose the better leader. The faces and the amount of make-up shown was manipulated by computer software for the research, which was published in the Perception journal. Women were evaluated more negatively as a leader if the image suggested she was wearing a lot of make-up. This was the result for both male and female participants. ""This research follows previous work in this area which suggests that wearing make-up enhances how dominant a woman looks,"" said Dr Christopher Watkins, of the university's division of psychology. ""While the previous findings suggest that we are inclined to show some deference to a woman with a good-looking face, our new research suggests that make-up does not enhance a woman's dominance by benefiting how we evaluate her in a leadership role."" The findings contradict Harvard University research in 2016 which found women who wore make-up were seen as better at their jobs and more likely to be promoted. A 2013 survey backed those findings as more than two thirds of British employers said they would be less likely to employ a female applicant is she turned up to an interview without make-up. The research by cosmetics retailer escentual.com also showed almost half of bosses said it would be a major factor if the job was in sales or a role dealing with customers and clients."

Emergency services were called at about 1.30pm on Thursday but the boy, thought to be Finch's eight-year-old son Brodie Moran, was found dead. According to Sky News Australia, one of the lines of inquiry reportedly being followed by police is whether he may have been suffocated. After being charged with murder, Finch made a brief appearance at Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Friday. The Age newspaper reported that she appeared dazed as she entered the courtroom and sat quietly in the dock. During the three-minute hearing, the court heard that she had not been in police custody before and that she was taking a daily dose of an anti-depressant. Finch's Facebook page says she is from Ewell, near Epsom in Surrey, and works as a brand ambassador for Crabtree & Evelyn. Brodie's father is reported to be Lee Moran, who is from Manchester but lives in Shanghai.

Mr Hinds, who took over at the Department for Education in January, will accept that rising pupil numbers are making it difficult for schools to recruit and retain staff. His remarks come amid continuing concerns about teacher shortages, particularly in maths and physics. Mr Hinds will say: ""Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn. ""We need to get back to the essence of successful teaching - strip away the workload that doesn't add value and give teachers the time and the space to focus on what actually matters."" Secondary schools across England have seen a recent increase in pupil numbers, prompted by a spike in the birth rate in the early 2000s, which is fuelling demand for teachers. In a bid to boost teacher numbers, Mr Hinds is expected to say there will be no new tests or exams, or changes to the national curriculum, beyond those already announced, before 2022. He will also admit that the current system for holding schools to account can ""feel very high stakes for school leaders"", which filters down to staff. Mr Hinds will make his speech on Saturday to the Association of School and College Leaders' (ASCL) at their annual conference in Birmingham. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman is also expected to say the watchdog will look at how it can help to reduce teacher workload. She will tell the conference: ""When I see newly qualified teachers brimming with passion to change young lives for the better, I think it an utter travesty that so many end up losing their early enthusiasm, because of the pressures of the job. Especially when so many of those pressures are entirely unnecessary. ""Because that's what endless data cuts, triple marking, 10-page lesson plans, and, worst of all, Mocksteds are: a distraction from the core purpose of education. And a costly distraction at that."" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said the Conservatives had been promising to solve teachers' ""workload crisis for years"" but had ""missed their own recruitment targets five years in a row, and teachers are leaving the profession in record numbers""."

The shows would give Mr Obama, who was US president for eight years until Donald Trump took over after the 2016 election, an unfiltered way of talking to the public. He already has an audience on Twitter, where he has 101 million followers, and Facebook, with 55 million. He would not use the shows to respond to Mr Trump or his conservative critics, however. Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president, told the newspaper: ""Throughout their lives, they have lifted up stories of people whose efforts to make a difference are quietly changing the world for the better. ""As they consider their future personal plans, they continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories."" Among the issues close to the former president's heart are health care, voting rights, foreign policy and climate change; while the former first lady championed the importance of nutrition during her time in the White House. It has not been revealed how much the Obamas might be paid for their involvement. The New York Times also reported that Apple and Amazon have shown interest in content deals with the couple. But Mr Obama has connections to Netflix: his ambassador to the Bahamas - Nicole A Avant - is married to Netflix's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos. Netflix has not commented on the talks."

2018-03-10,"Perched just off the south-eastern corner of famous ""Silicon Roundabout"", at the heart of the UK's burgeoning tech start-up scene, you can find the headquarters of a company that is one of the standard-bearers of the UK's space industry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180310135649/https://news.sky.com/story/space-firm-in-transition-as-profits-fall-11282642,"Inmarsat, a FTSE-100 member as recently as two years ago, is a global leader in the field of satellite technology. Its 13 satellites enable thousands of ships to traverse the globe, airlines to provide wi-fi services to their passengers in the air, enables engineers in the oil and gas sector to do work remotely and also helps journalists broadcast from far-away locations. And it's also a major supplier to the US military. At the moment, though, it's fair to say that this is a business going through something of a transition. Full year results on Friday brought news of a 23% fall in pre-tax profits, to $229.8m (this UK company reports in US dollars as most of its trading income is in that currency), despite a 5% rise in annual revenues to $1.4bn. Worse still, so far as shareholders will be concerned, was news that the dividend in respect of the second half of the year has been cut by 60% to a level where it is ""expected to stay"" until cash flows recover. Shares of Inmarsat have fallen by almost 6% on this development which, the company is stressing, has to be seen in the context of it having returned $2.1bn to investors since its stock market flotation in 2005. There are two elements at play here. The first is that Inmarsat has decided it would be unwise to depend on future cash payments from Ligado Networks, a US satellite company that was previously called LightSquared, which uses some of its airwaves. These payments, worth $136m to Inmarsat, are due to ""pause"" at the end of the year before resuming in 2020 but questions remain over whether Ligado will receive a licence from US regulators allowing it to reinvent itself as a mobile network. That licence approval is critical to future payments to Inmarsat, which has pointed out that its contract with the company has already survived Ligado going through a previous bankruptcy process. The other factor is that Inmarsat wishes to conserve its cash while it continues to invest in future opportunities. During 2017, the company launched two new satellites, one of which went up in one of entrepreneur Elon Musk's Falcon 9 rockets. This pushed up Inmarsat's capital expenditure by 45%, to $598.7m, but it wants to carry on investing this year to boost its position, in particular, in the aviation sector. It believes providing in-flight connectivity (IFC) to airlines is going to be its main growth opportunity in coming years on the basis that, in order to compete more effectively, commercial airlines are going to have to offer this to passengers as a matter of course. Inmarsat said: ""The retail value for satellite operators and services providers delivering IFC connectivity services to the industry is predicted to grow from around $1bn in 2017 to $5.4bn by 2026. ""Fuirthermore, there is expected to be a ramp-up in the number of connected aircraft in operation in the future - from 6,000 in 2015 to over 20,000 by the middle of the next decade. ""Over 70% of these new aircraft are expected to be based in the relatively nascent IFC markets of Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. ""These regions will drive the majority of the future growth of the global air transport industry and are therefore key target areas for Inmarsat."" Companies asking shareholders to exchange returns today for jam tomorrow is nothing new. However, in this instance, it looks justified. Demand for aviation is going to grow strongly in coming years, particularly in emerging markets, while people are increasingly expecting to be connected everywhere. Connecting them while they are in the air therefore does look to be a great opportunity for this fascinating company - even if it means that, for those of us who prefer to travel in relative peace and quiet, things may get a bit noisier when we're in the air in future."

It also creates a ""guardian"" programme that enables teachers and other school employees to carry handguns - a proposal President Donald Trump has backed. Florida Governor Rick Scott signed the $400m bill flanked by family members of students who were killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Within hours the National Rifle Association had filed a suit challenging the bill - saying it is unconstitutional under the second and 14th amendments of the US Constitution. Signing the new regulations, Governor Scott said: ""It's an example to the entire country that government can and has, moved fast."" But he said he was still ""not persuaded"" about the guardian programme. ""I'm glad, however, the plan in this bill is not mandatory,"" the Republican added. ""If counties don't want to do this, they can simply say no."" Other measures in the bill include extending a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns and setting up an anonymous tip line where people can report threats. The bill does not include a ban on assault-style weapons, such as the one used during the Florida massacre. Many survivors of the school shooting had called for the bill - which narrowly passed the House and Senate - to go further. Student Chris Grady said: ""Obviously, this is what we've been fighting for. ""It's nowhere near the long-term solution. It's a baby step, but a huge step at the same time. ""Florida hasn't passed any legislation like this in God knows how long. It's nowhere near what we want, but it's progress and uplifting to see."" Governor Scott told the students: ""You helped change our state. You made a difference. You should be proud."" The bill marks Governor Scott's break with the National Rifle Association. The group's powerful lobbyist Marion Hammer called the bill ""a display of bullying and coercion"" that would violate Second Amendment rights and punish law-abiding citizens."

Mr Hancock said more needed to be done to safeguard young people and suggested an age-verification system. He said there would be a new legal requirement for companies to ensure users were over 13 years old. The details of how such a scheme would work are still being worked out. ""There is a genuine concern about the amount of screen time young people are clocking up and the negative impact it could have on their lives,"" he told the Times. ""For an adult I wouldn't want to restrict the amount of time you are on a platform but for different ages it might be right to have different time cut-offs.""

The platforms already specify a minimum age of 13 but children only have to falsify a date of birth to gain access, despite critics claiming most sites are able to identify underage users from their browsing habits. Mr Hancock said it was ""not beyond the wit of man"" to develop an age-verification system for children.

""We are committed to supporting the Kingdom as it modernises the Saudi armed forces and develops key industrial capabilities critical to the delivery of Vision 2030."" Shares in BAE Systems were up 2.7% on the news. The preliminary deal comes on the final day of a three-day official visit by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The visit included talks with Prime Minister Theresa May, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and an audience with the Queen. There was also an estimated ¬£65bn of additional trade agreed for the coming years as part of the Crown Prince's Vision 2030 economic plan. :: UK senses opportunity in Saudi reforms Sky News Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said the memorandum of intent still required the details to be ironed out before a final contract is signed, but he added: ""You wouldn't expect things to go backwards now though.

Before his visit, the 32-year-old Crown Prince talked about the importance of security ties between between the UK and Saudi Arabia. He said both countries would be ""much safer if you have a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia"". But there have been protests because of Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen. Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said the UK had already licensed ¬£4.6bn of arms for Saudi Arabia since the Yemen conflict began in 2015. He added: ""If agreed, this shameful deal will be celebrated in the palaces of Riyadh and by the arms companies who will profit from it, but it will mean even greater destruction for the people of Yemen."" Mrs May defended the UK's ties with Saudi Arabia earlier this week, saying all arms sales are strictly regulated. But she has also raised concerns about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen with the Crown Prince during his visit. The Eurofighter Typhoon is the most advanced swing-role combat aircraft available and there are almost 500 in service across Europe. It is the primary quick reaction and expeditionary aircraft of the UK, Spain, Germany and Italy. Some 5,000 people are employed by BAE Systems on the Typhoon programme, covering production and support."

Sir John shared the Nobel Prize for medicine in 2002 for work on how genes regulate organ development and how cells die. He also served on the Human Genetics Commission from 2000 to 2009. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, said: ""John was a brilliant scientist and a wonderful, kind and principled man. ""His leadership was critical to the establishment of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Human Genome Project, one of the most important scientific endeavours of the past century.""His dedication to free access to scientific information was the basis of the open access movement, and helped ensure that the reference human genome sequence was published openly for the benefit of all humanity.

The increases were also highlighted by the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) think tank in February, which found 93% of councils were planning to hike charges to balance their budgets. It comes as many households face an above-inflation council tax increase next month. The increases are likely to anger many drivers, with complaints that parking charges are being used unfairly to generate additional revenue. One 500-yard stretch of residential road in the borough of Lambeth in London generated more than ¬£900,000 in fines in 2010. According to the Mail, councils including Bournemouth, Brighton and Hove, Bristol City, Cheltenham, Dover, Flintshire, Leicester, Reading, and Thanet have quietly announced plans to raise charges. Cheltenham Council increased charges 45% on 1 March. Tory MP Sir Greg Knight told the Mail that the move could harm high street takings. ""The high street in many towns and cities is already under threat from internet shopping and higher parking charges could well have the effect of pushing more small town centre shops into liquidation."" Councils hit with big cuts to their central government funding are also considering increasing the cost of social and home care, waste management and planning applications."

He was initially seen and assessed within an hour and was asked to wait. After a blood test suggested possible heart problems he was made to wait again to be seen by senior staff. But he suffered a cardiac arrest and died at around 1am while still waiting. An email from Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust's medical director, Matthew Metcalfe, was leaked to the Health Service Journal. It said: ""Last night a patient died due entirely to the dangerous overcrowding of the department. ""The risk we have all been aware of, but may have felt hypothetical, has just happened."" A spokeswoman for the trust said the hospital's A&E unit had seen an average of 400 patients a day over the past few months, an increase of almost 30% on the same period last year. The trust said in a statement: ""This has inevitably had an impact on our ability to consistently provide a high standard of patient safety in our ED (Emergency Department). ""Although every effort is made to see, assess and treat patients quickly in our ED and (the hospital) has a good record in this regard. ""However, in this situation the long wait for further treatment and assessment led to an unacceptable outcome."" Mr Metcalfe added: ""We can confirm that we will be conducting a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of a patient who recently attended our emergency department. ""The impact of the pressure in our emergency department and the associated delays are not yet known and will be included within the scope of our investigation. ""We have expressed our sincere apologies to the family and will share our findings with them as soon as we can."" The hospital had said on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon that its accident and emergency department was ""currently under extreme pressure""."

Mr Guardiola argued wearing the symbol is not political but has accepted it is in breach of the FA's kit and advertising regulations. He has not apologised for the gesture, but has said he will stop wearing it during domestic matches in order to respect the rules. The Catalan-born manager will continue to wear the ribbon for pre and post-match media commitments - which is permitted because the FA's regulations refer specifically to the technical area during games. He can also wear it during Champions League matches, as he did for Wednesday's clash against Basel, because it is not a breach of UEFA codes. Guardiola accepted the charge earlier this week and did not wear the ribbon during Sunday's 1-0 victory over Chelsea. He instead wore a yellow daffodil in support of the Marie Curie Cancer Charity. In their response, Manchester City cited what they believe is an inconsistency in the rules, as Europe's football body UEFA has no rules to stop managers wearing the yellow ribbon. City also insisted in their written reply that Guardiola does not believe the yellow ribbon is a political symbol. Guardiola started wearing it after October's independence referendum in Catalonia, arguing it is not ""about politicians, it's about democracy"". The Spanish government deemed the vote to be illegal and leaders of the independence movement were jailed. FA chief executive Martin Glenn said ""it's a symbol of Catalan independence... We don't want political symbols in football"". Guardiola was charged for wearing it after last month's FA Cup loss at Wigan and since then he has either not worn the ribbon or he has covered it up. Speaking ahead of a Champions League tie with Basel he said: ""I accept the decision because I have to but that doesn't mean I agree or not, or they are right or not."""
2018-03-10,An Iraqi teen on trial over the Parsons Green bomb confessed to making the device and leaving it on a train when questioned by police 24 hours after the attack.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180310135649/https://news.sky.com/story/parsons-green-suspect-ahmed-hassan-admitted-making-bomb-court-hears-11283013,"Thirty people were injured after an improvised device filled with screwdrivers, nuts and knives partially detonated during rush hour last September on a Tube train at Parsons Green station. Victims were left with burns to the face, legs and hands and singed hair which fell out in clumps after the bomb - which was hidden inside a bucket in a Lidl bag - sent a ""fireball"" through the carriage. Ahmed Hassan, 18, who was spotted by PC Daniel Carmen sitting outside the passenger terminal at the Port of Dover the following day, initially shrugged when stopped and questioned. The media student told the officer his name was Ahmed Ali and said he had been sleeping rough. He then said his name was Ahmed Hassan Ali and he was waiting for a Syrian friend before going on a short trip to Holland. Police then positively identified Hassan from an image from a lift at Wimbledon station, and he was arrested. When asked later who made the bomb, he replied: ""I did"". Mr Hassan was then questioned about whether were any more devices, replying: ""There maybe a few milligram traces at my home address, at the back of the sofa in the conservatory in a black plastic bag."" The teenager is accused of making the bomb in his foster parents' kitchen using 400g of triacetone Triperoxide (TATP). The chemical is a primary high explosive, just a few grams could blow off someone's hands and fingers. Officers who searched foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, found traces of it in the kitchen sink and around the hob, the court heard. Parts of a soldering iron and a number of empty nut, bolt and screwdriver set boxes were also discovered left on the windowsill of the conservatory. Tuppaware containers which appeared to be part of the same set as one found within the bomb, similar knives and a matching blue vase to one found in the bomb detonator were also found at the house. The court was told that the bomb had the potential to be lethal if fully detonated, and that it was possible it had failed because it was wet. The jury was also shown a video of Mr Hassan destroying a mobile phone by putting it in an oven, smashing it with brick and flushing down toilet - all set to music. He denies all charges against him. The trial is expected to last two weeks."
2018-03-10,"Theresa May has described allegations of bullying in Parliament as ""concerning"", but says she retains confidence in Commons Speaker John Bercow.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180310135649/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-parliament-bullying-claims-are-concerning-and-should-be-investigated-11282651,"Downing Street said that the Prime Minister believes complaints of abuse made against MPs by staff should be ""fully investigated"". It comes after BBC Newsnight published allegations against Mr Bercow, which he ""utterly refutes"", and two other MPs. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister is clear that there can be no place for bullying or harassment of any kind at Westminster, and everybody should be free to work in an environment that is safe and respectful. ""If any complaints are made, they should be fully investigated."" He added: ""With regard to the Speaker, I note the allegations are being contested, but I think these are concerning allegations and there can be no place for bullying or harassment of any kind. ""If complaints are made, they need to be investigated."" The spokesman said Mrs May had confidence in Mr Bercow as Speaker. One female employee told the BBC there is a ""culture of fear"" within the Commons, with staff described as having little faith in complaints procedures. It followed an investigation involving dozens of interviews with current and former staff. The programme claimed Mr Bercow has a reputation as a bully. Kate Emms was said to have left a job as Mr Bercow's private secretary in 2011, after less than a year, due to his behaviour. The Speaker's spokesman said: ""The Speaker completely and utterly refutes the allegation that he behaved in such a manner, either eight years ago, or at any other time. ""Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue."" It was also alleged Tory MP Mark Pritchard is notorious for shouting at and berating House of Commons clerks, including telling one official: ""You stupid young woman, you haven't got a f****** clue what you're talking about. Who the f*** do you think you are?"" He told the programme: ""I understand, over the past several years the House authorities have addressed numerous complaints about MPs, but they have also informed me they have no record of any complaints against me, and if they had, I would have been notified."" Labour MP Paul Farrelly was reported to be subject to a complaint on behalf of former clerk Emily Commander. A subsequent inquiry in 2012 was said to have found Mr Farrelly's behaviour amounted to ""an abuse of power or position, unfair treatment and undermining a competent worker by constant criticism"", adding ""the conduct was offensive and insulting"". But, after the case was referred to the House of Commons Commission - a panel of MPs chaired by the Speaker - it was decided they could not rule Mr Farrelly had bullied Ms Commander, the programme said. Mr Farrelly told Newsnight: ""In 2012 allegations were made about me having bullied a clerk to the Committee during the compilation of the phone hacking report. ""These allegations were investigated and not upheld. ""Despite this, I apologised if I had inadvertently upset the clerk who had suffered stress. ""The policy under which they were investigated was considered to be so unfair to those complained about that it was immediately withdrawn and replaced by another policy."" A House of Commons spokesperson: ""We take the welfare of our staff extremely seriously, and strongly reject any claims to the contrary. ""It is a grotesque exaggeration to suggest that members of the House of Commons service work in a 'culture of fear' in relation to dealing with bullying and harassment by MPs. ""The House of Commons takes pride in being a responsible and supportive employer, and does not tolerate bullying or harassment of any kind. ""In 2014 the House of Commons introduced the revised Respect policy which is specifically designed to combat bullying and harassment of House employees by MPs or their staff. ""In addition, we have implemented a range of measures to complement the respect policy, including training for managers on how to address reports of bullying or harassment and a team of trained bullying and harassment contacts for staff to approach should they have concerns. ""We are unable to comment on any individual cases but note that the issues raised by BBC Newsnight precede the introduction of these new procedures and processes."""

A Prison Service spokesman confirmed Imiela had died in custody at HMP Wakefield on Thursday. ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman,"" the spokesman added. Imiela is believed to have died of natural causes and his death is not being treated as suspicious. He had been referred for parole in January but a hearing was unlikely to take place within six months. The railway worker, from Appledore near Ashford in Kent, carried out a spate of horrific assaults on women and girls he had never met. He grabbed them and dragged them into a secluded area, threatening to kill them and hit them. After his 2004 conviction, Imiela's DNA was put on a police database. A cold case review into a sex attack that happened on Christmas Day 1987 found a match between Imiela and victim Sheila Jankowitz, who died in 2006. He was jailed for 12 years at the Old Bailey in March 2012 after being found guilty of rape, indecent assault and another serious sex offence against Ms Jankowitz. In January, a spokesman for the Parole Board confirmed the Ministry of Justice had referred Imiela's case for a parole review. The review is ""following the standard six-month process for all indeterminate sentence prisoners"", the spokesman said. It came a week after the decision to release black cab rapist John Worboys which is now the subject of a judicial review."
2018-03-10,"A long-standing adviser to the Prince of Wales, who started as a teenage footman at Buckingham Palace, has been promoted to a major role in a reorganisation of the Prince's charities.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180310135649/https://news.sky.com/story/former-palace-footman-michael-fawcett-heads-up-princes-foundation-11283474,"Michael Fawcett has become chief executive of the new Prince's Foundation, which will include organisations that promote the built environment, heritage, culture and education. Mr Fawcett started working for the palace when he was 17 as a footman to the Queen and went on to become Charles' assistant valet. Most recently he was chief executive of the Dumfries House Trust, which will now be part of the Prince's Foundation. Chair of the foundation Jayne-Anne Gadhia said they were ""thrilled"" to have him on board. Mr Fawcett's salary is believed to be between ¬£85,000 to ¬£90,000. In 2003, he was accused of selling unwanted royal gifts and taking a percentage of the money but was cleared by an internal inquiry of financial misconduct. It found Mr Fawcett did ""infringe internal rules relating to gifts from suppliers"" but could not be severely criticised because the rules were not enforced and he made no secret of such gifts. He resigned but continued to work alongside the prince and became a trusted adviser. His events business, Premier Mode, organises parties and events both for Charles and other members of the Royal Family. It is understood Premier Mode will not supply services to the Prince's Foundation. It comes as Clarence House announced a reorganisation of Prince Charles' charities, to make sure they are operating in the most efficient way. As well as the new Prince's Foundation, the UK-based Prince's Trust and four international organisations will be merged into the Prince's Trust group. Prince Charles will take on a new role as Royal Founding Patron for his charities not covered under the new groupings. The palace says it is not an attempt to free up more of his time for official duties on behalf of the Queen. In a video message to his charities, the prince alluded to his 70th birthday in November this year and said it was a chance to reflect. He said: ""I have a strong sense of optimism and anticipation for what more may be achieved. These changes do not mean I am stepping back from my charitable work or downsizing in any way - it is simply an opportunity to work more efficiently and, I hope, to even greater effect. ""I look forward to many more years of building on the important work that has been achieved to date."" Prince Charles carries out approximately 600 engagements a year and the palace says there are no plans to reduce that in the coming year."
2018-03-10,"The Government has promised a ""robust"" response if Russia is behind the Salisbury nerve agent attack but what could be imposed on Vladimir Putin's regime?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180310135649/https://news.sky.com/story/salisbury-spy-how-will-uk-respond-if-russia-was-behind-nerve-agent-attack-11281502,":: Expelling diplomats There have been calls to expel Russia's ambassador to the UK if the Kremlin ordered the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Sir Christopher Wrey, the former UK ambassador to the US who has previously worked in Moscow, told Sky News: ""You could, if this is proven, take advantage of this horrible case and not only expel the ambassador, but drain the swamp of all these guys MI5 are tagging around the streets of London and wherever."" He added that the UK's response after the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 - when four Russian diplomats were expelled - ""probably was too weak"". :: Avoiding Russia's World Cup Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has suggested the UK's involvement at the World Cup in Russia this summer could be affected by the nerve agent attack. ""I think it would be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way and we would certainly have to consider that,"" he told the House of Commons. It was later clarified Mr Johnson was referring to the possibility that officials, dignitaries and ministers may not attend the World Cup, not that England would boycott the tournament. :: Sanctions Mr Johnson has also threatened fresh sanctions against Russia if it was responsible for the Salisbury poisoning. Britain has already backed tough UN and EU sanctions on Russia's economy to oppose its annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine. The sanctions targeted Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors, which are managed by the powerful elite around President Putin. :: Imposing 'The Magnitsky Act' The Government has introduced measures in the Criminal Finances Act, inspired by America's Magnitsky Act, to allow the assets of international human rights violators to be frozen. The US law was named after whistle-blowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow detention centre in 2009 after attempting to reveal a massive tax fraud against his British-based investment firm and the Russian state. The 37-year-old father-of-two was held for almost a year without trial and denied medical treatment. Home Secretary Amber Rudd indicated that the Salisbury incident may prompt further action. ""The Sanctions Bill is at the moment before the committee and I know there are people who are talking about wanting to put down amendments at report stage,"" she said. ""Of course what we have seen happening in the past few days may bring this more to the front."" :: Ending diplomatic ties Former Tory minister Nick Bold has urged Britain to break off diplomatic ties with Russia in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning. He said: ""I do not see how we can maintain diplomatic relations with a country that tries to murder people on British soil and puts the lives of British citizens at risk. ""It's time for us to turn tough talk into action."""
2018-03-10,"The chairman of Carillion denied that an emergency Government loan to the company would be ""a bailout‚Äé"" even as he warned ministers that a failure to support it could risk ""the physical safety of employees and the members of the public they serve"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180310135649/https://news.sky.com/story/carillion-chair-denied-taxpayer-loan-would-be-a-bailout-11283076,"Sky News has exclusively obtained an email sent by Philip Green to John Manzoni, the Cabinet Office permanent secretary‚Äé, less than 48 hours before Carillion was placed into compulsory liquidation. The message, which set out the construction group's request for a ""bridge through to a restructuring"", provides fresh evidence of the Carillion board's efforts to avoid taking responsibility for the parlous state of its finances, even as it neared collapse. In the email, dated 13 January, Mr Green said an emergency Government loan, thought to be for ¬£10m, would be made alongside support from commercial lenders, while ‚Äéadding that ""the group is simply asking for temporary support - not a permanent subsidy"". But in a further comment which is certain to renew scrutiny of the competence and judgement of Carillion's directors, Mr Green added that they were ""increasingly confident that it will be possible to achieve a restructuring"". ""There has been tremendous progress over the last few weeks with key stakeholders, and we have every reason to expect that it will be possible to agree the commercial terms of a deal before the end of January,"" he told Mr Manzoni. The Carillion chairman's confidence contrasts with evidence which has emerged over recent weeks as MPs on two Commons select committees have engaged in a detailed investigation of the former FTSE-100 company's collapse. Mr Green's email has not been disclosed as part of the MPs' inquiry. Shareholders in Carillion, which was a key contractor on the HS2 high-speed rail link, have castigated its auditor, KPMG, and its directors for their mismanagement of the company's finances. The Pensions Regulator has been among the other stakeholders to face fierce criticism as it emerged that‚Äé numerous opportunities to tackle its retirement deficit had been missed prior to the company running into trouble. Carillion's collapse, left 19,000 UK-based staff facing an uncertain future - with just over 8000 subsequently having their jobs salvaged under deals struck by the Official Receiver. In a stark reminder of the fallout from one of the biggest corporate insolvencies for years, though, 2500 former Carillion employees this week had fresh doubts raised about their livelihoods when a Canadian company abandoned a deal to take on a portfolio of contracts. Mr Green's email during the weekend before Carillion's collapse urged Mr Manzoni to accept the board's request on the basis that an emergency loan would be far less costly to the public purse. He said that some of Carillion's contracts, including with the Prison and Probation Service, would need ""adjustments"", but insisted that it would not ""put back risk to the public sector, which would be clearly inappropriate"". Mr Green went on to say that the ""extremely modest cost to HM Government"" of a successful restructuring of the company would ""not be a bail-out"". ""There can be no basis for saying that Carillion - or its shareholders or management team - is being rewarded for failure or for past mistakes,"" he wrote. That assertion has already been challenged by major investors in the construction group who this week accused board members of being more preoccupied with their pay than securing the future of the company. The request to Mr Manzoni went on to describe the potential consequences of Carillion being declared insolvent, saying that its board was reviewing the appropriateness of it continuing to trade. Mr Green warned that if support from any stakeholder was withdrawn, directors would ""conclude that there is no longer a reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation"". It emerged last week‚Äéend that a number of advisers were paid millions of pounds by Carillion just hours before Mr Green was submitting his final request to Mr Manzoni. Mr Green said it had not been possible for Carillion to undertake ""meaningful contingency planning to limit the impact of failure"" because of the company's ""complexity"" - a comment likely to stoke the debate about 'too big to fail' Government contractors. ""We are...deeply concerned that, if HM Government determines in the near term not to support Carillion, that will lead very rapidly into what is likely to be a very disorderly and value destructive insolvency process, with no real ability to manage the widespread loss of employment, operational continuity, the impact on our customers and suppliers, or (in the extreme) the physical safety of Carillion employees and the members of the public they serve,"" Mr Green wrote. ""Any attempt to manage this process will come with enormous cost to HM Government, far exceeding the costs of continued funding for the business."" The Carillion chairman ended what amounted to a final begging letter by referring to the ""limited runway"" available to the company, warning that ""we cannot wait indefinitely"". Mr Green and his boardroom colleagues are now facing profound questions about their management of a massive profit warning last July that was triggered by an ¬£845m writedown of the value of certain key contracts. Carillion held more than 450 Government contracts when it plunged into compulsory liquidation with total financial liabilities of more than ¬£5bn - including a pension deficit that at its most extreme valuation stood at ¬£2.6bn. The vast scale of the company's total indebtedness dwarfed its comparatively minuscule market capitalisation of just ¬£61m when the Official Receiver was called in. The Pension Protection Fund has now stepped in to provide compensation to 28,500 pension scheme members, with the total bill facing it likely to be up to ¬£920m. Several official investigations are now underway into Carillion's collapse, involving the pensions watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, the accountancy regulator and the Insolvency Service. Mr Green could not be reached for comment on Friday evening."

Aluminium is increasingly the packaging of choice for beer brewers worldwide, and they will likely face higher raw material costs once any tariff comes into effect. A fifth of all aluminium consumed in the US goes towards goods packaging. Major US beer producers have been expressing deep concerns over the prospect of larger overheads and thousands of job losses for the industry after the President proposed the tariffs - which he has now confirmed - last week. Felipe Dutra, finance director for AB InBev, the brewing giant behind popular brand Budweiser, said about two million jobs depend on America's beer industry. He urged the Department of Commerce and Mr Trump to consider the impact of the tariffs. Rival MillerCoors also expressed its disappointment. ""Like most brewers, we are selling an increasing amount of our beers in aluminium cans, and this action will cause aluminium prices to rise. It is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry,"" it said in a statement. The Beer Institute, a trade group representing around 5,000 US brewers, estimates the tariff will drive costs up by $348m (¬£250M) annually, threatening more than 20,000 jobs. Chief executive Jim McGreevy challenged Mr Trump's assertion that the tariffs against imported aluminium and steel were in the interests of national security. He urged the Department of Commerce ""to exclude imported aluminium and cansheet used to make beer cans from these tariffs so as not to unnecessarily increase costs on American business and put jobs at risk"". Ultimately, beer drinkers could carry the can for the tariffs, as any price rises could be passed onto them. Responding earlier this week to the tariff threat, European Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told journalists that certain types of bourbon are on a retaliatory list, alongside peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. She quipped that Europeans would be able to ""plan their whisky drinking"", as soon as the full list was made public."

Renowned for his cocky persona, Shkreli cried as he apologised to investors and told the judge he had made mistakes. He said: ""I want the people who came here today to support me to understand one thing, the only person to blame for me being here today is me. I took down Martin Shkreli. ""I am terribly sorry I lost your trust. You deserve far better."" In August, a jury had found him guilty of sending investors fake account statements and concealing huge losses. Prosecutors had described the 34-year-old as a master manipulator who duped investors, and were calling for a 15-year sentence. They said he deserved a stiffer sentence not because he is ""the most hated man in America"", but because he is a criminal convicted of serious fraud. In 2015, Shkreli hit the headlines after defending his decision to increase the price of Daraprim, a cheap drug for treating HIV, by 5,000%. When questioned about the price hike by Congress a few months later, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination - only to tweet after the hearing that the politicians were ""imbeciles"". Shkreli was later thrown off Twitter for harassing a female journalist, and caused controversy by making speeches with the conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. Throughout the case, Shkreli had insisted that he was being persecuted by prosecutors because he was outspoken - and after being convicted, he predicted that he was unlikely to receive a jail sentence. But last autumn, his bail was revoked by the judge after he offered his followers a $5,000 (¬£3,600) reward to anyone who could get a lock of Hillary Clinton's hair. At one point, Shkreli's lawyer told the judge: ""There are times when I want to hug him and hold him and comfort him and there are times when I want to punch him in the face."" In his defence, letters were given to the court which highlighted Shkreli's capacity for generosity - such as the time he has spent teaching inmates chess and mathematics and the counselling he gave to a rape victim. One supporter said Shkreli demonstrated kindness by adopting a cat called Trashy, while another insisted his social media contributions were valuable and akin to ""performance art"". Earlier this week, the judge ruled Shkreli will have to forfeit more than $7.3m (¬£5.2m), including his one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album which he bought for $2m(¬£1.4m)."

The singer agreed to buy the eight-acre property and its Roman villa-style buildings for $14.5m (¬£10.4m) in 2015, but the deal failed when its former residents objected. The Sisters of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary have owned the property for more than four decades but have not lived there for several years. Sister Holzman was joined by Sister Rita Callanan in trying to scupper the move by selling the property to a restaurant owner for $44,000 (¬£31,760). A judge ruled that the sale of the convent was invalid and Perry and the Catholic Church were awarded a total of almost $10m (¬£7.2m) in damages in December last year. The sisters had failed to get the consent of Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez and the Vatican for the sale. Sister Holzman died after collapsing during a post-judgment hearing on Friday. Hours before her death she spoke to US news channel Fox 11 LA, decrying the ruling that cleared the way for the sale of the property to Perry. She said: ""To Katy Perry, please stop. It's not doing anyone any good except hurting a lot of people."" Sister Callahan added: ""You have stolen the property of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart. ""Please archbishop... do what is right in your heart."" The nuns had set up the website Stand with the Sisters to represent their cause. A picture of Sister Holzman is now featured on the site, beneath the message: ""Rest with the angels our most precious treasure"". Archbishop Jose Gomez said: ""I was sad to hear the news of her passing and I have offered a mass for the repose of her soul. ""We extend our prayers today to the Immaculate Heart of Mary community and to all her friends and loved ones."""
2018-03-11,West Ham United have called an emergency meeting after several pitch invasions and crowd protests interrupted the club's 3-0 defeat to Burnley at the London Stadium on Saturday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180311143634/https://news.sky.com/story/ugly-scenes-as-pitch-invasions-halt-west-ham-defeat-to-burnley-11284827,"After a goalless first half, Burnley took the lead through Ashley Barnes in the 66th minute - prompting a number of supporters to invade the pitch and approach West Ham players. One supporter was thrown to the ground by club captain Mark Noble, who was then restrained by Joe Hart. Two more fans then encroached the pitch and were led away by Hammers defender James Collins. Moments later, Chris Wood put Burnley 2-0 up, and the match was interrupted for a second time when another pitch invader grabbed a corner flag and attempted to plant it in the centre of the pitch. Meanwhile, home fans gathered below the directors' box chanting ""sack the board"" and ""you destroyed our club"". Joint-owners David Gold and David Sullivan are understood to have left their seats for their own safety. Police had to be positioned along the touchline and specifically around the West Ham bench, where more disturbances appeared to take place. The Hammers then conceded a third following a mistake from Hart, who was then approached by more angry supporters in a third pitch invasion. In a statement, the club said it had launched a ""full and thorough investigation"" and is ""committed to taking decisive and appropriate action"". It added: ""An emergency meeting has been called with all London Stadium stakeholders. There will be no further comment at this time."" Following the game, West Ham manager David Moyes called on the club's fans to get behind the team. ""We want the supporters behind us, but you can't cross the line and come onto the pitch,"" Moyes told Sky Sports. ""I don't think I've been at football games in my time where I've seen that. All I'll say to all of them is that we need them. We're fighting for points. We're all in it. ""The players know we did well today for long periods. We didn't do so well for a couple of minutes in the second half. We needed the supporters with us in a different way. ""All I ask for is that everybody sticks together and we try to get ourselves enough points to make sure we're a Premier League team (next season)."" Metropolitan Police says it is investigating two reports of assault. No arrests have been made."
2018-03-11,Russian officials involved in corruption and human rights abuse could be targeted by new legislation banning them from entering Britain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180311143634/https://news.sky.com/story/russian-officials-involved-in-human-rights-abuse-and-corruption-could-face-uk-visa-ban-11285356,"Conservative MPs said discussions were ongoing with senior Cabinet ministers about introducing a UK version of the Magnitsky Act into the Sanctions Bill currently going through Parliament. The US legislation, passed in 2012, was designed to punish Russian officials involved in the death in custody of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky while he was investigating official corruption. It has since been extended to apply worldwide, with the US authorities publishing a list of ""gross violators of human rights"" who are subject to visa bans and asset freezes. Tory backbencher Richard Benyon told the Press Association: ""We are in negotiations with the Government which I hope will come to fruition in the report stage (of the Bill) which is down for April."" Former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell told the Sunday Telegraph: ""We have been making slow but reasonable progress with the Government in trying to reach a mutually acceptable position."" Discussions about the move - which is supported by Labour - started before the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, which left former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia fighting for their lives amid suspicion of Kremlin involvement. However, Mr Benyon said he believed the Salisbury case made the adoption of their amendments more likely. ""It has certainly concentrated minds,"" he said. If accepted it will almost certainly lead to a further worsening of relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin - who imposed a retaliatory ban on the adoption of Russian children by Americans. There was no immediate comment from the Foreign Office, which is piloting the Sanctions Bill through Parliament. However, a Whitehall source told the Sunday Telegraph: ""We started the process by putting it into the Criminal Finances Act 2017 and are looking at expanding it across other legislation. ""But we are clear that we will not do anything that can adversely impact the operational effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies."" Meanwhile the Conservative Party is facing criticism after The Sunday Times reported that it had declared donations of more than ¬£820,000 from ""Russian-linked supporters"" since Theresa May became Prime Minister in July 2016. Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko who died in London in 2006 after being given radioactive polonium, said they should not have taken the money. ""These donations are not just from the heart and for charitable reasons. They are all calculated,"" she told The Sunday Times. A Tory Party spokesman said: ""All donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law."""

They are already banned in Wales and Scotland, and the Government is now opening a short consultation over outlawing them in England. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""We are a nation of animal lovers, and the use of these punitive devices can cause harm and suffering, whether intentionally or unintentionally, to our pets. ""Organisations and MPs have campaigned against the use of shock collars passionately and we are listening to their concerns. ""We are now proposing to ban the use of electric shock collars to improve the welfare of animals."" Research has shown that the collars are often counterproductive, leading animals to re-direct aggression or generate anxiety-based behaviour. Positive training methods, based on reward and encouragement, are more successful and less harmful, according to pet organisations. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is launching the six week consultation amid growing public concern, and campaigns from the Dog's Trust and the RSPCA. David Bowles, head of public affairs for RSPCA, told Sky News: ""For dogs, the evidence is pretty clear that there are huge welfare products with this on dogs, and if you have got problems with your dog it is much better to do positive training. The dog may not even know why it is being shocked."" He said pet owners with the collars should ""look at why they're using it"" and throw them away. Caroline Kisko, Secretary of Kennel Club, which runs the Crufts Dog show, said: ""Training a dog with an electric shock collar causes physical and psychological harm and is never acceptable, especially given the vast array of positive training methods available. ""We are delighted that the Government has listened to the Kennel Club's long standing campaign to ban electric shock collars and hope that a ban on their use is imposed swiftly. ""Shock collars are often marketed as a harmless quick fix solution. The truth is that far from providing a solution, they can easily cause more problems than they seek to fix."""

Mr Hinds, who took over at the Department for Education in January, will accept that rising pupil numbers are making it difficult for schools to recruit and retain staff. His remarks come amid continuing concerns about teacher shortages, particularly in maths and physics. Mr Hinds will say: ""Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn. ""We need to get back to the essence of successful teaching - strip away the workload that doesn't add value and give teachers the time and the space to focus on what actually matters."" Secondary schools across England have seen a recent increase in pupil numbers, prompted by a spike in the birth rate in the early 2000s, which is fuelling demand for teachers. In a bid to boost teacher numbers, Mr Hinds is expected to say there will be no new tests or exams, or changes to the national curriculum, beyond those already announced, before 2022. He will also admit that the current system for holding schools to account can ""feel very high stakes for school leaders"", which filters down to staff. Mr Hinds will make his speech on Saturday to the Association of School and College Leaders' (ASCL) at their annual conference in Birmingham. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman is also expected to say the watchdog will look at how it can help to reduce teacher workload. She will tell the conference: ""When I see newly qualified teachers brimming with passion to change young lives for the better, I think it an utter travesty that so many end up losing their early enthusiasm, because of the pressures of the job. Especially when so many of those pressures are entirely unnecessary. ""Because that's what endless data cuts, triple marking, 10-page lesson plans, and, worst of all, Mocksteds are: a distraction from the core purpose of education. And a costly distraction at that."" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said the Conservatives had been promising to solve teachers' ""workload crisis for years"" but had ""missed their own recruitment targets five years in a row, and teachers are leaving the profession in record numbers""."

Investigators are reported to have found traces of a chemical weapon in one part of the Zizzi premises. No one else who was at the restaurant at the time is thought to be at risk, nor has it been suggested that their fellow diners had anything to do with the suspected attack, the BBC said. Police have identified more than 240 witnesses and are examining more than 200 pieces of evidence as they investigate the attempted murder of Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who fell ill while trying to help the pair, is in a serious condition. :: What is a nerve agent and how does it work? After chairing a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee on Saturday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd gave details of the investigation, which involves more than 250 counter-terror officers. She said: ""We need to give the police and the investigators the space to get on with [it]. ""I want to stress that they are proceeding with speed and professionalism. ""We are putting in enormous resources to ensure that they have all the support that they need to do that."" :: Russia willing to help in spy investigation Ms Rudd did not give details on the nerve agent that was used and would not be drawn about who might have been responsible. She said: ""This investigation is focused on making sure that we keep people safe and also that we collect all the evidence so that when it comes to attribution (of the attack) we will be absolutely clear where it should be."" Meanwhile, DS Nick Bailey, who was one of the first on the scene after the Skripals were found, thanked the public for their support during his recovery. :: Who, and what, could be behind poison attack? A statement released by Wiltshire Police said: ""Nick would like us to say on his behalf that he and his family are hugely grateful for all the messages of support from the public, and colleagues from the police family. ""People have been so kind and he has expressed that he will never forget that kindness. ""He also wishes to say that he was part of a group of officers and other emergency service colleagues who dealt with the initial incident. ""He wants to say that he does not consider himself a 'hero', he states he was merely doing his job - a job he loves and is immensely proud of - just like all of his other dedicated colleagues do, day in day out, in order to protect the public and keep people safe."" :: Who is Russian double agent Sergei Skripal? Some 21 people required medical treatment in the days following the poisoning. Earlier on Saturday, specialist military help was used to remove vehicles and objects from scenes across Salisbury amid fears of contamination. Around 180 troops, including chemical specialists, have been deployed in the city to help with the investigation. Officers in hazmat suits worked at the cemetery where there are memorials for both Mr Skripal's son Alexander, who was cremated last year, and wife Liudmila, who was buried there in 2012."

The court heard their father sexually abused them, slapped, punched and kicked them, pulled their hair, made them get up early and ordered them to bed as soon as they arrived home from school. The abuse was revealed after social services asked the judge to make orders to protect them from their father. Mrs Justice Knowles analysed the case at a private family court hearing in London on Friday. She said the girls were now in foster homes and their father was serving a 22-year prison term after he was convicted of a string of offences. She ruled the girls' father should have virtually no involvement in their lives. Council officials were told they did not need to consult or inform the father about ""any aspect"" of the girls' ""progress, development or well-being"" but he could be informed of any life-threatening medical emergency. The judge said the girls and the council involved cannot be identified. The father was found guilty of cruelty and a number of child sex offences after a trial, while the girls' mother had been convicted of neglect and given a suspended prison sentence. Mrs Justice Knowles said: ""Both girls experienced significant physical, sexual and emotional harm in the care of their parents. ""Both girls have recounted frightening, sadistic and violent experiences and both developed a variety of behaviours to manage their experiences. ""They were hyper-vigilant and remain so."" One of the girls had become an ""elective mute"" and the other ""developed a fixed smile"", the judge said. She added: ""Both girls have expressed great fear/terror of their father and both have required much reassurance that he remains in prison, does not know where they are, and would not come out of prison until they were adults."""
2018-03-11,"Perched just off the south-eastern corner of famous ""Silicon Roundabout"", at the heart of the UK's burgeoning tech start-up scene, you can find the headquarters of a company that is one of the standard-bearers of the UK's space industry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180311143634/https://news.sky.com/story/space-firm-in-transition-as-profits-fall-11282642,"Inmarsat, a FTSE-100 member as recently as two years ago, is a global leader in the field of satellite technology. Its 13 satellites enable thousands of ships to traverse the globe, airlines to provide wi-fi services to their passengers in the air, enables engineers in the oil and gas sector to do work remotely and also helps journalists broadcast from far-away locations. And it's also a major supplier to the US military. At the moment, though, it's fair to say that this is a business going through something of a transition. Full year results on Friday brought news of a 23% fall in pre-tax profits, to $229.8m (this UK company reports in US dollars as most of its trading income is in that currency), despite a 5% rise in annual revenues to $1.4bn. Worse still, so far as shareholders will be concerned, was news that the dividend in respect of the second half of the year has been cut by 60% to a level where it is ""expected to stay"" until cash flows recover. Shares of Inmarsat have fallen by almost 6% on this development which, the company is stressing, has to be seen in the context of it having returned $2.1bn to investors since its stock market flotation in 2005. There are two elements at play here. The first is that Inmarsat has decided it would be unwise to depend on future cash payments from Ligado Networks, a US satellite company that was previously called LightSquared, which uses some of its airwaves. These payments, worth $136m to Inmarsat, are due to ""pause"" at the end of the year before resuming in 2020 but questions remain over whether Ligado will receive a licence from US regulators allowing it to reinvent itself as a mobile network. That licence approval is critical to future payments to Inmarsat, which has pointed out that its contract with the company has already survived Ligado going through a previous bankruptcy process. The other factor is that Inmarsat wishes to conserve its cash while it continues to invest in future opportunities. During 2017, the company launched two new satellites, one of which went up in one of entrepreneur Elon Musk's Falcon 9 rockets. This pushed up Inmarsat's capital expenditure by 45%, to $598.7m, but it wants to carry on investing this year to boost its position, in particular, in the aviation sector. It believes providing in-flight connectivity (IFC) to airlines is going to be its main growth opportunity in coming years on the basis that, in order to compete more effectively, commercial airlines are going to have to offer this to passengers as a matter of course. Inmarsat said: ""The retail value for satellite operators and services providers delivering IFC connectivity services to the industry is predicted to grow from around $1bn in 2017 to $5.4bn by 2026. ""Fuirthermore, there is expected to be a ramp-up in the number of connected aircraft in operation in the future - from 6,000 in 2015 to over 20,000 by the middle of the next decade. ""Over 70% of these new aircraft are expected to be based in the relatively nascent IFC markets of Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. ""These regions will drive the majority of the future growth of the global air transport industry and are therefore key target areas for Inmarsat."" Companies asking shareholders to exchange returns today for jam tomorrow is nothing new. However, in this instance, it looks justified. Demand for aviation is going to grow strongly in coming years, particularly in emerging markets, while people are increasingly expecting to be connected everywhere. Connecting them while they are in the air therefore does look to be a great opportunity for this fascinating company - even if it means that, for those of us who prefer to travel in relative peace and quiet, things may get a bit noisier when we're in the air in future."

Mr Hancock said more needed to be done to safeguard young people and suggested an age-verification system. He said there would be a new legal requirement for companies to ensure users were over 13 years old. The details of how such a scheme would work are still being worked out. ""There is a genuine concern about the amount of screen time young people are clocking up and the negative impact it could have on their lives,"" he told the Times. ""For an adult I wouldn't want to restrict the amount of time you are on a platform but for different ages it might be right to have different time cut-offs."" Mr Hancock suggested varying cut-off times for different ages on services such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. The platforms already specify a minimum age of 13 but children only have to falsify a date of birth to gain access, despite critics claiming most sites are able to identify underage users from their browsing habits. Mr Hancock said it was ""not beyond the wit of man"" to develop an age-verification system for children. A 2017 survey by Ofcom found that 83% of 12-18-year-olds and 39% of 8-11-year-olds had their own smartphone, and that 23% of 8-11-year-olds had a social media profile compared with 74% in the older age group. It also found that social media use sometimes brought problems. One in eight 12-15-year-olds said social media brought pressure to look popular all the time, and 29% of those who went online said they had seen something they had found worrying or nasty. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) recently found that most school leaders it surveyed believed children's mental health had suffered as a result of social media in the past year. The Government has also announced it will introduce a new code of practice setting out minimum expectations on social media companies to try to make the UK ""the safest place in the world to be online""."

The protest was targeted at Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who promised to leave ""no stone unturned"" in securing Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release. The British-Iranian dual citizen, who will spend her second Mother's Day in an Iranian prison on Sunday, is serving a five-year sentence after being convicted of spying charges in 2016. She denies the charges and maintains she was in Iran to introduce her young daughter Gabriella to her parents. Speaking of efforts to secure her release, Mr Ratcliffe told Sky News: ""We've had lots of hopes that have been dashed, it's been lots of ups and downs. ""Anything could happen at this point, part of the point of being here today is to make that point that it's the second Mother's Day. ""We're going to read out that letter the letter that Nazanin wrote to Gabriella on the first Mother's Day. ""We're also making a point to the Foreign Secretary by painting the stones."" Mr Ratcliffe said there had been positive signs from Iranian authorities, but the family still did not know when they would be reunited. He told Sky News: ""We've been getting better messages from the Iranian side, from the judiciary and the prosecutor's office in Iran. ""This week the head of prison said, 'Oh yes, I've approved her release, I approved it a number of months ago'. So there's been clearly things to hold on to, hopefully. ""Part of the aspiration of today's message to the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is I would like to meet to ask what's the blockage? What's going on?"" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We will continue to approach each case in a way that we judge is most likely to secure the outcome we all want. ""Therefore we will not be providing a running commentary on every twist and turn."" Last month, campaigners claimed that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe only remains in jail because of a financial dispute between the British and Iranian governments. Sky News revealed last year that the UK Government was trying to find ways to release the ¬£450m sum owed for a cancelled arms deal in the 1970s.

The increases were also highlighted by the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) think tank in February, which found 93% of councils were planning to hike charges to balance their budgets. It comes as many households face an above-inflation council tax increase next month. The increases are likely to anger many drivers, with complaints that parking charges are being used unfairly to generate additional revenue. One 500-yard stretch of residential road in the borough of Lambeth in London generated more than ¬£900,000 in fines in 2010. According to the Mail, councils including Bournemouth, Brighton and Hove, Bristol City, Cheltenham, Dover, Flintshire, Leicester, Reading, and Thanet have quietly announced plans to raise charges. Cheltenham Council increased charges 45% on 1 March. Tory MP Sir Greg Knight told the Mail that the move could harm high street takings. ""The high street in many towns and cities is already under threat from internet shopping and higher parking charges could well have the effect of pushing more small town centre shops into liquidation."" Councils hit with big cuts to their central government funding are also considering increasing the cost of social and home care, waste management and planning applications."

He was initially seen and assessed within an hour and was asked to wait. After a blood test suggested possible heart problems he was made to wait again to be seen by senior staff. But he suffered a cardiac arrest and died at around 1am while still waiting. An email from Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust's medical director, Matthew Metcalfe, was leaked to the Health Service Journal. It said: ""Last night a patient died due entirely to the dangerous overcrowding of the department. ""The risk we have all been aware of, but may have felt hypothetical, has just happened."" A spokeswoman for the trust said the hospital's A&E unit had seen an average of 400 patients a day over the past few months, an increase of almost 30% on the same period last year. The trust said in a statement: ""This has inevitably had an impact on our ability to consistently provide a high standard of patient safety in our ED (Emergency Department). ""Although every effort is made to see, assess and treat patients quickly in our ED and (the hospital) has a good record in this regard. ""However, in this situation the long wait for further treatment and assessment led to an unacceptable outcome."" Mr Metcalfe added: ""We can confirm that we will be conducting a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of a patient who recently attended our emergency department. ""The impact of the pressure in our emergency department and the associated delays are not yet known and will be included within the scope of our investigation. ""We have expressed our sincere apologies to the family and will share our findings with them as soon as we can."" The hospital had said on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon that its accident and emergency department was ""currently under extreme pressure""."

But in recent days, the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal has seen parts of Salisbury taken over not only by police and soldiers, but by the world's media. In a sense life continues as normal. Many residents insist there's no reason to be anxious, but others feel frightened and say it's no wonder that the city centre is far quieter than usual. Cheryl Rose, who lives in Salisbury, told Sky News: ""For me it is not knowing what's going on really. There are a lot of security and police around so I'm slightly nervous walking about. We don't really know what is going on do we?"" Despite the police insisting that there is a low risk to public health, at the city's market some admitted they weren't sure whether to venture into town for fear that the area may still be contaminated. Various sites in Salisbury are still cordoned off, including the Zizzi restaurant, the Mill pub and an area around the Maltings shopping centre where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed. Along the cobbled streets are a mixture of police ""road closed"" signs and ""open for business"""" chalkboards. Shops in the vicinity say footfall is down as people either think they're shut or are frightened to venture towards the crime scene. Mr Skripal occasionally visited jewellery shop Crystals UK in the Maltings. Shop assistant Cara Tappenden said the incident had seriously affected business. She told Sky News: ""It's been very quiet around the Maltings. Lots of customers are calling up to see if we are even open. ""They are scared to come in and want to check if we are okay...sales and footfall has been down, but we are very much open."" Similarly, a few hundred yards up the road, stamp dealer Paul Dauwalder said: ""It has been a unique situation really and follows hot on the heels of the winter weather, which we have never had before. ""So there has been a bit of apprehension and this is so different to what people in Salisbury are used to. ""Some customers have admitted they are a bit apprehensive about coming into Salisbury...we continue online. It's the local business that is affected. People can't deal with it."" It has almost been a week since the former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned, exposed to a nerve agent. However, the mysterious details outlining what happened are still making headlines on many national and local newspaper front pages. Many of the scenes witnessed in Salisbury in recent days are reminiscent of those in a Hollywood movie, which makes them almost surreal. Nonetheless local MP John Glen has reassured his constituents and local businesses that a ""whole range of tools are at our disposal"" once it is established who was behind the poisoning of Mr Skripal. The police investigation continues, which means life is unlikely to return to normality in the cathedral city any time soon. Meanwhile, at the local hospital both Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a serious condition."

The victims were executive director Christine Loeber, 48, clinical director Jennifer Golick, 42, and Jennifer Gonzales, 29, a clinical psychologist. Wong had been a member of the Pathway Home - a facility that looks after military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It forms part of the Veterans Home of California-Yountville, which houses around 1,000 elderly and disabled veterans. California Highway Patrol assistant chief Chris Childs said the bodies had been found around 6pm, almost eight hours after the gunman slipped into a staff party. Mr Childs said: ""It's far too early to say if they (the victims) were chosen at random."" Larry Kamer said his wife had been at the party and phoned him to say the gunman had entered quietly before letting some leave and taking others hostage. Victim Jennifer Golick also called her husband to say she was being held - but nothing was heard from her after that, said her father-in-law. Police evacuated the building and closed off roads when the standoff began. An armoured police vehicle, ambulances and fire engines were rushed to the scene, located about 53 miles north of San Francisco. Wong exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy at around 10.30am but then went silent, despite repeated police attempts to contact him. In a statement, Pathway Home paid tribute to the victims: ""These brave women were accomplished professionals who dedicated their careers to serving our nation's veterans, working closely with those in the greatest need of attention after deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan."""

She suggested Theresa May, home secretary at the time of the inquiry, has failed to act over her husband's murder. Mr Litvinenko was a former Russian FSB agent who went on to work with MI6 after fleeing to the UK. His murder is suspected to have been personally signed off by Russia's President Putin. Russia has denied any involvement. Mrs Litvinenko said she was shocked at the recent poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The nerve agent attack has cast fresh suspicions on Moscow's activities in Britain. :: LIVE: Spy poisoning - Hundreds told to wash their possessions :: Fears and nervousness in city rocked by double agent attack Mrs Litvinenko revealed Mrs May wrote to her after the inquiry into her husband's murder concluded in 2016.

Mr Skripal, who had acted as a double agent for the UK's intelligence services, came to Britain after being released from a Russian prison under a spy swap in 2010. Asked whether the attack on Mr Skripal demonstrates Britain is unable to protect those offered political asylum, Mrs Litvinenko said: ""It looks like, after what happened to my husband, and you accepted people who might be targeted from a foreign country, it looks like you're not able, for now."" Mrs Litvinenko added her voice to those demanding a review of 14 other deaths on UK soil that have reportedly been identified by US intelligence sources as potentially connected to the Russian state. ""These cases were very quickly closed and I don't think proper investigation was provided,"" she said. ""I'm absolutely sure it must be done."" Mrs Litvinenko stressed Russia can't be blamed ""immediately"" for Mr Skripal and his daughter's poisoning, but highlighted how those currently ruling in Moscow play by ""different rules"". Russia has dismissed any claims it might be behind the poisoning as mere ""propaganda"". :: What is a nerve agent and how does it work? :: Who is Russian double agent Sergei Skripal? Mrs Litvinenko also called on the Conservative Party to return any donations from Russian-linked individuals or businesses if they cannot determine the origin of the cash. It comes after The Sunday Times revealed Russian oligarchs and their associates have registered donations of more than ¬£820,000 to the Tories since Mrs May became Prime Minister. ""Not every Russian person is a criminal, even if the person is rich,"" Mrs Litvinenko said. ""But you need to be very accurate where this money came from before you accept this money."" She added: ""If you identify it's dirty money [you're] just not allowed to accept it. ""Because I think reputation is very important. [The] reputation of the Conservative Party in UK and all around the world need to be clear."" A spokesman said: ""All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law."" Responding to Mrs Litvinenko's claim that the Government had failed to act adequately against Russia after her husband's murder, Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""The inquiry of course took some time. And it was some time after the events that we had the evidence from the inquiry. ""But we took the appropriate steps, we took measures which are still in place today. ""But, of course, the Russians have not complied with their international obligations despite being members of the [United Nations'] Security Council.

In the November Budget he announced plans to use the tax system to help deliver the Government's target of eliminating avoidable plastic waste by 2042, but next week Mr Hammond will also unveil a ¬£20m innovation fund for businesses and universities to develop new technologies to help achieve the goal. Mr Hammond said: ""Single-use plastics waste is a scourge to our environment. From crisp packets to coffee cups, each year the UK produces millions of tonnes of waste which is neither recyclable nor biodegradable. ""We are determined to create an environment that is fit for future generations. By working with industry, innovators and the public I am confident we can bring about real change."" It comes after the Government refused to give its backing to calls for a 25p ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups. The 25p charge was recommended by a cross-party committee of MPs, which said cash raised could pay for improved recycling facilities. But in its official response to the committee's report, the Government said only that a charge was ""something we could consider amongst other policy options"". The Government has also been accused of ""dragging its feet"" on introducing a deposit return scheme for plastic drinks bottles and kicking the plans ""into the long grass"". The House of Commons' Environmental Audit Committee claimed the Government had not ""adequately acted upon, or responded to"" its recommendations in combating the 15 million plastic bottles not recycled in the UK every day. The new plastic innovation fund announced on Tuesday is expected to be one of the few spending policies in the Spring Statement, which beyond consultations, is expected to be scarce on announcements. Instead Mr Hammond will focus on updating the economic forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Writing in The Sun on Sunday Mr Hammond said: ""Thanks to the hard work of the British people, we're now at a turning point. ""Over the last two quarters we have seen the first signs that productivity growth ‚Äì the key to higher wages ‚Äì may be increasing and this year we are forecast to see the beginning of the first sustained fall in debt for a generation. It has been a long road ‚Äì and there is still work to be done ‚Äì but I am confident that there is light at the end of the tunnel. ""This comes at a pivotal moment for Britain.

""I came downstairs and noticed one of my bikes, it was gone. That was in the front of the house,"" Peter told Sky News. ""Little did I know, the thieves were still in the house, they'd got in with a crowbar, they broke three windows and they stole my second bike too."" Mr Murtagh can't prove it, but thinks he might know why the thieves knew exactly where to look. He'd been using an app that logs cycling data, called Strava, to track his cycling speeds and compete against other users - but her didn't realise his settings were the default ones - which are ""public"". The setting meant that the start and end of his rides could easily be seen online. He'd also recorded the make and model of his top of the range time-trial bikes. ""I've been using Strava for four years,"" he says. ""I had‚Ä¶ the two bikes listed. So anybody could log on to Strava, search my name, and they'd be able to find my exact location. ""I suspect Strava played a role in targeting me, as my bike's always locked in my house. So it seems the criminals were just after the bikes, that's all they stole."" Mr Murtagh has now changed his privacy settings - and says social media isn't all bad - he managed to get his bikes back after posting about his loss on Facebook and Twitter. :: US military to review security amid Strava fitness app fears But his experience isn't uncommon. Adam Lang is a police officer in Gwent - he says the force noticed a spike in bicycle thefts in January and February. ""The common denominator was high-end bikes,"" Mr Lang tells Sky News. ""We needed to contact the victims and see if we could find if there was any connection between them. And through those enquiries we came up with the fact these mapping apps were being used, not by all, but there were quite a lot of them. ""Due to the fact they were all high-end bikes and they were clearly targeted, we feel these mapping apps could be used to target these high-end bikes. Because looking at the maps, you could clearly see where these people had started their rides and where they'd finished them."" Mr Lang says cyclists need to be more aware of the problem when using any kind of tracker app. ""I think social media, that's been well advertised that you should have your accounts locked down and regularly check your privacy settings,"" he says. ""I don't think a lot of people were aware that these mapping apps can basically give a huge amount of information to a would-be thief. So we need to have people checking their privacy."" But experts warn that even with privacy settings on cyclists should be careful since apps can still be hacked. Joel Windels, vice president of marketing at cyber security firm Wandera, showed us how thieves could use a feature - intended to help users by keeping home locations secret - to their advantage. When Strava's ""privacy zone"" is activated, it masks where you start and end your cycle ride or jog, so the line on the map vanishes. But Mr Windels says: ""The problem is that by taking the points at which your run disappears, you can actually triangulate your location. If you look at three different runs that someone has done using the Strava app, you'll actually be able to draw circles round them, and if you enlarge those circles, where they meet is where that person is trying to keep secret."" So what should cyclists do? Mr Windels says: ""My suggestion would be to randomise your own privacy zone. So when you leave the house for your next cycle, perhaps turn it on 100 metres away from your home."" When Sky contacted Strava, it told us it hasn't seen any verified cases of bicycle theft related to its platform. And it's reviewing its app to make sure some features can't be used by those with bad intentions. Meanwhile, though, bike campaign groups say it's up to cyclists themselves to check their settings on any ride-tracking apps they use, and be careful about what they post online in general. Louise Gold, head of Behaviour Change at SusTrans, says ""Like with any social media, you need to be careful about where your information is going. So don't publish pictures of your flashy new bike to Facebook or Instagram. If you really, really must, then ensure your settings are private."""

He told the party congress: ""Let them call you racist. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honour."" Mr Bannon was speaking in Lille as part of a Europe-wide tour. The appearance comes after Ms Le Pen's crushing defeat to independent, pro-globalisation candidate Emmanuel Macron in last year's presidential race. His remarks may have threatened the Front National's efforts to re-brand itself, with Mr Bannon also endorsing Ms Le Pen's more hard-line niece - Marion Marechal-Le Pen. ""You're part of a worldwide movement bigger than France, bigger than Italy,"" added Mr Bannon, who denounced central banks, central governments and ""crony capitalists"". His European visit had centred on last weekend's election in Italy, which he called ""an earthquake"" after populist and anti-immigration parties outperformed traditional parties. ""History is on our side,"" said the former Breitbart News chairman, who hailed Ms Le Pen's politics as no longer about left and right but nationalists and globalists. He said he was travelling in order to learn after giving his first speech in Zurich earlier in the week. His tour comes after he was dumped by the White House last year and contributed to Michael Wolff's controversial Trump book, Fire And Fury. Ms Le Pen defended inviting the former White House aide and said it was important to hear from the man who was ""the architect of Donald Trump's victory"". She said he had written about globalisation, protectionism and giving regular people power ""practically illegally captured by the elite"".

The sanctions targeted Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors, which are managed by the powerful elite around President Putin. :: Imposing 'The Magnitsky Act' The Government has introduced measures in the Criminal Finances Act, inspired by America's Magnitsky Act, to allow the assets of international human rights violators to be frozen. The US law was named after whistle-blowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow detention centre in 2009 after attempting to reveal a massive tax fraud against his British-based investment firm and the Russian state. The 37-year-old father-of-two was held for almost a year without trial and denied medical treatment. Home Secretary Amber Rudd indicated that the Salisbury incident may prompt further action. ""The Sanctions Bill is at the moment before the committee and I know there are people who are talking about wanting to put down amendments at report stage,"" she said. ""Of course what we have seen happening in the past few days may bring this more to the front."" :: Ending diplomatic ties Former Tory minister Nick Bold has urged Britain to break off diplomatic ties with Russia in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning. He said: ""I do not see how we can maintain diplomatic relations with a country that tries to murder people on British soil and puts the lives of British citizens at risk. ""It's time for us to turn tough talk into action."""

But she refused until she knew more about the nature of the allegations. On Sunday evening, the Labour Party released a statement, saying: ""Debbie Abrahams has stood aside from her role while the Labour Party investigates an employment issue."" Sky News understands the allegation relates to bullying. But Ms Abrahams hit back with her own complaints. She told Sky News: ""I refute the allegations that have been made against me in the strongest possible terms.""I will fight this spurious claim and do not rule out taking legal action.""She added: ""I have had no details about the complaint, who it is from, the process or timescales. I have not agreed to stand aside.""My treatment by certain individuals in the Leader's Office over the last 10 months has been aggressive, intimidating and wholly unprofessional. ""My treatment in the last week has shown a bullying culture of the worst kind. As such I am making a formal complaint to both the Labour Party and Parliamentary Authorities."" Some Labour MPs have privately expressed their support for Ms Abrahams, with one saying: ""They've been looking to get rid of her for ages but they couldn't find any ammo. Then this mysterious complaint turned up."" Margaret Greenwood will act as shadow secretary of state for work and pensions during the internal investigation, which will be dealt with through the employee internal grievance process. Ms Abrahams, who first entered Parliament in 2010, was made shadow minister for the disabled by Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. She was promoted to the shadow cabinet after last year's general election."

Carragher, who said his behaviour ""cannot be condoned"", personally called the family on Sunday to apologise and said his ""biggest regret was that a young girl was caught up in the middle of the altercation"". When shown the mobile phone footage, which was shot following Liverpool's defeat to Manchester United on Saturday, he said it ""felt like an out of body experience - a moment of madness for four or five seconds"". The football analyst, who has a daughter the same age as the girl who was caught up in the incident, says that he thinks ""a young girl would feel worse"" in such a situation and said he ""would find it hard to know what he would say or how he would react"" if such a thing had happened to his own daughter. Admitting ""what I've done is disgusting"", he said ""if someone had done what I had done on the pitch I would vilify them"". In the video, which was filmed after Carragher's former club lost 2-1 at Old Trafford and obtained by the Daily Mirror, the 40-year-old pundit can be seen driving his black SUV as a Manchester United fan spots him and beeps his horn. The car driver says: ""There's Jamie's Carragher there, look,"" before shouting ""2-1, 2-1, unlucky Jamie lad, 2-1 lad."" At that point Carragher, who has wound down his window, spits towards the car. The 14-year-old daughter of the Manchester United fan, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, can be heard saying she was hit in the face by the spit. When asked on Sky News if he felt he deserved his privileged position as the face of football, he said he did not believe the incident ""represented the real me"", saying: ""I have brought shame on the name of football. I was a role model, people looked to me."" He went on: ""I've made mistakes in my 25 year career, but this is the worst one."" When he was asked what his children thought of his behaviour, Carragher became visibly upset, welling up with tears. He went on to say: ""Hopefully I can get the chance to meet face-to-face with the family, and apologise to them again."" A statement from Sky Sports said: ""Sky takes this matter extremely seriously and strongly condemns Jamie's actions, we have made that clear to him in person today and suspended him from his duties. It falls well below the standards we expect of our people."" Acknowledging the impact of his actions, Callagher said: ""The world that we live in now, with social media, a lot of people will have seen this clip. It's the lowest of the low, and I'll never do it again."" Former Wimbledon player Vinnie Jones commented on the incident saying: ""Spitting at 14-year-olds through a window? He is presenting on the TV. For Christ's sake, he is supposed to be one of the top men. You can't condone that whatsoever. It is filth, it is absolute filth."" I‚Äôve known Jamie Carragher for 30 years and I can tell you now that incident is completely out of character for him,fair play for phoning the guy and his daughter up and apologising,he‚Äôs only human at the end of day and the frustration has got the better of him. Former Liverpool footballer David Thompson defended Carragher on Twitter, writing: ""I've known Jamie Carragher for 30 years and I can tell you now that incident is completely out of character for him, fair play for phoning the guy and his daughter up and apologising, he's only human at the end of day and the frustration has got the better of him."" Former Manchester City footballer Joey Barton called the act ""absolute madness"". He wrote: ""You just can't do that in any fashion. If Jamie is that annoyed he should just keep his window up, or just tell him to mind his own business."""
2018-03-12,A British shale gas company owned by Barclays is sounding out rivals about pumping cash into the business as it delays fracking at a controversial site in Yorkshire until later in the year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/barclays-backed-fracker-third-energy-courts-rivals-for-cash-11287180,"Sky News has learnt that Third Energy, which is awaiting the outcome of a review ordered by the Government into its financial strength, has in recent weeks approached a number of other industry players about a potential deal. The development underlines Third Energy's need for new investment as Barclays, which effectively outsourced the management of its shareholding in 2015, declines to inject more capital into the company. The British bank has previously indicated that it will sell its stake in the business, although such a deal is unlikely until after the results of fracking at its Kirby Misperton site are clear. Sources said on Monday that several other specialists in the hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - sector had been asked by Lazard, the investment bank, to consider offers to invest in Third Energy. An outright takeover of the business or merger is also thought to be being suggested as an alternative option by Lazard to prospective investors. Reports last year suggested that Third Energy would examine a ¬£500m stock market listing, although this is now considered by industry bankers to be off the agenda. Like Cuadrilla and Igas Energy, Third Energy hopes to cash in on an increasingly permissive political climate towards fracking on the UK mainland. In the Conservative Party's general election manifesto last year, Theresa May pledged to support the development of the UK's shale gas sector. However, protests over its presence at the Yorkshire site that it believes contains significant gas reserves have clouded Third Energy's progress. It has also faced questions over repeated delays to the filing of its accounts, prompting Greg Clark, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, to seek guarantees of its financial resilience. Barclays is the majority shareholder in Third Energy, with the investment managed for it by Global Natural Resources Investments, a former subsidiary of the bank. Third Energy's chairman is Keith Cochrane, who was the interim chief executive of Carillion for six months before it collapsed into liquidation in January. Its other board members include Lord Gadhia, a Conservative peer. The company recently said it would release some of the equipment required at Kirby Misperton until the outcome of the resilience test was clear. It added that it was ""committed to working with our local community and have taken guidance from Flamingo Land, local farmers and the North Yorkshire Police that it would be helpful for the local community and economy to avoid operations during the school holidays and harvest season"". Mr Clark also indicated that Third Energy had met the technical requirements necessary to enable it to frack at the site. In a statement issued to Sky News, a spokeswoman for Third Energy said: ""Third Energy has all the necessary funding in place for its current operations, both onshore and offshore. ""As is normal in natural resources, including oil and gas, when moving into the development stage companies look at different options for funding known developments, future exploration and also further opportunities."""
2018-03-12,King's Cross in London has been closed amid a pro-Kurdish demonstration at the station.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/protest-on-tracks-halts-train-services-at-manchester-piccadilly-station-11286043,"The demonstration in London comes hours after a similar protest forced the closure of Manchester Piccadilly railway station. According to National Rail, there is only one exit currently functioning at King's Cross as police address ""an incident"" outside. Social media users posting pictures from among the crowd are stating that the demonstration is in support of Afrin, which Kurds have claimed is being ""ethnically cleansed"" by the Turkish military. Virgin Trains said on Twitter that it was in the process of contacting trains which were already on the move, and asked passengers to listen out to announcements from their on-board rain managers. At the time of Manchester Picadilly's closure, BTP's Superintendent Mark Cleland said: ""While we appreciate and respect the right to peaceful protest, when this compromises the safety of the public and the protesters themselves, any offenders will attract the full investigative resources of BTP. ""Those involved in this afternoon's incident will be subject to intense investigation with a view to arrest and prosecution.

Images on social media showed protesters sitting on train tracks with yellow banners in support of the YPG (People's Protection Units), a Kurdish militia group. Some read: ""Stop Turkey from helping ISIS terrorists"". The demonstration follows several months of conflict between Kurdish groups and Turkish forces in Afrin, northern Syria. Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group, although it is not a proscribed organisation. The government in Ankara has accused the YPG of supporting another armed Kurdish organisation, the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party), which is considered a terrorist group by NATO. Red flags displaying the emblem of the proscribed PKK are also visible in images of the Manchester Piccadilly protest posted to social media. More follows..."
2018-03-12,"Five years ago a team of retail experts published a report for Westminster about the future of Britain's high streets.¬†Now, they say, is the right time to do it again.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/how-vinyl-is-helping-revive-the-high-street-11286791,"For years out of town retail parks and online shopping have accelerated the demise of the British high street. And although the rate of decline is slowing, it's not stopping. Bill Grimsey, former CEO of Wickes, Iceland and Booker, is the lead author of the report. He says the troubles faced by outlets like Thomas Cook, Maplin, New Look and Toys R Us, along with business rate changes and Brexit, make this the perfect time to see which recommendations in his previous report were implemented, and which worked. ""It is time to get this subject back on everyone's agenda,"" he says. ""Otherwise we will continue to sleepwalk into the remainder of the 21st Century, leaving a legacy of ill-thought-out town centres and high streets to the next generation."" ""Change is rapid and change is constant. This all-encompassing second review, written by independent experts, will act as an independent source of evidence and advice as to how the change should be managed."" At a time when Mary ""Queen of Shops"" Portas was asked by the Government to conduct a review of the high street, the Grimsey report was compiled to offer an alternative review, which sought to broaden the subject beyond shops. It identified a need to embrace technology and reinvent the high street as a community hub with a combination of goods and services. Some councils have begun to do just that. For example, Kirklees Council in West Yorkshire implemented an initiative to bring more town centre buildings in Huddersfield into residential use. Within two years 2,000 people had moved into the centre. The theory is that the demand for goods created by the influx will support the remaining shops. The report also highlighted a need for entertainment and other services to replace pure retail. And one retailer in Huddersfield has put that into practice. Tony Boothroyd was selling records and cds on the internet two years before Google was even invented. He was a genuine pioneer of online selling, but now he's back on the high street. He believes his Vinyl Tap store acts as a shop window to his online portal, and a series of special promotions helps generate recognition through social media. Vinyl Tap has brought in over 150 bands for free gigs, hosts record launches, and has teamed up with local breweries and eateries to put on other promotional events. ""If you do have a shop you have to be open minded and try different things,"" he says. ""The live bands, cinema evenings and so on encourage people to come in, and once they've been in they'll check out the website, and hopefully keep coming back. It's a bigger picture. It's not just a shop."" Retailers like Tony, and anyone else with interests relating to the high street, are being invited by the Grimsey report authors to submit feedback and evidence for the study. The report, ""Grimsey Review 2"", will be published on 4 July."
2018-03-12,A teenager has been jailed for 10-and-a-half years for attacking moped riders with acid to steal their vehicles.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/despicable-teenager-jailed-for-acid-attacks-on-moped-riders-11287135,"Derryck John targeted six motorists in a spate of attacks in north and east London on the evening of 13 July 2017 - all in less than 90 minutes. The 17-year-old sprayed his victims in the face with a noxious liquid, leaving one man with a 30% loss of sight in one eye. Others described searing pain and burning at the time and have been forced to leave their jobs as a result of their injuries. ""Had they not been wearing helmets, all of the victims' injuries could have been much more serious,"" Ramesh Patel of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. John stole two mopeds and tried to take another four from their owners before he was arrested hours after the attacks. Sentencing John at Wood Green Crown Court, Judge Noel Lucas QC told him his actions were ""despicable and cowardly"" and had had a ""life-changing"" and ""defining"" impact on his victims. He said: ""You and your accomplice chose to attack members of the public who were going about their lawful business. ""These were grave crimes. You attacked members of the public with what appears to have been an acid at the strongest end of the scale of acids. ""You have not revealed the name of your accomplice or the precise nature of the corrosive fluid used or where you and your accomplice obtained it."" The teenager from Thornton Heath, Croydon, pleaded guilty earlier this year to 12 offences. He admitted six counts of throwing a corrosive substance with intent to disable, maim, disfigure or do grievous bodily harm. He also pleaded guilty to four counts of attempted robbery of a moped and two counts of robbery of a moped. Judge Lucas said there was an ""overwhelming, huge public interest"" in naming the teenager after he entered his pleas. He also told John that had he been sentencing him as an adult and had he been convicted after a trial, he would have been jailed for 22 years. During Monday's hearing, the judge also commented on the prevalence of acid attacks. ""I can state from my own knowledge of the offences arriving at this Crown Court that such offences have risen sharply in the last 12 months. ""This is the second major corrosive fluid case I have had to deal with in the past three months. ""It is clear to me that the carrying and use of corrosive liquids is rapidly becoming a serious and growing problem in London and in particular, in this part of London. ""So too are crimes committed using scooters."""
2018-03-12,Prime Minister Theresa May is believed to be close to publicly blaming Russia for the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-close-to-blaming-russia-for-spy-poisoning-11286813,"The former Russian spy, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench in the cathedral city eight days ago, suffering the effects of nerve agent. They are still in a critical condition. Nick Bailey, a police officer who was among the first on the scene, was also affected but is said to be in a stable condition, conscious and talking. :: What is a nerve agent and how does it work? The Times newspaper reported that senior government sources have said police and security services have established enough evidence to link Moscow to the attempted killings. Mrs May is chairing a meeting of the National Security Council later, which will include senior ministers, intelligence and military chiefs. An announcement could come after that, along with possible repercussions, which could include expelling Russian diplomats and spies and new financial sanctions. :: Is spy 'poisoning' Russia vendetta or rogue mission? But some say Russia is unlikely to be behind the attempted murders. Nikolai Tsiplakov told The Associated Press that he had lived in the same building as Mr Skripal's family in Moscow before the retired military intelligence officer was jailed for spying for Britain. Mr Tsiplakov said there was no proof of Russian involvement and added: ""You need to understand, he's a former spy and he's a traitor. ""If they wanted him dead, they would have killed him in Russia a long time ago."" Mr Skripal was released from a Russian jail in 2010 and brought to Britain as part of a spy swap. :: Who is Russian double agent Sergei Skripal? The news comes after hundreds of people were told to wash their clothes and other items in case they had also come into contact with the nerve agent, which has not yet been publicly identified. The advice was given after traces of the substance were found at The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant, with up to 500 people thought to have been in the venues between Sunday lunchtime and Monday night. People were told to machine wash clothing worn on the day, and double-bag items which would normally be dry cleaned to await further advice. :: Sky Views: Putin resorts to 'last refuge of a scoundrel' Officials insisted that the risk to the public was still low, however. Also, Jamie Knight, 30, from Salisbury, will appear before magistrates in Swindon on Monday accused of breaching one of the cordons on Friday evening."

An investigation by the Sunday Mirror gathered allegations of abuse in the Shropshire town. It is said to include cases involving girls as young as 11 who were drugged, beaten and raped. They are reported to date back to the 1980s. Many of the perpetrators are believed to have gone unpunished, with cases being mishandled by authorities. It is claimed similar abuse is continuing in the area. Three murders and two deaths could also be linked to the scandal, the newspaper reported. :: Facebook criticised for 'irresponsible' survey on child grooming rules Sixteen-year-old Lucy Lowe became pregnant aged 14. She died alongside her mother and sister after the baby's father set fire to her house. He was jailed for murder, but not sex crimes. Seven men were jailed in 2013 following Operation Chalice, a police inquiry into child prostitution in the Telford area. The paper says authorities were warned of the abuse a decade before Operation Chalice. Telford's Conservative MP, Lucy Allan, has previously called for a Rotherham-style inquiry into the allegations and called the latest reports ""extremely serious and shocking"". ""There must now be an independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Telford so that our community can have absolute confidence in the authorities,"" she told the paper. The number of victims was calculated with the help of Professor Liz Kelly, from the Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit at London Metropolitan University. Dino Nocivelli, a specialist child abuse solicitor, told the Sunday Mirror: ""These children were treated as sexual commodities by men who inflicted despicable acts of abuse. The survivors deserve an inquiry. ""They need to know how abuse took place for so long and why so many perpetrators have never been brought to justice."" A spokesperson for Telford and Wrekin Council said: ""Child sexual exploitation (CSE) is a vile, evil crime. It's an issue right across the UK and has been for a long time. ""Telford will be covered by the national CSE review. We welcome this. All agencies continue to work very closely together and this remains our top priority."""

However, local scone lovers were quick to point out that the advert - which promised ""sconelets with Cornish clotted cream and strawberry jam"" - depicted a Devon cream tea rather than a Cornish cream tea. In Cornwall, the tradition is to spread jam first followed by the cream, while in Devon, cream is added to the scone before the jam.

The report said that the prosecutor had ""referred to a six-year prison sentence for an agent of England's intelligence service"". It also quoted him as saying the same British-Iranian citizen was under investigation in a separate case related to a private bank. The person jailed was not identified and there is no known case of a British-Iranian national being jailed for six years. The Foreign Office said only that it was ""currently investigating the reported sentencing"". It comes almost two years after Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman, was arrested. She was accused of planning the ""soft toppling"" of Iran's government while travelling with her young daughter, and her husband Richard has been campaigning for her release ever since. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe served a third of her sentence by January 2018, making her eligible for release. She remains in Iranian custody, however. Kamal Foroughi, a 78-year-old British-Iranian businessman, was arrested seven years ago and convicted of espionage and possessing alcohol charges. His family has denied the charges on his behalf.

Asked about the mixed reaction to the adaptation, Corden said: ""I sort of felt some reticence about doing it when I got offered it simply because of what it means to so many people in this country and across the world. ""But then when the Beatrix Potter estate (gave permission), who have turned down I think maybe over 20 proposals, even Walt Disney at one point wanted to make a Peter Rabbit film and they felt it didn't capture the essence of the character and this script did."" The film marks the first time the Potter estate has given permission to adapt the story for the big screen and some have said the author, who died in 1943, would not have been impressed by the result. Critic Matthew Dennison, who wrote a Beatrix Potter biography in 2016, told The Guardian: ""Peter Rabbit emerges as a bully, and there really isn't any evidence for that in the story."" Speaking at the London premiere of Peter Rabbit, Corden said the live action film was a faithful adaptation of Potter's work. ""What I love most about what Will (Gluck, the writer and director) has done and I think the Beatrix Potter estate responded to is there is so many small vignettes across the film that he has taken from all of those books,"" he said. ""At its core, at its actual core, what the film is about, aside from all the big comic set pieces and the brilliant soundtrack and the animation is wonderful, what the film is actually about is acceptance. ""It's about going 'people will look different to you and sound different to you and be different to you and actually if you accept your differences you will find lots of similarities'. ""What people do is go 'I'm going to put up a wall and this is mine and that is yours and you don't come in here' and actually what you should do is open your arms and go 'well I don't look like you or understand you but perhaps we can find some common ground'. ""That is what the film is actually about, so anyone who is being what I would consider snobby about such an experience, I can't find anything that can be anything other than positive in such a message for young children."" Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley, who voices Cottontail, also said she believed Potter would have been pleased with the film. She said: ""I think Beatrix Potter would first be gobsmacked that it had become the success it has and the fact that they (the estate) believed in this script says a lot, because obviously her family knew her. ""I think she would be thrilled, I think it shows all of the character that we know and love in a different sort of setting and there are bits that the original books are animated within and it's beautiful."" Peter Rabbit hits UK cinemas on Friday."

Ministers say they need to ""revolutionise"" the way people get older, ensuring they remain healthy and independent for longer. Although today there are just 15,000 centenarians, the population aged 90 and over has grown more rapidly than other age groups in recent years - with one in six Britons now expected to reach triple figures. A ¬£210m fund will be set up to encourage the development of innovative new diagnostic tools, medical products and treatments, as part of plans set out by Business Secretary Greg Clark. A number of regional centres across the UK will be set up with the aim of using technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve patient diagnosis. Money will also be used to invest in genome sequencing. The genomes of 500 ""Biobank"" volunteers will help develop tools for early diagnosis of illness and disease and a new wave of therapies. A further ¬£98m will be invested in a healthy ageing programme to help people to live in their homes for longer, rather than having to go into care homes or assisted living facilities.

Yvette Short, from Edinburgh, clutched her Best In Show whippet, called Tease, as security guards subdued the protester at the NEC in Birmingham. The intruder was carrying a banner bearing the logo of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). The crowd booed before breaking into applause as he was taken away. A Crufts spokesman said: ""It appears that protesters from PETA gained unauthorised access to the ring in the main arena at Crufts, and in doing so scared the dogs and put the safety of both dogs and people at risk in a hugely irresponsible way. ""Our main priority at the moment is the wellbeing of the dogs that were in the ring, who are looked after by their owners and show officials. ""The NEC Group have extensive security procedures in place at Crufts and we, along with the NEC Group, will be reviewing what happened as a matter of urgency."" PETA UK later posted a clip of the incident on Twitter and claimed activists were protesting against extreme breeding and carrying banners which said ""Crufts: Canine Eugenics"". It said there were two intruders and named them as members of the Vegan Strike Group, an organisation which claims to fight against animal abuse."
2018-03-12,"The Secretary General of the Commonwealth has described next month's Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) as a ""wonderful opportunity"" for leaders to ""talk about anything they wish to"", following reports they may discuss the delicate subject of who will succeed the Queen as their head.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/will-queens-successor-be-on-agenda-at-next-commonwealth-meeting-11286720,"In a sign of the sensitivities surrounding who will become Head of the Commonwealth when the Queen dies, Baroness Patricia Scotland did not deny that the leaders may talk about it when they next meet on 16 April. But speaking to Sky News on Commonwealth Day, Baroness Scotland said: ""That is certainly not a matter for me, it's a matter for the leaders. The leaders will have a wonderful opportunity to be alone together at the retreat and they will talk about anything they wish to but it's definitely not a matter for me."" The Queen's support and promotion of the Commonwealth is seen by many as one of her greatest achievements. Princess Elizabeth took over as head of the organisation in 1952 when her father King George VI died and she became Queen, but Prince Charles will not automatically inherit the title when he becomes king. Asked if she could elaborate on the process for selecting a future Head of the Commonwealth, Baroness Scotland said ""no, no, no, I can't"", before adding: ""I as Secretary General of the Commonwealth am the servant of 53 countries, and the 53 leaders decide what the mandate is going to be and then give it to the Secretary General."" The Commonwealth represents a global population of almost 2.4 billion people. All the leaders of the member countries are expected to attend CHOGM in London next month. Under the theme ""Towards a Common Future"" they will talk about a range of global challenges with a focus on issues such as sustainability, security threats, business, protecting the marine environment and young people. Reflecting on the current political climate and the importance of the meeting, Baroness Scotland said: ""This is a troubling, troubling time, and it is a time when we really need our friends. We need people of goodwill to put their heads together and say what are we actually going to do... how are we going to ensure we have a safer, more prosperous, basically a kinder world?"" Later today, the Queen and members of the Royal Family will attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. In her Commonwealth Day message released ahead of the event, Her Majesty praised the diversity of the global institution, saying: ""We all have reason to give thanks for the numerous ways in which our lives are enriched when we learn from others. ""Through exchanging ideas, and seeing life from other perspectives, we grow in understanding and work more collaboratively towards a common future. ""There is a very special value in the insights we gain through the Commonwealth connection; shared inheritances help us overcome difference so that diversity is a cause for celebration rather than division."" The Queen will be joined by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke of York, the Princess Royal, the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess of Gloucester and Princess Alexandra. Prince Philip will not attend the event after announcing his retirement from public life last year. The service will be the first time Ms Markle takes part in an official family engagement in the presence of the Queen."

According to reports, 67 passengers and four crew members were on board the plane, which is believed to have taken off from Dhaka in Bangladesh. Those on board included 33 Nepali passengers, 32 from Bangladesh, one from China and another from the Maldives. A survivor, Basanta Bohora, told the Kathmandu Post: ""All of a sudden the plane shook violently and there was a loud bang. ""I was seated near a window and was able to break out of the window."" People posted photos of thick smoke rising from the wreckage on social media. Hundreds of people stood by a nearby hill as rescue workers attended the scene. Amanda Summers saw the crash from the terrace of her home. She said: ""It was flying so low I thought it was going to run into the mountains."" Ms Summers said it was unclear if the plane had reached the runway when it landed. She added: ""All of a sudden there was a blast and then another blast."" The Bangladeshi airline operates a Boeing 737-800 and smaller Bombardier Dash Q-400 planes. Nepal has suffered a number of air disasters in recent years, and the country's poor safety record has been blamed on inadequate plane maintenance and inexperienced pilots. In early 2016, a Twin Otter turboprop aircraft crashed into a mountainside in Nepal - killing all 23 people on board."

Moments before the crash, the pilot radioed for help saying the engine had failed, according to local press.""Mayday, mayday, mayday,"" the pilot said, according to news accounts. ""Engine failure. We've got an engine failure over the East River."" It went down near Gracie Mansion, the residence of New York's mayor, near the northern end of Roosevelt Island, at about 7pm local time. Two passengers were declared dead at the scene and three others later died in hospital, according to the Fire Department. The sixth person - the pilot - freed himself and was able to stay afloat using a flotation device. He was rescued by a passing tugboat, according to police. The pilot was taken to hospital but is in a good condition. Witnesses had described seeing one person emerge from the helicopter before waving their hands and shouting for help. Daniel Nigro, Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department, said the helicopter had been upside down and ""completely submerged"" in 50ft of extremely cold water. The passengers had been tightly harnessed and the harnesses had to be cut to free them, he said. ""The divers worked very quickly, as fast as they could. ""Everyone worked very hard."" Emergency services had to battle currents of 5mph and a water temperature below 40 degrees, he said. Xinran Jiang, who lives on Roosevelt Island with her husband, said they saw a red helicopter rapidly descending near the north end of the island at about 7.08pm. She told the New York Times that the helicopter showed no obvious signs of trouble before going into the river. ""It almost looked like it was landing,"" Ms Jiang said. ""It wasn't moving fast. ""Then the next minute, it was diving into the river."" Brianna Jesme, 22, an Upper East Side resident who witnessed the crash, told Reuters TV: ""It kind of hit sideways and just flipped over."" ""It's cold water. It was sinking really fast,"" Mary Lee, 66, told the New York Post. ""By the time we got out here, we couldn't see it. It was underwater."" The helicopter has been recovered and towed to a nearby pier. Liberty Helicopters has suffered a number of crashes, including two incidents within the last 11 years. In August 2009, nine people were killed when the Liberty-operated Eurocopter AS350 collided mid-air with a small, private plane over New York's Hudson River. The helicopter, carrying tourists, was found to be flying too high. It was the same model as the helicopter involved in the latest crash. In July 2007, a Liberty sightseeing helicopter carrying eight people made an emergency landing in the Hudson. An off-duty paramedic who was on board helped the passengers and pilot escape. On New Year's Eve in 1997, a Liberty tour helicopter crashed into the side of a building at the West 30th Street heliport. The eight people on board sustained minor injuries. The company has been conducting sightseeing tours of the city since September 1990, according to The New York Times."
2018-03-12,The amount of salt and sugar in popular McDonald's products has rocketed in the last 30 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/shocking-rise-in-sugar-and-salt-in-mcdonalds-burgers-in-last-30-years-11287119,"A leaflet distributed by the chain in 1989 reveals how customers now consume more than double the amount of salt and almost four times the amount of sugar in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese. The burgers had 2.6 grammes of sugar per serving in 1989, but that figure has now risen to 10 grammes per serving. McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain, with more than 34,000 branches worldwide and 1.8 million employees. Health specialists have voiced their concerns about the chain, which boasts 1,200 restaurants around the UK. Professor Graham MacGregor, chair of Action on Sugar, said: ""These figures truly are shocking. ""At a time when both food manufacturers and the food service industry should be making strides to reformulate and reduce the amount of foods high in sugar, salt, saturated fat and calories, McDonald's is clearly lagging behind. ""With PHE's (Public Health England) plans to reformulate and cut excess calories consumption, this reinforces why it is imperative that the 20% calorie reduction targets are properly enforced and transparent."" The 1989 leaflet, uncovered by The Sun newspaper, shows how the content of the restaurant's menu has changed over the last three decades. A cheeseburger has gone from having 0.4 grammes of salt and two grammes of sugar, to now containing 1.2 grammes of salt and 6.6 grammes of sugar. The number of calories in a large portion of fries is up from 335 kilocalories to 444 kilocalories, while a strawberry milkshake has 57 grammes of sugar in it now, compared to 48 grammes in 1989. A Big Mac has three times the amount of sugar and more than double the amount of salt. But there is some good news for fans of the chain, with the number of kilocalories in Chicken McNuggets falling from 276 to 270 and the amount of fat also reducing slightly from 16.4 grammes to 16 over the same period. It is not known whether the size of portions has changed since 1989. In the UK, it is estimated McDonald's serves three million customers every day. A spokesperson for McDonald's said: ""We've worked hard to improve our recipes and to reduce fat, salt and sugar across our entire menu, without compromising on the taste that our customers love. ""Since 2005, we've reduced the salt content across our entire menu by nearly 35%, the trans-fat content of our cooking oil by 94% and saturated fat by 83%, and almost 90% of our standard food and drink items now contain fewer than 500 calories. ""For more than 30 years we have provided clear nutritional information, at point of sale and on tray liners, to help our customers make informed choices, and our menu has evolved over the years so it provides more choice than ever from salads, to wraps, to coffee, to fruit bags. ""Our support for Public Health England's One You campaign, to provide meal options of 400 and 600 calories, is an extension of this, and part of our ongoing commitment to continue to work in partnership, to help people confidently make informed choices about what they eat at McDonald's."""
2018-03-12,"Sir Ken Dodd - master of tickling sticks, Diddy Men and tattifilarious comedy - has died, his publicist has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/comedian-sir-ken-dodd-has-died-11286788,"The comedian passed away just days after leaving hospital and marrying his partner of 40 years, Anne Jones. He was 90. His publicist Robert Holmes described him as ""one of the last music hall greats"". ""With Ken gone, the lights have been turned out in the world of variety. He was a comedy legend and genius,"" he said. :: Vote: Which Ken Dodd one-liner is funniest? Mr Holmes added: ""He asked Anne if she wanted to marry. They got the registrar and were married in the house on Friday. ""He died two days later on Mother's Day. Anne is obviously very upset. They had been together for 40 years. It's a love story to beat them all."" Sir Ken passed away in the same house in Liverpool that he grew up in. He continued to perform right through to his later years, bringing the energy and stamina of a man half his age to his manic routines. :: LIVE: Tributes to Ken Dodd - 'master of tickling sticks' Even when he was taken to hospital for a ""minor operation"" on New Year's Eve in 2007, it came just hours after completing a four-hour sell-out gig at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall. But behind the hair, teeth and offbeat humour dwelt a mass of contradictions and insecurities. His carefully guarded private life received an unwelcome airing in 1989 when he endured a five-week trial accused of tax fraud. The trial transformed Liverpool Crown Court into a sell-out theatre, with fellow comics Eric Sykes and Roy Hudd called as character witnesses. Having clocked up 35 years in showbusiness, Dodd told the court: ""Since I am stripped naked in this court, I might as well tell you the lot."" He said: ""I am not mean, but I am nervous of money, nervous of having it, nervous of not having it,"" and described money as a yardstick of success - ""important only because I have nothing else"". His counsel described him as a fantasist stamped with lifelong eccentricities - such as keeping love letters in a safety deposit box and hoarding ¬£336,000 in the attic - due to a close-knit family upbringing. The entertainer was acquitted following a brilliant defence by George Carman QC. He would later joke publicly about the case. Sir Ken left school at 14 and worked with his brother Bill, heaving Arley cobbles and Houlton kitchen nuts for six years as part of his father's business. But in his spare time, the former choirboy was singing and developing a stand-up comic routine at working men's clubs. He would describe himself as ""Professor Yaffle Chuckabutty. Operatic Tenor and Sausage Knotter"". The Theatre Royal, Nottingham, saw his debut in 1954 as Professor Chuckabutty, and within two years he was topping the bill at Blackpool, with bits such as the famous Diddy Men, the Broken Biscuit Repair Works, the Jam Butty Mines, the Moggy Ranch and the Treacle Wells. This was followed by numerous BBC series, including The Ken Dodd Show and Ken Dodd's Laughter Show, and he entered the big time in 1965 with the longest-ever run at the London Palladium (42 weeks). During the 1960s, he entered the Guinness Book of Records for the longest joke-telling session ever - 1,500 jokes in three-and-a-half hours. He was awarded an OBE in 1982 and was dubbed a knight by the Duke of Cambridge in 2017 - the year of his 90th birthday. RIP Sir Ken Dodd. A legend and an inspiration. I have a lot to thank You for. I Was thrilled you had the best birthday party in Liverpool before you left us. Your city, friends,Family and Show business will miss you terribly. pic.twitter.com/iDeEC4yukJ He spent more than six weeks in the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital earlier this year, following a chest infection, leaving at the end of February. Fellow Liverpudlian Claire Sweeney described Dodd as a ""legend and an inspiration"". Actor John Challis, who played Boycie in comedy television series Only Fools And Horses, tweeted: ""So sorry to hear we have lost Ken Dodd. I met him once and I've never forgotten it. Gawd bless 'im."" Comedian Dara O Briain tweeted: ""So happy I got to meet him once, and more importantly, saw him do one of his incredible 5 hour shows. He was an education to watch and, afterwards, at 1.30 am, he had beers with me in the dressing room and talked showbiz. A privilege, and a loss. RIP."""

The list is determined by 2,500 consumers, who are asked to rank each brand for quality, reliability and distinction for the Centre for Brand Analysis. Superbrands chairman Stephen Cheliotis said: ""British Airways tumbling from top spot to outside of the top 20 should be a wake-up call for all brands. ""In a world where customer expectations have rightfully risen, brands cannot afford to disappoint and need to continually deliver to retain their valuable reputations. ""No brand, however strong, is immune to changing consumer sentiment. ""The rise of fresh, disruptive brands - particularly in terms of relevance to consumers' lives - should be an added warning to more established brands.

2018-03-12,"Perched just off the south-eastern corner of famous ""Silicon Roundabout"", at the heart of the UK's burgeoning tech start-up scene, you can find the headquarters of a company that is one of the standard-bearers of the UK's space industry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180312145800/https://news.sky.com/story/space-firm-in-transition-as-profits-fall-11282642,"Inmarsat, a FTSE-100 member as recently as two years ago, is a global leader in the field of satellite technology. Its 13 satellites enable thousands of ships to traverse the globe, airlines to provide wi-fi services to their passengers in the air, enables engineers in the oil and gas sector to do work remotely and also helps journalists broadcast from far-away locations. And it's also a major supplier to the US military. At the moment, though, it's fair to say that this is a business going through something of a transition. Full year results on Friday brought news of a 23% fall in pre-tax profits, to $229.8m (this UK company reports in US dollars as most of its trading income is in that currency), despite a 5% rise in annual revenues to $1.4bn. Worse still, so far as shareholders will be concerned, was news that the dividend in respect of the second half of the year has been cut by 60% to a level where it is ""expected to stay"" until cash flows recover. Shares of Inmarsat have fallen by almost 6% on this development which, the company is stressing, has to be seen in the context of it having returned $2.1bn to investors since its stock market flotation in 2005. There are two elements at play here. The first is that Inmarsat has decided it would be unwise to depend on future cash payments from Ligado Networks, a US satellite company that was previously called LightSquared, which uses some of its airwaves. These payments, worth $136m to Inmarsat, are due to ""pause"" at the end of the year before resuming in 2020 but questions remain over whether Ligado will receive a licence from US regulators allowing it to reinvent itself as a mobile network. That licence approval is critical to future payments to Inmarsat, which has pointed out that its contract with the company has already survived Ligado going through a previous bankruptcy process. The other factor is that Inmarsat wishes to conserve its cash while it continues to invest in future opportunities. During 2017, the company launched two new satellites, one of which went up in one of entrepreneur Elon Musk's Falcon 9 rockets. This pushed up Inmarsat's capital expenditure by 45%, to $598.7m, but it wants to carry on investing this year to boost its position, in particular, in the aviation sector. It believes providing in-flight connectivity (IFC) to airlines is going to be its main growth opportunity in coming years on the basis that, in order to compete more effectively, commercial airlines are going to have to offer this to passengers as a matter of course. Inmarsat said: ""The retail value for satellite operators and services providers delivering IFC connectivity services to the industry is predicted to grow from around $1bn in 2017 to $5.4bn by 2026. ""Fuirthermore, there is expected to be a ramp-up in the number of connected aircraft in operation in the future - from 6,000 in 2015 to over 20,000 by the middle of the next decade. ""Over 70% of these new aircraft are expected to be based in the relatively nascent IFC markets of Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. ""These regions will drive the majority of the future growth of the global air transport industry and are therefore key target areas for Inmarsat."" Companies asking shareholders to exchange returns today for jam tomorrow is nothing new. However, in this instance, it looks justified. Demand for aviation is going to grow strongly in coming years, particularly in emerging markets, while people are increasingly expecting to be connected everywhere. Connecting them while they are in the air therefore does look to be a great opportunity for this fascinating company - even if it means that, for those of us who prefer to travel in relative peace and quiet, things may get a bit noisier when we're in the air in future."

Sir Christopher Wrey, the former UK ambassador to the US who has previously worked in Moscow, told Sky News: ""You could, if this is proven, take advantage of this horrible case and not only expel the ambassador, but drain the swamp of all these guys MI5 are tagging around the streets of London and wherever."" He added that the UK's response after the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 - when four Russian diplomats were expelled - ""probably was too weak"". :: Avoiding Russia's World Cup Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has suggested the UK's involvement at the World Cup in Russia this summer could be affected by the nerve agent attack. ""I think it would be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way and we would certainly have to consider that,"" he told the House of Commons. It was later clarified Mr Johnson was referring to the possibility that officials, dignitaries and ministers may not attend the World Cup, not that England would boycott the tournament. :: Sanctions Mr Johnson has also threatened fresh sanctions against Russia if it was responsible for the Salisbury poisoning. Britain has already backed tough UN and EU sanctions on Russia's economy to oppose its annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine. The sanctions targeted Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors, which are managed by the powerful elite around President Putin. :: Imposing 'The Magnitsky Act' The Government has introduced measures in the Criminal Finances Act, inspired by America's Magnitsky Act, to allow the assets of international human rights violators to be frozen. The US law was named after whistle-blowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow detention centre in 2009 after attempting to reveal a massive tax fraud against his British-based investment firm and the Russian state. The 37-year-old father-of-two was held for almost a year without trial and denied medical treatment. Home Secretary Amber Rudd indicated that the Salisbury incident may prompt further action. ""The Sanctions Bill is at the moment before the committee and I know there are people who are talking about wanting to put down amendments at report stage,"" she said. ""Of course what we have seen happening in the past few days may bring this more to the front."" :: Ending diplomatic ties Former Tory minister Nick Bold has urged Britain to break off diplomatic ties with Russia in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning. He said: ""I do not see how we can maintain diplomatic relations with a country that tries to murder people on British soil and puts the lives of British citizens at risk. ""It's time for us to turn tough talk into action."""

The group analysed dishes from six Chinese restaurants and found that 97% of them contained at least two grams of salt per dish. Some 58% had more than three grams of salt per dish, half of the daily recommended maximum for an adult. If people were to eat a side dish as well, they would be likely to exceed the six gram per day limit in one meal, the group said. The group also looked at Chinese ready meals from supermarkets and found that, of the 141 examined, 43% were high in salt - high enough to receive a red warning label on the front of the pack. Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at London's Queen Mary University and chairman of Action on Salt, called on health bodies to take immediate action. He said: ""Salt is the forgotten killer as it puts up our blood pressure, leading to tens of thousands of unnecessary strokes, heart failure and heart attacks every year. ""Reducing salt is the most cost effective measure to reduce the number of people dying or suffering from strokes or heart disease."" Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""Our salt consumption has decreased over the last decade - a loaf of bread has 40% less than it used to. ""However, some products are still too high in salt and we know this can be reduced further. ""We've been very clear with the food industry on the importance of meeting the 2017 salt targets.

A witness told the Financial Times of the shock of those present after the East Hull MP allegedly slapped a female party member's backside when she walked through Mr Turner's constituency office in 2015. When the MP was challenged, the witness told the newspaper Mr Turner replied with something similar to: ""I couldn't help myself."" It was reported two witnesses also said they heard Mr Turner tell the woman, who had recovered from breast cancer, she ""shouldn't have got rid of her real t*** because they were great"", before adding: ""The ones you've got now are nice enough."" The MP, a former barrister, is alleged to have first made such comments in 2014 and repeated them on other occasions. Mr Turner denies the allegations. ""I am aware of reports in the media about my alleged inappropriate behaviour,"" he said in a statement. ""I strongly reject any suggestion that I behaved inappropriately or in a misogynistic manner."" Sky News understands the Labour Party has not received an official complaint about the allegations. A Labour spokesman said: ""The party takes all complaints of sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination extremely seriously. ""We ask that anyone with a complaint comes forward so that allegations can be fully investigated, and any appropriate disciplinary action taken in line with the party's rule book and procedures."" It comes after House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom last month announced plans for a new behavioural code for all MPs, peers and staff, which will underpin a new independent complaints and grievance procedure separate from the political parties. The recommendations of a cross-party group came in response to a recent scandal, which saw a series of allegations of sexual harassment and bullying made against politicians and staff from across political parties."

Mr Corbyn, responding to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, called for a ""decisive and proportionate"" response once an investigation by counter-terror officers in Salisbury has been completed. He added this should be ""focused on reducing conflicts and tensions rather than increasing them"", telling MPs: ""Let us do all we can to ensure this never, ever happens again."" Earlier, the Prime Minister promised to return to the House of Commons this week to update MPs on Britain's response to the attack, once the Russian government has provided its response by the end of Tuesday. However, Mr Corbyn appeared to suggest the UK's response should not include the cutting off of diplomatic ties with Moscow. ""We need to continue seeking a robust dialogue with Russia on all the issues currently dividing our countries, both domestic and international, rather than simply cutting off contact and letting the tensions and divisions get worse and, potentially, even more dangerous,"" he said. Mr Corbyn prompted more controversy when he highlighted Russian-linked donations to the Conservative Party, as revealed by the Sunday Times at the weekend. He said: ""We're all familiar with the way huge fortunes, often acquired in the most dubious circumstances in Russia, sometimes connected to criminal elements, have ended up sheltering in London and trying to buy political influence in British party politics. ""There have been over ¬£800,000 worth of donations to the Conservative Party from Russian oligarchs and their associates."" The remarks were met with shouts of ""you are a disgrace"" from the Conservative benches, while Mr Corbyn also faced calls of ""shame"" as he sat down at the end of his comments to MPs. The Labour leader also challenged the Prime Minister to back proposed Labour changes to legislation currently going through Parliament, which could give Britain so-called ""Magnitsky"" powers to sanction foreign officials. Later, as backbench MPs asked the Prime Minister questions about her statement, the Labour leader came under attack from those critics within his own party. Ex-Labour shadow chancellor Chris Leslie insisted it is ""just not appropriate"" to take ""party political differences"" when ""our country is potentially under attack"". His Labour colleague Mike Gapes notably declared ""all MPs must stand together"", as he branded the Salisbury poisoning ""an act of terrorism"". Former chief secretary to the treasury Liam Byrne also resisted party politics to pointedly present a message of unity. He said: ""The Prime Minister should know that if by Wednesday she concludes we are indeed embattled, she'll find both unity and resolve across this House in facing down a common threat."" And former shadow transport minister John Woodcock, who has previously stated he could not support Mr Corbyn as prime minister, appeared to suggest the Labour leader in Number 10 would threaten the UK's national security. He said: ""The level of resilience voiced by the Prime Minister in the chamber today has been many years in coming but it is hugely welcome. ""Indeed, it would put our national security at significant risk if we were led by anyone who did not understand the gravity of the threat which Russia poses to this nation."" Tory MPs also provided a robust response to Mr Corbyn's comments. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith praised Mrs May for ""rising to this occasion"" and added many MPs wished Jeremy Corbyn had ""abandoned party politics and done just the same"" with his response. Fellow Tory Johnny Mercer, calling out Mr Corbyn, described how he had ""just seen the most shameful moment I have seen in the House of Commons in my time to date."""
2018-03-13,Gwent Police is being investigated after failing to inform hundreds of people that hackers may have accessed their confidential reports to the force.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180313154023/https://news.sky.com/story/gwent-police-investigated-for-hiding-potential-hack-11287980,"Sky News has learned that up to 450 people who filed reports through an online tool over a two-year period could have been put at risk by hackers due to security flaws. Although the tool was decommissioned after an internal security review discovered that confidential information was being exposed, the force did not inform the individuals who were affected. In what may amount to a breach of its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act, the force also failed to notify the Information Commissioner's Office until it was contacted by Sky News. This week, a spokesman for the force said: ""Gwent Police has recently contacted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and confirmed that formal notification will be provided for consideration. ""Data integrity is of paramount importance to Gwent Police and we continually review our governance procedures to minimise the risk of data breaches."" The potential breach was discovered in February 2017, when the force said an immediate ""investigation was commenced to establish whether any data had been accessed"". However, the investigators found that the web server logs from the hosting company which could reveal whether hackers had accessed the reports only stored access information covering the previous 24 hours. The tool was created by the force's digital development team and is understood to be unique to the force. An ICO spokesperson confirmed: ""We've been made aware of an incident involving Gwent Police and will be making enquiries."" The Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent, Jeff Cuthbert, told Sky News he would also be investigating the incident. ""I am responsible for monitoring and scrutinising the performance of Gwent Police. I will be asking the chief constable for a full and comprehensive report on data breaches and the process in place for identifying and acting upon them. ""Moving forward, I will seek reassurance that the protection of personal data of the public we serve is of paramount importance and that any lessons learnt from previous breaches are implemented with immediate effect."" A spokesperson for the force told Sky News: ""We are not able to confirm whether this data had been accessed. ""However, in mitigation, for someone to access this data, they would have had to been actively looking on the specific area of the site, had a reasonable level of technical skill and known a complex URL (which was long in length and a mixture of random characters). ""There has been no other form of communication (complaints or any malicious activity on our security system). It was concluded that there was a high probability no data had been accessed and no risk to any individuals."" Gwent Police's failure to report the potential breach stands in stark contrast to a breach at Uber, where the company is accused of paying a hacker to conceal the confirmed theft of information belonging to 57 million customers. Speaking to Sky News, Raef Meeuwisse, the author of Cybersecurity for Beginners, said: ""The response of any organisation to a potential data breach should always reflect the value or sensitivity of the information involved. ""In this case, it is surprising that the team dealing with this on behalf of Gwent Police do not appear to have considered this a notifiable incident. ""Gwent Police did not have the means to verify if any copy of the sensitive data posted on the internet had been taken. ""Despite this, they also chose not to contact the 450 people or organisations to alert and support them and they also decided not to report the matter to the ICO or any other entity."" Mr Meeuwisse, who has been involved as a consultant in many high-profile breach responses during his career, added: ""Although it is good news that it was a security review for Gwent Police that identified the issue, the process from that point onwards seems to have fallen over."""
2018-03-13,The Prime Minister's detailed statement to the Commons on the Salisbury poisoning raises the prospect of Britain being drawn into an ever escalating confrontation with Russia.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180313154023/https://news.sky.com/story/what-can-theresa-may-do-about-russia-over-the-salisbury-poisoning-11287730,"Theresa May described the attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia as a foreign state attacking Britain, and by definition that will require a robust response. Anything else makes her, her government, and the country look weak. As foreign policy analyst Ed Lucas told Sky News: ""This I think is as important for Britain's security and Britain's image in the world as the Falklands War was. :: Novichok nerve agent: What exactly is it? ""It will change not only the way we think about ourselves but also the way other countries will think about us. ""A chemical weapons attack totally unprovoked in the heart of Britain could have killed many more people than it did, and it's the biggest test of Theresa May's premiership how it responds."" Mrs May did in theory give the Russians a way out, but they have already indicated they are unlikely to take it. She raised the possibility that somehow they lost some of their stockpile of nerve agent and it fell into the wrong hands. If that was the case, they need to account for it to the international body responsible, the OPCW. They seem in no mood to cooperate using terms such as ""fairy tales"" and ""circus acts"" to dismiss the allegations and the furore around them. So the deadline for a Russian explanation is likely to come and go. What are the British Government's options then? They may opt for a traditional response, expelling diplomats and Russian intelligence agents and maybe even the Russian ambassador, too. That would be far more effective if they can do so in concert with their allies. Already British cabinet ministers are consulting their American counterparts and others on what help they can possibly expect. They may also seek to hurt Putin and his circle where it hurts - financially. Russian oligarchs famously use London as a playground to spend and park their money. Russian opposition leader Alexander Navalny has tweeted his advice to Mrs May, naming three oligarchs with London connections in particular to target. The British Government could go after their assets. They could also restrict their visas or deny them. That always runs the risk of the oligarchs and tycoons finding a new place to take their money. Multi-national cooperation would make those kinds of sanctions more effective. However, unlike past British governments, Theresa May's cannot necessarily depend on American's full-throated support given Donald Trump's bromance with Vladimir Putin, even if his spokesperson was making the right noises in the White House briefing earlier. Brexit has coloured Britain's relations with its European allies and may complicate the effort to coordinate a response across the continent, even if what happened in Salisbury could happen in provincial towns anywhere. Then there is the risk of retaliation. If Vladimir Putin is capable of attempting an assassination using a nerve agent in the middle of provincial Britain, what else might he try? A cyberattack, for instance, targeting British commerce or public infrastructure; a chilling prospect and thought to be well within the capability of the Russians. The path ahead for Mrs May is not without peril but then if this was a state sponsored attack on the UK, as her police chiefs and spies seem to believe, she has little choice but take it. Otherwise, they will be telling her she will be inviting more such attacks in future."
2018-03-13,A Russian chemical weapons scientist has told Sky News that people exposed to even tiny traces of the nerve agent used to attack a spy and his daughter in Salisbury could be in danger of developing symptoms in years to come.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180313154023/https://news.sky.com/story/spy-poisoning-novichok-inventor-says-hundreds-could-be-at-risk-for-years-11287880,"Dr Vil Mirzayanov is a chemist who ran the technical counter-intelligence department in Russia's chemical weapons institute. He helped make ""novichok"", the class of nerve agents the British government says was used to poison defected spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. :: LIVE: Deaths to be re-examined for Russia links:: Public faces 'low risk' after chemical attack, health officials insist More than two decades ago, Dr Mirzayanov became so concerned about novichok that he blew the whistle and fled to America, where he campaigned to get all chemical weapons banned. He spoke to Sky News at his home in Princeton in New Jersey. He said: ""It's the same as nerve gas but 10 times, at least 10 times, more powerful."" The scientist emphasised that Novichok was designed to do ""irreparable"" damage to the human body. He said it would leave those exposed to significant doses, like Mr Skripal and his daughter, as ""invalids"" who would need medical assistance for the rest of their lives. He spoke of a colleague who died after accidental exposure to a small amount in his lab. ""That's it,"" he said. ""No cure."" But Dr Mirzayanov also talked about the risk of trace contamination to hundreds of members of the British public who may have been in the vicinity of the attack around the time it happened. He said that even minuscule amounts of novichok could affect victims, and that symptoms could develop ""in years"". :: Novichok nerve agent: What exactly is it? He described ""headaches, difficulty thinking, and also co-ordination (issues), a lot of problems"". When asked about the advice given by Public Health England, including washing clothes and wiping down belongings, he said: ""Sure it's useful, but not enough, absolutely not."" He said that anyone who may have been exposed should be offered ""permanent medical surveillance."" Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""PHE has been working very closely with the police and national experts on chemical weapons since the start of the incident and our risk assessment is based on knowledge of the chemical used. ""Our advice remains that the risk to the general public is low."" Dr Mirzayanov said that novichok, which means ""newcomer"", can be made from two separate compounds similar to chemicals used in agriculture, and which crucially are not on the chemical weapons convention banned list. In that way, he said, novichok could be transported to the site of an attack in its constituent parts without detection, and once assembled the tiny micro particles could easily be deployed using an aerosol, spray, liquid or wipe. He thinks it is likely that the attack was carried out using a spray, which maximises the chances of a victim getting the nerve agent on their skin and also inhaling it. :: Russia 'highly likely' to be behind Salisbury attack Dr Mirzayanov described the secret development of the powerful nerve agent as ""a plot against the world"" designed to maintain chemical weapons capability without having to declare it to the international community. The Russian government has denied any involvement in the Salisbury poisonings, but Dr Mirzayanov says that only Russia could have carried out such an attack, characterising novichok as a ""fingerprint"". He said the use of it on British soil was his ""worst nightmare."""

The card, which gives discounted rail travel to passengers aged 26 to 30, was announced by Philip Hammond in his budget speech in November. Although 4.5 million people could benefit, just 10,000 railcards were offered on a first come, first served basis - meaning only about one in 500 people in this age range will have one. Demand for the railcard has been high since it went on sale on Tuesday morning, with the official website crashing under the strain. A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said: ""The 10,000 quota of 26-30 Railcards, made available as part of the national trial, have now sold out. ""A key commitment in the rail industry's long-term plan to change and improve is to boost communities by enabling more people to travel by train, so we will consider carefully the unprecedented demand we've seen as part of this trial."" Those who missed out can sign up online to receive notification if more cards are made available. Emily Thomas, from London, wrote: ""Getting a 26-30 railcard is worse than getting a Glastonbury ticket. Sort out your website to make it fair!"" In a message to the National Railcards Twitter account at 7.48am, youth worker Josh Booth, from Leeds, posted: ""Been trying to get 26-30 railcard since 7am, your website crashing and been on hold on the phone since then."" Tom Drury, from London, wrote: ""The launch of the new railcard is a shambles."" The limited number of railcards are being made available as part of a trial which is designed to assess the take-up of cards and the impact they have on revenue and passenger numbers. Valid for one year and costing ¬£30, the railcards are digital only and stored in an app on the user's phone. The card is aimed at leisure travel, and will not be applicable to season tickets. There will be a ¬£12 minimum on tickets between 4.30am and 10am, excluding weekends and public holidays. The first trial of the scheme was on Greater Anglia services. An RDG spokesman said: ""The trial of the 26-30 Railcard is part of the rail industry's long-term plan to change, improve and boost communities by enabling more people to travel by train. ""Research being gathered as part of the 26-30 Railcard trial is being used to inform discussions with the Government about a national roll-out, and to develop new products that make leisure travel easier and better value for customers.""

2018-03-13,A Turkish heiress and bride-to-be has been killed in a plane crash alongside her friends as they returned from her bachelorette weekend. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180313154023/https://news.sky.com/story/turkish-heiress-mina-basaran-killed-in-plane-crash-after-hen-weekend-11287340,"Mina Basaran, 28, died on board a private jet after it crashed into a remote part of Iran's Zagros mountains on Sunday evening. She is the daughter of Huseyin Basaran, the chairman of Turkey's Basaran Investment Holding, and is understood to have been in line to succeed her father. Ms Basaran was on the board of the company, after graduating from Koc University in Istanbul and continuing her studies at a business school. According to her social media, she was the owner of a Ramada resort in Turkey and a yacht firm. Ms Basaran was engaged to Murat Gezer and was due to marry next month at the Ciragan Saray, an Ottoman-era palace which is one of the most prominent wedding venues in Turkey. According to reports, three of the other hens on the trip were due to marry this summer, and one was pregnant. The group wore matching hen dressing gowns in the last photo they had taken together, shared with the hashtag #minasbachelorette, and taken at the One and Only Royal Mirage luxury hotel in Dubai. They had also been to a Rita Ora concert in Dubai during their trip. Mr Basaran had named one of his residential developments after her, and she shared some pictures from Mina Towers on her Instagram before she died. Turkish media reported the two female pilots killed were Beril Gerbes and Melike Kuvvet. Ms Kuvvet was one of the first female pilots in the Turkish armed forces, but left to work in civil aviation. The cause of the crash is not yet known. The flight took off from Sharjah International Airport on Sunday and one hour later rapidly gained altitude before dropping drastically according to Flight Radar 24. Iranian emergency management organisation spokesperson Mojtaba Khaledi said the plane hit a mountain and burst into flames. Rescuers were dispatched to the scene in a remote part of the Zagros mountain range, 230 miles south of the capital Tehran. Witnesses in a village near the crash claim they saw flames coming from the plane's engine before it went down, according to Iranian news agency Fars. The aircraft's black boxes have been found and will be handed to Turkish authorities. Basaran Holdings has dominated Turkish industry since the collapse of the Ottoman empire, and grew out of the country's hazelnut trade. Mr Basaran also used to be the deputy chairman of Turkey's Trabzonspor football team."

He told Sky News that anyone exposed to even tiny traces of the substance used to attack Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia could face long-term health risks. :: LIVE - Russia blocked from spy poisoning materials Significant doses of nerve agents are deadly, but it is unclear whether there are long-term effects of exposure to smaller amounts. Dr Mirzyanov, who has not worked in Russia for 30 years and has not been approached by the British authorities for advice, said he believes trace elements could lead to complications similar to Gulf War syndrome, which has been attributed to exposure to pesticides and chemicals released during that conflict. Public Health England (PHE), the agency responsible for responding to health emergencies, has consistently advised that the risk to the general public is low, and repeated that position in response to his claims. :: Novichok nerve agent: What exactly is it? Dr Jenny Harries, PHE's deputy medical director, said: ""PHE has been working very closely with the police and national experts on chemical weapons since the start of the incident and our risk assessment is based on knowledge of the chemical used. Our advice remains that the risk to the general public is low."" While PHE's assessment has remained consistent, its advice to the public has evolved in the nine days since Mr Skripal and his daughter were poisoned. Most significantly, on Sunday it advised anyone who was in the pub or restaurant visited by the Skripals to wash clothing and items such as watches, phones and spectacles. PHE said the measures were precautionary and the immediate risk was ""extremely low"", but it drew criticism from figures including former chief medical officer Liam Donaldson, who questioned whether its response had been too slow. Officials are adamant the reaction has been proportionate, timely and underpinned by the very best intelligence and expertise. :: Diners told to wash possessions, but risk 'very low' PHE retains experts in biological and chemical weapons, and manages a rare and imported pathogens laboratory on the same site at Porton Down as the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, where the novichok samples were analysed. PHE officials have worked closely with the police and their experts at Porton Down, and it is understood they were informed novichok had been used as soon it was identified, perhaps within 24 hours of the attack. Their subsequent assessment of the wider health threat was based on three factors: the dose used in the main attack, the trace amounts identified, and ""proportionality"" of response. Initially, with no traces of the compound found, they advised the public that there was a low risk while the emergency and health response focused on assessing medical staff and first responders - including Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who remains in hospital in a serious condition. :: Fears and nervousness in city rocked by double agent attack Last Sunday, however, the advice was adapted when it emerged that trace elements had been found at the Zizzi restaurant and The Mill pub. Officials insist their position has developed appropriately as the facts have changed, and believe there is a very small risk from repeated exposure to small amounts of novichok. They maintain that dilution with water is the most effective way of dealing with trace elements, hence the advice to wash clothes and personal items, and that the risk is limited to the small number of people who visited the two sites. PHE continues to review its advice but privately officials believe they have been vindicated by the fact that no one else in Salisbury has been affected. If anyone else has received a significant dose of Novichok they would be in hospital."

The 40-year-old spat at the car where the young Manchester United fan was travelling in following a brief verbal exchange with the teenager's father after his former club lost 2-1 to the Red Devils at Old Trafford on Saturday. Footage filmed by the parent and obtained by the Daily Mirror shows the father tease Carragher about the result as the pair drive alongside each other after the game. In the video, he shouts through his daughter's front passenger side window: ""2-1, 2-1, unlucky Jamie lad, 2-1 lad."" Carragher then winds down the window of his black SUV and spits towards the car. The girl tells her father ""he spat on me"", to which he responds: ""Jamie Carragher spat at my daughter... nice, nice, very nice Jamie Carragher"". Speaking to Sky News, the ex-Liverpool defender called it ""a moment of madness"". The football pundit, who has a daughter the same age as the girl who was caught up in the incident, said his behaviour ""cannot be condoned"" and became visibly upset when he was asked what his children thought of his behaviour. He said his ""biggest regret was that a young girl was caught up in the middle of the altercation"". ""That devastates me more than anything. I've got a daughter exactly the same age and I can't say how I'd react if someone did that to her,"" he continued. ""I've made mistakes in my 25-year career, but this is the worst one."" Carragher added: ""Hopefully I can get the chance to meet face-to-face with the family, and apologise to them again."" He was suspended by Sky Sports shortly before the interview, which said in a statement: ""Sky takes this matter extremely seriously and strongly condemns Jamie's actions, we have made that clear to him in person today and suspended him from his duties. ""It falls well below the standards we expect of our people."" The girl's father said the family ""don't want him to lose his job"". He told the Mirror: ""We wanted an apology and an explanation. He seems contrite. Everyone makes mistakes, we are all human."" His wife added: ""He did seem extremely sorry."" Fellow Sky Sports pundit, former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, also urged his bosses not to sack Carragher. He tweeted: ""I've just watched Carra23 say sorry.

""They call it manspreading - that was Putin."" Having been deployed to Russia in the wake of the Sergei Skripal poisoning I happened to be listening to the audio book What Happened - Hillary Clinton's account of the US election in 2016, which she lost to Donald Trump. It was an election famously dogged by claims of Russian interference in favour of Mr Trump. There can be few in the world more conscious (or sore) about the notion of Russia dabbling in the affairs of a sovereign nation than Mrs Clinton, or au fait with the levels Mr Putin will go to to get what he wants. In the wake of the Salisbury attack, Mrs Clinton's words take on a fresh poignancy, recounting in her book: ""I've dealt with a lot of male leaders in my life but Putin is in a class by himself. A former KGB spy with a taste for over the top macho theatrics. ""A public inquiry in the UK concluded that Putin probably approved the killing of Alexander Litvinenko, one of his enemies, in London in 2006, by poisoning his tea with palonium 210. ""The Russian leader has emerged in the popular imagination as an arch villain straight out of a James Bond movie. Yet he's also perennially misunderstood and under estimated."" Barack Obama once compared Vladimir Putin to a bored kid at the back of a classroom, saying ""he's got that kind of slouch"". George W Bush famously said after looking Putin in the eye that he found him ""very straightforward and trustworthy and was able to get a sense of his soul"". On that, Mrs Clinton says: ""My somewhat tongue in cheek response was he (Putin) was a KGB agent. By definition he doesn't have a soul."" So the stage is set. Theresa May insists she means business this time. In other words, if Russia 'got away with it' over the killing of Litvinenko, it won't this time over the attempted murder of Mr Skripal and his daughter. Yet in Russia, there's a sense almost of bored shoulder shrugging at Britain's incensed stance. Moreover, how could Britain have reached its conclusion so quickly? So quickly, in fact, that all this is part of a British campaign to discredit Russia in the run-up to its presidential election. It sounds familiar. Within minutes of Mrs May's statement in the Commons, Russia likened her performance to a ""circus show"". It's not really the kind of language you'd expect one G8 nation to respectfully say to another, no matter what the allegation. Not much indication of co-operation, let alone acknowledgement of guilt. Putin is highly skilled and exceedingly well practised in the art of playing games - in particular hardball. There's a deadline but he won't take kindly to having a gun held to his head. Talking of guns - an analogy being used in the Russian media is this: if somebody somewhere in the world was shot with a Kalashnikov rifle just because the rifle was made in Russia, would that make Russia responsible? Understand that and you get a sense of how Russia seems to be playing this."
2018-03-13,"The poison used to target a former spy and his daughter is Russian-made nerve agent novichok, the PM has said. The chemicals are among the most deadly nerve agents ever created.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180313154023/https://news.sky.com/story/salisbury-poison-was-russian-made-novichok-pm-confirms-11287491,":: Who made it? There are more than 100 formulations in the novichok family, all developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok is the Russian word for ""newcomer"". :: How did it get here? Andy Oppenheimer, a biological and chemical specialist, has told Sky News the chemical could have been brought into the UK through an airport. ""These things can evade detection if they are very small amounts and very well shielded, whether they are biological, chemical or a biological agent,"" he says. ""This chemical may have come through an airport, we really don't know yet."" :: How is it used? Novichok agents are dispersed as an ultra-fine powder rather than a gas or vapour. They can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. :: What are the symptoms? As with other nerve agents, the chemicals block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme active in the nervous system. The result is involuntary contraction of all muscles, leading to cardiac arrest and asphyxiation. :: Is washing clothing enough? Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, has said the ""immediate risk to the general public remains low"". She advised people who were in either The Mill pub or Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday March 4 to wash any clothing they were wearing, wipe personal items including phones or handbags with baby wipes and to wash hands thoroughly. Mr Oppenheimer says the advice was just a ""precaution"". He told Sky News: ""Unlike a conventional explosive device going off, it really has a kind of a spread, it will produce particular symptoms. ""I would have thought those symptoms would have emerged by now and all the advice is a precaution."" :: Is there an antidote? All nerve agents have an antidote in atrophine, but it needs to be administered as soon as possible. The problem is it can take time to diagnose that a nerve agent has been used. :: Does it contravene international law? Novichok is ""highly illegal"", ""extremely powerful"" and created to avoid detection, says Mr Oppenheimer. Significantly, several of the novichok chemicals are so-called binary weapons - with two non-toxic precursor chemicals that can be mixed prior to use. This makes them safer to transport and handle. One of these is novichok-5, derived from the highly potent A-230 chemical. Its precursor chemicals are ordinary organophosphate pesticides and can be legally made at agricultural chemical manufacturers. According to Dr Vil Mirzayanov, who worked on the novichok programme in the Soviet Union until he fled to the US, the legitimate use of precursor chemicals was deliberate as it meant they were not placed on the controlled list of the Chemical Weapons Convention. :: Who could be behind it? Theresa May told the Commons her Government has concluded it is ""highly likely"" Russia is responsible for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The PM said the attack, using a ""military-grade"" nerve agent, fits a pattern of Russian aggression and said Russia's ambassador to the UK has been summoned to explain what happened. She said: ""We will not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has told the Russian ambassador that Moscow must ""immediately provide full and complete disclosure"" of its novichok nerve agent programme to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Moscow has been given until the end of Tuesday to respond, Mrs May said. If Russian involvement is proved, it will be considered an ""unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom"", she added. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in a critical condition more than a week after they were found slumped unconscious in Salisbury."
2018-03-13,Police hunting a stalker who has been harassing a woman for six years have released pictures of several notes in an appeal to people who may recognise the handwriting and distinctive features.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180313154023/https://news.sky.com/story/do-you-recognise-this-handwriting-stalkers-notes-released-by-police-in-bristol-11288223,"The cards, sent to a 40-year-old woman, have recently become more sexually explicit and include threats to commit rape, Avon and Somerset officers say. In one, a Valentine's Day card, the sender ominously signs off: ""From your long time secret admirer who has now become your stalker."" Police say the offences all happened in Bristol and it is believed the cards are being sent from somewhere within the Bristol postmark area. They are usually signed ""Gordon"" and always with five crosses - one large X and four small Xs around it. In a plea to the public, the victim, who has not been named, said: ""This has been going on for so long - someone out there must know who it is. ""Whether it's the distinctive crosses, the handwriting or the name they call themselves, if you recognise anything that could help the police, please let them know."" The woman first contacted police in January 2016. Officers say the cards are always written in capitals and usually feature an animal on the front, often cats. The force is appealing to anyone who may recognise the handwriting, as well as shop workers and post office staff, to see if any of the distinctive features appear familiar. Lead officer Detective Constable Patrick Prescott said: ""Do you recognise this handwriting, the name Gordon or the signature with the five crosses? Do you know who may be sending these cards? ""If you work in a shop which sells cards, or if you work in the postal service, do you recognise the handwriting or the distinctive pattern of crosses? ""You may recognise one or more of the characteristics but can't believe the person you have in mind would commit offences like this. It could be a colleague, friend or even a family member. ""We'd ask you to please report any concerns or suspicions to help us make this stop."" Police say they have been working with the National Crime Agency to glean how much of a threat the offender might pose. DC Prescott said: ""Thorough analysis of the communications has been carried out and the possibility the offender has sent, or is sending cards or letters with similar content to other people cannot be excluded. ""If you have been receiving similar correspondence then we want to hear from you."" Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting reference number 5216008248. You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2018-03-13,"The Government has promised a ""robust"" response if Russia is behind the Salisbury nerve agent attack but what could be imposed on Vladimir Putin's regime?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180313154023/https://news.sky.com/story/salisbury-spy-how-will-uk-respond-if-russia-was-behind-nerve-agent-attack-11281502,":: Expelling diplomats There have been calls to expel Russia's ambassador to the UK if the Kremlin ordered the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Sir Christopher Wrey, the former UK ambassador to the US who has previously worked in Moscow, told Sky News: ""You could, if this is proven, take advantage of this horrible case and not only expel the ambassador, but drain the swamp of all these guys MI5 are tagging around the streets of London and wherever."" He added that the UK's response after the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 - when four Russian diplomats were expelled - ""probably was too weak"". :: Avoiding Russia's World Cup Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has suggested the UK's involvement at the World Cup in Russia this summer could be affected by the nerve agent attack. ""I think it would be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way and we would certainly have to consider that,"" he told the House of Commons. It was later clarified Mr Johnson was referring to the possibility that officials, dignitaries and ministers may not attend the World Cup, not that England would boycott the tournament. :: Sanctions Mr Johnson has also threatened fresh sanctions against Russia if it was responsible for the Salisbury poisoning. Britain has already backed tough UN and EU sanctions on Russia's economy to oppose its annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine. The sanctions targeted Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors, which are managed by the powerful elite around President Putin. :: Imposing 'The Magnitsky Act' The Government has introduced measures in the Criminal Finances Act, inspired by America's Magnitsky Act, to allow the assets of international human rights violators to be frozen. The US law was named after whistle-blowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow detention centre in 2009 after attempting to reveal a massive tax fraud against his British-based investment firm and the Russian state. The 37-year-old father-of-two was held for almost a year without trial and denied medical treatment. Home Secretary Amber Rudd indicated that the Salisbury incident may prompt further action. ""The Sanctions Bill is at the moment before the committee and I know there are people who are talking about wanting to put down amendments at report stage,"" she said. ""Of course what we have seen happening in the past few days may bring this more to the front."" :: Ending diplomatic ties Former Tory minister Nick Bold has urged Britain to break off diplomatic ties with Russia in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning. He said: ""I do not see how we can maintain diplomatic relations with a country that tries to murder people on British soil and puts the lives of British citizens at risk. ""It's time for us to turn tough talk into action."""

Mr Juncker was cheered by eurosceptic MEPs as he referenced the UK's departure date of March 29 2019. Responding to the small group, Mr Juncker said the time would come ""when you will regret your decision"". Nigel Farage hit back shortly after. ""The EU is bullying us,"" he said, before urging Theresa May ""to do what Trump has done and stand strong against the European Commission, against the unelected bullies"". Despite Mrs May's Mansion House speech earlier in March, in which she sought to provide more information on the UK's Brexit plans, Mr Juncker said the EU needed ""more clarity on how the UK sees its future relationship"". Mr Juncker said ""cherry-picking is not going to be possible"" in the future trade relationship between the UK and EU. ""I would rather have preferred Britain not to have decided to leave the European Union, but anyone who leaves the European Union has to know, frankly, what this means,"" he said. ""If you decide to jettison, leave behind, the common agreements and rules, then you have to accept that things cannot remain as they are."" Mr Junker said the EU was ready to work with the UK on its preferred option of the Irish border issue being resolved in the future trade deal, or by other specific measures. But he added ""we need to receive concrete proposals from the UK first"". Mr Juncker said: ""The 27 member states stand firm and united when it comes to Ireland. For us this is not an Irish issue, it is a European issue."" But he was heckled by one MEP, who shouted: ""It is a British issue."" The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt also called for more details from the Prime Minister. He said: ""There was this Mansion House speech by Mrs May, but it was mainly repeating the red lines that we know already."" Mr Verhofstadt said it was time to move beyond ""slogans"" and ""soundbites"". Mr Farage also used his time in parliament to complain that the UK was unable to complete a trade deal with the US while it remains in the transition period. ""In this USA dispute we now find ourselves trapped, impotent, unable to act,"" he said. ""We need to be free. We voted Brexit. We voted to make our own trade policy, our own trade decisions."" He continued to say ""we could do a deal with America in 48 hours"", which was met with laughter."

Fever-Tree's tonic, ginger ale and other mixers were boosted by brisk sales over the Christmas period. Chief executive Tim Warrilow said the company is looking to replicate its gin and tonic mixer success with recent additions to its dark mixer range for drinks such as rum and whisky, as well as low-calorie mixers. ""We have been very pleased with the initial launch of the extended dark spirits range which has reinforced our belief that, in much the same way we approached the gin category over 10 years ago, an exciting opportunity exists to work alongside these brands to reinvigorate the dark spirits category."" He added that gin accounts for only 6% of the global premium spirits sales, while the dark spirits category accounts for 60%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""If Fever-Tree can replicate the success it's had in tonics, particularly in the UK, then these multiples can be justified for longer and the share price could have further to go. ""Therefore we look for greater growth in ginger, cola and lemonades, particularly in the USA, where there is a significant opportunity for the brand."" Fever-Tree saw growth in all of its sales regions in 2017, including a 96% surge in the UK. It opened its North American operations in December last year, where sales were up by 39%. The company sells 13 different flavours of mixer to hotels, restaurants and bars, as well as airlines and supermarkets, and claims to be the number one brand among retailers. Over half of Fever-Tree‚Äôs sales are from abroad, with key markets such as the US, Spain and Belgium. Fever-Tree, named after the plant that produces the key tonic water ingredient quinine, is one of the largest companies on London‚Äôs junior AIM market, with a market value of around ¬£3.1bn."

Although it was due to be implemented in April, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport have now postponed it until ""later in the year"" as they consult on ensuring that the law will work properly. :: Sky News digs into the Government's pornography plans Government officials believe that age verification will protect children, and that it will help to fulfill the Conservatives' manifesto pledge to make the UK the safest place in the world to go online. But academic researchers and technology experts have warned that the measures will not necessarily protect children from online pornography. Instead the move could put government ministers and other high-profile figures at risk of blackmail if their embarrassing habits were observed by hackers. Niche pornography producers in the UK have warned that the age verification law is putting their businesses at risk due to the costs of verifying the ages of visitors rather than purchasers. They have also warned that the law could create an age verification monopoly out of pornographic giant MindGeek, which owns many popular adult websites and production studios. MindGeek told Sky News it will not use its ability to track the sexual preferences of 25 million people in the UK to snoop on them, although it did plan to collect a trove of information on users, including their names, addresses, date of birth, as well as their online activities on other websites."

The 17-year-old threw petrol bombs on to the M3 motorway on two occasions in September 2017. Thousands of motorists and passengers were stranded for hours. Prosecutors said Elger confessed to carrying out the attacks. They say he had been hearing voices and ""was sort of trying to kill someone"". Judge Keith Cutler ordered that the defendant be treated and assessed at a psychiatric unit. If doctors are unable to treat him, Elger will face a considerable custodial sentence. ""It's clear to me that you are a dangerous young man who has committed serious offences,"" Judge Cutler told the court. The judge lifted reporting restrictions on naming Elger because of the public interest in the serious offences. Elger constructed Molotov cocktails using items stolen from a Tesco store. He threw them from a bridge close to junction 10 of the M3, which is the main route between London and Southampton. Prosecutors told the court that a witness described the ""carriageway ablaze with flames reaching the height of a person"" and another had to swerve on to the hard shoulder to avoid the ""firebomb"". The second attack, on 23 September, closed the motorway for several hours and sparked massive tailbacks. Rob Welling, prosecuting, said: ""The estimated damage to the local economy is ¬£40m, we know that many people were left stranded on the M3 for many, many hours as a result of that closure."" The teenager had pleaded guilty to two arson charges, as well as burglary and blackmail charges against Winchester College, a top public school which he attended as a boarder. He also pleaded guilty to two charges of theft. Elger had twice demanded payment of ¬£10,000 in the online currency Bitcoin from the school in order for him to stop carrying out further break-ins - during which he had stolen computer equipment worth ¬£37,000. Referring to the burglaries, Mr Welling said ""he did it for satisfaction and he found the risk enjoyable."" When interviewed, prosecutors say Elger said he enjoyed the risk. The student adopted an alter ego, James, and engraved the name into a knife, Mr Welling said. He also collected hundreds of matches and had drawn an ""eerie"" picture on a notice board. Elger has since been expelled. Robert Morris, defending, said Elger was a ""deeply troubled individual"". Mr Morris went on to say Elger had been described as a child as a ""kind and pleasant boy"" but had ""lost the opportunity to go to a top university"". A further hearing at Winchester Crown Court will be held on May 18."

The interim arrangement says that the transitional period for which higher contributions would need to be paid would be implemented on 1 April 2019 and last for three years. The stalemate over pensions has seen academics strike over a number of days in protest at changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Proposals to change the USS from a ""defined benefit"" scheme, which gives workers a guaranteed income in their retirement, to a purely ""defined contribution"" scheme, in which pensions are subject to fluctuations in the stock market, formed the focus of the complaints. The University and College Union (UCU) claims the changes would cost staff ¬£10,000 a year after retirement. Members had been expected to strike for five working days this week, rounding off 14 days of industrial action. A spokesman for the UCU said the agreement would be considered by its higher education committee and branch representatives on Tuesday. The strike has resulted in hundreds of thousands of students being forced to miss lectures, seminars and assessments. More than 60 universities have been affected."

The Old Bailey was told Hassan had raised alarm bells at college. After arriving in the UK in 2015, Hassan attended Brooklands College in Weybridge, Surrey, and moved in with a foster family in Sunbury. Jurors were told his teacher and mentor Katie Cable became concerned about his behaviour despite him being named student of the year in June last year. She told the court she alerted Prevent after she saw a WhatsApp message on the 18-year-old's phone in August 2016, saying: ""IS (Islamic State) has accepted your donation."" Ms Cable said Hassan blamed America for the deaths of his parents in Iraq and said: ""It's my duty to hate Britain."" She said he was ""incredibly conflicted, frightened, confused, plagued by boredom"" and added that he would snap pens and walk out of the classroom when he first started school in April 2016. ""I believe Ahmed said his father was blown up and his mother had been shot,"" Ms Cable said. She said he talked about Tony Blair and expressed his ""anger"" at the situation in Iraq. ""I believe the anger was very clear,"" she said. ""He referred to being angry several times."" The court heard he told her ""the British"" were responsible for his parents' deaths. Ms Cable said that by September 2017, she had become ""really concerned about his mental state"". The day before the bombing, she said Hassan came to see her with presents for her children, which she says she found ""strange"". Under cross-examination, Ms Cable said she had believed Hassan was not a supporter of IS. When asked by Tim Moloney QC if it appeared that ""he desperately wanted to stay in this country"", she said that ""it seemed so"". Barnardo's workers also gave evidence to the court on Monday. Youseff Habibi, from the charity, who met Hassan when he was living in a children's home in Surrey, told jurors the defendant told him his father was a taxi driver who had gone to work one morning when ""a bomb fell on him and he died"". He said Hassan's mother had died when he was much younger and that he blamed America for her death, too. The court heard how another Barnardo's worker, Zoe Spencer, had accompanied Hassan to an immigration interview in January 2016. She said when he was asked if he had been involved with terrorist groups such as IS, he said: ""Yes, I was recruited by ISIS for three months."" Ms Spencer said she stopped the interview as she felt Hassan did not understand the question. During a second interview with an interpreter, Hassan said he was ""forced"" to go with IS and denied being sent to Europe to work for them. She also told the court she saw the teenager looking at a picture of people in balaclavas with guns and the black IS flag about a week later. Hassan denies attempted murder and using the chemical compound TATP to cause an explosion that was likely to endanger life. The trial continues."
2018-03-14,The Prime Minister has unveiled a raft of measures against Russia in response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-expels-russian-diplomats-over-salisbury-nerve-agent-attack-11289689,"The UK will kick out 23 Russian diplomats, suspend bilateral relations with Moscow, toughen sanctions powers and lead a boycott of dignitaries at this summer's World Cup, Theresa May said. Following the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, Mrs May told MPs on Wednesday there can be ""no alternative conclusion"" other than the Russian state being responsible for their attempted murder. Speaking to the House of Commons, the Prime Minister accused Moscow of responding with ""sarcasm, contempt and defiance"", demonstrating ""complete disdain for the gravity of these events"". She spoke after a deadline passed at midnight on Tuesday without a ""credible explanation"" from Russia for the use of military-grade nerve agent novichok in the UK. Mrs May said the ""reckless and despicable act"" represented an ""unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the UK"" as she vowed a ""full and robust response"". Outlining the UK's response, the Prime Minister told MPs the Government would: :: Expel 23 Russian diplomats who have been identified as undeclared intelligence officers, giving them just one week to leave. This is part of an attempt to dismantle the Russian spy network in the UK :: Urgently develop proposals for new laws to harden defences against hostile state activity, including widening anti-terror powers to detain suspects at the UK border :: Consider the need for new counter-espionage powers :: Strengthen the Sanctions Bill with new US-style ""Magnitsky"" powers to act against human rights abusers :: Increase checks on private flights, customs and freights :: Freeze Russian state assets where there is evidence they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals :: Suspend all planned high-level bilateral contacts with Russia, including revoking the invitation to Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to visit the UK :: Send no ministers or members of the Royal Family to this summer's World Cup in Russia The Prime Minister also signalled further action against Russia, but stated this could not ""be shared publicly for reasons of national security"". Speaking after a meeting with Mrs May in Downing Street earlier, the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, branded the measures ""absolutely unacceptable"" and ""a provocation"". He told Sky News: ""We believe the measures which are [being] taken by the British Government is nothing to do with the situation in Salisbury. ""We believe this is real, very serious provocation. We are not ready to talk in the way of the ultimatums."" He also warned there would be ""answers from the Russian side - in diplomacy there is always reciprocity"". Mrs May told the House of Commons the UK had ""no disagreement with the people of Russia"" and had hoped for a better relationship with the post-Soviet country. But, she added: ""It is tragic that President Putin has chosen to act in this way."" The Prime Minister insisted the Government would ""not tolerate the threat to life to British people"" on UK soil of a nerve agent attack, as she revealed the US, Germany and France had pledged co-operation in responding to ""this barbaric act"". Mrs May also welcomed support from NATO and the EU as she insisted the Government will push for action at the United Nations Security Council, while also working with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the Salisbury attack ""an appalling act of violence"", adding: ""Nerve agents are abominable if used in any war - it is utterly reckless to use them in a civilian environment."" But he asked whether Mrs May agreed it is ""essential to maintain a robust dialogue with Russia"" while suspending high-level contact. He also said the UK should ""urge our international allies to join us and call on Russia to reveal without delay full details of its chemical weapons programme"". Mr Corbyn was then heckled by Tory MPs as he expressed ""huge regret"" that there had been cuts of 25% to the UK's diplomatic capacity in the last five years. Responding to the Labour leader, Mrs May told Mr Corbyn: ""It is clear from the conversations I have had with allies that we have a consensus with our allies, it was clear from the remarks that were made by backbenchers across the whole of this House on Monday that there is a consensus across the backbenches of this House. ""I am only sorry that the consensus does not go as far as the Right Honourable gentleman, who could have taken the opportunity - as the UK Government has done - to condemn the culpability of the Russian state."" After the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford committed his party to ""working constructively with the Government"" over the ""unlawful"" attack by Russia against the UK, Chancellor Philip Hammond told Mr Blackford ""send him a copy"" as he pointed towards Mr Corbyn. Another Tory MP was heard to shout: ""That's how you do it."" Mr Corbyn's spokesman later threatened a deeper row when he refused to say if the Labour leader believed Russia was at fault. The spokesman said: ""The Government has access to information and intelligence on this matter which others don't. ""However, also there is a history in relation to weapons of mass destruction and intelligence which is problematic, to put it mildly. ""So, I think the right approach is to seek the evidence to follow international treaties, particularly in relation to prohibitive chemical weapons."" Asked to comment on the remarks, the Prime Minister told the House of Commons she was ""surprised and shocked"". She added: ""It is very clear from the remarks that have been made by backbenchers from the Labour Party that they will be equally concerned by that remark."" Mrs May spoke after Labour MPs, for the second time this week, again hinted at frustration with their party leader's response to the Salisbury attack."
2018-03-14,A dog has died after its owner was ordered to put it in an overhead locker during a flight.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/anger-after-dog-dies-in-planes-overhead-locker-11289101,"The dog had been brought on board the United Airlines flight in a small carrier designed to fit under a seat but the woman carrying it was reportedly told to put it in the locker. Passengers said they heard the dog barking during the flight from Houston to New York on Monday night. But they didn't know the dog had died until the plane landed at LaGuardia Airport, around three and a half hours later. In a statement, United described the death as a ""tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin"". Passenger Maggie Gremminger wrote on Twitter after the flight: ""It was clearly a dog and while the customers was adamant about leaving it under the set, the attendant pushed her to (put the dog in the overhead locker). ""At the end of the flight, the woman found her dog, deceased. ""She sat in the airplane aisle on the floor crying and all of surrounding passengers were utterly stunned."" Ms Gremminger added: ""I am disgusted and traumatised."" The woman, Catelina Robledo, had also been travelling with her daughter, Sophia Ceballos, 11. Sophia said they had been told the dog would be in the way before it was put in the locker and the attendant ""closed it like it was a bag"". She said that, after the flight landed, her mother had got up and got the bag. ""She took him out and she's like 'Kokito, Kokito wake up!'"" United spokesman Charles Hobart said the flight attendant had told the dog's owner to put the pet carrier in the overhead locker because it was partly obstructing the aisle. He said it was unclear why the carrier was not placed under a seat. United's own policy on pets in cabins states that an animal's cabin ""must fit completely under the seat in front of the customer and remain there at all times"". The airline is investigating the incident but the dog owner and her two children had had their flights refunded, along with the fee they had paid to bring their pet on board, Mr Hobart added. Eighteen animals died while being transported on United last year, against six cases on other US carriers combined, according to Department of Transportation figures."
2018-03-14,"For a lot of people, the Prudential is synonymous with the ""Man from the Pru"", the friendly door-to-door agent who, for almost 150 years, collected insurance premiums from millions of Britons.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/prudential-demerger-to-result-in-two-ftse-100-companies-11289505,"These days though, you are more likely to find the ""Man from the Pru"" in a fast-growing Asian market like Indonesia or Malaysia, with doorstep agents having been phased out in the UK in 2001. Because this is a business that, more than a decade ago, pivoted away from its home market to focus on the bigger - as it saw it - opportunities in Asia and the United States. It is a bet that has paid off. In Asia and the US, the Pru's customer numbers have almost doubled since 2006, while its assets under management have multiplied eight-fold and its operating profits six-fold. As a business, in that time, the Pru has become immensely more profitable and much more international. This has led to growing speculation in the City that the Pru was less-than committed to the UK. The cynics said it retained its more mature UK business simply to generate cash that could be reinvested in those faster-growing global markets. That argument will soon no longer be valid, as the Pru today announced it is breaking itself into two separate UK-listed and headquartered companies, both of which are expected to be members of the FTSE-100. The first, M&G Prudential, will consist of the Pru's existing operations in the UK and Europe, including M&G, the insurer's fund management arm. The second, Prudential plc, will comprise the Pru's operations in Asia, the US and its nascent businesses in Africa. Shares of the Pru have shot up by more than 5% on news of the break-up - which growing numbers of investors are thought to have been demanding. The international business, Prudential plc, can look forward to a racier stock market rating as investors price in its stronger growth prospects shorn off its more mature European businesses. Those growth prospects are indeed spectacular. Mike Wells, the Pru's chief executive, who will take that role in the demerged business, pointed out on Wednesday that Asia and the US have a population of 5 billion people, while accounting for $40trn worth of GDP. He added: ""In Asia, the working age population grows by one million every month, and these people are under-protected. ""The gap between the insurance cover that the people in the region have and what they need to maintain their family's living standards is estimated to be ¬£35trn."" The growth prospects are no less dazzling in the US where the Baby Boomers, the wealthiest generation in history, are beginning to retire. Mr Wells pointed out that, in the US, 10,000 people will retire each day during the next 20 years - creating huge demand for ""income protection policies"" that provide them with a decent income during their retirement. The domestic business, M&G Prudential, can also expect a re-rating. For the first time in years, it will not be competing for capital with international businesses perceived as having better growth prospects, but will be competing instead with local rivals for investment. As a stand-alone European business, without the dazzle of American and Asian businesses, it will be easier for investors to compare it with the likes of Aviva and Legal & General. The team running the business, led by John Foley, will also be keen to show that, just because it is based in Europe, this too is a business capable of growth. The Pru's biggest rival, Aviva, has been arguing for some time that where an insurance company is based is now less important than the products and services in which it specialises. The numbers unveiled today bear that out - the businesses that will form M&G Prudential already have seven million customers in the UK and Europe and have some ¬£351bn worth of assets under management. In the next five years, Mr Wells pointed out, the UK asset management market, currently worth ¬£7trn, is expected to expand by a further ¬£2.5trn. In continental Europe, the market is worth ‚Ç¨14trn and is expected to grow by a further ‚Ç¨3.5trn during the next five years. Ultimately, though, M&G Prudential may be seeking comparisons not with the likes of Legal & General and Aviva, but more with Standard Life Aberdeen, which is reinventing itself as a specialist fund management group. To that end, the Pru also announced today it was offloading a ""back book"" of annuities (products that guarantee a set income in retirement) worth ¬£12bn and covering 400,000 individual policies, reducing its dependence on its traditional business of administering the retirement policies of customers. It would be no surprise if, in due course, this business were simply renamed M&G - the name of the fund manager the Pru bought in 1999."

""He passed away very peacefully, she was with him. We are all shedding a tear. It wasn't completely unexpected, he's been ill for several weeks in hospital,"" he said. Bowen achieved cult status in Bullseye, a game show where contestants threw darts and answered basic general knowledge questions to progress. We are devastated to announce that our friend & Bullseye presenter Jim Bowen has passed away. Our love and thoughts go out to Jim's family.Thank you for all the memories Jim, you will be greatly missed.Andrew & Laura Woodx pic.twitter.com/2ONzDlzptF His catchphrases, such as ""super, smashing, great"", ""let's see what you could have won"" and ""you can't beat a bit of Bully"" made him a household name. The show, which ran between 1981 and 1995, was watched by over 12 million viewers, and was especially popular among students. It attracted a peak audience of almost 19 million viewers on Boxing Day 1989. Born Peter Williams in Heswall on the Wirral in 1937, Bowen was adopted as a baby by Annie and Joe Whittaker from Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire, taking the name James Whittaker. At 15 years old, having left Accrington Grammar School, he worked as a dustman in Blackburn for a short time and completed national service before becoming a PE teacher. At training college, he met his future wife Phyllis and they married in 1959. They later had two children, Susan and Peter. He rose to become a deputy headmaster but a stint in amateur dramatics gave him a thirst for being on stage. In the 1960s he switched careers and took up stand-up comedy under the stage name Jim Bowen and soon ended up performing on television. As well as Bullseye, Bowen also had a number of TV acting roles, including in Last Of The Summer Wine, Muck And Brass, Jonathan Creek, The Grimleys, and the second series of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights. He also presented a morning show on BBC Radio Lancashire from 1999 to 2003. In 2011, Bowen, also known as Alf in the Tetley Bitter adverts, said he had learned to ""appreciate all the things in life"" after suffering two strokes. In 2005, 2007 and 2008, he appeared at The Edinburgh Festival, with a show featuring tales about his time in show business and Bullseye stories.

RIP Stephen Hawking Professor Hawking's first attempt to write a popular book about the physics and the universe's beginnings was a massive success, spending 237 weeks on the Sunday Times best sellers list. His life was retold in the 2014 film The Theory Of Everything, which starred Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. Professor Hawking, who became renowned for his sense of humour, also performed cameos in the US comedy series The Big Bang Theory as well as The Simpsons and Star Trek. But in between his screen appearances, his amazing mind tackled everything from the origins of the universe to the possibility of time travel and the mystery of the solar system's black holes. He once described belief in a God who intervenes in the universe ""to make sure the good guys win or get rewarded in the next life"" as wishful thinking. ""But one can't help asking the question: Why does the universe exist?"" he said in 1991. ""I don't know an operational way to give the question or the answer, if there is one, a meaning.

There have been warnings, most prominently from Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary, that flights could be grounded in that eventuality because UK operators would no longer come under the single market for aviation. Which? said it was particularly important for customers booking a non-package holiday in Europe to ensure they would not be left in limbo as they would not be covered by current repatriation guarantees under the Abta scheme. Its investigation found a very mixed picture. It found Tui, Jet2 and On the Beach ""failed to provide any reassurance that any information would be communicated upfront"". Thomas Cook, it said, had amended its terms and conditions but they stated that it would not provide compensation or reimburse expenses if it was to change the circumstances of a booking due to airspace closures. Expedia told researchers it believed passengers would be entitled to compensation in the event of disruption, although it was yet to sell post-March 2019 holidays. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of airline industry body Airlines UK, said a deal to cover aviation was achievable to avoid any threat of disruption. He said: ""Just as they do today, airlines will continue to comply with all legal requirements, paying compensation quickly when it is due and making it easy for passengers to claim.""

Facebook said both had recently been given ""a written final warning"" but ""they have continued to post content that violates our community standards."" The social network added: ""We do not do this lightly, but they have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the pages from our service."" :: The far right - What is Britain First? Britain First's Facebook page had two million followers globally, and the content in violation of Facebook's standards is understood to have included a photo of the group's leaders with the caption ""Islamaphobic and Proud"". Other content violations included an image with a caption comparing Muslim immigrants with animals, and multiple videos posted deliberately to incite hateful comments against Muslims. Last week, Golding, 36, and Fransen, 32, were found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. The ban means their group will not be permitted to set up an official Facebook page in the future. Facebook added: ""We are an open platform for all ideas and political speech goes to the heart of free expression. But political views can and should be expressed without hate. ""People can express robust and controversial opinions without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are. ""There are times though when legitimate political speech crosses the line and becomes hate speech designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society."" Twitter banned the leaders last December, months prior to Facebook's crackdown. That ban came after the group's inflammatory content was retweeted by Donald Trump, who subsequently said he was willing to apologise for apparently endorsing the group."

A consultation paper on the plans has been launched by Communities Secretary Sajid Javid with ¬£50m of Government money. It follows the 2016 Casey Review which warned that social cohesion cannot be taken for granted in a multicultural UK. Mr Javid said: ""Britain can rightly claim to be one of the most successful diverse societies in the world. ""But we cannot ignore the fact that in too many parts of our country, communities are divided, preventing people from taking full advantage of the opportunities that living in modern Britain offers. ""Successive governments have refused to deal with the integration challenges we face head on, preferring to let people muddle along and live isolated and separated lives."" The initiative is to be piloted in five areas - Blackburn, Bradford, Peterborough, Walsall and the London borough of Waltham Forest - and will develop local integration plans allowing new strategies to be tested as the programme develops. The proposals include: :: A new community-based English language programme, with a network of conversation clubs and support for councils to improve provision of tuition. :: Personalised skills training to help women from ""isolated"" communities into work. :: Measures to ensure young people have the opportunity to mix and form lasting relationships with those from different backgrounds. :: Promotion of British values across the school curriculum. :: Increased take-up of the National Citizen Service. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""We want to make sure that all children learn the values that underpin our society - including fairness, tolerance and respect. ""These are values that help knit our communities together, which is why education is at the heart of this strategy. ""It's also important that children are taught in a safe environment and that we can act quickly if children are at risk or being encouraged to undermine these values."" Polling data released by think-tank British Future suggested a majority of voters would back schools teaching pluralistic British values (76%), more support to learn English (67%) and a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime and prejudice (79%). Around 63% said the Government should use national events like St George's Day, St David's Day and St Andrew's Day to bring people together. British Future director Sunder Katwala said: ""Integration isn't just about British Muslims - it's an issue for all of us. ""So it's welcome that this green paper moves on from the Casey Review and broadens the integration debate.

In some places, frosts are forecast to be ""severe"" and there is a chance the snow could spread to central, eastern and southern parts of the UK. Some snow showers could also be seen in the West, the Met Office has said. Yellow warnings have been issued from midday on Wednesday to the same time on Thursday in Northern Ireland because of the likelihood of persistent and occasionally heavy rain and the resulting danger of flooding. In Cornwall and Devon, the Met Office said journey times may be affected by downpours and a there was also a flood warning until around midnight on Wednesday. That band of wet weather is expected to move northeastwards across the UK but to weaken. The sudden drop in temperature at the weekend, with winds from the east, have led to the weather phenomenon being dubbed the ""Beast from the East Two"" after a similar front brought freezing temperatures and heavy snow to the UK in early March. Some European forecasters claim snow will hit the South East and East Midlands on Sunday morning. But Sky weather forecasters say it is too early to say how much is likely to fall. Weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""Very cold conditions are expected to spread westwards across the UK and Ireland later on Friday and through this weekend as easterly winds develop. ""As a result some places may see temperatures fall to only a few degrees above freezing - this most likely across the east of the UK. There will also be a significant wind chill, making it feel colder than the temperatures suggest. ""There has been talk of snow as well, and at this stage Sunday is the most likely day for snow showers. Areas most at risk are central, southern and eastern parts of the UK. ""However it is too early to know how much may accumulate, but current forecasts suggest there is only a low risk of disruption."" The UK is not the only part of the world to be facing unseasonable weather two weeks after the meteorological start of spring, with the third major storm in two weeks burying some towns in the American North East under up to 2ft feet (60cm) of snow on Tuesday."

NHS digital, which manages the register, says 39% of NHS providers and 24% of private clinics may be putting women at risk by not adding their data. A woman's details can only be added with their consent, so NHS Digital is now asking women who have implants to make sure their surgeon has registered the details. Tom Denwood of NHS Digital said: ""The development of the Breast and Cosmetic Implant Registry marked a major step forward in improving patient safety for those undergoing breast implant surgery. ""Now we are encouraging patients to ask their surgeon to submit their data to the registry and we hope this will lead to an increase in contributions. ""The more information that is contained within this important tool, the more it will benefit patients."" PIP breast implants were withdrawn from the UK in 2010 after it was found they had been fraudulently manufactured with unapproved silicone gel.

Competition in the sector remains fierce given the scramble among the major chains to grow their customer bases at a time when discounters continue to expand.

While this excludes the majority of England, the Aurora Borealis could be seen at this time of year over Wednesday night in the northernmost part of the country, localised entirely within the polewards part of the sky. NOAA also warned that the electromagnetic storm could result in weak power grid fluctuations, and could also have a minor impact on satellite operations.

""We expect a storm of this magnitude might be visible in Scotland and parts of northern England and Ireland, but could extend further south if it's stronger than predicted. ""For the best possible chance to see the aurora, look out for clear, dark skies free of light pollution. Northward facing coastlines and high up rural areas tend to be good spots for aurora spotting."" Last September, two powerful solar flares caused brilliant Northern Lights in higher latitudes and disrupted radio communications over large areas of Earth. This week's solar storm did not originate from a solar flare, however, but from a coronal hole - a region where the surface of the sun is dark. Coronal holes are associated with ""open"" magnetic field lines and are where the high-speed solar wind originates as the holes allow particles to stream out into space. A wave of these particles are expected to reach Earth on Wednesday and give the Northern Lights a boost in electromagnetic activity."

Four Soviet diplomats have been kidnapped - one is killed. Muslim extremists were trying to pressure Moscow to rein in pro-Syrian militiamen from shelling their positions in the Lebanese city of Tripoli. What happens next is a lesson in the efficiency of brutality - and it's from a KGB textbook that Russia's successor security agencies still studiously read. :: LIVE - Russian diplomats excluded by UK The KGB's response to the kidnapping was ruthlessly elegant. They snatched a senior Shia cleric off the streets. They then cut off his genitals and sent his penis to the extremist group behind the kidnappings. The cleric was then murdered with a single bullet to the brain and his body was dumped with a message: others will meet this fate if our people are not released. The three surviving Russian diplomats were quickly freed; dropped off outside the Soviet embassy. The incident is worth remembering because it tells you everything you need to know about the rules of the playground that Vladimir Putin is operating in. It could be a parable on the psychology of violence - just how far are you prepared to go? I don't know if the Russian leader has read William Golding's Lord Of The Flies. Perhaps he doesn't need to, as he already understands the dynamics at work. Golding was a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth's Grammar School, which is situated in Salisbury's cathedral close. It's just a short and scenic walk from where the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter took place. The choristers leaving the cathedral provided the imagery for his most famous work and his observations of pupil behaviour no doubt fuelled the central idea of the novel - what happens when authority and law and order break down. Mr Putin sees the same thing happening in the West and is actively trying to accelerate it in order to take advantage. Because of trouble in the EU, Brexit and an increasingly isolationist America, the anchor points are becoming untethered and Britain is the weak link. Anyone who views the attack as only state-sponsored revenge, wrought on a dissident former agent, is naive. Russia's state killers are good at their work; they don't generally make mistakes. If they'd only wanted Skripal and his daughter dead, that end could have been achieved far more simply. A nerve agent was used to send a message to the British government and also to precipitate a crisis - it was a poisonous and highly toxic calling card. All of the measures that Theresa May has at her disposal and may use have already been gamed into the outcome. Kicking out the Russian elite, for instance, may actually be desired by the Kremlin. It is a sore point that the country's wealthiest use London and the UK's private school system with such passion - if it's so great, why not stay in Russia? And further sanctions, or asset freezes, simply reinforce the Russian narrative that the enemy is at the gates. As citizens, we, of course, are quite naturally worried about nerve agents being used on our streets but we should also be aware that other stuff maybe swirling under the surface. If this was an attack orchestrated by the Russian state, did it come out of the blue? What games are our security services playing? Is this tit for tat? And are we just not aware of the ""tat""? The embarrassing Spy Rock scandal in 2006, which exposed British attempts at espionage in Moscow, is a case in point. From the Kremlin's viewpoint, trying to recruit Russians to spy is almost an act of war; as is the expansion of the EU into Eastern Europe and the promise of NATO membership to former Soviet republics. This is not to mitigate what has happened but to point out that in this game there are no umpires - and Britain needs to understand that, if it doesn't already. It has made me think, on a personal level, of an incident that happened over 10 years ago now. My car was clamped outside Ealing station - I wasn't even parked and was still in the vehicle at the time. I didn't have any money, or cards on me, so the car was towed away - I was angry. The next day I went to the compound where it had been taken and the man on duty told me I had to pay ¬£275. I had the key in my hand, the car door on the driver's side was open and I said to him: ""What's to stop me just getting in and driving off."" At which point he looked at me coldly, replying without emotion and in a calm voice, saying: ""You could but I don't think its worth one of us losing an eye over."" I paid the money and left. While I was bigger than the man and may have won a physical confrontation, I was not prepared to accept the possible cost of such a fight. I like my eyes and had a job and a future to consider. And that brings me back to Vladimir Putin. Is the UK prepared to lose an eye in this clash with Moscow? Because, just like in Beirut back in 1986, there are no rules in this game."

While viewing prototypes for the wall, he said: ""They have a lot of problems in Mexico, they have a lot of problems over there, they have the cartels ""We're fighting the cartels and we are fighting them hard, nobody fought them like we fought them. ""If you didn't have a wall system it would be bedlam I imagine."" He added: ""The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas, they won't tell you that, but we said no we won't do it until we build the whole wall. ""There are certain areas where they are really wanting us to build a wall because people are complaining, people are pouring in."" Mr Trump flew to San Diego to view several prototypes measuring 30ft-tall (9m), and asked which of them would be hardest to climb. He noted the wall would have to be see-through, even though he would prefer it to be fully concrete. He said: ""The ones that work the best aren't necessarily the most expensive, that's what I like."" Mr Trump also criticised California governor Jerry Brown, saying he was doing a ""terrible"" job. He added that he had a ""great relationship"" with the Mexican President, who he said was a good negotiator. On his way to the viewing, Mr Trump tweeted: ""California's sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!"" Speaking later at California's Marine Corps Air Station, the President suggested there could be a ""space force"" akin to the country's air force. He also said ""very soon we're going to Mars"", adding ""you wouldn't even be thinking about it"" if Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential election. Sky News' US correspondent Greg Milam said Mr Trump's visit came after he had ""upended the news agenda"" by firing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He said: ""[The President] actually tweeted on the plane that this wall would pay for itself by cutting crime - well, he's not got Congress or Mexico yet to pay for it so it might be handy if it pays for itself. ""But he believes that whatever wall they choose needs to be see-through, he says. He believes people will stand the other side throwing drugs over and if you can't see that, it's dangerous. ""He's coming to a place that he hasn't visited as president, where he is massively unpopular, where he lost by 4m votes in the election and a place where he faces huge resistance. But he thinks his core still believes in that wall and still wants it."""

The child poverty rate for single-parent households is predicted to rise from 37% to 62%. The report also found that women, ethnic minorities and disabled people would be disproportionately affected. Welfare reforms such as disability benefit changes, reductions in Universal Credit rates and working-age benefit changes said to be behind the findings. EHRC chairman David Isaac said: ""It's disappointing to discover that the reforms we have examined negatively affect the most disadvantaged in our society. ""It's even more shocking that children - the future generation - will be the hardest hit and that so many will be condemned to start life in poverty. ""We cannot let this continue if we want a fairer Britain."" :: Single-parent families let down as poverty rises Specific impacts highlighted include: :: Households with at least one disabled adult and a disabled child will lose more than ¬£6,500 a year, or 13% of their annual income. :: Bangladeshi households will lose around ¬£4,400 a year, in comparison to white households or those with adults of differing ethnicity, which will lose between ¬£500 and ¬£600 on average :: Lone parents will lose an average of ¬£5,250 a year, almost one-fifth of their annual income :: Women will lose about ¬£400 per year on average, while men will only lose ¬£30 The EHRC has called on the government to review the level of certain welfare benefits. A government spokesman said: ""Our commitment to equality and fairness has seen child poverty drop, inequality drop and female employment reach a record high. ""We spend ¬£90bn a year on welfare to support those who need it most and this report does not take into account many of the important changes that Government has introduced since 2010. ""Automatic enrolment pension saving and near record employment are just two issues which contribute enormously to people's lives, but are not reflected in the analysis."""
2018-03-14,"Unilever, the maker of Dove shampoo and Marmite, is set to bring the curtain down on nearly a century of corporate history by axing its UK headquarters‚Äé and consolidating its legal base in the Netherlands.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/boards-of-dove-maker-unilever-finalise-move-to-axe-uk-hq-11289411,"Sky News has learnt that directors of Unilever‚Äé's dual British and Dutch holding companies are meeting in the coming hours to finalise the landmark decision. An announcement will be made on Thursday - or possibly late on Wednesday - according to City sources who cautioned that the formal verdict had not yet been rubber-stamped by Unilever's boards. Unilever - created in 1929 by the merger of Britain's Lever Brothers and Margarine Unie of the Netherlands - ‚Äéowns many of the world's best-known consumer goods brands, including Magnum ice cream and Persil detergents. It is the third-largest company in the FTSE 100 index, with a market value of approximately ¬£113bn during Wednesday's trading session. Run by Paul Polman, its Dutch chief executive, Unilever has been reviewing its dual corporate structure‚Äé since an unwanted ¬£115bn takeover approach from the US-based food giant Kraft Heinz fell apart just over a year ago. Ministers, including Theresa May, have been briefed on the impending decision to unify under a sole headquarters in Rotterdam, which will represent a major blow to the Government. Unilever's announcement is expected to come less than 48 hours after Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, sought to portray the UK as an attractive inward investment destination in his update on the public finances. Assuming the decision is disclosed on Thursday, it will come on the same day that the Prime Minister meets a group of leading figures from the business community‚Äé to discuss Brexit-related concerns as well as the broader economy. Ministers have fought a rearguard action in recent weeks to try to avert the prospect of Unilever scrapping its UK base. Unilever's decision will be seized upon by opponents of Brexit, who are likely to cite it as evidence of the damage being wreaked on British jobs and investment. ‚ÄéThe precise impact on its UK-based workforce was unclear on Wednesday‚Äé, however, and Unilever is expected to seek to downplay the UK's departure from the European Union in its announcement. The company will also emphasise its continuing commitment to its UK operations, according to insiders. Dutch corporate laws which allow Netherlands-incorporated companies to adopt ‚Äé""poison pill"" defences to thwart hostile takeovers have been a major factor in the year-long review, according to people close to the company. Unilever employs about 7,500 people in the UK, with its main base on Victoria Embankment in Central London, while roughly 3,000 people work for the company in the Netherlands‚Äé. The majority of its UK-based jobs are unlikely to be relocated, with the company's British operations regarded as a centre of excellence ‚Äéfor marketing and other corporate functions. Nevertheless, one leading corporate figure described the decision as ""totemic"". It has been a particularly sensitive exercise for Unilever because of the extent to which last year's takeover approach raised fears about widespread UK job cuts, with Kraft Heinz portrayed as a rapacious corporate raider more concerned with cost cutting than innovation. More than 100 jobs have already been relocated by Unilever from London to Rotterdam as part of the merger of its food and refreshment units, whose brands also include PG Tips. While Unilever will retain its primary listing in London, as well as listings in the Netherlands and the US, it will no longer be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE-100 index because its domicile will be outside the UK. That will affect the ability of fund managers who track the index to hold Unilever's shares, although active UK-based fund managers will continue to be able to trade the stock. The unification of its headquarters will be among the last major decisions overseen by Mr Polman, who Sky News revealed last autumn would step down next year. Since fending off Kraft Heinz's advances, Mr Polman has sold the spreads division which held brands such as Flora and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, while acquiring businesses in faster-growing consumer product categories such as the online-based Dollar Shave Club for $1bn last year and Mae Terra, a Brazilian organic food company. Unilever declined to comment on Wednesday."
2018-03-14,"Professor Stephen Hawking was one of the most brilliant scientists of his, or any other, generation.  ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/stephen-hawking-the-man-who-made-astro-physics-understandable-11289131,"But it was his ability to explain the most complex of ideas in terms that anyone could understand that brought fame far beyond the scientific community. The renowned physicist died on Wednesday in Cambridge at age 76. Published in 1988, A Brief History Of Time became a huge hit, selling 10 million copies and being translated into 35 languages. Aimed at a non-scientific audience it attempted to explain some fundamental principles of physics and answer some of the oldest questions of mankind; how, why and where the universe began, how it works and where it will end. In a simple, elegant style it covered the nature of time, gravity, black holes, the Big Bang and the physicist's holy grail - ""the theory of everything"" an all-encompassing, coherent theoretical framework of physics that fully explains and links together all physical aspects of the universe. ""My original aim was to write a book that would sell on airport bookstalls,"" he said at the time. ""In order to make sure it was understandable I tried the book out on my nurses. I think they understood most of it."" The Theory Of Everything became the title of the 2014 film that charted Prof Hawking's early life and how he came to terms with motor neurone disease, the crippling disease that gradually paralysed him. He was confined for most of his life to a wheelchair. As his condition worsened, he had to resort to speaking through a voice synthesiser and communicating by moving his eyebrows. His popularity brought him guest appearances in TV shows such as The Simpsons and the Big Bang Theory, but he was above all a true scientific genius. Building on the work of scientists such as Einstein he defined and refined our understanding of the Big Bang, gravity black holes, entropy, general relativity and quantum theory. Stephen William Hawking was born in Oxford on 8 January 1942, the eldest of four children. The family's home was in north London but his mother lived in Oxford because London was being bombed during the Second World War. He was given a scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, where he studied natural sciences. Prof Hawking's father was a doctor of tropical medicine and wanted his son to follow him into the profession - but he wanted to be a mathematician so natural sciences was an agreed compromise. Prof Hawking contracted motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 1963 at the age of 21. In his 2013 memoir My Brief History, he recalled: ""At the time, I thought my life was over and that I would never realise the potential I felt I had. ""But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life."" Doctors gave him just two years to live after his diagnosis, but he went on to study cosmology at Cambridge. He was given more than a dozen honorary degrees and was awarded the CBE in 1982. Prof Hawking was twice married and divorced. He married undergraduate Jane Wilde in July 1965 and the couple had three children, Robert, Lucy and Timothy. The pair divorced in 1990, and in 1995 he married Elaine Mason, a nurse whose ex-husband had designed the electronic voice synthesiser that allowed Prof Hawking to communicate. For him, the search was almost a religious quest - he said finding a ""theory of everything"" would allow mankind to ""know the mind of God."" ""A complete, consistent unified theory is only the first step: our goal is a complete understanding of the events around us, and of our own existence,"" he wrote."
2018-03-14,A Russian chemical weapons scientist has told Sky News that people exposed to even tiny traces of the nerve agent used to attack a spy and his daughter in Salisbury could be in danger of developing symptoms in years to come.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/spy-poisoning-novichok-inventor-says-hundreds-could-be-at-risk-for-years-11287880,"Dr Vil Mirzayanov is a chemist who ran the technical counter-intelligence department in Russia's chemical weapons institute. He helped make ""novichok"", the class of nerve agents the British government says was used to poison defected spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The doctor said that even minuscule amounts could affect victims, and that symptoms could develop ""in years"". But responding to an inquiry from Sky News, Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Medical Director at Public Health England, said: ""PHE has been working very closely with the police and national experts on chemical weapons since the start of the incident and our risk assessment is based on knowledge of the chemical used. ""Our advice remains that the risk to the general public is low."" :: Public faces 'low risk' after chemical attack, health officials insist More than two decades ago, Dr Mirzayanov became so concerned about novichok that he blew the whistle and fled to America, where he campaigned to get all chemical weapons banned. He spoke to Sky News at his home in Princeton in New Jersey. He said: ""It's the same as nerve gas but 10 times, at least 10 times, more powerful."" The scientist emphasised that Novichok was designed to do ""irreparable"" damage to the human body. He said it would leave those exposed to significant doses, like Mr Skripal and his daughter, as ""invalids"" who would need medical assistance for the rest of their lives. :: LIVE: Deaths to be re-examined for Russia links He spoke of a colleague who died after accidental exposure to a small amount in his lab. ""That's it,"" he said. ""No cure."" Dr Mirzayanov also talked about the risk of trace contamination to hundreds of members of the British public who may have been in the vicinity of the attack around the time it happened. He described ""headaches, difficulty thinking, and also co-ordination (issues), a lot of problems"". When asked about the advice given by Public Health England, including washing clothes and wiping down belongings, he said: ""Sure it's useful, but not enough, absolutely not."" He said that anyone who may have been exposed should be offered ""permanent medical surveillance"". :: Novichok nerve agent: What exactly is it? Dr Mirzayanov said that novichok, which means ""newcomer"", can be made from two separate compounds similar to chemicals used in agriculture, and which crucially are not on the chemical weapons convention banned list. In that way, he said, novichok could be transported to the site of an attack in its constituent parts without detection, and once assembled the tiny micro particles could easily be deployed using an aerosol, spray, liquid or wipe. He thinks it is likely that the attack was carried out using a spray, which maximises the chances of a victim getting the nerve agent on their skin and also inhaling it. Dr Mirzayanov described the secret development of the powerful nerve agent as ""a plot against the world"" designed to maintain chemical weapons capability without having to declare it to the international community. :: Russia 'highly likely' to be behind Salisbury attack The Russian government has denied any involvement in the Salisbury poisonings, but Dr Mirzayanov says that only Russia could have carried out such an attack, characterising novichok as a ""fingerprint"". He said the use of it on British soil was his ""worst nightmare."""
2018-03-14,Theresa May issued Russia with an ultimatum and deadline and Russia has ignored her.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/salisbury-spy-mystery-may-and-britains-credibility-at-stake-after-ultimatum-to-russia-11288995,"A foreign power has conspired to kill people on British soil for at least the second time in a decade - this time with a nerve agent that only Russia owns and can develop. Theresa May's credibility is at stake. But so is Britain's. Former diplomats are in no doubt she must now announce actions that match the rhetoric she used on Monday. Sir Christopher Meyer was Britain's ambassador in Washington and also worked in Moscow. He has told Sky News the UK will be unable to act diplomatically ""until the police and Home Office office point the finger conclusively at Russia, and they may never do so"". ""If I were in the Foreign Office right now I imagine there would be a lot of contingency planning against the possibility that Russia is the guilty party, in which case you can come up with a menu of things you'd do against the Russian state and then in the other column, how would they retaliate, because they will,"" he said. ""There will be a calculation of benefit and cost if it is expected officially of carrying it out. ""I used to run the department in the Foreign Office that was responsible for this kind of thing, the position from which I would start is to say that a state assassination on British territory is utterly intolerable and just about the worst thing one state can do on the territory of another state. ""Whatever the cost, the response should be pretty draconian."" The Prime Minister will have been given what diplomats like to call a suite of options to choose from. At the more extreme end she could expel every Russian diplomat and suspected intelligence operative in the country. It has happened before in 1971. The more hawkish among her advisers would recommend throwing out the Russian ambassador, too. That would send a clear message but sever relations with a permanent member of the UN Security Council and increasingly important global player. It would be far more effective if it happens in concert with Britain's allies. British cabinet ministers are consulting with their American counterparts and others on what help they can possibly expect. Their efforts have been rewarded with encouraging words from European chancelleries and eventually the US government but what we have not seen yet is a co-ordinated response...a communique promising united action and co-ordinated sanctions. The Prime Minister will be advised by some to hurt Putin and his circle where it hurts - financially. Russian oligarchs famously use London as a playground to spend and park their money. Russian opposition leader Alexander Navalny has tweeted his advice to Theresa May naming three oligarchs with London connections in particular to target. The British Government could go after their assets. They could also restrict their visas or deny them. That always runs the risk of the oligarchs and tycoons finding a new place to take their money. Multinational co-operation would make those kinds of sanctions more effective. Theresa May will have been encouraged by the promise from Donald Trump to stand by Britain ""all the way"", but less encouraged by the suspicion he sacked his Secretary of State at least partly because Rex Tillerson linked Russia far more explicitly with the Salisbury poisoning than his boss was prepared to at first. Brexit has coloured Britain's relations with its European allies and may complicate the effort to co-ordinate a response across the continent. There is undoubtedly less appetite to stand alongside the UK now it is heading out of the EU. Then there is the risk of retaliation. If Vladimir Putin is capable of attempting an assassination using a nerve agent in the middle of provincial Britain, what else might he try? A cyberattack, for instance, targeting British commerce or public infrastructure is a chilling prospect and thought to be well within the capability of the Russians. The path ahead for Theresa May is not without peril but then if - as her police chiefs and spies seem to believe - this was a state sponsored attack on the UK, she has little choice but take it. Otherwise they will be telling her she will be inviting more such attacks in future. Theresa May warned Russia in November her government knew what it was up to and it would not succeed. If she is incapable of punishing Russia in a way that hurts, she will have proven herself and the UK as weak and that is in the long term dangerous for our national security."
2018-03-14,Stephen Hawking was best known for his extraordinary mind and inspiring people to look beyond our planet and better understand the universe.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180314161152/https://news.sky.com/story/stephen-hawking-the-genius-with-a-funny-side-11289582,"But the brilliant physicist also had a wicked sense of humour. From spinning on the dance floor in his wheelchair to a party he threw for time travellers, Sky News takes a look at some of the more unusual stories from Professor Hawking's remarkable life: He once ""drove over Prince Charles' toes in his wheelchair"" Biographer Kitty Ferguson wrote in her 2013 book ""Stephen Hawking: Unfettered Mind"" that the professor enjoyed weaponising his wheelchair, and targeted the toes of those who annoyed him. Hawking is alleged to have rolled over Prince Charles' feet at an event to celebrate His Royal Highness' induction to the Royal Society. Mrs Ferguson wrote: ""The Prince was intrigued by Hawking's wheelchair, and Hawking, twirling it around to demonstrate its capabilities, carelessly ran over Prince Charles's toes."" She continued: ""People who annoyed him, it was said, found themselves a target."" Mrs Ferguson added: ""One of Hawking's regrets in life was not having an opportunity to run over Margaret Thatcher's toes."" Hawking's driving-style and dance moves are the stuff of legend The young Oxford student had to use crutches after his initial diagnosis in 1963 and long-resisted the use of a wheelchair. When he finally did succumb to four wheels, he later developed a reputation for his wild driving style through the streets of Cambridge where he worked at the university. Rumours circulated that he would deliberately run over students' toes, and he was said to be no stranger to a spin on the dancefloor. A genius take on One Direction After a talk he delivered at the Sydney Opera House he was asked by an audience member about the ""cosmological effect of Zayn Malik leaving One Direction"". Hawking replied: ""Finally, a question about something important. ""My advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics. Because one day there may well be proof of multiple universes. ""It would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies another different universe. And in that universe Zayn is still in One Direction. ""This girl may like to note that in another possible universe she and Zayn are happily married."" Professor Stephen Hawking was a brilliant and extraordinary mind - one of the great scientists of his generation. His courage, humour and determination to get the most from life was an inspiration. His legacy will not be forgotten. He threw a party for time travellers Professor Hawking once carried out an ""experiment"" to prove that time travel is not possible by hosting a party for... time travellers. The professor's point was proven when nobody turned up. He said after hosting: ""I have experimental evidence that time travel is not possible. ""I gave a party for time-travellers, but I didn't send out the invitations until after the party. ""I sat there a long time, but no one came."" The scientist's take on the importance of humour Stephen Hawking told the New York Times in 2004 that ""life would be tragic if it weren't funny"". He told a documentary in 2013: ""Keeping an active mind has been vital to my survival, as has maintaining a sense of humour."" In loving memory of Stephen Hawking. It was an honor to have him on The #BigBangTheory. Thank you for inspiring us and the world. pic.twitter.com/9rWoYqIToy A Brexit gag During ITV's Pride of Britain Awards in 2016, Professor Hawking told Theresa May: ""I deal in tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask me to help with Brexit."" Hawking later said it would be a ""terrible mistake"" to ignore the populism behind the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump. The professor liked a flutter.. and he didn't always back a winner Stephen Hawking placed a bet with US physicist Kip Thorne in 1975 that the cosmic ray source Cygnus X-1 was not a black hole. He conceded that he had lost the argument 15 years later and agreed to pay Thorne the wager - a four-year subscription to the US men's magazine Penthouse. Hawking had requested a four-year subscription to the satire magazine Private Eye if he was the winner. He joined forces with Thorne in 1997 to bet against the physicist John Preskill on the outcome of the ""black hole information"" paradox. Sad to hear about Stephen Hawking. What a remarkable life. His contributions to science will be used as long as there are scientists, and there are many more scientists because of him. He spoke about the value and fragility of human life and civilisation and greatly enhanced both The pair claimed that general relativity made it impossible for black holes to lose information, while Mr Preskill argued the opposite. Prof Hawking announced in 2004 that he was conceding the bet and agreed to pay Mr Preskill the wager, which was an encyclopedia of his choice. Mr Preskill opted for a copy of ""Total Baseball: The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia"". Professor Hawking also lost $100 to Professor Gordon Kane of the University of Michigan in 2012 after betting him that the Higgs Boson would not be discovered. Lapdance clubs and the ""mystery of women"" Prof Hawking was accused of sexism and of being a mysognist after he visited a Stringfellows lap-dancing club in 2003. When asked what he thinks about most during the day, he replied: ""Women. They are a complete mystery."" The Simpsons, Star Trek and a very different Big Bang Theory The physicist appeared on The Simpsons a handful times, at one time praising Homer's theory of a ""donut-shaped"" universe as ""intriguing"" and adding he ""may have to steal it"". The professor also helped explain black holes to Bart and punched Principal Skinner before flying away in a helicopter. He famously appeared on the US sitcom The Bang Bang Theory, when he delivered the put-down: ""What do Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck."" He appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation where he played poker with Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Professor Hawking turned into a Transformer in the UK sketch show Little Britain and killed carer Lou, played by David Walliams. He also made several appearances in the comedy Futurama, and in one episode teamed up with the former US presidential candidate Al Gore to protect the space-time continuum. In a sketch for Red Nose Day he embarked on a quest to find A-list celebrities who could replace his famous computerised voice. Liam Neeson, Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson all auditioned to be his new voice in the hilarious clip. Professor Hawking was unimpressed with the candidates and in the end decided to go with Michael Caine. On aliens The professor famously said of extra-terrestiral life: ""If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans."" A dig at Trump? When asked if he was the most intelligent person in the world, he replied: ""I would never claim this. People who boast about their IQ are losers."" US President Donald Trump has bragged publicly about his IQ on more than one occasion. The professor and the Pope He once revealed that Pope John Paul II had tried to discourage him and other scientists from attending a cosmology conference at the Vatican. The professor later joked at a lecture in Hong Kong that he refrained form telling the Pope he had already delivered his own thoughts on how the universe was created at the conference. He said: ""I didn't fancy the thought of being handed over to the inquisition like Galileo."" Late night humour Last Week Tonight host John Oliver sat down with Prof Hawking for an interview in 2014. John Oliver asked: ""You've stated that there could be an infinite number of parallel universes. ""Does that mean there's a universe out there where I am smarter than you?"" Prof Hawking replied: ""Yes. And also a universe where you're funny."""

Scotland Yard said anti-terror police were investigating his death ""as a precaution because of associations that the man is believed to have had"". But it said there was ""no evidence to suggest a link to the incident in Salisbury"", adding that the death was being treated as ""unexplained"". One of Mr Glushkov's friends was late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who fled to London in 2000 following a row with Vladimir Putin. Mr Glushkov, a former deputy director of the Russian airline Aeroflot, had also worked for Mr Berezovsky's LogoVAZ car company. After Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March 2013, Mr Glushkov told The Guardian he would ""never believe"" his friend took his own life. An inquest into Mr Berezovsky's death recorded an open verdict. Mr Berezovsky was also a friend of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. Police and MI5 are expected to examine allegations that a series of deaths on UK soil, including the Berezovsky case, may be linked to Russia. Sky News' home affairs correspondent, Mark White, said Mr Glushkov's home in New Malden, southwest London, was being treated as a crime scene. Officers were called by the London Ambulance Service at 10.46pm on Monday. Local resident Tracy Broadfield said the police presence was ""very large"". Neighbour Patricia Egan said Mr Glushkov had lived there for several years, describing him as well educated and ""a lovely fellow"". ""His daughter used to call - she was in her 20s I think,"" she added. The body was removed at about 8.15pm on Tuesday and taken away in a private ambulance. Mr Glushkov was arrested in 1999 and put on trial for allegedly embezzling $7m from Aeroflot, and sentenced in 2004 to three years, three months in prison. Russian media said he was granted political asylum in Britain in 2010. But his case was revived by a Moscow court last year, which sentenced him in absentia to eight years for allegedly embezzling more than $122m from Aeroflot. The Russian embassy said it had sought Mr Glushkov's extradition in 2015 ""for committing a number of severe financial offences on the territory of Russia"", but the British government refused."

The 23-year-old's body was found two days later under rubble in the basement of flats in Great Portland Street. Farouk Abdulhak is wanted in connection with her death but remains in Yemen where he fled within hours of Ms Magnussen's disappearance and has refused to return to the UK. As he visited the capital to mark 10 years since her death, her father Petter warned Abdulhak: ""I would like to address this individual, who has continued his sheltered life without any consequences, while my family has continued to suffer the greatest loss a family can suffer. ""I want him to know that 10 years on we continue to pursue justice for Martine. The police continue to investigate, we want you to know that this case will never go away until justice has prevailed."" Police have vowed to continue the investigation and have released a CCTV clip of the pair leaving the nightclub as they continue to appeal for him to hand himself in. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Partridge, from Scotland Yard's murder squad, said: ""A decade on and our ambition remains the same - to obtain justice for Martine. ""With this CCTV now in the public domain, our hope is that the case will not fade from public attention, keeping the spotlight firmly focused upon Farouk Abdulhak. ""Abdulhak fled to another country in the pursuit of continuing with his life and today he remains sheltered and protected in the Yemen. For 10 years this person has been avoiding our requests to return to the UK and assist the investigation. ""We have reached an important milestone, therefore this is the right time to once again appeal personally to Abdulhak to return to the UK. ""He was a guest in our country when the murder of Martine occurred and I believe the responsible thing to do is return. ""If he thought that this case would diminish, or that his wanted status would change over time, then this year's anniversary demonstrates our resolve and that of the Magnussen family to continue to seek justice for Martine."" A post-mortem examination concluded Miss Magnussen's cause of death as compression to the neck. A verdict of unlawful killing was recorded at an inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court on 24 November 2010."

Workers were told the grim news on Wednesday morning alongside details of the first redundancies , involving 67 head office staff in Maidenhead. Moorfields said 25 stores, earmarked for closure before the failure, were due to be shut by close of business on Thursday and the rest would follow at the end of a closing down sale to get rid of existing stock. Joint administrator and Moorfields partner, Simon Thomas, said: ""We have made every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the company's business. ""This process attracted some interest, but ultimately no party has been able to move forward with a formal bid prior to the expiration of the stated deadline.

The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had previously called for prosecutors to look again at her daughter's case after a third court judgement said her daughter was sexually assaulted before her death. Earlier this year David Roberts, the senior coroner for Cumbria, concluded the toddler was assaulted in her father Paul Worthington's double bed at the family home in Barrow-in-Furness in the early hours of December 12, 2012. Mr Roberts decided that Poppi died as a result of being placed in an unsafe sleeping environment which had compromised her breathing. The coroner decided the sexual assault was unconnected to her death. The CPS was given a copy of the coroner's verdict in order to establish whether there were grounds to reconsider the decision not to prosecute. This would only happen if new evidence had emerged at the inquest which was capable of affecting that decision. ""The coroner's verdict has now been considered carefully. No new witness was called at the inquest whose evidence had not already been considered by the CPS prosecutors,"" the CPS said, confirming that there will not be a fourth full review of this case. The lawyer acting for Poppi's mother said she ""was also left disappointed that Poppi's father chose to rely on his right not to answer many questions which may incriminate him at the inquest"". She added: ""While she understands he was entitled to do this, she considers that the coroner's inquiry was frustrated by this."" ""The past five years have been a complete nightmare for her. Not knowing what happened to Poppi on that day, and knowing that there were evidence gathering failures by the police in the very early stages of the investigation has made things even worse. Although she is now closer to the devastating truth, it is likely that she may never get full closure on exactly what happened that night."" Medical opinions gathered during the case have differed starkly, with the Family Court judge saying: ""The pathological evidence revealed a world of small differences and strong feelings."" Cumbria Constabulary has accepted that there were failings in the investigation. The CPS say this meant that sources of evidence one might expect to find in such a case were absent. Three reviews were conducted between March 2015 and November 2016. The three different prosecutors decided that there was not enough evidence to ""provide a realistic prospect of conviction""."

There's a notion in political circles in Russia: if you want something from Putin, don't put him under pressure to get it. He doesn‚Äôt like to be seen as weak. Weak is bad. Weak is the worst possible thing. If he's forced to act under pressure, he doesn't like it because he doesn't want to be seen as being pushed around - that's weak. So if Britain wants Russia to explain itself, tough talk and demands may not be the best way to get answers. Russia doesn't like the language of ultimatums. Britain, France, Germany and the US have issued a joint statement condemning Russia. That‚Äôs strong and the message hasn't been lost in Russia that Britain is serious about all this. But the point is Putin sees himself as stronger and the alliance of the West as utterly predictable - of course they will issue statements and bandy together. Russia has China and friends in the Middle East. Moreover, it's not like it's the first time Russia has faced international condemnation over its actions. Remember: Ukraine and Crimea were not that long ago. Certainly the Kremlin believes it can just ride this out. And let's not forget there's a presidential election looming here. What‚Äôs going on provides Mr Putin with an argument to his electorate: ""Choose me, because the whole world is against us."""

So that's it then - game on. The next move will come from Russia - and it's not a question of if but when that happens and a raft of counter measures is unveiled. Already, Britain's ambassador to Moscow has been hauled back to the Foreign Ministry, no doubt to be told once more Russia pleads not guilty and it's Britain which isn't playing by the rule book. Not the rule book from which Britain points out chemical weapons were banned a long time ago, but the one which Russia is relying on, saying it should be given access to the nerve agent inquiry. Over the water, on the banks of the Moskva River, British staff at the embassy will be wondering which of them will be London-bound within a week and how many can hang on longer. Ordinary Russians simply aren't following the twists and turns of the Skripal saga in the way Britain is. They would hardly notice if England didn't show up to the World Cup, let alone a few ministers or Royals. What about visas? Britain is an expensive country that isn't on the day-to-day holiday list for pretty much most Russians. Of course, for the wealthy elite, it's a different matter. And they are the cronies surrounding Mr Putin at the top."

The proposed ""final offer"" from Melrose is also facing opposition from MPs amid fears for what a takeover would mean for staff, pensions and investment at GKN. Melrose has pledged to maintain spending at least at current levels and denied any suggestion of a short-term approach. The opinion of Airbus carries weight as it is currently GKN's biggest customer - making parts for wings primarily and accounting for 20% of its aerospace sales last year. Airbus chief operating officer Tom Williams said: ""The industry does not lend itself to shorter term financial investment which naturally reduces R&D (research and development) budgets and limits vital innovation. ""It would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such an ownership model when we don't know who will be the long-term investor."" GKN chairman Mike Turner responded: ""The comments from Airbus that stress the need for long-term investment and strategic vision in our industry emphasise our firmly held belief that Melrose is not an appropriate owner of GKN. ""Its management lacks the relevant experience and its short-term business model is inappropriate for GKN's customers and investors."" GKN has moved to lure investors away from interest in the Melrose offer by concluding a deal of its own to merge its automotive business Driveline with US firm Dana. The FTSE 100 company's shares closed 1.7% lower on Thursday. Melrose's chairman, Christopher Miller, responded to the intervention by AIrbus by saying: ""We will be delighted to explain to all customers and stakeholders why Melrose's 'invest as if we were to own the business forever' approach is the right way forward for GKN. ""We are certain that GKN's new strategy of hasty short term business break up will not benefit the long term requirements of customers."""

The Russian authorities accuse him of ""large scale fraud in collusion with abuse of power"" and he is Number 12 on an extradition list published by the Russian Embassy in London which accuses the British government of sheltering fugitives from justice. :: Live - Russia to expel UK diplomats The man who was top of the list, Nikolai Glushkov, was found dead at his home in New Malden on Monday night. Counter-terrorism officers are leading the investigation into his death because of his connections with other prominent Russian dissidents, including Boris Berezovsky who was found hanged at home in 2013. Sergey Kapchuk told Sky News that he thought that the poison attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was a ""terror attack"" that shocked him. But he assumed they had been targeted because Mr Skripal had previously been a double-agent - whereas Glushkov, like him, was simply a businessman. He said: ""Everybody ask me if I'm worried. Of course I'm worried. It's the only answer. All normal persons should be worried about this. ""Nobody knows who will be next. and it's very scary, that's why the guys are with me."" :: British soldiers vaccinated against anthrax poisoning As he spoke, one bodyguard stood a few feet away looking out of the window of his London apartment, while another remained at the front door. Mr Kapchuk added: ""If something unexpectedly happened with that man, Glushkov in his home. If he had bodyguards, if he had an attack, they could have helped. I had bodyguards when I was in Russia. It's not a problem for me."" He said he always felt safe in the UK because he was given a British name, and did not involve himself in Russian politics. Even though there have been a number of unexplained deaths of Russian exiles, he says he trusted the British police and the courts to get to the truth. When he was asked why someone who fears for their personal safety would do an interview and appear on television, he replied that in Russia you are safer if you are in the public eye."

The branch's manager says this, when cutting free wi-fi, has resulted in an increasingly civil clientele. Atul Pathak, whose company runs 31 restaurants in the capital, said: ""Working together with the police and the local council in Shepherd's Bush to help them with combating persistent anti-social behaviour, we thought that playing classical music at certain times of the day would help to set a different and calmer tone. ""It is working really well and has been positively received by many customers, so much so that we are giving real consideration as to where else we might introduce it."" The musical measures were introduced at the Uxbridge Road restaurant in partnership with the police. Transport for London (TfL) has been piping classical music into some Tube stations since 2003 in an attempt to combat anti-social behaviour. London Underground's classical music trial began at Elm Park station on the east end of the District line, following successful experiments by rail operators in the UK and abroad. After receiving positive feedback from customers and staff alike, classical music was rolled out to more than 65 stations in an effort to improve ambience. McDonald's is hoping the music gives customers are more enjoyable dining experience. A spokesperson said: ""We have tested the effects of classical music in the past and played it in some of our restaurants as it encourages more acceptable behaviour. ""Typically, classical music would be played from early evening onwards, and in some cases, on certain nights in a small number of restaurants."""

Sources said that a document containing a list of allegations against Mr Waggott was produced by Dakota Blue, a Kent-based human resources consultancy, and passed to the Port of Dover's board. The string of complaints against Mr Waggott are said to include the use of abusive language aimed at employees and members of the public, and inappropriate physical and verbal gestures towards a number of female staff. Richard Everitt, the Dover Harbour Board chairman, is now said by a Government source to be considering how to proceed after being passed the report on Mr Waggott's conduct. The uncertain fate of Mr Waggott may turn into a headache for ministers, who are desperate to finalise a post-Brexit solution that would defy predictions of motorway chaos in Kent triggered by protracted vehicle checks. Dover is a crucial spoke in the wheel of Britain's economy, with roughly ¬£120bn of goods passing through the port each year. The Dover Harbour Board chief executive has previously advocated the establishment of a new customs system using some form of passporting for goods. Ministers including Theresa May and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, have recently insisted that the UK will leave the EU customs union, but have yet to provide significant details of replacement arrangements. A Port of Dover spokeswoman said: ""Dover Harbour Board acknowledges that following a detailed and independently managed staff engagement survey a number of issues came to light as you would normally expect. ""These are being worked through and so it would be inappropriate to provide further comment at this stage.""‚Äé The spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Waggott remained in his role, but declined to comment on the specific allegations against him. Mr Waggott, who also sits on the board of the water regulator Ofwat and sits on the south-east regional council of the CBI employers' group, could not be reached for comment. He became chief executive of the Port of Dover in 2013, having held a number of other roles there. The Port of Dover is structured as a trust-port, which means it is administered as a trust by an independent statutory body, and has no shareholders. Its board reports to the Transport Secretary. Ministers last examined the privatisation of the Dover Harbour Board four years ago, but eventually decided against doing so."

Pharmaceutical companies have restricted the supply of their drugs because they believe they should be used to treat the sick, rather than kill convicts. It led to the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections admitting defeat, in an increasingly desperate search. Joe Albaugh told reporters in Oklahoma City: ""I got to the point...that I was calling all around the world, to the backstreets of the Indian subcontinent to try procure drugs. ""My discussions with individuals, seedy individuals who had access to drugs, even with other states with access to drugs, has proven to be for nought."" But the alternative is likely to be just as controversial. Oklahoma's Attorney General Mike Hunter calls it Inert Gas Inhalation or IGI. The precise details have yet to be worked out, but it's likely that a hood or a mask would be used to administer nitrogen gas. Mr Hunter said: ""Well documented research has shown that individuals who are exposed to excessive amounts of inert gas experience fatigue dizziness, perhaps a headache, loss of breath and eventual loss of consciousness. ""This is the safest, the best and the most effective method available."" The use of nitrogen gas has already been approved by the state legislature, but it was only a reserve method and has never been attempted anywhere in America. Now it will be the first method of choice, though legal challenges are likely to be mean it could be a long time before it is adopted. Maya Foa from Reprieve, who has led the campaign to restrict the use of lethal injection drugs, welcomed the announcement that Oklahoma will no longer attempt to acquire them, but told Sky News that nitrogen was an untested method, particularly when a prisoner was resisting. Dale Baich, a federal public defender and one of the attorneys representing Oklahoma death row prisoners in a federal lawsuit challenging the state's lethal injection protocol said: ""How can we trust Oklahoma to get this right when the state's recent history reveals a culture of carelessness and mistakes in executions?"" Richard Glossip, who survived his execution date because of the drugs blunder, will now be the first in line for the new method of execution."

Choosing a wider range of fish, beyond the usual cod, salmon, haddock, tuna and prawns, will encourage demand for local seafood and reduce the amount of fish exported in favour of developing UK markets. The new list is focused on the industry post-Brexit, as fisheries talks become a bigger part of negotiations in the coming months. Included in the top 10 list are dab, seine netted in the North Sea, Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified hake from Cornwall and MSC certified herring from the Irish, Celtic and North seas, south west Ireland and eastern English Channel. UK rope-grown mussels, Devon brown crab, pollack and Dover sole are also included. Bernadette Clarke, MCS Good Fish Guide programme manager, said: ""Although they may not trip off the tongue like cod, mackerel and plaice, these could, and should be, the fish supper of the future. ""UK consumers tend to stick to their tried and tested top five - both in taste and familiarity but not always sustainability. ""Cod, tuna, salmon, haddock and prawns from the right sources are all OK, but there's so much more to explore and the new additions to the best choice list are a good place to start."" The UK exports around 75% of the fish caught and landed in the country but it is the ninth-largest importer of fish, with around 70% of the seafood entering our supply chain coming from overseas. The MCS Best Choice Top 10 are:1. Dab, seine netted in the North Sea2. Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Certified hake from Cornwall3. MSC certified herring from Irish, Celtic and North Seas, SW Ireland and Eastern English Channel4. Mackerel, handlined in the south-west of England5. Megrim from the Northern North Sea and West of Scotland6. UK rope-grown mussels7. Brown crab from Devon Inshore Potting Area, Western Channel8.

The figures showed that 88% of the total related to retail consumers, who lost an average of ¬£2,784, while the remainder of victims were businesses, losing ¬£24,355 on average per case. Banks and building societies were able to recover ¬£60.8m of the scam losses. Which? launched a ""super complaint"" in 2016 calling on the industry to do more. The Payments System Regulator (PSR) responded by urging banks to work together to crack down on scammers but stopped short of making them liable for the losses. Last November the PSR said it was aiming to agree a reimbursement policy with the sector by September. Responding to the latest figures, Which? money expert Gareth Shaw said the new system ""must be swiftly introduced by banks to properly compensate customers who have been left out of pocket"". He added: ""These figures show the alarming scale of push payment scams, with people still losing life-changing sums of money to this type of crime."" Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said the industry was ""committed to playing its part"" in combating the fraudsters. She said financial providers had invested in new security systems, introduced new standards on how they respond to victims, and was working with the Government's Joint Fraud Taskforce to stop scams and better recover stolen funds. The authorised payment fraud figures were released alongside data showing unauthorised fraud on payment cards, remote banking and cheques totalled ¬£732m in 2017, 5% down on the year before."
2018-03-15,The Government has dismissed any suggestion that Unilever's decision to abandon its UK headquarters is connected to Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180315164927/https://news.sky.com/story/marmite-maker-scraps-uk-hq-for-dutch-shift-11290317,"The company, behind top consumer brands including Marmite and Persil, confirmed a move to Rotterdam on Thursday morning. The announcement was made less than 24 hours after Sky News reported the decision was to be finalised by the boards of its current dual British and Dutch holding companies. Under the changes, which Unilever said would result in no job losses among its 7,300 UK staff, the two holding companies would become a ""single legal entity incorporated in the Netherlands"". It began to ponder the shake-up after fighting off a ¬£115bn takeover approach by US rival Kraft just over a year ago. Dutch laws provide stronger defences against unwanted bid interest. It also moved to dismiss any speculation of Brexit being a factor by explaining that shares in its current Dutch business accounted for the majority of its share capital. Nevertheless, the shift abroad will be seen as a major blow to the Government as it tries to calm nerves in the business community about Britain's decision to leave the EU. Unilever said London would continue to play a major future role because it was to make the city the headquarters for its Beauty and Personal Care and Home divisions - two of three to be created under the shake-up. The company explained that the decision cemented almost ¬£1bn of continued annual spending in the UK, including research and development work. It said Unilever shares would continue to be listed in London, as well as in Amsterdam and the US, though it would no longer be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE 100 index because its domicile would be outside the UK. Chairman Marijn Dekkers said: ""Unilever's board is fully committed to delivering long-term performance and sustainable value for shareholders. ""The board believes the move to three divisions and the simplification of our corporate structure will create a simpler, more agile and more focused company with increased strategic flexibility for value-creating portfolio change. ""Our decision to headquarter the divisions in the UK and the Netherlands underscores our long-term commitment to both countries. ""The changes announced today also further strengthen Unilever's corporate governance, creating for the first time in our history a 'one share, one vote' principle for all our shareholders."" The Government sought to play down the significance of the shake-up. A spokesperson said: ""Unilever has today shown its long-term commitment to the UK by choosing to locate its two fastest-growing global business divisions in this country, safeguarding 7,300 jobs and ¬£1bn a year of investment. ""As the company itself has made clear, its decision to transfer a small number of jobs to a corporate HQ in the Netherlands is part of a long-term restructuring of the company and is not connected to the UK's departure from the EU."" But Rajesh Agrawal, London's deputy mayor for business, said the move was ""clearly disappointing"" for the capital. He added: ""It brings into sharp focus the need for the Government to secure a Brexit deal that secures London as Europe's leading business centre. ""The best way to do this is for London and the UK to remain part of the Single Market and Customs Union."""

2018-03-15,Sky News has established the Government has been signing a series of secret agreements with companies and industry groups over highly controversial outcomes of the Brexit process for Britain's trade border.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180315164927/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-government-paranoia-over-secret-business-agreements-11290344,"The attempt to enforce silence about outside discussions on the changes urgently required to the border after Brexit has raised eyebrows across industry. A series of non-disclosure agreements have been forced into the process of consultation with the logistics companies that actually operate the UK border, with one industry source calculating that ""many dozens"" have been signed. The development was described by Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, as ""extremely unusual"" and ""a sign of Government paranoia"". She told Sky News: ""I'm pretty staggered by that because I don't see why the Government shouldn't be revealing what it knows about Brexit but also why would it want to shackle organisations that might want to criticise or comment on Brexit by asking them to sign NDAs?"" Ms Hillier, whose committee produced a stinging report on the preparedness for Brexit border changes in December, said such agreements were normally only relevant for commercial contractors, not outside stakeholders being consulted on policy changes. The secret meetings with industry occur in sub-committees of the Border Co-ordination Group. This is believed to have started so the Government could obtain private sector data on what exactly was being brought into and out of the UK in its trade inside the European Union. By definition this data is largely uncollected, as the cargo is never checked within the single market and customs union. But the Government asked those private sector companies and organisations to reflect on how this data would change under various identified Brexit scenarios, requiring a series of secretive agreements with transport operators covering both their trade data, but also the likely Government Brexit scenarios, including No Deal Brexit. Reports based on anonymised data from this exercise, calculating likely difficulties and delays caused by border checks, have been fed back into the Border Planning Group, a cross Whitehall committee of senior officials. But in recent weeks the requirement to sign non-disclosure agreements has also spread to more arcane technical committees on the future of the border. Some have refused to sign them, citing concern about Brexit secrecy curtailing political debate about the economic consequences of the Government's red lines and suggesting the ""bizarre, Secret Society"" agreements were preventing trade bodies from discussing their Brexit approach internally. A key member of a different industry collaboration body, the Joint Customs Consultative Committee, Peter MacSwiney, told Sky News: ""I don't understand what the secrecy is, I don't know what is causing this paranoia, they are petrified that someone is going to release something that will reveal to the EU what we are trying to achieve, but that is straightforward - frictionless borders."" On wider border issues, Mr MacSwiney who is collating the industry response to the Customs Bill, said: ""I don't think we're anywhere, there are no practical measures on the table that I can see, endless discussions about theoretical concepts, but not about what we are actually going to do on day one."" Rolling on and rolling off ferries, trains and cargo ships is what our current frictionless border looks like - enabling more than half of the trade in and out of Britain. Those running these operations now have as little as 12 months to adapt to the potential of entirely new arrangements outside the European Union, its customs union and the single market. The Government argues it wants to negotiate the maintenance of these free flowing economic arteries of European trade such as the M20 and the Channel Tunnel, and so does not wish to give away its hand in delicate Brexit negotiations. Others argue the full consequences revealed in secret reports cannot be kept from the public and the MPs who will soon vote on Brexit outcomes, including the customs union. Paul Blomfield, Shadow Brexit Minister, said: ""This is more disturbing evidence of a Government obsessed with secrecy and intent on keeping the public in the dark about their plans for Brexit. ""The public has every right to hear what the Government's plans are to guarantee frictionless trade with Europe. There is no legitimate reason why ministers should be instructing businesses to sign these non-disclosure agreements. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the Government is trying to hide the fact that they have no plausible plan for protecting British trade and manufacturing. ""It's increasingly clear that only Labour can deliver the Brexit deal Britain needs. We would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland. ""Ministers should stop trying to silence businesses and accept Labour's plan for delivering frictionless trade with the EU."" Labour's Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign, described the revelation as ""shocking"" and said the ""undemocratic"" move made a ""complete mockery of Parliamentary sovereignty"" by preventing MPs from seeing the information. A spokesman for Number 10 told Sky News: ""It is standard practice for the Government to use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with business partners. ""NDAs are crucial to the exchange of information between ourselves and business."""
2018-03-15,A jury has retired to consider its verdict in the trial of a teenager accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180315164927/https://news.sky.com/story/jury-considers-verdict-over-parsons-green-bomb-11290819,"Ahmed Hassan, an 18-year-old Iraqi asylum seeker, told the court he left a homemade bomb on a train last September because he was bored and wanted attention, rather than having the intention to harm or kill. The device partially exploded on a District line train at Parsons Green station in west London. Thirty people were seriously injured and burned in the fireball that ripped through the carriage. Hassan, who had been living with foster parents in Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey, denies attempted murder and using the chemical compound TATP to cause an explosion that was likely to endanger life. The teen says he developed a fugitive fantasy fuelled by action films. He said he was ""certain"" the bomb would not explode. After testing a sample on the kitchen table, Hassan says he believed the device would ""just burn"" and that the idea of killing someone had never crossed his mind. The prosecution has claimed the media studies student was moved by ""anger and hatred"" when he planted 400g of explosives. His trial at the Old Bailey heard he told a mentor that it was his ""duty to hate Britain"" - and the court heard he blamed the UK and the US for the death of his father in Iraq. In his summing up, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told jurors a central issue in relation to the bomb was whether a device containing 400g of high explosives and 2.2kg of shrapnel was a ""hoax"" or not. He said: ""The prosecution rely heavily on motive in this case and point to evidence that Hassan was angry. He blamed the coalition for his father's death. He had been killed by a bomb in Iraq. The judge told jurors that Hassan denied the accusation and said he never had contact with Islamic State. Sending the jury out just after 12.30pm on Thursday, the judge said: ""Be logical, objective, dispassionate. What's required is 12 cool heads."""

The council responsible for Grenfell Tower said, along with hundreds of other councils, it was urgently seeking information from the Government about whether the finding has implications for residents beyond Grenfell. The Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told Parliament the Expert Advisory Panel set up in the wake of the fire had determined that there was no increased risk to public safety and no systemic risk. But, he added, the panel had recommended that further tests be carried out ""at pace"", to determine the ""root cause of the failed test"". The test came as part of a ""comprehensive investigation"" being carried out into what happened at Grenfell Tower by the Metropolitan Police. Seventy-one people died in Grenfell Tower in June 2017, when fire spread rapidly up the building in London's west Kensington. The revelation comes as a firefighter who fought the inferno at Grenfell told Sky News he believed more people could have been saved if his colleagues had been given better radio equipment. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told Sky News: ""We have previously described that our forensic examination at the scene would be followed by a phase of offsite testing to be conducted by experts on our behalf. ""As part of this investigation experts tested a flat front door taken from Grenfell Tower. ""The door tested was designed to resist fire for up to 30 minutes but during the test it was only found to resist the fire for approximately 15 minutes. A much shorter period than expected. ""The forensic examination and the testing phase is ongoing and we are not able to comment as to the potential impact or otherwise that any test result may have on the overall criminal investigation."" A Kensington and Chelsea Council spokesman said: ""We understand that tests organised by the Government have found that three fire doors from the same company provided less protection than guidelines recommend, but test results are as yet inconclusive. ""Alongside hundreds of councils and landlords across the country, we are seeking further information from the Government on what this means for our residents. ""As soon as we have clear advice from the Government about the safety implications of these tests, we will write to our residents about what this means for them. ""We understand this news will be of particular concern to residents in this borough, which is why we are urging the Government to move as quickly as it can to give us clarity about the situation."" Mr Javid told the House of Commons: ""The expert panel has concluded that risk to public safety remains low, that there is no change to fire safety advice, that a programme of additional testing has to be commissioned to determine the root cause of the failed test. ""That's essential - that additional testing is required. It is going on now and, as I said, it has to be thorough but at pace. ""We shouldn't rush it to get inappropriate results. It should be done properly, led by the experts. Their advice so far is that there is no evidence of a systemic problem."" Representatives of the families affected by the Grenfell disaster told of their shock at the finding. Natasha Elcock, from Grenfell United, said: ""It's shocking - first the cladding and insulation, then the doors. Who knows what else is putting people's lives at risk? ""It's time people's lives are taken more seriously - and that includes everyone from every walk of life. ""People's homes must be made absolutely safe for them and their children. The Government should have improved regulations after previous fires. We can't listen to anymore excuses."""

The video, recorded last July, shows Jones giving a talk on leadership for Fuso - the Japanese parent company of England sponsor Mitsubishi. It came to light before Saturday's final round of the Six Nations, when England will face Ireland at Twickenham. Jones apologised for his comments on Wednesday evening and admitted his choice of words was inexcusable, saying he was ""very sorry"". The Rugby Football Union said it would apologise to the Irish and Welsh unions. However, Sky Sports News understands he will not face any disciplinary procedures. Jones had told the audience: ""We've played 23 tests and have only lost one test to the scummy Irish. I'm still dirty about that game. But we will get that back! ""We will get that back, don't worry, we have them next year at home, we will get 'em back!"" Earlier, Jones had discussed Japan's under-20s losing to their Welsh counterparts 125-0 shortly after he took over as Brave Blossoms head coach in 2012. He had said: ""Wales. Who knows Wales? Are there any Welsh people here? So it's this little s*** place that has got three million people. Three million!"" In his apology, released by the Rugby Football Union, Jones said: ""I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused - no excuses and I shouldn't have said what I did. I'm very sorry.""

They said that even if the UK stays in the European Space Agency (ESA), which is not an EU organisation, the loss of freedom of movement for scientists and equipment could still impact heavily on the industry. At present the UK is a European leader in space science research and development, the scientists said. Professor John Zarnecki, president of the Royal Astronomical Society and emeritus professor of space science at the Open University, said: ""In the UK, we have been incredibly successful in exploiting these opportunities - whether it's landing on a comet, as in Rosetta... there are many examples of great success. ""We do that with 30% of our funding coming from the EU... without which we just wouldn't be able to play the leading role in these organisations. We feel that we are facing a cliff edge. :: Spaceport would bring opportunities for Britain ""If we look ahead, for the next generation of missions, we will lose our leading position."" The UK pays into the ESA budget directly and into the European Research Council (ERC) through the EU, which then both fund the development of space technology. But the supply of funds from both are in doubt when the UK leaves the EU, the scientists said. Professor Alan Smith, director of Space Domain, University College London, said that the EU has considerable input into the ESA and, because of Brexit, the UK's involvement in some of its programmes was ""in jeopardy"". Another of the experts, RAL Space's director Dr Chris Mutlow, said among a particular class of the ESA's missions - the Explorer missions - the UK had a very good record of being chosen to take the lead. He said: ""We are seeing there are these Brexit clauses appearing and we are being squeezed out of things in practice. ""That will mean that our influence, which pays dividends for us, will disappear. ""If you look back historically across the explorer missions, the successful candidate missions have all been led out of the UK and this is something that will become increasingly difficult."" Andrew Stroomer, of Airbus, said the firm employs 3,000 people on building satellites for TV and other purposes but its work for the EU's navigational system Galileo was already being affected because of Brexit. He said: ""Our team is the incumbent for something called the Ground Control System for Galileo. In Portsmouth we are producing the software that controls the satellites in orbit. ""We are currently engaged in a tender for the next phase of this Ground Control and due to the Brexit environment, we don't believe its possible to sustain the lead from the UK for that activity."" Professor John Remedios, of the National Centre for Earth Observation, added: ""We are already thinking about the next generation of sentinel satellites. At least two or three of the mission, in fact the candidate missions, have substantial if not leading UK investment. ""We are the people being asked if they are worth doing. If we are not able to do that, we are disadvantaged, both in the ERC but also in ESA, so we are very concerned about that."" The evidence to peers on Thursday morning comes after dreams of a spaceport for Britain moved a step closer after the Space Industry Bill was given Royal Assent. In a recent speech in Munich, the Prime Minister said she intended to ""keep open all the options which will enable the UK and the EU to collaborate in the most effective way possible"" on space technologies. She said: ""The UK hosts much of Europe's cutting edge capabilities on space and we have played a leading role, for example, in the development of the Galileo programme. ""We are keen for this to continue as part of our new partnership, but, as is the case more widely, we need to get the right agreements concluded which will allow the UK and its businesses to take part on a fair and open basis."""

Hord had been planning the attack for weeks after attaching a tracking device to Mrs Willsher's car and buying a pistol crossbow as an ""option weapon"". He told police Mrs Willsher had made his relationship with her mother ""very difficult"". The court heard how he wanted revenge and so went into the Aldi branch in North Yorkshire where she worked armed with a knife and an axe. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told Hord he was a ""monster"" and ""truly and horribly rotten to the core"". The judge said: ""You chose a time and a place to, in effect, execute; to kill; to murder."" He said the killing was calculated to cause the ""maximum pain, horror, shock and trauma"". Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC told the court how Hord stabbed Mrs Willsher several times in the store before he was stopped and restrained by members of the public. The prosecutor said Hord admitted he went to the store to kill Mrs Wilsher and told officers he thought she had smiled at him as they made eye contact in the supermarket before he stabbed her. He said it was a ""cold-blooded public execution perpetrated for the purpose of revenge"". In an emotional statement read to the court, Mrs Willsher's husband Malcolm said his life and that of his daughter Megan had been ripped apart. He said his daughter had told him she ""hated"" him ""for not bringing mummy back"". He told the court: ""I'm so scared he'll get out and do something to Megan."" At Mrs Willsher's funeral Mr Willsher said his wife's death had left a ""great hole in our lives"" and added that she and his daughter were ""more than mother and daughter, they were best friends"". At an earlier hearing, Hord's family passed a statement to the media via his lawyers in which they expressed their ""sincere condolences"" to Mrs Willsher's family and added: ""No words can convey our sorrow for this tragic turn of events."" Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Mark Pearson, of the Cleveland and North Yorkshire Major Investigation team, said: ""Neville Hord planned and carried out a horrific attack on Jodie Willsher while she was working in a busy supermarket in the run up to Christmas.

Currently, satellites must be launched into orbit from spaceports abroad, exposing British firms to substantial cost, delay and bureaucracy. The legislation aims to present new opportunities in the commercial space race, increasing Britain's share of the global space economy from 6.5% to 10% by 2030. The Government predicts it will create hundreds of jobs, bring in billions of pounds and increase the scope for scientific research. The creation of spaceports also provides some of the infrastructure needed for space tourism, although the Government has said it has no current plans to create the regulatory framework needed for passenger trips. Transport Minister Jo Johnson said: ""The Space Industry Bill gives companies the ability to launch satellites from UK soil, putting us at the forefront of the new space race, and helping us to compete as the destination of choice for satellite companies worldwide."" A number of sites have been previously been earmarked as possible spaceport locations, including Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Campbeltown, Stornoway, Newquay and Llanbedr. Jules Matteoni, operations director at Glasgow Prestwick, said: ""This means we will be able to offer horizontal launches of orbital and sub-orbital missions for satellite launches, micro-gravity experiments and passenger spaceflight experiences. ""As soon as the Space Industry Bill is enacted and a regulatory framework is in place, we will seek to apply for a licence and expect to become the first fully operational, licensed spaceport in the UK and Europe."" The prospect of low-cost, reliable access to space has been welcomed by companies involved in the building and use of satellite technology. The city of Glasgow has become a centre for satellite technology, with resident firms creating around 70 satellite 'spacecraft' in the past three years, more than anywhere outside of California. Gavin Tweedie, of Global Surface Intelligence, told Sky News: ""The legislation will create more interest in the sector. It will bring investment, which will lead to more research and more reliable applications of the data collated from space."" Steve Greenland, of Craft Prospect, said: ""Our barrier is the access to space and the number of satellite missions. ""This will push forward efficiency. ""The time spent on navigating licensing and regulations will be greatly reduced."""

His handler, PC Dave Wardell, says he's ""bursting with pride that Finn is receiving this award"". He added: ""He is my best friend and I owe him my life. PC Wardell was stabbed in the hand as he and Finn pursued the suspect in Stevenage in October 2016. But the assailant was stopped from injuring PC Wardell more severely because Finn pulled him back until support arrived. PC Wardell says both he and Finn suffered post-traumatic stress disorder afterwards. The incident inspired the #FinnsLaw campaign, which is calling for greater protection for service animals.

But Gavin Williamson warned Russia against escalating the diplomatic battle over the attempted murder of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The Defence Secretary said: ""What we will do, we will look at how Russia responds to what we have done. ""It is absolutely atrocious and outrageous what Russia did in Salisbury. ""We have responded to that. Frankly, Russia should go away and should shut up. ""But if they do respond to the action we have taken, we will consider it carefully and we will look at our options but it would be wrong to prejudge their response."" When asked whether UK-Russia relations had returned to pre-1990 tensions, Mr Williamson raised the prospect of the West entering a new Cold War with Moscow. He said: ""Well, let's face it, relations ain't good are they? ""Russia has, in my view, made a deliberate political decision in terms of what they did, in terms of attacking Britain. ""It's often described as a cool war that we're entering in. I would say it's feeling exceptionally, exceptionally chilly at the moment."" Mr Williamson's remarks came after a speech in Bristol, where he announced the Ministry of Defence are ""evolving"" the capabilities of the UK's Armed Forces to meet chemical threats. This includes offering anthrax vaccines to the UK's high-readiness troops as well as investing ¬£48m in a new Chemical Weapons Defence Centre at the military's Porton Down facility in Wiltshire. Outlining global threats to the UK, Mr Williamson accused the Kremlin of ""ripping up the international rule book"", and he warned the UK is at a ""crossroads"". He said: ""After a long period of relative peace, threats are increasing again. ""So, we have arrived at profound moment in our history. A crossroads where the choice before us as a nation is simple. ""To sit back and let events overtake us, or step forward - seizing the moment as we leave the EU to shape our vision for a bold, more prosperous Britain. ""A Britain proud of its past and confident of its future. A Britain ready to reassert its right to do global good in a dangerous and unpredictable world. ""A Britain able to protect our security and prosperity at home and abroad."" Mr Williamson praised the role of the Foreign Office and Department for International Development in spending UK aid as part of British ""soft power"" around the world, but warned military capabilities were also needed. He said: ""Let's be clear, after 1990 we believed the world was going to become a better and safer place with every year that passed.

The 20-year-old fired a .50 calibre handgun at Mr Ruiz from roughly a foot (30cm) away as he held an encyclopaedia to his chest. A Desert Eagle pistol was used for the stunt, which has been described as ""one of the world's most powerful semi-automatic handguns"". The bullet pierced the book - and the 22-year-old died from the gunshot wound. According to local media, 30 people - including the couple's young daughter - witnessed the shooting. Perez pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter, but her sentence was lower than suggested by state guidelines. James Brue, an attorney in Norman County, Minnesota, said: ""This foolish stunt was dreamed up, planned and executed by Pedro Ruiz, and the defendant wrongfully and tragically relied on his assurances that the stunt was safe."" A few hours before the ill-fated video, Perez had written on social media that the stunt was ""one of the most dangerous videos ever"" and was Mr Ruiz's idea, not hers. Me and Pedro are probably going to shoot one of the most dangerous videos everüò≥üò≥ HIS idea not MINEüôà Perez has since given birth to their second child. She has been sentenced to a 180-day jail term, 90 of which will be spent in prison. She will alternate being in and out of prison every 10 days for six months, and will spend the remaining 90 days of her sentence in home confinement. According to a plea agreement, Perez is forbidden from making any financial compensation from the recording of Ruiz's death, and she will be banned from owning a gun for the rest of her life. At the time of the incident, the victim's aunt, Claudia Ruiz, told WDAY-TV the couple often carried out pranks and put them on their amateur video channel. She told Valley News Live: ""They were in love. They loved each other. It was just a prank gone wrong. It shouldn't have happened like this. ""He had told me about an idea. I said, don't do it, don't do it. Why are you going to use a gun? Why? Because, we want more viewers. ""I don't know why they thought the book was supposed to stop the bullet."" The couple's YouTube channel was described as ""all about craziness"", and has just under 2,000 subscribers. Their earlier pranks had included disguising icing sugar as baby powder and putting it on a doughnut, and planting the world's hottest chilli in each other's sandwiches."

Mr Corbyn writes: ""Labour is of course no supporter of the Putin regime, its conservative authoritarianism, abuse of human rights or political and economic corruption."" But he adds: ""That does not mean we should resign ourselves to a 'new cold war' of escalating arms spending, proxy conflicts across the globe and a McCarthyite intolerance of dissent."" A ""McCarthyite intolerance"" refers to the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence. His words will spark further fury among some of his backbenchers who openly disagreed with their leader after his comments in the Commons on Wednesday. There is growing tension and uneasiness among many within Labour about his response to the attack. A group of Labour MPs led by John Woodcock have defied their leader and tabled a motion offering their support for the Government's expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. Asked by Sky News whether the UK would be safe with Mr Corbyn in No 10, Mr Woodcock said: ""I understand why you ask that question, but I think it's important - at a time when the UK has found itself under attack with chemical weapons - that actually we focus on what the UK Government, the UK state can do and that we all as MPs, of whatever party, give support to that where appropriate."" :: Sky Data poll: Most Britons back Theresa May over Jeremy Corbyn on Russia Mr Corbyn says he supports the actions taken by Theresa May, but would only back further sanctions ""as and when the investigation into the Salisbury attack produces results"". The Labour leader has said he believes ""the evidence points towards Russia"" but his repeated reluctance to point the finger of blame directly at Moscow is angering and concerning many within Labour. There is a clear divide between Jeremy Corbyn's office and those in the party who struggle with his position on national security and foreign policy. And it is a division Conservative MPs are keen to exploit in the aftermath of the Salisbury attack. Tensions within the Labour Party come as a Sky Data poll reveals that 57% of Britons say Jeremy Corbyn is doing a bad job dealing with Russia. Just 18% believe he is doing a good job on the issue."

But Gavin Williamson warned Russia against escalating the diplomatic battle over the attempted murder of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The Defence Secretary said: ""What we will do, we will look at how Russia responds to what we have done. ""It is absolutely atrocious and outrageous what Russia did in Salisbury. ""We have responded to that. Frankly, Russia should go away and should shut up. ""But if they do respond to the action we have taken, we will consider it carefully and we will look at our options but it would be wrong to prejudge their response."" When asked whether UK-Russia relations had returned to pre-1990 tensions, Mr Williamson raised the prospect of the West entering a new Cold War with Moscow. He said: ""Well, let's face it, relations ain't good are they? ""Russia has, in my view, made a deliberate political decision in terms of what they did, in terms of attacking Britain. ""It's often described as a cool war that we're entering in. I would say it's feeling exceptionally, exceptionally chilly at the moment."" Mr Williamson's remarks came after a speech in Bristol, where he announced the Ministry of Defence are ""evolving"" the capabilities of the UK's Armed Forces to meet chemical threats. This includes offering anthrax vaccines to the UK's high-readiness troops as well as investing ¬£48m in a new Chemical Weapons Defence Centre at the military's Porton Down facility in Wiltshire. Outlining global threats to the UK, Mr Williamson accused the Kremlin of ""ripping up the international rule book"", and he warned the UK is at a ""crossroads"". He said: ""After a long period of relative peace, threats are increasing again. ""So, we have arrived at profound moment in our history. A crossroads where the choice before us as a nation is simple. ""To sit back and let events overtake us, or step forward - seizing the moment as we leave the EU to shape our vision for a bold, more prosperous Britain. ""A Britain proud of its past and confident of its future. A Britain ready to reassert its right to do global good in a dangerous and unpredictable world. ""A Britain able to protect our security and prosperity at home and abroad."" Mr Williamson praised the role of the Foreign Office and Department for International Development in spending UK aid as part of British ""soft power"" around the world, but warned military capabilities were also needed. He said: ""Let's be clear, after 1990 we believed the world was going to become a better and safer place with every year that passed.

2018-03-16,A teenage asylum-seeker who set off a bomb on a rush hour Tube train is facing life in jail.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180316171324/https://news.sky.com/story/ahmed-hassan-found-guilty-of-attempted-murder-on-parsons-green-tube-11292104,"Iraqi-born Ahmed Hassan, 18, built a bomb in his bedroom at his foster parents' home over the summer holidays. A jury found him guilty of the attempted murder of 93 people, who escaped with their lives when a fireball engulfed a Tube carriage at Parsons Green on 15 September last year. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said it was ""a matter of luck that the device did not function as intended"". The bomb was made from triacetone triperoxide (TATP), also known as ""Mother of Satan"", an extremely volatile homemade explosive. Experts told the Old Bailey that even a gram of TATP had the potential to cause serious injury. The Parsons Green device contained 400g of the high explosive. Hassan packed 300g of TATP into Tupperware container and another 100g in a glass vase. The containers were packed into a white plastic bucket, and carried inside a Lidl bag. The tub had been packed with 2.2kg of knives, screwdrivers, screws, bolts, nails and other metal items designed to cause ""maximum harm and carnage in the surrounding area,"" Ms Morgan said. The District Line train was packed with commuters when the bomb partially detonated at the height of the morning rush. ""The partial explosion caused a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns, many ran in fear and panic,"" Ms Morgan said. ""They were fortunate - had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage. Those in close proximity to the device may well have been killed."" Hassan got off the train two minutes before the explosion and switched trains four times on his way to Dover. He was only caught by chance when a sharp-eyed police officer spotted him sitting outside the passenger terminal at Dover, 24 hours after the attack. When he was searched, he was carrying ¬£2,320 in cash and claimed to police that he was waiting for a friend. The teenager arrived in Britain illegally in October 2015, in the back of a lorry from Calais. He claimed asylum, telling officials that he was in fear of ISIS, who he said had kidnapped him and other youngsters and trained them to kill. Interviewed by immigration officials on 18 January 2016 at Lunar House in Croydon, Hassan was asked if he had ever had any training with ISIS. He told the officials: ""They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based."" However, sources have told Sky News that the teenager, who arrived in Britain two years before his attack, is not thought to have been sent to the UK by the terrorist group. During his trial, he told the court he had made up the story, because he actually came from a safe area of northern Iraq and feared he would have been refused permission to stay. He said that he had picked up the story from fellow asylum-seekers at the makeshift camp nicknamed ""the jungle"" in Calais. He was referred to the Prevent de-radicalisation programme after disappearing on a trip to Wales eight months after his immigration interview in 2016. The jury was heard from a former tutor of Hassan, who said he had blamed the West for the death of his parents in Iraq and that it was his duty to hate the British. The teenager showed no reaction when the jury found him guilty of attempted murder. He will be sentenced at a later date."

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" that President Putin approved the attack, but Russia strenuously denies any involvement. The first leg of the match will be held at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium on 5 April, with the second leg in Moscow on 12 April. :: Live updates: Salisbury spy poisoning Arsenal have encouraged any fans planning to attend the away game to follow advice from the Foreign Office (FCO). A statement on the club's website quoted the latest travel advice from the FCO, which says: ""Due to heightened political tensions between the UK and Russia, you should be aware of the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment at this time; you're advised to remain vigilant, avoid any protests or demonstrations and avoid commenting publicly on political developments. ""While the British Embassy in Moscow is not aware of any increased difficulties for British people travelling in Russia at this time, you should follow the security and political situation closely and keep up to date with this travel advice."" A leading fan group has promised to work closely with the club in the lead up to what Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association chair Lois Langton said was a ""hot potato"" of a draw. ""AISA will work with the club to help ensure the safety of those supporters who do plan to travel to Moscow,"" she said. ""It's a hot potato of a draw in view of the political stand-off between the UK and Russia at present although no doubt it will inject some hype and tension into this season's Europa League. ""It probably isn't going to be the destination of choice for many supporters and the Foreign Office travel advice will need to be listened to."" CSKA, meanwhile, have moved to calm any concerns about the game in Russia's capital. ""We are happy to play Arsenal and don't see any danger for English fans that would like to come to Moscow, we have already played against Manchester United this season in Moscow and everything went well,"" a club spokesman told Sky Sports News. The last meeting in London between the teams was attended by Andrei Lugovoi, the man suspected of murdering another former spy, Alexander Litvinenko, in 2006. An inquiry into the polonium poisoning concluded that Mr Lugovoi had met Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel, along with fellow suspect Dmitri Kovtun, and hours later went to the game. Traces of the radioactive substance were discovered at the team's north London stadium. Earlier, Liverpool and Manchester City were drawn against each another in the Champions League quarter-finals.

Snow has already started falling in the Grampian mountains in Scotland, he said. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for snow and ice, beginning at 3pm on Friday. The 20cm (8in) of snow is forecast on higher ground and 5cm (2in) in other areas, which Met Office meteorologist Martin Bowles said was ""enough to cause a fair amount of disruption to transport"". ""Significant snowfall"" is expected on Sunday, when some parts of the country could have freezing temperatures all day. ""It is probably the coldest day of the lot,"" Mr Bowles said. He added that an upgraded amber warning on Sunday is ""certainly a possibility"", but a red warning is ""extremely unlikely"". Snow will initially affect northeastern Scotland and northeastern England, before spreading to the rest of the UK. ""On Saturday that snow band in the east starts to move further south, including southeast England and London, (and) it will weaken as it does so,"" Mr Bowles said. ""On Sunday we get that snow spreading more widely, particularly further west and into the south of England - Devon, Kent, the Midlands and parts of Wales."" Low temperatures are likely to continue on Monday with temperatures rising ""fairly rapidly"" from Tuesday. During the cold snap earlier this month, motorists in two parts of the UK reported getting stuck for 17 or 18 hours as snow and high winds brought treacherous driving conditions."

Personally, I haven't thought up a suitably catchy alternative title for the current standoff but we are living through an era of great tension. Relations between Russia and the West have been deteriorating gradually. What happened in Salisbury on a Sunday in early March can be added to a quite extraordinary list that includes the shooting down of a long-haul passenger aircraft, the invasion of a sovereign country (Ukraine), and the use of barrel bombs and complicity in the use chemical weapons in Syria. Add to that Russian aircraft flying dangerously close to crowded European airspace with transmitters switched off, interference in numerous elections and a build-up of conventional forces, and all in all you have a situation that is as every bit as worrying as 40 years ago. In his state-of-the-nation address three weeks ago, Mr Putin spoke about the development of a nuclear weapon that couldn't be shot down by any anti-missile system - he backed this up with simulated graphics showing an attack on Florida. It's remarkable in some ways that the West hasn't responded more aggressively. There are some differences between the Cold War and now. Russia is a much weaker prospect today than the Soviet Union was then. It remains a nuclear state, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, but the breakup of the USSR has meant that some of the former Soviet states, like Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, are now members of NATO. Russia is financially weaker than the Soviet Union too - it has fewer trading partners than it did, and an economy smaller than any of the UK, France and Germany. Worryingly the channels of communication and understanding that were maintained during the Cold War years are seemingly absent these days. The chances of an accidental clash or misunderstanding in Syria, the Baltics or European airspace has been so far avoided but remain a real risk. It might not be the new Cold War, but the Putin era is every bit as dangerous."

In a transcript released on Friday night, Denney Pate with FIGG Bridge Group says the cracking would need repairs ""but from a safety perspective we don't see that there's any issue there so we're not concerned about it from that perspective"". The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said they have just begun their investigation, and cannot yet say whether that cracking contributed to the collapse. Six people are now confirmed to have died when the newly installed 950-ton bridge at the Florida International University collapsed on Thursday afternoon. Five were found dead at the scene and another died in hospital. Rescuers have been using high-tech listening devices, trained sniffer dogs and search cameras to find anyone still alive in the rubble. They have found no sign of life. ""We don't anticipate that we will find anybody alive in there,"" officer Lee Cowart, spokesperson of the Miami-Dade police department, told the Miami Herald. At least eight vehicles were trapped in the wreckage of the bridge, as fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene. One desperate woman whose daughter was in one of the crushed vehicles begged to search the rubble herself, the Miami Herald reported. Her request was denied. Speaking to reporters, Juan Perez, the director of the Miami Dade police department, said: ""Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims of this tragedy. ""We are assisting in the efforts and the main focus is to rescue people."" One hospital said it has been treating 10 trauma patients. One arrived in cardiac arrest. Their heart was restarted and they were operated on and they are now in intensive care with head and chest injuries. Another patient arrived at hospital in a coma with severe injuries to their extremities. They have been operated on by neuro and orthopaedic surgeons. The other eight patients at that hospital have injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones. All are said to be in a stable condition. Doctors say they range in age from about 20 to about 50 years old. It has been confirmed that workers were on the top of the bridge, and there were ""surface rescues"" as well as two people pulled out of the debris. A family reunification centre has been set up for anyone concerned about relatives involved in the tragedy. Florida governor Rick Scott has been briefed. The university tweeted: ""The pedestrian bridge across Southwest Eighth Street has collapsed, please avoid the area."" A statement said they were ""shocked and saddened"" at the tragic events and would be working to gather information and help rescue efforts. Firefighters have been working to secure the bridge while searching for casualties. Munilla Construction Management, the company involved in the bridge build, called the accident a ""terrible tragedy"" and vowed to find out why the bridge collapsed. ""The new UniversityCity Bridge, which was under construction, experienced a catastrophic collapse causing injuries and loss of life.

The bridge's main span was assembled at the side of the road, and then moved into place by crane. I have spoken with Miami-Dade County Police Chief Juan Perez about the pedestrian bridge collapse at FIU. I will be in constant communication with law enforcement throughout the day. The university told the Herald the installation process reduced the risk to pedestrians and workers and minimised traffic disruption. The $14.9m (¬£10.7m) bridge crossed over a seven-lane road dividing the campus from the city of Sweetwater and was due to be completed in 2019. On the bridge installation on Saturday, the university president Mark B. Rosenberg said: ""FIU is about building bridges and student safety. This project accomplishes our mission beautifully."""

The report concludes it has been unable to find border solutions anywhere in the world which avoid physical infrastructure. It says greater technical clarity is needed to explain how the current frictionless border will continue. :: UK will 'regret' leaving EU warns Juncker The Committee Chair Dr Andrew Murrison MP said: ""Brexit's success or otherwise hinges on the UK-Ireland border. Everyone agrees that the border after Brexit must look and feel as it does today. ""However, we have heard no evidence to suggest that there is currently a technical solution that would avoid infrastructure at the border. ""Furthermore, we have no detail on how checks on goods and people will be undertaken away from the border."" The Committee reflects widespread concerns about the lack of progress to find a workable solution to the Irish border. The Government has always insisted there will be no infrastructure at the border, but how that could be achieved is still unclear. When Brussels published its draft withdrawal agreement last month, it outlined the options including the unpopular idea that Northern Ireland would stay fully aligned with the EU. Today's report rejects that option, noting it would be incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson recently told Sky News he believed any claims about the Irish border were being used to ""politically"" to try and ""frustrate"" Brexit. He insisted it was possible to maintain frictionless trade without a hard border, and made reference to the London congestion charge scheme. His comments last month came after a leaked letter suggested the Foreign Secretary believed Britain might have to accept some kind of border checks. The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee also claims there isn't enough time to bring about a new customs arrangement before Britain leaves the EU. 'It is now clear that a significant transition period is essential for the options in December's Joint Report to be worked through. ""It is equally clear that regulatory and tariff alignment will be required during transition to avoid any hardening of the border before a definitive low-friction solution can be determined,"" Dr Murrison said."

She said: ""When I did look at going back to work it just would not have been financially possible for me - to have to pay for childcare would have crossed out any wages I got because I wasn't on a particularly good wage and I think that's true for a lot of women. ""I think you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. If you've got a career you want to go back to its incredibly hard to find really good childcare that doesn't cost a phenomenal amount of money,"" she told Sky News. Last year the government rolled out its programme of 30 hours free childcare for some working parents. The Department for Education told Sky News the early implementation of 30 hours had helped almost a quarter of mothers to increase their work hours as a result. A spokesperson added: ""Our figures show that 294,000 children are now benefiting from a free 30 hours childcare place, saving hardworking parents money on their childcare bills and giving them extra cash in their pockets. ""Early evidence shows that this childcare offer has supported working mothers to increase hours."""
2018-03-16,British counter-terror police have launched a murder investigation into the death of Russian Nikolai Glushkov in London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180316171324/https://news.sky.com/story/british-police-launch-murder-probe-into-death-of-russian-nikolai-glushkov-in-london-11292406,"The Metropolitan Police said a post-mortem examination found the cause of the 68-year-old's death was compression to the neck. Mr Glushkov, who had received political asylum in Britain after being jailed in Russia for money laundering and fraud, was found dead at his home in New Malden, southwest London on Monday. Scotland Yard said its Counter-Terrorism Command is leading the investigation ""because of the associations Mr Glushkov is believed to have had"". Police say there is ""nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that he [Mr Glushkov] was poisoned"". Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in the city earlier this month, an attack that Britain has blamed on Moscow. Russia has denied any involvement. Earlier, Russia's Investigative Committee, which reports directly to President Vladimir Putin, announced it had opened a murder investigation into Mr Glushkov's death. On the Salisbury case, the committee said in the same statement that it will probe the ""attempted premeditated murder"" of Yulia Skripal, adding it was ready to co-operate with the British authorities. One of Mr Glushkov's friends was late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who fled to London in 2000 following a row with Vladimir Putin. Mr Glushkov had also worked for Mr Berezovsky's LogoVAZ car company. He was arrested in 1999 and put on trial for allegedly embezzling $7m (¬£5m) from Aeroflot, and sentenced in 2004 to three years, three months in prison. Russian media said he was granted political asylum in Britain in 2010. But his case was revived by a Moscow court last year, which sentenced him in absentia to eight years for allegedly embezzling more than $122m (¬£88m) from Aeroflot. The Russian embassy said it had sought Mr Glushkov's extradition in 2015 ""for committing a number of severe financial offences on the territory of Russia"", but the British government refused. After Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March 2013, Mr Glushkov told The Guardian he would ""never believe"" his friend took his own life. An inquest into Mr Berezovsky's death recorded an open verdict. Mr Berezovsky was also a friend of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. Police and MI5 are expected to examine allegations that a series of deaths on UK soil, including the Berezovsky case, may be linked to Russia. More follows..."

There is a large 96 on the back with a rose and words: What goes around comes back around. The design seems to be a reference to a Bob Marley song remixed in 1996 but Liverpool fans were not impressed. Ninety-six people died at Hillsborough in 1989, when Liverpool fans were crushed at the start of an FA Cup semi-final match. Many on Twitter were furious. The red 96 shirt is tone deaf to a horrible injustice. Surely anybody with a brain should have caught the design before it was approved. Tony Cowin wrote that the shirt was ""tone deaf to a horrible injustice"", adding: ""Surely anybody with a brain should have caught the design before it was approved.""

The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had previously called for prosecutors to look again at her daughter's case after a third court judgement said her daughter was sexually assaulted before her death. Earlier this year David Roberts, the senior coroner for Cumbria, concluded the toddler was assaulted in her father Paul Worthington's double bed at the family home in Barrow-in-Furness in the early hours of December 12, 2012. Mr Roberts decided that Poppi died as a result of being placed in an unsafe sleeping environment which had compromised her breathing. The coroner decided the sexual assault was unconnected to her death. The CPS was given a copy of the coroner's verdict in order to establish whether there were grounds to reconsider the decision not to prosecute. This would only happen if new evidence had emerged at the inquest which was capable of affecting that decision. ""The coroner's verdict has now been considered carefully. No new witness was called at the inquest whose evidence had not already been considered by the CPS prosecutors,"" the CPS said, confirming that there will not be a fourth full review of this case. The lawyer acting for Poppi's mother said she ""was also left disappointed that Poppi's father chose to rely on his right not to answer many questions which may incriminate him at the inquest"". She added: ""While she understands he was entitled to do this, she considers that the coroner's inquiry was frustrated by this."" ""The past five years have been a complete nightmare for her. Not knowing what happened to Poppi on that day, and knowing that there were evidence gathering failures by the police in the very early stages of the investigation has made things even worse. Although she is now closer to the devastating truth, it is likely that she may never get full closure on exactly what happened that night."" Medical opinions gathered during the case have differed starkly, with the Family Court judge saying: ""The pathological evidence revealed a world of small differences and strong feelings."" Cumbria Constabulary has accepted that there were failings in the investigation. The CPS say this meant that sources of evidence one might expect to find in such a case were absent. Three reviews were conducted between March 2015 and November 2016. The three different prosecutors decided that there was not enough evidence to ""provide a realistic prospect of conviction""."
2018-03-16,The government is launching a review to better understand why vulnerable and disadvantaged children are more likely to be excluded from school.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180316171324/https://news.sky.com/story/review-into-the-inequality-of-school-exclusions-11291728,"Evidence shows children who learn in alternative schooling are less likely to achieve good GCSE grades and less likely to be in education, employment or training after the age of 16. They also have a higher chance of ending up in the criminal justice system. The most common reason for a child being excluded from school is persistent disruptive behaviour. The law states permanent exclusion should be a last resort but the number of children falling out of mainstream schooling is on the rise. The last recorded figures show 6,685 pupils left mainstream education in England in 2015/16, compared with 5,795 the previous year. The Anna Freud National Centre for children is managing to transform the lives of some of these children. We met Anthony in a reading lesson, where he told us that school ""wasn't easy"". He added: ""I had people bullying me, and I bullied other people, so I never got on with friends and I used to play around with the wrong people. ""When I started coming here I used to sit on the stairs and do my work, but now I'm capable of staying inside a classroom and asking for more support."" This support is not available to every child in Anthony's position, however. The centre has a 100% success rate for getting children back into mainstream education and its teachers want to see it rolled out nationwide. Brenda McHugh, the centre's clinical lead, said: ""We have the evidence here that it works, our next step is to share that with as many people as possible."" The government is announcing new measures to improve results for children with additional needs, backed by a ¬£4m fund. MP Edward Timpson, who is to carry out a review into school exclusions said: ""As someone who grew up in a family who fostered, I'm all too familiar with the disproportionately higher levels of exclusion of some children, including those in care. ""This review provides a real opportunity to fully understand what drives the different rates of exclusion in our school system and the impact it has on the outcomes of children involved."" The review of exclusions will look at inconsistencies such as why black Caribbean boys are more than three times as likely to be excluded from school. Think tank The Institute for Public Policy Research said the government's figures for the number of children permanently excluded from school are ""the tip of the iceberg"" with five times as many children being educated in schools for excluded pupils than official data suggests."

There's a notion in political circles in Russia: if you want something from Putin, don't put him under pressure to get it. He doesn‚Äôt like to be seen as weak. Weak is bad. Weak is the worst possible thing. If he's forced to act under pressure, he doesn't like it because he doesn't want to be seen as being pushed around - that's weak. So if Britain wants Russia to explain itself, tough talk and demands may not be the best way to get answers. Russia doesn't like the language of ultimatums. Britain, France, Germany and the US have issued a joint statement condemning Russia. That‚Äôs strong and the message hasn't been lost in Russia that Britain is serious about all this. But the point is Putin sees himself as stronger and the alliance of the West as utterly predictable - of course they will issue statements and bandy together. Russia has China and friends in the Middle East. Moreover, it's not like it's the first time Russia has faced international condemnation over its actions. Remember: Ukraine and Crimea were not that long ago. Certainly the Kremlin believes it can just ride this out. And let's not forget there's a presidential election looming here. What‚Äôs going on provides Mr Putin with an argument to his electorate: ""Choose me, because the whole world is against us."""
2018-03-16,An exiled Russian businessman has told Sky News that he is so worried about his safety after the poison attack in Salisbury and the mysterious death of another Russian that he has hired two bodyguards for protection.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180316171324/https://news.sky.com/story/exiled-russian-businessman-hires-bodyguards-after-spy-attack-11290529,"Sergey Kapchuk fled Russia a decade ago, where he had run a metal factory and been elected as a member of parliament. The Russian authorities accuse him of ""large scale fraud in collusion with abuse of power"" and he is Number 12 on an extradition list published by the Russian Embassy in London which accuses the British government of sheltering fugitives from justice. :: Live - Russia to expel UK diplomats The man who was top of the list, Nikolai Glushkov, was found dead at his home in New Malden on Monday night. Counter-terrorism officers are leading the investigation into his death because of his connections with other prominent Russian dissidents, including Boris Berezovsky who was found hanged at home in 2013. Sergey Kapchuk told Sky News that he thought that the poison attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was a ""terror attack"" that shocked him. But he assumed they had been targeted because Mr Skripal had previously been a double-agent - whereas Glushkov, like him, was simply a businessman. He said: ""Everybody ask me if I'm worried. Of course I'm worried. It's the only answer. All normal persons should be worried about this. ""Nobody knows who will be next. and it's very scary, that's why the guys are with me."" :: British soldiers vaccinated against anthrax poisoning As he spoke, one bodyguard stood a few feet away looking out of the window of his London apartment, while another remained at the front door. Mr Kapchuk added: ""If something unexpectedly happened with that man, Glushkov in his home. If he had bodyguards, if he had an attack, they could have helped. I had bodyguards when I was in Russia. It's not a problem for me."" He said he always felt safe in the UK because he was given a British name, and did not involve himself in Russian politics. Even though there have been a number of unexplained deaths of Russian exiles, he says he trusted the British police and the courts to get to the truth. When he was asked why someone who fears for their personal safety would do an interview and appear on television, he replied that in Russia you are safer if you are in the public eye."

The consultant's car, which was left in an area where parking was not allowed, had been blocked in by the emergency vehicle. Mr Kazmi told Sky News he shared the note on social media because he felt it was inappropriate and ""not a nice thing to do"". He added: ""I felt let down that another colleague would do such a thing."" Mr Kazmi posted two photographs of the ambulance on a now hidden Facebook post and wrote: ""Came out of ED (emergency department) to find this! ""Another note on an ambulance this time from an A&E consultant outside A&E because he was blocked in a bay where he shouldn't have parked himself!""

None of the people surveyed got full marks, with many making mistakes that could result in entire bags of recycling being rejected and sent to landfill. Two thirds of those surveyed thought kitchen foil and foil trays could not be recycled when - on the contrary: as long as they are clean, they can be. Just over half of people did not know that empty deodorant aerosols and hairspray cans are fit for recycling, along with the plastic cap. Also, more than half did not realise metal can lids, empty surface cleaner bottles and empty bleach bottles could also be recycled. Meanwhile, almost half of those surveyed incorrectly thought used kitchen roll could go in the recycling bin and 24% made the same mistake with coffee cups, which cannot be recycled because of their plastic lining. Other mistakes included not emptying and rinsing shampoo and conditioner bottles or food containers and not taking the plastic out of tissue boxes. The Recycling Association said: ""If in doubt, throw it out as that is better than putting the wrong items in the recycling bin."" Ivvet Modinou, head of engagement at the British Science Association, said: ""Manufacturers could provide clearer information on packaging and local councils should be actively working to improve guidance for local residents. ""In addition, small, individual actions can really make a difference - such as asking your local cafe not to stock plastic straws, or checking the back of packaging for recycling information."" British households generate 22 million tonnes of waste a year, with 44% of this being recycled, according to 2016 figures from DEFRA."

The harpoon, designed by Airbus UK, could be launched on a spacecraft in the 2020s in an attempt to snare the 8-ton EnviSat, which stopped working in 2012. Pete Steele, a space systems engineer at Airbus, told Sky News that the captured satellite would then be dragged through the atmosphere, burning up as it goes. ""The problem with [EnviSat] is that it is now unresponsive,"" he said. ""We can't control it, we can't steer it, so we can't get out of the way of any debris that comes its way. ""If that does happen and the satellite does explode we will have a large cloud of debris, so it's important we get it down as soon as possible."" There are already half a million pieces of space junk larger than a tennis ball orbiting the Earth at 17,500mph. Some of those are satellites that are no longer operational and pose a collision risk. In 2009, a crash between a Russian and an American satellite produced a cloud of 2,000 fragments large enough to destroy other spacecraft. The increasing number of orbiting objects raises the chance of Kessler syndrome - with a crash producing fragments that cause further collisions in a runaway series of explosions. Alastair Wayman, the harpoon project manager, said: ""It's a big risk if we carry on using space as we do at the minute. ""If we don't do anything, such as bringing out large pieces of space debris or implementing guidelines to make satellites de-orbit themselves at the end of mission, then this Kessler syndrome will present a real problem as we go forward."" A smaller version of the Airbus harpoon will be launched next month on the European Space Agency's RemoveDebris mission. It will be fired at a test rig from a distance of 2m to confirm that it operates as expected in zero gravity. Even small fragments of junk put the International Space Station at risk, forcing the crew to take evasive action or even evacuate to the Soyuz spacecraft as a precaution."

However, when travelling on the Sydney Trains system, Mr Meow-Meow was unable to produce the card for a ticket inspector - who reportedly said ""Wow, that's crazy!"" when he showed her the implant. Although the inspector's card reader confirmed Mr Meow-Meow had tapped in before boarding, he was convicted of attempting to travel without a ticket.

Hord had been planning the attack for weeks after attaching a tracking device to Mrs Willsher's car and buying a pistol crossbow as an ""option weapon"". He told police Mrs Willsher had made his relationship with her mother ""very difficult"". The court heard how he wanted revenge and so went into the Aldi branch in North Yorkshire where she worked armed with a knife and an axe. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told Hord he was a ""monster"" and ""truly and horribly rotten to the core"". The judge said: ""You chose a time and a place to, in effect, execute; to kill; to murder."" He said the killing was calculated to cause the ""maximum pain, horror, shock and trauma"". Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC told the court how Hord stabbed Mrs Willsher several times in the store before he was stopped and restrained by members of the public. The prosecutor said Hord admitted he went to the store to kill Mrs Wilsher and told officers he thought she had smiled at him as they made eye contact in the supermarket before he stabbed her. He said it was a ""cold-blooded public execution perpetrated for the purpose of revenge"". In an emotional statement read to the court, Mrs Willsher's husband Malcolm said his life and that of his daughter Megan had been ripped apart. He said his daughter had told him she ""hated"" him ""for not bringing mummy back"". He told the court: ""I'm so scared he'll get out and do something to Megan."" At Mrs Willsher's funeral Mr Willsher said his wife's death had left a ""great hole in our lives"" and added that she and his daughter were ""more than mother and daughter, they were best friends"".

2018-03-16,One of President Putin's longest standing opponents has told Sky News that the Salisbury attack was the consequence of Western indifference to an ever-evolving threat from Russia and that the UK was targeted because it is perceived as weak.¬†,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180316171324/https://news.sky.com/story/former-georgia-president-mikheil-saakashvili-says-the-west-should-fear-putin-11291712,"The former President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, now living in exile in Amsterdam, said: ""I think that for some reason Russia believed that the UK would be softer on Russia than, say, the United States. ""I don't imagine him doing the same now on Trump's America, because that might trigger unpredictable reactions from Trump. For some reason he believes there will not be the same reaction from the UK long term."" However he praised Prime Minister Theresa May's handling of the Salisbury incident, saying: ""It was swift, no nonsense language and she appeared as someone strong and resolute."" Speaking about President Putin he said: ""The guy has been evolving and evolving in a worse direction and he has been moving his red lines all the time. ""Moving the red line, crossing it and moving it again. He has been warning about moving it, hearing his own voice, seeing the lack of reaction from the West and moving it further."" ""He thinks that he can manipulate everyone, he thinks that the world is a very cynical place: everybody is for sale and he has this advantage, he is eternal, he is always in power,"" Mr Saakashvili said.""All these western leaders: they come and go. You don't have to invest much in them because they are all about the next elections... Vladimir Putin is long term. ""He is always there so he can have longer plans, he can manipulate, he learnt how to trick the democratic systems."" Mr Saakashvili, 50, was in no doubt that the attack in Salisbury was carried out by Russia and suggested that it was under the direct orders of Mr Putin. ""Since the time of Stalin, these kind of things are only authorised by the main leader. Stalin used to sign death sentences personally and Putin is priding himself on being like Stalin. ""There is no way any Russian mafia or Oligarchs on their own would decide to kill someone like Skripal without explicit order from Putin. And all this BS about someone else doing that? It's just not working,"" he said. He claimed the UK's acceptance of wealthy Russians and their money has helped the Russian government infiltrate British society. ""I think the fact that Oligarchs feel so much at ease in London that they can buy newspapers, they can influence public opinion and do very well in the public finance sphere but also get football clubs - just be a strong presence in British society and have lots of traction. ""So there is a strong foothold established in London and he thinks that from his standpoint nobody would risk long term damage to relations because there are too much powerful interests inside UK at play."" He added: ""They are much more efficient than the Soviets were with their ideological agents or spies because now it's not ideology but money that talks. And it looks like that language is understood in the West much more powerfully."" Mr Saakashvili was the pro-western President of the former Soviet state of Georgia from 2004 to 2013. His bitter relationship with Vladimir Putin dates back to the brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008. He said that Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia marked the beginning of Mr Putin's test of the West's resolve. ""They [Western nations] really thought seriously that the 2008 war was an exception. It was a grave mistake,"" Mr Saakashvili said. The West, he claimed, has repeatedly underestimated Vladimir Putin. ""Every new US President thought he can reset relations with Russia. George Bush started with it, Obama started with it. ""People were telling me just a few months before the 2012 elections in Russia: 'Oh, our intelligence tells us that Putin is not running anymore, he is tired of power, he wants to have a rest, he wants to go around the world and enjoy life'. ""I have been hearing that from the top of that administration. ""It couldn't have got more delusional... we know its absolute BS - Putin would never go. For him, losing power means physical death."" However, Mr Saakashvili says President Trump's stance is different and will be more effective. ""I think Trump is certainly on the right page this time because he's all about a strong America - Putin doesn't understand the language of weakness...Trump invested in the US army. And that's exactly the thing that Putin understands."" Mr Saakashvili claimed that Mr Putin personally obsesses about him: ""He has a long and malicious memory. He follows my itinerary very carefully. He knows what visas and documents I have in my passport. The guy never lets go. It always stays with him. ""He is the guy who promised to hang me by certain parts of my body. I am almost the only guy he managed to kill publicly who is still walking, so in many ways I am luckier than the others."" In 2013 Mr Saakashvili lost the Georgian election amid allegations of abuse of power. The following year he moved to Ukraine after forging a political alliance with his old student day acquaintance, Ukrainian President Pedro Poroshenko. He quickly became one of Ukraine's most popular politicians. But he then accused Mr Poroshenko of corruption.

Lamo gained notoriety in the early 2000s when he was arrested and convicted of computer fraud for hacking several high-profile companies including Microsoft and The New York Times. But he became infamous for his part in the prosecution of Manning, a former US army intelligence analyst who had befriended Lamo. Lamo reported Manning to the US military after the transgender soldier, who was known as Bradley but now identifies as a woman, admitted leaking the trove of classified military documents. It was the largest breach of its kind in US history, and included damaging videos like footage of a US airstrike killing Iraqi civilians. Manning was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013. Her sentence was later commuted by President Barack Obama and she was released last year. Lamo's father, Mario, posted a brief tribute to his son on Facebook on Friday. ""With great sadness and a broken heart I have to let know all of Adrian's friends and acquittances that he is dead. A bright mind and compassionate soul is gone, he was my beloved son,"" he wrote."

Personally, I haven't thought up a suitably catchy alternative title for the current standoff but we are living through an era of great tension. Relations between Russia and the West have been deteriorating gradually. What happened in Salisbury on a Sunday in early March can be added to a quite extraordinary list that includes the shooting down of a long-haul passenger aircraft, the invasion of a sovereign country (Ukraine), and the use of barrel bombs and complicity in the use chemical weapons in Syria. Add to that Russian aircraft flying dangerously close to crowded European airspace with transmitters switched off, interference in numerous elections and a build-up of conventional forces, and all in all you have a situation that is as every bit as worrying as 40 years ago. In his state-of-the-nation address three weeks ago, Mr Putin spoke about the development of a nuclear weapon that couldn't be shot down by any anti-missile system - he backed this up with simulated graphics showing an attack on Florida. It's remarkable in some ways that the West hasn't responded more aggressively. There are some differences between the Cold War and now. Russia is a much weaker prospect today than the Soviet Union was then. It remains a nuclear state, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, but the breakup of the USSR has meant that some of the former Soviet states, like Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, are now members of NATO. Russia is financially weaker than the Soviet Union too - it has fewer trading partners than it did, and an economy smaller than any of the UK, France and Germany. Worryingly the channels of communication and understanding that were maintained during the Cold War years are seemingly absent these days. The chances of an accidental clash or misunderstanding in Syria, the Baltics or European airspace has been so far avoided but remain a real risk. It might not be the new Cold War, but the Putin era is every bit as dangerous."

During a visit to the Middle Wallop military base in Hampshire, Harry told graduates: ""You're now going to end up flying some of the best aircraft that we have to offer. ""In certain areas, budgets are being shrunk, but essentially you guys are the assets, the aircraft is the asset, and just don't forget who you're serving and who you're supporting."" Harry's comments were praised by the former head of the Royal Navy, who said more funds were needed to deliver plans to modernise Britain's military. Former first sea lord, Lord West of Spithead said: ""Any royal 'stands into danger' when he makes comments that directly relate to political issues. ""I am delighted he is saying it because it is true. ""The Modernising Defence Programme instigated by Gavin Williamson will have to come up with more funding for defence."" Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Lord Campbell added: ""It may not quite be a royal command but it's as close as you can get. ""Servicemen and women at every level in the forces are well aware of the serious under-funding of the defence budget."" Former senior military commanders have warned MPs that years of defence cuts have left Britain's armed forces ""close to breaking"". There have been reports that parts of the military face further cuts, including the Royal Marines, regular troop numbers and amphibious assault ships. Harry - who will marry fiancee Meghan Markle in May - also alluded to the issue of reduced resources for the military when he gave a speech at a one-day conference about the mental health of veterans on Thursday. Speaking at King's College London, Harry told delegates: ""In an ever-shrinking defence community where every man and woman counts, we must consider that mental health issues are the second highest cause of absence after muscular-skeletal injury."""
2018-03-17,Theresa May has taken on critics of the Tories' record on public services with a highly personal speech about her own experiences.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180317173206/https://news.sky.com/story/im-eternally-grateful-to-the-nhs-theresa-may-will-say-11293177,"The Prime Minister declared that when she was diagnosed with diabetes ""the NHS was there for me"" and that she relies on it every day. She also pointed to her own background and said it was state schools that helped her get to university and then pursue her career in politics. Addressing the Conservative Spring Forum, she admitted public services face real challenges - but claims doubts about the Tory record are unfair. ""Some people question our motives,"" the PM said. ""They wonder whether we care enough about our NHS and schools. ""Whether we truly respect the people who work in them. And understand that people rely on them."" She said everyone in the Conservative Party cares deeply about public services, uses them, and many Tories rely on them. ""We each have our own story of how they have been there for us throughout our lives,"" she said. ""Mine starts with state schools which helped me to get into a great university and set me on course for a rewarding career."" She said that first as a councillor and now as an MP she has seen first-hand how important public services are to people from all walks of life. And in a rare comment about her diabetes, which requires her to inject insulin five times a day, she said: ""And when I was diagnosed with diabetes, the NHS was there for me. ""Skilled and compassionate, helping me every step of the way to manage my condition and live a normal life. I rely on the NHS every day and I am eternally grateful to them. ""That is an experience replicated right across the country, by people of all political persuasions. ""We know how much we care about our vital public services, and we know we have a strong record of delivery in government. ""So we might think that the public's doubts about us are unfair. But they are a political fact which we must face up to."" She added: ""So as we carry on delivering Brexit, and carry on taking the action needed to build an economy fit for the future we as a party, and as a government, must mount a determined effort to win and keep the public's trust in our management of public services. ""To do that, we need to be unafraid to speak out clearly and passionately about our values as Conservatives and what motivate us in politics. ""While always defending our record in office, we also need to accept that our public services today do face real challenges, and we must be clear about the action we are taking to help them."" In her attack on Labour's policies on public services, the PM made a veiled reference to Jeremy Corbyn's controversial stance on the Russian poisoning row. ""Time and again, they are on the wrong side of the argument and the wrong side of history,"" the Prime Minister said. But reacting to the PM's speech, Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner MP said: ""Once again Theresa May offers no solutions to the huge problems our country is facing. ""She is desperately trying to pretend that she cares about our public services but you can't trust a word that she says. ""The truth is that under this Government our public services are in crisis. NHS waiting lists have risen, schools budgets have been cut and local councils have seen their funding slashed."""

2018-03-17,"A woman who heckled the Prime Minister during her visit to Salisbury this week has told Sky News ""people want to see the evidence"" behind the nerve agent attack.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180317173206/https://news.sky.com/story/heckler-demands-theresa-may-provides-evidence-over-russian-spy-poisoning-11293209,"Salisbury resident Jessica McCarnun explained that she felt angry that Theresa May had not provided more clarity as to what makes the UK Government so certain it knows who was behind the plot. On Thursday during the Prime Minister's visit to the area around The Mill pub Ms McCarnun shouted: ""How can you accuse Russia when you have no clear evidence?"" :: Boris draws battle lines with Russia over spy attack In her first interview since the visit, the anti-poverty campaigner told Sky News: ""It isn't good enough - it's not how we conduct matters in our own courts where you present evidence to the people."" ""We need to know why she is so sure she hasn't jumped the gun."" She spoke to Sky News as forensic teams in full protective suits and gas masks worked close to the bench where Sergei Skripal and his daughter were found at 4.15pm on 4 March. :: Russian diplomat: 'We did not make novichok' Just a strip of police tape and a few yards separated unprotected members of the public and the fully kitted up officers. ""It's not what you still expect to see when you are going to a shop that says 'open for business' outside"", Ms McCarnun said. Nearly two weeks after the nerve agent poisoning the emergency services and the military continue to search for evidence or any traces of the nerve agent. On Friday evening Mr Skripal's maroon BMW was placed in a shipping container at the vehicle recovery centre on the edge of the city. It was then loaded onto a military truck and driven to the specialist research site at Porton Down, which is just north of Salisbury, where much of the evidence from the investigation is now being analysed. Both Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital. DS Nick Bailey, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, is in a serious but stable condition and is said to be ""improving"". :: Fugitive Russian who died in London 'was murdered' Counter-terror officials are continuing to investigate the alleged murder of Russian exile Nikolay Glushkov, a prominent Kremlin critic, found dead at his southwest London home a week after the poisoning of the Skripals. Police initially treated the death as unexplained, but launched a murder probe after the results of a post-mortem investigation found Mr Glushkov, 68, died from ""compression to the neck"". According to Sky sources he was found hanged, perhaps to make it look like suicide."
2018-03-17,"The Foreign Secretary drew battle lines with the Kremlin as he pointed the finger directly at Vladimir Putin for the Salisbury poisoning, saying it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" he ordered the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180317173206/https://news.sky.com/story/boris-draws-battle-lines-with-kremlin-as-putin-denies-ordering-spy-attack-11292849,"Boris Johnson chose to directly involve the Russian leader as he said the British government's quarrel was with him, not with the Russian people. He said: ""Our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin, and with his decision, and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War. ""That is why we are at odds with Russia."" :: Novichok nerve agent: What exactly is it? Mr Putin's office immediately responded, saying the comment was ""shocking and unforgivable"". Although no formal response to Theresa May's expulsion of 23 diplomats has been given, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, said that ""of course"" some British diplomats would be expelled. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the response would be ""well thought out"" and could ""come at any minute"". He went on: ""Sooner or later the British side will have to present some kind of tangible evidence. Sooner or later we will have to move into the area of supported accusations, and not just insinuations."" A Russian diplomat also claimed on Friday that the country had never had a programme called ""novichok"" and denied any production of the agent, despite one of the scientists who created it telling Sky News that only Russia could have been behind the attack. Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to the UK, confirmed that the 23 expelled diplomats would be leaving on 20 March, as ordered by Mrs May, but accused the Government of lying about the condition of the Skripals. He said: ""(Britain) is in difficult situation because of Brexit and it has strong influence on the Government. The Government is trying to find distracting manoeuvres to take the stress off and of course this kind of aggression, political provocation that they are doing against Russia is very much needed."" He added: ""The British keep hiding the medical assessment from us, we do not have access to the patients, we do not have a chance to talk to the doctors. ""No one has even published the photo (of the Skripals). They may be alive, maybe not, maybe nothing happened at all."" ""We are expected to take everything on trust, and that is inadmissible."" A former high=profile oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, has described the Kremlin as a 'criminal gang'. Mr Khodorkovsky was once Russia's wealthiest man until he was arrested and jailed for fraud in 2003, before being released ten years later. Speaking to Sky News, he said:""Either it (the poisoning) was done with Putin's consent or by the secret services, who are a criminal gang, have done it without his approval. He said the best way to deal with them is to ""attack their soft spot - which is the money they have"". The investigation continues in Salisbury, where several cordons remain in place as police continue to hunt for vital evidence. :: Jeremy Corbyn again refuses to directly blame Russia for Salisbury poison attack Mr Skripal's car was taken away by the military, in the back of a large metal container, and flanked by a police motorcade. And the diplomatic row threatened to get close to Britain before the World Cup, as Arsenal drew Russian side CSKA Moscow in the quarter-finals of the Europa League. The first leg will be held in London, with the team going to Moscow to face them in the second leg, as the merging worlds of sport and politics collide again. The last time Moscow played Arsenal, the game was attended by Andrei Lugovoi, the man suspected of the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. He and Dmitri Kovtun met Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in London and attended the match at the Emirates stadium hours later. Litvinenko told a retired Metropolitan Police officer in hospital prior to his death that he drank tea from a silver teapot in the presence of Lugovoi, but it was ""nearly cold"" and he did not like the taste so only took three or four sips. Meanwhile, Russia has opened its own criminal investigations into the murder of Nikolai Glushkov, who was found dead at his home in New Malden on Monday, and what it called the ""murder"" of Yulia Skripal, who remains in a critical condition in hospital after the nerve agent attack. Global support for the UK continues, as European Council president Donald Tusk spoke with Mrs May to begin formulating a European Union response. In Paris, Emmanuel Macron met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the pair said they would be discussing the spy attack and offered their support to Britain."

The Portobello Business Centre estimates that, in the nine months since, some companies in the immediate vicinity of the tower have lost up to 70% of trade, mainly due to a reduction in footfall. Allen Pluck, chief executive of the Portobello Business Centre, told Sky News, ""We have now unfortunately nine months on bailiffs turning up for collection of debt and business closure. ""If I'm being brutal here, the last thing this community needs is the loss of its business community, because it then just makes it even more difficult for the community to stand up and get back on its feet."" The Garden Bar is a pub situated a few hundred metres from the tower. On the night of the fire, emergency services commandeered it as a place for them to rest, recharge and bring survivors. The charred remains of Grenfell Tower are still visible from its main window. ""It's been a struggle since reopening,"" Bardi Berisha, the bar's general manager told Sky News, ""We've had a lot of cancellations. You can't blame them, no one wanted to come and have a drink or celebrate."" :: Grenfell Tower doors found to resist fire for half as long as expected Work has begun to cover up the tower, which Mr Berisha hope will encourage more customers to come back to the area and back to his bar. ""I don't think anyone wants to see the tower in this condition,"" he said, ""It brings back a lot of bad memories of what happened before."" The Government and local London authorities have already provided financial compensation to local residents including businesses. This week, the London Mayor's office pledged a further ¬£65,000 specifically for small businesses. But in addition, the Portobello Business Centre would like to see a moratorium on bank loans and utility bills for the companies that have been worst affected. One local business owner, who did not want to be named, told Sky News that as the police investigation into the fire had not yet concluded, he had been unable to claim for loss of earnings from his insurance company. He estimated he'd lost more than ¬£50,000 of business, as the roads around his garage has been closed leading many customers to believe he was shut. ""It's taken a toll,"" he said, ""It's been tough.

A jury found him guilty of the attempted murder of 93 people, who escaped with their lives when a fireball engulfed a Tube carriage at Parsons Green on 15 September last year. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said it was ""a matter of luck that the device did not function as intended"". The bomb was made from triacetone triperoxide (TATP), also known as ""Mother of Satan"", an extremely volatile homemade explosive. Experts told the Old Bailey that even a gram of TATP had the potential to cause serious injury. The Parsons Green device contained 400g of the high explosive. Hassan packed 300g of TATP into Tupperware container and another 100g in a glass vase. The containers were packed into a white plastic bucket, and carried inside a Lidl bag. The tub had been packed with 2.2kg of knives, screwdrivers, screws, bolts, nails and other metal items designed to cause ""maximum harm and carnage in the surrounding area,"" Ms Morgan said. The District Line train was packed with commuters when the bomb partially detonated at the height of the morning rush. ""The partial explosion caused a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns, many ran in fear and panic,"" Ms Morgan said. ""They were fortunate - had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage. Those in close proximity to the device may well have been killed."" Hassan got off the train two minutes before the explosion and switched trains four times on his way to Dover. He was only caught by chance when a sharp-eyed police officer spotted him sitting outside the passenger terminal at Dover, 24 hours after the attack. When he was searched, he was carrying ¬£2,320 in cash and claimed to police that he was waiting for a friend. The teenager arrived in Britain illegally in October 2015, in the back of a lorry from Calais. He claimed asylum, telling officials that he was in fear of ISIS, who he said had kidnapped him and other youngsters and trained them to kill. Interviewed by immigration officials on 18 January 2016 at Lunar House in Croydon, Hassan was asked if he had ever had any training with ISIS. He told the officials: ""They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based."" However, sources have told Sky News that the teenager, who arrived in Britain two years before his attack, is not thought to have been sent to the UK by the terrorist group. During his trial, he told the court he had made up the story, because he actually came from a safe area of northern Iraq and feared he would have been refused permission to stay. He said that he had picked up the story from fellow asylum-seekers at the makeshift camp nicknamed ""the jungle"" in Calais. He was referred to the Prevent de-radicalisation programme after disappearing on a trip to Wales eight months after his immigration interview in 2016. The jury was heard from a former tutor of Hassan, who said he had blamed the West for the death of his parents in Iraq and that it was his duty to hate the British. The teenager showed no reaction when the jury found him guilty of attempted murder. He will be sentenced at a later date."

""There has never been any programme under the group name 'novichok' in the Russian Federation,"" he said. ""Back to 1992, Russia stopped all the activities in the area of military chemistry. ""Last year we completed the destruction of all chemical arsenals and the completion of this programme was duly certified by the OPCW."" Asked whether his country had destroyed all its chemical weapons in line with the internationally recognised Chemical Weapons Convention, Mr Shulgin said: ""Absolutely. No question."" :: Fugitive Russian who died in London 'was murdered' He said the first time he had heard the word ""novichok"" used in relation to a chemical agent was when Prime Minister Theresa May mentioned it in Parliament. ""Just the day when Theresa May made the announcement,"" he said. ""I've never heard about this programme, about this novichok agent. Never."" Referring to the broad accusation by Britain that Russia was behind the chemical attack in Salisbury, Mr Shulgin did not hide his irritation at what he sees as a lack of due process. ""Russia was summoned for our explanation - it was a kind of ultimatum. 'You Russians you have only 24 hours and you need to respond - actually to confess - to your sins',"" he said. ""First, Russia is not a country to be presented with ultimatums. Secondly, how could we respond without any proof, without any evidence to substantiate the claims; the unjust accusations levelled against Russia? ""It was very bellicose rhetoric: Russia is accused without any proof. Our reaction was to say: let's drop this rhetoric, let's drop this practice of ultimatums and let's be abiding by the international law."" Mr Shulgin said that Russia did not feel isolated, despite broad Western backing for the UK in its assertion that the Kremlin was behind the Salisbury attack. He suggested that privately, some Western diplomats shared his scepticism. ""Believe me, there are many delegations even among the western group, western countries, that share our standpoint, our point of view about the necessity for Russians to be provided with some kind of stuff to be able to respond,"" he said. ""We are unable to respond to specific accusations without given materials. ""I spoke with some delegations and they shared with me their scepticism about this play by the British government; it seems because they are in NATO and EU they are bound to follow the line."" Speaking from the Russian Embassy in The Hague, Mr Shulgin said the British evidence should be put before the OPCW but claimed that the British rejected the idea. ""So we suggested to our British colleagues to calm down and to use this opportunity in The Hague provided by the Chemical [Weapons] Convention,"" he said. ""Not immediately but the next day after the expiration of this so-called ultimatum, our British colleagues have even more toughened their stance. ""They blankly rejected our proposals."" :: Boris draws battle lines with Kremlin as Putin denies ordering spy attack The British have stated they are cooperating with the OPCW in line with their duty as part of the Salisbury investigation. The OPCW has declined all requests for an interviews but released a statement on Friday saying: ""As was stated by the UK authorities, the OPCW offered technical assistance for the UK's investigation and the OPCW expects some action will be taken soon."" The statement added that there was ""no record of the novichok group of nerve agents having been declared by a state party to the Chemical Weapons Convention"". The OPCW, which is essentially the global chemical weapons watchdog, announced late last year that Russia had successfully destroyed its chemical weapon stockpiles. It is still working with other countries, including the United States, to destroy theirs. Mr Shulgin said that OPCW officials were welcome to inspect suspected Russian chemical weapon sites as part of the investigation. He said: ""Yes, there are specific procedures. You mentioned the idea of inspection. This is called under the [Chemical Weapons] Convention, 'challenging inspection'. ""So if the British people suspect Russia of having a concealed arsenal, they have the right to ask for the 'challenging inspection'. So they will be welcome to go to Russia providing that there is sufficient evidence that their suspicions are very well based."" Mr Shulgin said he expected the UK's research facility at Porton Down would also be opened for inspection. ""Yes, because this novichok agent is very well known by the specialists working in Porton Down,"" he said, laughing. Asked how he would characterise UK-Russian relations at the moment, he said: ""Very bad. Very bad and the prospect is not bright at all. So following the decision by UK government to slap sanctions on the Russian Federation, including expulsion of Russian diplomats, you should not be surprised that Russia will retaliate."" On Wednesday, Sky News spoke to an exiled Russian chemist who claimed to have helped develop the novichok agent in Russia in the 1970s and 1980s. Dr Vil Mirzayanov told Sky News that he had worked on the weapons programme which produced the novichok group of agents which he said were ""the same as nerve gas but 10 times - at least 10 times - more powerful"". But Mr Shulgin said: ""Lies. He is lying. In 1992 Russia brought an end to all kinds of chemical researches, development, work. No developments, no research after 1992."" He repeated that Russia had never produced any agents with the codename ""novichok"". ""We are interested, no less and even more than the British to shed a light, and the establishment of truth is of major importance,"" he said. ""These could turn up interesting results for our good British colleagues."""
2018-03-17,Russia is kicking out 23 British diplomats - many believed to be intelligence officers - as the row intensifies over the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180317173206/https://news.sky.com/story/british-ambassador-summoned-to-russian-ministry-11293252,"The move follows the UK's expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats - thought to be intelligence agents - earlier this week, after Moscow failed to respond to a deadline set by Theresa May for the Kremlin to explain whether it was behind the nerve agent attack. The British ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned for talks with the Russian foreign ministry on Saturday, and Moscow has said the UK diplomats must leave the country within one week. Sky's Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall tweeted: ""I understand the 23 expelled British diplomats are intelligence officers. Looks like Russia has gone for exact tit-for-tat."" Russia has also withdrawn permission for Britain to open a general consulate in St Petersburg and says it will be closing the British Council in Russia. Additionally, the Russian foreign ministry has said it reserves the right to take other measures against Britain in the event of further hostile steps from London. Following the meeting, Mr Bristow said: ""This crisis has arisen as a result of an appalling attack in the UK, the attempted murder of two people using a chemical weapon developed in Russia and not declared by Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) as Russia is obliged to do under the Chemical Weapons Act. ""The Prime Minister set out a number of measures which we took to defend ourselves against this type of attack. We gave Russia the opportunity to explain how the material got to Salisbury and we asked Russia to declare that material to the OPCW. Russia did neither, therefore we announced certain steps."" Fugitive Russian who died in London 'was murdered' Mr Bristow reiterated that the UK has no dispute with the Russian people, but said ""we will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves, our allies and our values against an attack of this sort which is not only an attack on the UK but also on the international rules based systems on which all countries - including Russia - depend for their safety"". Earlier in the week, Mr Bristow met with Russian deputy foreign minister Vladimir Titov, however there were conflicting reports over the reason for the meeting. Russian news agencies reported that it was to discuss the poisoning, while the UK embassy in Russia said it was a pre-planned meeting. However, Mr Bristow confirmed that the attack on the former Russian spy and his daughter was discussed in the meeting, saying: ""I reiterated the points made by Prime Minister May that we expect by the end of today an account from the Russian state as to how this material came to be used in Salisbury."" The midnight deadline then passed without comment from Russia, prompting the UK expulsion of the Russian diplomats. Russia has continued to deny possessing the deadly nerve agent - novichok - confirmed to have been used in the 4 March attack. When asked by Sky News whether Russia had destroyed all its chemical weapons in line with the internationally recognised Chemical Weapons Convention, Russian diplomat Alexander Shulgin said: ""Absolutely. No question."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off the nerve agent attack. In response, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov called Mr Johnson's claims ""shocking and unforgivable"". Mr Lavrov had earlier said that Moscow had ""stopped paying attention"" to the poisoning claims, and called UK's refusal to work with Russia a ""violation of international agreements"". Russian elections are due to take place on Sunday, with Mr Putin seeking a fourth term in office after being in power for 18 years. He is widely predicted to win."
2018-03-17,"For the Russian President Vladimir Putin, a good enemy is better than a bad friend.

There's a notion in political circles in Russia: if you want something from Putin, don't put him under pressure to get it. He doesn‚Äôt like to be seen as weak. Weak is bad. Weak is the worst possible thing. If he's forced to act under pressure, he doesn't like it because he doesn't want to be seen as being pushed around - that's weak. So if Britain wants Russia to explain itself, tough talk and demands may not be the best way to get answers. Russia doesn't like the language of ultimatums. Britain, France, Germany and the US have issued a joint statement condemning Russia. That‚Äôs strong and the message hasn't been lost in Russia that Britain is serious about all this. But the point is Putin sees himself as stronger and the alliance of the West as utterly predictable - of course they will issue statements and bandy together. Russia has China and friends in the Middle East. Moreover, it's not like it's the first time Russia has faced international condemnation over its actions. Remember: Ukraine and Crimea were not that long ago. Certainly the Kremlin believes it can just ride this out. And let's not forget there's a presidential election looming here. What‚Äôs going on provides Mr Putin with an argument to his electorate: ""Choose me, because the whole world is against us."""

Her father Mohamed Moustafa said his ""angel"" had also been the victim of another attack several months beforehand, but that nothing had been done to catch those responsible. In the attack in February, the teenager was allegedly punched several times during a confrontation with a group of girls. After getting on a bus near the Victoria Centre shopping complex, it is claimed the group followed her and were threatening and abusive towards her. Ms Moustafa was taken to hospital where she was put in an induced coma before her death. Speaking about the alleged attack, Mr Moustafa said: ""These people came up to her and said 'Black Rose' and she said 'no my name is Mariam' and they started to hit her."" He said up to 10 people were attacking her but could not be certain as there were ""so many"". The student had been involved in another incident with her younger sister in August last year, he said, in which they were also attacked by a group of girls. Mr Moustafa, 50, said nothing was done due to ""no CCTV"" being available and because the girls were not known to them. The teenager's death has sparked outrage in Egypt, where her family comes from, with the country's embassy calling on those responsible to be ""brought to justice swiftly"". Speaking about support from Egypt, Mr Moustafa said: ""People have given me very good support. It's not fair because I live in this country and the support should come from this country as well."" Nottinghamshire Police has said there is no evidence so far to suggest the teenager's death was the result of a hate crime, although officers are ""keeping an open mind"". Mr Moustafa said: ""I want justice for my daughter - not just my daughter but also so this doesn't happen to another girl or another boy. ""My daughter was like an angel. She would do anything for anyone - a very kind girl. She meant the world to me. She tried to help anyone - if they needed money or anything, she would always help. ""All of my family - my son, my daughter - they have all been crying after what happened. It's not fair. ""I needed some help and it came after, when she died."" A 17-year-old girl has been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and has been bailed pending further investigation."

2018-03-17,British counter-terror police have launched a murder investigation into the death of Russian Nikolai Glushkov in London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180317173206/https://news.sky.com/story/british-police-launch-murder-probe-into-death-of-russian-nikolai-glushkov-in-london-11292406,"The Metropolitan Police said a post-mortem examination found the cause of the 68-year-old's death was compression to the neck. According to Sky sources he was found hanged, perhaps to make it look like suicide. Mr Glushkov, who had received political asylum in Britain after being jailed in Russia for money laundering and fraud, was found dead at his home in New Malden, southwest London on Monday. Scotland Yard said its Counter-Terrorism Command is leading the investigation ""because of the associations Mr Glushkov is believed to have had"". :: Russian diplomat: 'We did not make novichok' Police say there is ""nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that he [Mr Glushkov] was poisoned"". Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in the city earlier this month, an attack that Britain has blamed on Moscow. Russia has denied any involvement. Earlier, Russia's Investigative Committee, which reports directly to President Vladimir Putin, announced it had opened a murder investigation into Mr Glushkov's death. On the Salisbury case, the committee said in the same statement that it will probe the ""attempted premeditated murder"" of Yulia Skripal, adding it was ready to co-operate with the British authorities. One of Mr Glushkov's friends was late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who fled to London in 2000 following a row with Vladimir Putin. Mr Glushkov had also worked for Mr Berezovsky's LogoVAZ car company. He was arrested in 1999 and put on trial for allegedly embezzling $7m (¬£5m) from Aeroflot, and sentenced in 2004 to three years, three months in prison. Russian media said he was granted political asylum in Britain in 2010. But his case was revived by a Moscow court last year, which sentenced him in absentia to eight years for allegedly stealing more than $122m (¬£88m) from Aeroflot. The Russian embassy said it had sought Mr Glushkov's extradition in 2015 ""for committing a number of severe financial offences on the territory of Russia"", but the British government refused. After Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March 2013, Mr Glushkov told The Guardian he would ""never believe"" his friend took his own life. An inquest into Mr Berezovsky's death recorded an open verdict. Mr Berezovsky was also a friend of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. Police and MI5 are expected to examine allegations that a series of deaths on UK soil, including the Berezovsky case, may be linked to Russia."
2018-03-17,The Information Commissioner's Office is to investigate a possible data breach affecting more than 50 million Facebook users. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180317173206/https://news.sky.com/story/investigation-after-claims-50m-facebook-users-affected-by-data-breach-11294042,"It comes as a whistleblower told a newspaper how Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump's election team, used personal information taken without permission in early 2014 to build a system that could profile US voters so they could be targeted with personalised political advertisements. The company is owned by hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer and was led at the time by Mr Trump's key adviser Steve Bannon. Christopher Wylie, who worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, told The Observer: ""We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on."" The paper says documents show that by late 2015, Facebook had discovered that information had been gathered on an unprecedented scale that affected 50 million people. According to the New York Times, some of the information could still be found online. It said journalists had viewed some of the raw data which was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife. The app was developed by Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan through his company Global Science Research (GSR) in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica. Hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use. But as well as the data, the app also reportedly collected the information of their Facebook friends, allowing a massive data bank to be built. Cambridge Analytica told The Observer that its contract with GSR stipulated that Mr Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not. The paper quotes a company spokesman saying GSR was ""led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractural commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections"". SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been ""knowingly breached"" and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, the spokesman said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election. The Information Commissioner's Office commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: ""We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used. ""It's part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people's personal information to micro target voters. ""It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy. ""We are continuing to invoke all of our powers and are pursuing a number of live lines of inquiry. Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously"". Meanwhile, a second investigation is taking place in the US. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey posted a link to the New York Times article on Twitter, saying: ""Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. We are launching an investigation."" Facebook has suspended Cambridge Analytica while it carries out its own investigation and has warned it may take legal action against the company. Facebook's legal counsel Paul Grewal said in a blog: ""When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data. ""Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims."""

The question is, what happens next? In its statement the Russians made it clear this may not be the end of the matter - saying they ""reserved the right to take other measures against hostile steps from London"". They are sending a message to London that if Britain wants to keep this going they'll pack a punch back and maybe more. But Russia's tit-for-tat measures could have been a lot worse. At the British embassy in Moscow, 23 members of staff are now busy packing their bags. That's no surprise. But even before the announcement, a wise man might have told staff at the British Council to get their suitcases out as well. Russia hasn't much cared for the British Council and its activities for some time - clamping down on it in the wake of the Litvinenko tit-for-tat retaliations. Now it's being closed completely. :: Novichok inventor says hundreds could be at risk for years Russia has called the body ""unregulated"". The British Council promotes cultural and educational links between countries and operates all around the world. Russia is suspicious of it, and in any case isn't particularly interested in promoting cultural ties after Britain announced no ministers or members of the Royal Family would be attending this year's football World Cup in Russia. Britain's aim with its measures was to hurt Vladimir Putin by hitting the oligarchs in London who are close to him. Britain hopes by clamping down on the oligarchs they will pull the plug on support for President Putin. So you might have expected Russia would hit out at British business interests in Russia such as BP. In the event, that hasn't happened. We should now watch for the diplomatic language used by both countries. It has been verging on the hysterical of late. Russia likening Britain's Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to a ""fishwife"" for saying Russia should ""shut up and go away"". It would be funny if it weren't for the fact that this is two nuclear countries screaming insults at each other. Russia's retaliatory measures provides a chance for things to calm down. The Russians will be too busy presenting statesman Vladimir as the victor for the next few days. They will want foreign media to be focusing on election success, not spies."

The first attack took place in April 1983 when McKenna raped a 21-year-old woman as she walked home near to the High Level Bridge in Gateshead. The victim reported her ordeal to the police but officers could not identify her attacker. Five years later, he struck again in the Manors area of Newcastle, but police did not link the crimes and McKenna was not identified.

Sky's defence correspondent Alistair Bunkall said he understands measures are now under way to protect some Russian exiles from harm on British soil. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force had given ""security advice to individuals"" but refused to comment on whether they were Russians. A post-mortem found the cause of Mr Glushkov's death was compression to the neck, prompting police to launch a murder investigation. He was found hanged, perhaps to make it look like suicide, Sky sources have confirmed. His death came days after the attempted poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, but police have not linked the two incidents. Mr Glushkov, a prominent critic of the Kremlin, had received political asylum in Britain after being jailed in Russia for money laundering and fraud. :: Exiled Russian businessman hires bodyguards after spy attack Scotland Yard said its counter-terrorism command is leading the investigation ""because of the associations Mr Glushkov is believed to have had"". Russia's Investigative Committee, which reports directly to President Vladimir Putin, has also opened a murder investigation into Mr Glushkov's death. The Russian embassy said it had sought Mr Glushkov's extradition in 2015 ""for committing a number of severe financial offences on the territory of Russia"", but the British government refused. One of Mr Glushkov's friends was late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who fled to London in 2000 following a row with Mr Putin. After Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March 2013, Mr Glushkov told The Guardian he would ""never believe"" his friend took his own life. An inquest into Mr Berezovsky's death recorded an open verdict. Mr Berezovsky was also a friend of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in London in 2006. Police and MI5 are expected to examine allegations that a series of deaths on UK soil, including the Berezovsky case, may be linked to Russia."

As the fallout from the poisoning unravels in the international arena, British police are continuing their investigation into the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia. They have renewed appeals for information about a burgundy BMW belonging to the former spy, which is believed to have been driven around Salisbury on the morning of the poisoning."

The rental store branch announced on social media it would be shutting last week, and began a liquidation sale of its stock that will continue into April. ""Kelli and her crew have done a phenomenal job and will be greatly missed,"" Blockbuster Alaska wrote on Facebook. ""Thank you SO VERY much North Pole for your years of support."" Local media reported that about 40 people gathered at the store on the first day of its sale last week - hoping both to pick up a bargain and show their gratitude to a local institution. On Facebook, Rachel Stark wrote that her family had always used the Blockbuster and would ""continue to do so until the end"". ""We and our kids enjoy the social experience as in going outdoors to get something,"" she said. ""I feel like I am losing my childhood,"" Sonja Yatlin commented.

Alaska still has Blockbusters #blockbusterandchill #wherehaveyoubeen #wemeetagain #blockbuster A post shared by  Orion Briel (@beardedorion) on Mar 30, 2017 at 11:18pm PDT Three of the remaining Blockbusters in the US have closed this year, including another Alaska store in Wasilla and one in Texas. With those branches gone, there are now just six US stores set to continue operating. Four are in Alaska, including two in the state's biggest city, Anchorage, and two others in Oregon. At its peak Blockbuster had 9,000 stores in the US, with $6bn in annual revenue and a new store opening every 17 hours in 1989. But the growth of Netflix and other video streaming technologies proved a death knell for the chain, and its distinctive yellow-and-blue branding is now associated with a nostalgia for 90s evenings when watching a movie required leaving the sofa. Of all the remaining US stores four are now in Alaska. Movie watchers in the state have continued to rent from the stores thanks, in part, to poor internet reach in the state and tough weather conditions which mean it's preferable to stay inside. North Pole, a town of about 2,200 people near Fairbanks in interior Alaska was named by a property development company in 1944, in the hope of attracting a toy manufacturer. A factory was never built, but North Pole keeps Christmas decorations up all year round and each year receives 400,000 letters addressed to Santa Claus, all of which are answered by a team of community volunteers. Santa Claus, a local celebrity, wrote on Facebook that he was sad to see the Blockbuster close."

Personally, I haven't thought up a suitably catchy alternative title for the current standoff but we are living through an era of great tension. Relations between Russia and the West have been deteriorating gradually. What happened in Salisbury on a Sunday in early March can be added to a quite extraordinary list that includes the shooting down of a long-haul passenger aircraft, the invasion of a sovereign country (Ukraine), and the use of barrel bombs and complicity in the use chemical weapons in Syria. Add to that Russian aircraft flying dangerously close to crowded European airspace with transmitters switched off, interference in numerous elections and a build-up of conventional forces, and all in all you have a situation that is as every bit as worrying as 40 years ago. In his state-of-the-nation address three weeks ago, Mr Putin spoke about the development of a nuclear weapon that couldn't be shot down by any anti-missile system - he backed this up with simulated graphics showing an attack on Florida. It's remarkable in some ways that the West hasn't responded more aggressively. There are some differences between the Cold War and now. Russia is a much weaker prospect today than the Soviet Union was then. It remains a nuclear state, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, but the breakup of the USSR has meant that some of the former Soviet states, like Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, are now members of NATO. Russia is financially weaker than the Soviet Union too - it has fewer trading partners than it did, and an economy smaller than any of the UK, France and Germany. Worryingly the channels of communication and understanding that were maintained during the Cold War years are seemingly absent these days. The chances of an accidental clash or misunderstanding in Syria, the Baltics or European airspace has been so far avoided but remain a real risk. It might not be the new Cold War, but the Putin era is every bit as dangerous."

The fake accounts have struck hundreds of times over the last two months, with the most successful taking away as much as ¬£50,000 a day before using a range of exchanges to convert the proceeds into cash. :: Twitter to prohibit range of cryptocurrency ads The scam takes place after a high-profile Twitter account posts, then an impersonating account with the same image and display name responds in the thread offering to give away cryptocurrency. Claiming that they want to support the cryptocurrency community, the scammers in the guise of the celebrities ask users to send a token sum to an address they provide in order to receive a larger amount back. These posts can appear legitimate on first sight. Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX, and Vitalik Buterin, the principal inventor of cryptocurrency ethereum, have been among the most commonly impersonated accounts. Mr Buterin has since had to change his display name to note that he is not giving away any of the ethereum cryptocurrency. In the largest scams, Sky News has observed hundreds of fake and automated accounts retweeting and liking the scam post, some responding with claims that they received money back; all providing the scammer with legitimacy and encouraging other users to take part. Fake tweets pretending that the offer is real. pic.twitter.com/w5UBFGcmWF Despite the apparent simplicity of the scam, Sky News has established that some individuals have fallen for it. Our analysis of the ethereum blockchain - which transparently tracks and stores all transactions made with the cryptocurrency - showed thousands of pounds being sent to the addresses posted in these scams. While it was immediately clear that none of the users' addresses which sent money to the scammers had received any back, it wasn't obvious whether these were genuine transactions or whether the scammers manufactured fake transactions - similar to the interactions from the bot accounts - which were designed to encourage others to take part. Sky News and Chainalysis - which works with Europol to help police track down the supposedly anonymous users of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum - searched through the histories of those addresses to see if they had received seed funds from a similar address, or if they were indeed legitimate victim transactions. Seems this scam is happening commonly involving a lot of high-profile Twitter users. Not possible to see if the payments are genuine as nobody seems to be responding complaining about their funds being stolen. pic.twitter.com/EvRxmkYcgy Our investigation found that some of these scams did indeed feature seed transfers, but these curiously were only utilised by the least successful of the scams. For the most successful - which received thousands of pounds from their victims - not a single transaction could be confidently flagged as a seed transfer. Many were actually sent directly from the cryptocurrency exchanges where they appeared to have been bought and stored, suggesting that the individuals falling for the scam were novice users. Graphs produced by Chainalysis show how the funds belonging to victims' accounts were independently sourced, displaying separate clusters of transactions rather than anything which the scammer had seeded. Alvaro Sevilla of Chainalysis told Sky News this was not easy to establish, as following the transaction histories of a victim addresses requires an exponentially increasing search. However, our investigation assessed that it was unlikely the scammers had used a sophisticated scheme of cryptocurrency laundering to conceal a single source and convince others to take part in the scam, as any potential victim who was sceptical enough to undertake an in-depth search of those transactions would also have noticed that the tweets did not originate from legitimate accounts. What was more intriguing however was the way the cryptocurrency was handled by the scammers when they attempted to withdraw the funds. Chainalysis detected significantly different methodologies in terms of how the scammers attempted to launder their cryptocurrency, and to which exchanges their funds were sent in exchange for cash - suggesting that the campaigns were being run by copycats rather than a single conspiracy with an established method of operating. Mr Sevilla, a senior developer at Chainalysis, said: ""The differences in the way these funds are being handled, such as different withdrawal patterns and the use of different exchanges, is indicative of different copycats attempting to do the same scam. ""The simplicity of the attack, which requires little technical knowledge and preparation, also leads us to believe it's a trend more than an organised attack."" Although impersonating another account on Twitter in a misleading or deceptive manner is a violation of its rules and may lead to a permanent suspension, the cryptocurrency scams have continued largely because these rules have not been quickly enforced. Accounts using the celebrity status of individuals from billionaire Musk through to Mr Buterin - ethereum's principle inventor - have continued to operate on the platform, despite conning Twitter users out of their money. One fake Elon Musk account reported by Sky News remained active on the site for almost a fortnight, despite Twitter acknowledging our report of the scam. Twitter has confirmed receipt of my report, but the account impersonating Elon Musk and scamming people is still up. pic.twitter.com/oB5O7Y1oc6 A spokesperson for Twitter told Sky News: ""We are aware of coordinated spam activity around cryptocurrencies and related software products. The malicious use of automation, impersonation, and other deliberate attempts to deceive are prohibited under the Twitter Rules. ""Our teams are overseeing a technological process of batch suspending these networks of offending accounts at scale and at speed. If anyone sees suspicious account behaviour relating to these issues, they should block the user immediately and report them directly to our dedicated support teams."" Earlier this month, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned that cryptocurrencies faced a regulatory crackdown, stating that the time had come to ""regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities."" Following changes by Facebook and Google, Twitter is also understood to be considering a policy change towards cryptocurrency advertising in the near future."

""Mr Parkinson's position is that the MoD breached its statutory responsibility to provide him with the care he requires,"" said Yogi Amin, from lawyers Irwin Mitchell. Ben is not allowed to talk to the media because he remains a serving soldier. But his mother, Diane Dernie, told the paper she believes there has been ""deception"" from the authorities. ""Under an agreement reached with us and the NHS in 2016, the MoD is supposed to provide Ben's wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs and specialist medical services not available to us locally on the NHS,"" she said. ""We have learned, contrary to what the Army has told us, that charities have provided two of Ben's wheelchairs from funds donated by the public. This was a deception on their part. ""We cannot suffer in silence any longer. We need a long-term care plan in place for Ben now."" Mrs Dernie said one of Ben's wheelchairs, which he used between 2013 and 2016, had been provided by Help For Heroes. ""Senior officers suggested to us that they'd provided the chair,"" she told the paper. ""How could the Army palm off the responsibility for providing it on to a charity? That's not right. ""Then in 2016 they admitted there was no budget for wheelchairs. Ben waited 15 months for a new one, which, as I understand, also came from a charity."" According to the paper, the MOD did not dispute Mrs Dernie's account. In a statement sent to Sky News, an MOD spokesman said: ""We can assure Lance Bombardier Parkinson and his family that we are working hard to establish his new care package as quickly as we can.

The list takes into account jobs, life expectancy, schools, broadband speed, culture, community spirit and local shops, among other things. York boasts trendy cafes and restaurants, innovative tech and media firms, and a dynamic workforce. The methodology uses statistics, but also the knowledge of The Sunday Times's expert panel. ""Choosing the right location to put down roots is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make,"" Helen Davies, The Sunday Times Home editor, said. ""Which is why we're here to help - and what Best Places to Live in Britain is all about. ""We're championing York this year in honour of its bold approach to bringing the historic city into the 21st century without losing any character or community spirit."" Bermondsey was named the best place to live in London, and Frome was named the best place to live in the South West. Melrose topped the list for Scotland while Mumbles took the top spot for Wales.

It is the first time a UK teacher has claimed the award from education charity the Varkey Foundation. Ms Zafirakou teaches art and textiles, which she says are ""powerful subjects that help the students unlock all of their language barriers"". Children in the area of northwest London where she works face complex challenges - including violent crime and gangs that work to recruit young people on their way home from school, she said. High levels of deprivation also mean it is common for many families to live in the same house, leaving pupils struggling with stressful home environments and unable to find a quiet place to do homework. Ms Zafirakou has introduced after-school and weekend support for children to give them a safe place to work, and has also worked with police and students to protect pupils as they are leaving school. Pupils at Alperton speak 35 different languages, and Ms Zafirakou has worked to learn a few words from many of them so she can communicate better with everyone at the school. She has also started a boxing club, keeping students off the streets after lessons and helping them build confidence and self-defence skills. The Global @TeacherPrize winner 2018 will be announced today at the @GESForum in Dubai.

""Building relationships with your students is absolutely key."" Alperton College is now among the top 5% of schools in the country in terms of accreditation and qualifications - a remarkable improvement since Ms Zafirakou started at the school, the Varkey Foundation said. ""My calling in life is to make sure that every single child reaches their full potential. That I unlock that,"" Ms Zafirakou said. ""That I make sure, whatever it is that they need to achieve, I make it happen for them."""

There's a notion in political circles in Russia: if you want something from Putin, don't put him under pressure to get it. He doesn‚Äôt like to be seen as weak. Weak is bad. Weak is the worst possible thing. If he's forced to act under pressure, he doesn't like it because he doesn't want to be seen as being pushed around - that's weak. So if Britain wants Russia to explain itself, tough talk and demands may not be the best way to get answers. Russia doesn't like the language of ultimatums. Britain, France, Germany and the US have issued a joint statement condemning Russia. That‚Äôs strong and the message hasn't been lost in Russia that Britain is serious about all this. But the point is Putin sees himself as stronger and the alliance of the West as utterly predictable - of course they will issue statements and bandy together. Russia has China and friends in the Middle East. Moreover, it's not like it's the first time Russia has faced international condemnation over its actions. Remember: Ukraine and Crimea were not that long ago. Certainly the Kremlin believes it can just ride this out. And let's not forget there's a presidential election looming here. What‚Äôs going on provides Mr Putin with an argument to his electorate: ""Choose me, because the whole world is against us."""
2018-03-18,"She was built before the Second World War, and is now a permanent reminder of British naval history, sitting right on the heart of the Thames.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180318182356/https://news.sky.com/story/historic-warship-hms-belfast-reaches-80th-birthday-11295113,"This weekend HMS Belfast is celebrating 80 years since her launch, on St Patrick's Day 1938, with a series of events including a private ceremony for veterans who served on her in various campaigns - D Day, the Arctic Convoys, the Korean War and the Cold War. The celebrations also involve the cutting of a nine-tiered cake - inspired by the ship's nine decks - baked specially by the winner of the Great British Bake Off 2017, Sophie Faldo. John Harrison, aged 104, is now the ship's oldest surviving veteran. ""It's a warm feeling ship, it really is,"" he said. ""Right from the word go."" Launched in 1938, the Belfast was quickly pressed into service against Germany once the Second World War began the following year. And John was on board when she suffered her first attack - hitting a German magnetic mine. ""Suddenly, the lights went out,"" he said. ""My head felt heavy, the deck bounced about a foot and I thought 'That's strange'. The lights had gone out, it bounced about three times, we eventually got back on to deck and they said we've just hit a mine and been blown up 16 foot!"" But the Belfast was repaired and thanks to her refit, became one of the most advanced ships in the British fleet, with better firepower, radar and armour. By 1943 was ready to take part in the Battle of the North Cape in icy Arctic seas. Veterans describe clinging on to whatever they could find on deck as towering waves smashed into the deck. Sailors faced pack ice, howling winds and extreme cold as they escorted much-needed supply boats to Russia. The end of World War Two didn't see the end of HMS Belfast's service though - she was soon off to the Korean War, taking with her Ron Yardley, now 89. ""It's impossible to describe the noise when the six-inch guns fired. The blast used to take the ship over and back again,"" Ron told Sky News. An American admiral in Korea agreed that the Belfast's artillery was impressive, reportedly praising her as a ""straight-shooting ship"". When the Belfast was eventually retired from service in 1963, the government had decided to scrap her - but a private trust campaigned successfully for her preservation and since 1971 she has been moored on the River Thames. Ngaire Bushell, public engagement and learning officer at the Imperial War Museum, which runs HMS Belfast, says she's a special ship. ""I think it was because many of the crew had such fond memories of her, and there was such a spirit around them, that they really successfully argued this should be the first flagship saved for the nation since Nelson's victory,"" she told Sky. ""This ship is a survivor. To get to 80 years old is pretty remarkable - most ships are considered old at 30. But it's the stories she tells, and the people that served on board her. We have veterans on board this weekend from across all of her commissions, telling the stories from the 1930s - when this ship was sent into the Second World War as a very new commissioned ship with very young sailors, as young as 16, 17 - right up through the 1950s and 60s. So Belfast tells the story of all that period of history, and it's the last big-gunned, armoured warship left in the whole of Europe from the Second World War."" The veterans' love for the ship was much in evidence as they gathered for a memorial ceremony on Friday - which included the firing of those powerful six-inch guns, the booms echoing across the South Bank and the City. Ron remembered the day in 1971 when the Belfast arrived in the heart of the capital. ""I worked in the City for 38 years,"" he said. ""And when I heard that the Belfast was coming in, I walked out my office, I walked down and stood on the cobbles by the Tower of London as Tower Bridge went up and the four tugs pulled her in, and tears just came streaming down my eyes, because what was happening was that my old home was coming back again."""

Mr Johnson revealed: ""We actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination, but has also been creating and stockpiling novichok."" His comments came ahead of the arrival in London of experts from the chemical weapons watchdog on Monday. Scientists from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will take samples and send them to ""reputable international laboratories"". The results are expected to take at least two weeks. :: A poisoned spy and a stalemate with Russia Mr Johnson announced the move on Sunday, marking the latest step by the UK to build an international coalition against Russia following the poisoning of the Skripals two weeks ago in Salisbury. The Foreign Office said the move ""reflects the UK's commitment to fully complying with the obligations of the Chemical Weapons Convention"". Mr Johnson also backed a suggestion that Russia had told a ""direct lie"" about its chemical weapons stores. ""That is exactly the tactics we've come to expect from Russia over the last few years,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Suggestions by Russia's ambassador to the EU that the poisoning could have been carried out by Britain were dismissed as ""satirical"". ""The UK is, as it were, in the Kremlin's crosshairs,"" Mr Johnson warned. Sky sources have also said authorities are investigating whether the nerve agent used in the attack was administered via the ventilation system in Russian Mr Skripal's car. :: Analysis - follow the money and you will get to Putin It came as Labour hardened its stance against Russia. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he agreed ""completely"" with Mrs May that Moscow either carried out the 4 March attack or lost control of a nerve agent. Hitting out at Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr McDonnell told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""He is responsible whichever way you look at it. All the evidence points to him."" But Tory party chair Brandon Lewis has reiterated Tory criticism of the Labour leadership. He told Sky's Sunday with Niall Patterson it was ""inappropriate"" for leader Jeremy Corbyn to have raised the issue of Russian donors to the Conservatives. Despite diplomatic tensions rising and the Skripals and a police officer remaining in hospital, Russia tried to strike a humorous tone. Its UK embassy tweeted a picture of fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, writing: ""In absence of evidence, we definitely need Poirot in Salisbury!"""
2018-03-18,A call for Brexit to be delayed to give the UK more time for a better deal has provoked a furious bust-up between pro-Remain and pro-Leave MPs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180318182356/https://news.sky.com/story/call-for-brexit-transition-delay-provokes-bust-up-11294971,"Leave supporters on a powerful Commons committee have angrily disowned a report calling for the Brexit transition period to be extended if necessary. The controversial proposal comes in a report by the all-party Brexit Select Committee of MPs on the progress of the UK's negotiations on EU withdrawal. The call, led by committee chairman former Labour Cabinet minister Hilary Benn, has been backed by 12 other MPs on the 21-member committee. But the eight pro-Leave MPs on the committee have denounced their colleagues as ""the high priests of Remain"" and published their own minority report. :: Brexit putting UK-led space missions 'in jeopardy' The MPs backing Mr Benn include pro-EU Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock, Emma Reynolds and Pat McFadden, the SNP's Joanna Cherry and former Tory Cabinet minister Stephen Crabb. The eight rebels include hardline Tory Eurosceptics Jacob Rees-Mogg, Peter Bone, Sir Christopher Chope, Craig Mackinlay and former Cabinet minister John Whittingdale. Launching the majority report, Mr Benn said the divisions in the committee showed that achieving an agreement on Brexit was far from easy. ""The Government must now come forward with credible, detailed proposals as to how it can operate a 'frictionless border' between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,"" he said. ""At the moment, the committee is not persuaded that this can be done at the same time as the UK is leaving the single market and the customs union. ""We know of no international border, other than the internal borders of the EU, that operates without checks and physical infrastructure. This is deeply concerning."" Mr Benn said that in the past few days Brexit Secretary David Davis had said he could live with a transition period of under two years if it helped to secure an early deal. :: Govt signs secret Brexit agreements with firms And he added: ""But even this time could prove to be too short to conclude a comprehensive agreement. Given the modelling we have seen, a 'no deal' scenario is a significant danger to the UK."" But Mr Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Brexit-supporting Tory European Research Group, said: ""The committee's majority report is the prospectus for the vassal state. ""It is a future not worthy of us as a country, and I am sure that Theresa May will rightly reject a report by the high priests of Remain. ""The majority report would keep us in the customs union and the single market, which is an attempt to keep us in the EU by sleight of hand. ""Those of us who respect the instructions the people gave us in the referendum could not support so partisan a text."" Select committees reports are only influential if they are unanimous, dividing on leave remain lines simply refights the referendum #remoanathon The minority report says 21 months is ample time and that a prolonged transition period would be difficult for the UK and would not respect the EU referendum result. It says the UK would still be bound by EU rules and would have to hand over cash with no say on how it was spent if the implementation arrangements were extended. Mr Whittingdale, vice chairman of the Brexit committee, said: ""I am very disappointed that the committee was unable to produce a unanimous report and instead divided along the same lines as in the referendum campaign. ""For a number of us the chairman's report was far too negative and we do not believe that its conclusions are borne out by the evidence we heard. ""The report's recommendations essentially ignore the wishes of the people and would delay Brexit by an indefinite period."" Reacting to the committee split, Mr Davis's Brexit department said a ""great deal of progress"" had been made on citizens' rights, a financial settlement and the Northern Ireland border. ""Importantly, the UK and the EU are equally committed to ensuring that our departure does not lead to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,"" a spokesman added. ""We are currently discussing the terms of an implementation period and are confident we can reach an agreement by the European Council next week. ""Doing so will provide businesses and citizens with the certainty they need as we prepare for exit. ""It remains a shared aim to get the withdrawal agreement agreed by October and we will continue to work closely with the commission to achieve that."""

But everybody knows Vladimir Putin will win. Over the past 18 years he has built a subservient political regime which supports and promotes his leadership. His decision to annex Crimea and deploy forces in Syria have bolstered his claim that Russia has re-taken its seat at the world's top table. ""We are a great power and no one likes competition,"" he said in a recent interview. :: Follow the money and you will get to Putin It is this electoral certainty - the total absence of suspense - that has made turnout the key test of this election for President Putin. Will Russians leave the comforts of home and vote on what is a bitterly cold and windswept day? The best-known opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, has instructed his supporters to boycott the event with his #noelections2018 hashtag. Mr Navalny has been banned from competing in the poll due to a previous fraud conviction which he says is politically motivated. As a consequence of this unsanctioned challenge, the government has been working hard to get the vote out and we have seen plenty of examples of this operation on social media. Food seems to figure prominently as an inducement at polling stations. A large buffet was put on for residents in the Moscow suburb of Korolov: ""Food is delicious here.

Personally, I haven't thought up a suitably catchy alternative title for the current standoff but we are living through an era of great tension. Relations between Russia and the West have been deteriorating gradually. What happened in Salisbury on a Sunday in early March can be added to a quite extraordinary list that includes the shooting down of a long-haul passenger aircraft, the invasion of a sovereign country (Ukraine), and the use of barrel bombs and complicity in the use chemical weapons in Syria. Add to that Russian aircraft flying dangerously close to crowded European airspace with transmitters switched off, interference in numerous elections and a build-up of conventional forces, and all in all you have a situation that is as every bit as worrying as 40 years ago. In his state-of-the-nation address three weeks ago, Mr Putin spoke about the development of a nuclear weapon that couldn't be shot down by any anti-missile system - he backed this up with simulated graphics showing an attack on Florida. It's remarkable in some ways that the West hasn't responded more aggressively. There are some differences between the Cold War and now. Russia is a much weaker prospect today than the Soviet Union was then. It remains a nuclear state, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, but the breakup of the USSR has meant that some of the former Soviet states, like Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, are now members of NATO. Russia is financially weaker than the Soviet Union too - it has fewer trading partners than it did, and an economy smaller than any of the UK, France and Germany. Worryingly the channels of communication and understanding that were maintained during the Cold War years are seemingly absent these days. The chances of an accidental clash or misunderstanding in Syria, the Baltics or European airspace has been so far avoided but remain a real risk. It might not be the new Cold War, but the Putin era is every bit as dangerous."

Its previous Barcelona-based owners - Catalan architect Norman Cinnamond and his sister Rosy - whose ancestors are believed to have bought the island for the equivalent of ‚Ç¨252 in 1932, put it on the market almost three years ago for ‚Ç¨24m (¬£17m). Its natural beauty is protected as it lies inside the Las Salinas Natural Park, and although s'Espalmador is one of the most coveted private islands in the world, its seafront is public land and is a favourite sunshine getaway for celebrities. Prince William reportedly romanced his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton on the idyllic island and was photographed caked in mud. When the island was put up for sale it was offered to the Formentera government, but proved too expensive for the local authority and eventually went to the highest bidder. ""Like the majority of people from Formentera, we would've preferred for local government to have reached an agreement to use state funds to buy s'Espalmador and make it available to the general public,"" local politician Silvia Tur told Spanish media. It is unclear whether the new owners have the power to ban tourists from the island, but with their newfound luxury comes the responsibility for its conservation and upkeep. The island, which is under two miles (3km) long and half a mile (800m) wide, is said to have ""a remarkable location that few other private islands of this calibre can match"", according to estate agents Vladi. ""It's easy to enjoy the best of Ibiza from Espalmador, for example the happening beach clubs on Ibiza's Ses Salines beach, a short boat ride away, or the night clubs in Ibiza town,"" the listing reads. ""And after the buzz of Ibiza, Espalmador is the perfect sanctuary to retreat to, somewhere to get away from it all and unwind in beautiful surroundings, with zero stress."""
2018-03-19,The FTSE 100 is trading at levels not seen since December 2016 after a rally in the pound's value - a reaction to Brexit progress - added to a tough day for shares worldwide.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/ftse-100-at-lowest-level-since-2016-as-brexit-progress-boosts-pound-11297188,"The London market closed 1.7% or 121 points down at 7,042 - making it the worst performer among its major European rivals as tech stocks came in to sharp focus. Many big names in the sector were dragged lower as Facebook's value came under pressure amid a fake news storm facing the company related to a data mining firm's use of Facebook profile information. The fall in the FTSE 100's value was exacerbated by a recovery for sterling as investors reacted to news of progress in Brussels, where the broad terms were agreed for a Brexit transition deal between the EU and UK. The news was also broadly welcomed by UK business groups - among them the CBI, whose director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said: ""Agreeing transition is a critical milestone that will provide many hundreds of businesses with the confidence to put their contingency planning on hold and keep investing in the UK."" While the pound enjoyed its best day against the dollar since January at one stage - climbing comfortably back above $1.40. It also gained against the euro. Higher sterling has tended to hurt the value of many companies on the FTSE 100 since the EU vote, as they earn much of their revenues in foreign currencies and those are then damaged when they are converted to pounds. The biggest loser in London was Micro Focus - losing almost half its market value by the close - after the UK's biggest tech firm warned on revenues and admitted its chief executive had quit. The intense backlash from its shareholders contributed to rival stocks being spooked across Europe and the US though Facebook's troubles were seen as the main driver. Its shares were almost 7% lower on Wall Street leaving them on track for their worst day for four years. Google's parent, Alphabet, and Twitter were among other big tech names to feel the pain on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Other sectors to have a tough day in London included retail as speculation continues to swirl about the fate of several well known names. Shares in Carpetright and Mothercare fell 21% and 14% respectively. Both chains have admitted tough trading recently, with the floor coverings chain reported, by the Sunday Times, to be considering a rescue plan involving store closures after it announced earlier this month it was considering a number of options."
2018-03-19,"For the Russian President Vladimir Putin, a good enemy is better than a bad friend. Psychologically, it makes him much more comfortable.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/why-uks-tough-talk-may-not-get-results-from-putin-11290920,"In other words, at least Britain's actions have left him knowing exactly where he is - in a place of growing isolation he's survived many times before. There's a notion in political circles in Russia: if you want something from Putin, don't put him under pressure to get it. He doesn‚Äôt like to be seen as weak. Weak is bad. Weak is the worst possible thing. If he's forced to act under pressure, he doesn't like it because he doesn't want to be seen as being pushed around - that's weak. So if Britain wants Russia to explain itself, tough talk and demands may not be the best way to get answers. Russia doesn't like the language of ultimatums. Britain, France, Germany and the US have issued a joint statement condemning Russia. That‚Äôs strong and the message hasn't been lost in Russia that Britain is serious about all this. But the point is Putin sees himself as stronger and the alliance of the West as utterly predictable - of course they will issue statements and bandy together. Russia has China and friends in the Middle East. Moreover, it's not like it's the first time Russia has faced international condemnation over its actions. Remember: Ukraine and Crimea were not that long ago. Certainly the Kremlin believes it can just ride this out. And let's not forget there's a presidential election looming here. What‚Äôs going on provides Mr Putin with an argument to his electorate: ""Choose me, because the whole world is against us."""
2018-03-19,The foster parents of the Parsons Green bomber Ahmed Hassan have told Sky News of the dramatic moment armed police raided their home.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/foster-parents-of-parsons-green-tube-bomber-he-was-a-good-boy-11296842,"Describing Ahmed as a ""good boy"", Penny Jones says she has no idea what turned the ""quiet"" Iraqi asylum seeker who she took in and who called her ""mum"" into someone who wanted to kill commuters at rush hour in London. Mrs Jones said she and her husband Ron were watching darts at their Surrey home when the phone rang. Irritated at being interrupted, Penny described how she reluctantly answered the phone and snapped ""hello"" at the caller. She said: ""A voice said 'this is the police. You are surrounded by armed police. Put everything down and get out now.' ""I looked up, there were two eyes at the window, a mouth and a gun... and that was the first we knew. ""And it wasn't until I got outside and I said to the police officer 'are you trying to tell me Ahmed has done something?' and he said yes, and I went 'what?' and he said 'the bombing'. And I was dumb struck. ""I just couldn't believe it because he was such a good lad.'"" Mr Jones said: ""I couldn't believe it. It's still hard to believe that he could have done such a thing because he was such a good boy."" Penny and Ron have fostered 269 youngsters over a 40-year period. Penny said: ""We've always tried to do our best and when kids come to live in my house... they may be somebody else's child but when they're in my house they're my responsibility, they're my children. And I always refer to them as my kids."" She explained that whenever they went shopping and Ahmed was at home he would rush out to help her with the bags. Penny described 18-year-old Ahmed as respectful and polite but an asylum seeker who came to her aged 17 with a lot of problems. She said: ""He told us he lived in Baghdad and that his mum had been killed when the troops were out there looking for Saddam Hussein and that his dad had been blown up by IS in his taxi. ""He didn't talk about western involvement in Iraq. ""When it came up to Christmas I said to him 'I know you're Muslim and you don't do Christmas but do you mind if we put a few Christmas decorations up, and his attitude was 'I've come to live in your country, you're a Christian country, you're a Christian family and I will go along with it.' Ahmed was a photography student doing well at college. When asked what went wrong, Penny said simply: ""I don't know."" The couple proudly display a framed photograph on their sitting room wall of the day they received an MBE at Buckingham Palace for their work fostering. They built up a close relationship with Ahmed and said he called Penny his ""English mum"", sending her a birthday card shortly before the bombing saying, ""wishing you a day filled with happy memories and a year with numerous reasons to be thankful. May god bless you"". She said sadly: ""I feel as if he's let me down. He's betrayed me. All I wanted to do is care for these children, make sure they get a good life and I put them on the right track."" Even though the couple say they have no idea who or what radicalised Ahmed they said that looking back, he became agitated in the weeks before the bombing. Ron said: ""There were times he got a phone call and he'd go up the garden and be walking up and down the garden at the bottom and he seemed to be getting quite aerated and arguing with somebody and when he came back I've said to him 'everything alright Ahmed?' and he said 'yes fine'. ""I said, 'only you looked a bit annoyed when you were on the phone, are you sure everything's alright? If you want to talk about anything, that's what we're here for."" Penny said there were some late night phone calls which disturbed the household. ""I had to speak to him several times about phone calls at two o'clock in the morning because I'm a light sleeper and I'd hear him talking on the phone. He used to say to me it was his brother or uncle and I said they need to phone before I go to bed."" The foster couple said they had to get Ahmed's bedroom door replaced after he headbutted it and broke it. Showing the room - now devoid of any of Ahmed's possessions which were taken away by the police - Ron pointed at the door and said: ""He'd written 'I'm bored' and when I tackled him about it he had nothing to say and said 'I'm alright'."" The couple say they had taken in another foster boy called Binyam who appeared to have clashed with Ahmed, describing him as ""brainwashed"" and ""mad"". Should there have been more checks on Ahmed before he was fostered? Penny replied: ""You can't have more checks because they haven't come in from a refugee centre. ""If they've come from a refugee centre they've come with their papers so you can check on their papers. ""But when they've come in on the back of a lorry there aren't any checks - you just have to take it at face value. ""He was in the camp at Calais for a long time, managed to get himself in the truck and as so many of them do, got to Cobham services. Then they're picked up by the police and social services get involved because they're under age. ""He had three places before he came to me and the last place before he came to me he was living in student accommodation all on his own and couldn't cope."" In spite of what they've been through, Penny and Ron said they would foster again. ""Just because you've got one that's done something wrong there's still somebody out there that needs your love and care and needs to be looked after,"" Penny said. ""I wouldn't say I'm angry. I'm really disappointed that he has done this and that he's put everybody else at risk. That's what I'm angry about. ""There must have been a reason for it but I can't say what it is."" The couple have not had any contact with Ahmed since the day of the bombing because that would feel like condoning his actions. ""Once I knew it was Ahmed I was horrified,"" Penny said. ""I'm so glad he didn't do it right."" She added: ""I'm really sorry people got hurt and I feel sorry for the ladies who were burnt. ""I would have been distraught if people had been killed knowing that that had come from my house."" Ron said: ""'I'm very disappointed about it but I am thankful that he didn't do the job properly because I don't think I could have lived if he'd have got any further and done what it should have done."""
2018-03-19,"The Tories are heading for a record all-time low in local elections in London on 3 May, according to an authoritative new analysis.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/tories-heading-for-record-all-time-low-in-london-local-elections-11297224,"The number of Conservative councillors in the capital could fall from 604 currently to below 519, the party's lowest ever total back in 1994, experts predict. The local elections in England, in just over six weeks, will be the biggest test for the parties and their leaders - Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Vince Cable - since last year's general election. In total, 4,371 council seats are being contested, with Labour set to make big gains in the 32 London boroughs but the Conservatives poised to do better outside the capital. A month ago, a disaster for the Tories in London on 3 May would almost certainly have put the Prime Minister's job in peril and prompted moves to force her to quit. But her supporters are now confident that she is more secure after a fightback against her critics on Brexit and what they believe has been her sure-footed handling of the Russian poisoning crisis. Besides the London boroughs, there are elections on 3 May in so-called unitary authorities such as Portsmouth, Southampton, Derby, Hull and Blackburn and districts in shire counties such as Surrey and Hampshire. Districts including Harrogate, South Lakeland, Huntingdonshire, Eastleigh and Hastings are electing all their councillors, as are the big cities of Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham. Mayors are being elected in the London boroughs of Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets and in Watford and the Sheffield City region. Nominations close at 4pm on Friday 6 April and most of the 18% share of the vote won by the now self-destructed UKIP in the same elections in 2014 is likely to be up for grabs. Analysis by elections expert Lord (Robert) Hayward, pollster Andrew Hawkins of ComRes and Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics reveals that in recent elections Labour has performed up to 15% better in London than in Great Britain as a whole and the Conservatives up to 10% worse in the capital. ""I would be surprised if the Tories did not have an all-time low of councillors in London,"" said Lord Hayward, who correctly predicted the 2015 general election result and the outcome of the EU referendum. ""Labour were very successful in the general election. I would expect that to continue in 2018 in London."" On the elections outside London, he added: ""I expect the Tories to lose seats overall and the Liberal Democrats to gain seats against the Tories in some parts of the country. ""But I don't expect them to lose to such an extent that it would endanger Theresa May's premiership."" In London, Labour looks on course to snatch Barnet from the Conservatives and is battling to seize two jewels of the Tories' local government crown, Wandsworth and Westminster. The LibDems hope to win Kingston and Richmond from the Conservatives. One factor that could rob Labour of taking Wandsworth could be an increased number of Green Party candidates. In 2014 the Greens only contested 25 of the 60 seats in the borough. And Labour's opponents will be looking for evidence that a purge of veteran councillors in Haringey by left-wing Momentum activists has damaged the party at the polls. The big reason for Labour's growing vote share in recent years in London appears to be demographic change, the experts believe. In the Clayhall ward in Redbridge, for example, in 2001 50% of the population was described as ""white English"", but by 2011 it was down to 20%. But the local elections will be a different story outside London on 3 May. In Bolton, Labour has lost two council by-elections already this year. Labour will hope to benefit from a Brexit backlash against the Conservatives in London, but elsewhere pro-Brexit voters want the Government to get on with leaving the EU. The Conservatives could lose Trafford, however, to no overall control and Labour could gain Dudley, Calderdale and Kirklees from no overall control. The LibDems will have hopes of a breakthrough in South Cambridgeshire, close to the heavily pro-Remain university city, and in affluent Three Rivers in Hertfordshire. Finally, if you live in Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford or Woking you will need ID when you go to the polling station to vote. A new voter ID requirement - criticised by some Labour MPs - is on trial in these boroughs. :: WHEN WILL THE RESULTS BE DECLARED? Of the 150 councils where there are elections, 100 are counting on the night, and the rest during the day on Friday 4 May. The first results will come in from the smaller districts, starting as early as 11.30pm and continuing to come in between midnight and 1am, when results from the unitary authorities will also start coming in. The big metropolitan cities will declare between 2am and 4am and the London boroughs from 2am, but more likely between 4am and 5am. Sky News will bring you all the results throughout the night and on the Friday."
2018-03-19,Shares in UK technology firm Micro Focus International have plunged more than 50% after it warned on sales and announced the departure of its chief executive.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/micro-focus-shares-slump-on-revenue-warning-as-chief-executive-quits-11296815,"The FTSE 100 group said revenues were declining more sharply than expected, thanks to problems stemming from its ¬£6.6bn acquisition last year of the software arm of Hewlett Packard. Micro Focus said chief executive Chris Hsu had quit, just six months after taking the role, and would be replaced by chief operating officer Stephen Murdoch. Executive chairman Kevin Loosemore said: ""We remain confident in Micro Focus' strategy whilst recognising that operational issues have led to a disappointing short term performance and outlook."" Micro Focus, which manages older software for customers including banks and airlines, said revenues for the current financial year were expected to be 6%-9% lower, worse than the previously forecast 2%-4% decline. It blamed ""one-off"" effects from the Hewlett Packard deal but said that the ""fundamental thesis"" of the acquisition was still sound. The deal had catapulted Micro Focus into the ranks of Europe's leading software makers. But Monday's warning saw shares slump 55%, leaving them at barely a third of their value at the start of 2018. The stock had already been hit by a previous gloomy revenue outlook earlier this year. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ""The cracks in Micro Focus were clearly visible at its half-year results in January and today's warning confirms the problems have got worse. ""Large acquisitions are inherently risky as they come with integration challenges. ""Micro Focus appears to have underestimated these challenges and is now suffering."""

On Friday, it was announced that the 68-year-old's death was being treated as murder following a post-mortem examination which revealed the cause of his death was compression to the neck. Detectives are appealing to the public for their help and are asking for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at or near his home in Clarence Avenue on Sunday 11 March and Monday 12 March to contact them. The investigation is being led by officers from the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command. Commander Clarke Jarrett said: ""I would like to thank the public for their response to our appeal so far and I would urge anybody who may have information to get in touch if they have not already done so. ""We will have officers in Mr Glushkov's local neighbourhood today so please come and speak to us if you think you may have seen or heard anything suspicious last Sunday or Monday. ""The investigation is progressing; we have taken a number of statements and have over 400 exhibits which are being processed. ""We have found no sign of forced entry thus far, but the forensic examination at Mr Gluskov's home continues and we expect to be there for some time."" Police said Mr Glushkov's family has been informed and is being supported by family liaison officers. Mr Glushkov, a retired financial director for Aeroflot, was a Russian national who had lived at that address for two years. A close friend of Vladimir Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, Mr Glushkov was wanted over fraud allegations in his native Russia. He was also outspoken after Mr Berezovsky died in 2013, refusing to accept that his friend had killed himself. Scotland Yard said there was nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders of former Russian Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, nor any evidence that Mr Glushkov was poisoned. :: Anyone with information should call police on 0800 789 321."

The allegations dated back to the 1980s. When the scandal peaked in 2013, he stepped down from his post as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh. At the time, he said: ""My sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal."" He was succeeded, temporarily, by Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, who said the episode had damaged the ""credibility and moral authority"" of the church. After stepping down, Cardinal O'Brien retired from public life and moved to the north of England. Archbishop Leo Cushley of St Andrews and Edinburgh said: ""In life, Cardinal O'Brien may have divided opinion. ""In death, however, I think all can be united in praying for the repose of his soul, for comfort for his grieving family and that support and solace be given to those whom he offended, hurt and let down. ""May he rest in peace."" Also responding to news of Cardinal O'Brien's death, Andi Lavery from the abuse survivors support group White Flowers Alba, called for a fresh police investigation into the activities and associates of a man he described as a ""sexual predator and malodorous presence"". Cardinal O'Brien died at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne. Catherine Deveney, the journalist who broke the story about Cardinal O'Brien's abusive behaviour, told Sky News: ""On a human level, it's sad that he has died and we must have regard for his family and friends. ""But we can't forget the serious issues within the Catholic Church that he represents. His behaviour was a symptom of corruption in an organisation that lost its way. ""I would never criticise him for being gay or for his own lifestyle choices, but the hypocrisy of saying one thing publicly and doing another privately is an abuse of power that's symptomatic of a wider abuse in the Catholic Church."""
2018-03-19,"Vladimir Putin has dismissed claims that Russia was behind the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury as ""nonsense"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/nonsense-that-russia-behind-spy-posioning-says-vladimir-putin-11296350,"In his first public comments about the nerve agent attack, the Russian president said Moscow was ready to cooperate with the British government on the investigation. He called the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia a ""tragedy"" but said they would have died instantly if it was true they had been poisoned by a ""military-grade nerve agent"". ""The first thing I thought was that if it was a real poison, they would have just died. They wouldn't be in hospital,"" Mr Putin said. ""The second thing - Russia doesn't have any such poisons. We destroyed all our chemical weapons in front of international observers. We were the first to do it. ""We're ready to work together. We need the other party to do that as well, although we haven't seen any signs of that."" He added: ""It's complete drivel, rubbish, nonsense that somebody in Russia would allow themselves to do such a thing ahead of elections and the World Cup."" :: A poisoned spy - the story so far Mr Putin was speaking after securing a fourth term as Russian president following a landslide victory in which he secured more than 70% of the vote. Earlier on Sunday, Boris Johnson said it was ""overwhelmingly likely"" that Mr Putin ordered the attack on Mr Skripal and accused Russia of ""stockpiling"" deadly novichok over the last decade. The Foreign Secretary said: ""We actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination, but has also been creating and stockpiling novichok."" Mr Johnson will brief EU foreign ministers on the case on Monday before meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Scientists from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are also due to arrive in London as part of the investigation. :: Analysis: Follow the money and you will get to Putin Experts will take samples and send them to ""reputable international laboratories"", Mr Johnson said. The results are expected to take at least two weeks to come back. Authorities are investigating whether the nerve agent used in the attack was administered via the ventilation system in Russian Mr Skripal's car, Sky sources have confirmed. Police have renewed their appeal for sightings of Mr Skripal's burgundy BMW 320D saloon car, registration HD09 WAO, in Salisbury on Sunday 4 March. The former Russia double agent and his daughter remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, also remains in hospital but is no longer in a critical condition, NHS England said."
2018-03-19,"Drug testing stations where substances could be tested without penalty should be opened in city and town centres to help stem a startling rise in club drug-related deaths, a report has concluded.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/call-for-city-centre-drug-testing-to-save-lives-11296515,"It found that deaths linked to ecstasy and cocaine are at their highest level since records began, and that hospital admissions for these drugs and the tranquiliser ketamine have also risen dramatically. There were 98 ecstasy-related deaths in the UK in 2016, up from 12 in 2010, and 494 attributable to cocaine, up from 148 over the same period. Both drugs have also been increasing in purity, with cocaine seized by the police 80% pure on average and a five-fold increase in the MDMA content of ecstasy pills. The report, co-authored by academics from Durham University, advice service The Loop and drugs think-tank Volte Face, concludes that current drugs policy, based primarily on prohibition, means the night-time economy is failing young people. The authors say it is increasing the risk to health of young people and the burden on the police and health service, with every admission estimated to cost the NHS ¬£10,000. As well as drug safety testing services, the report calls for an independent information service for young people, training for staff in clubs and bars, and improved safety procedures in licensed venues. Testing has been trialled at a number of festivals in the last two years and The Loop is in discussions with local authorities in several UK locations to deliver drug safety testing to town and city centres. ""A refocusing of national drug policy and resources away from harm reduction has left our night-time environments more vulnerable than ever to drug-related harms,"" the report states. ""Licensing fears and landmark closures have left venues obliged to harden their 'zero tolerance' rhetoric towards drugs, leaving them ill-equipped to deal with the unavoidable realities of drug use."" Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University, said testing was an effective deterrent. ""We are not encouraging, condoning or assisting drug use, the idea is to reduce drug-related harm and we have been every successful at festivals. ""Around four in 10 people take a lower amount of the substance afterwards, and around one in five say they don't want to take it."" Fabric in central London, one of the best-known clubs in Europe, was forced to close in 2016 after two young men died after taking MDMA. Following a high-profile campaign it re-opened last year, but only after agreeing to extensive safety and security protocols as a condition of its licence. Everyone who enters the club is meticulously searched, and anyone found with drugs, or seeking to offer or solicit them, is reported to the police. Welfare staff circulate, stepping in to help anyone thought to be suffering ill-effects. General manager Luke Laws told Sky News that dealing with fatalities had been ""horrific"", but said testing alone would not reduce the risks of drug-taking. ""I think it's an idea worth thinking about but it is not a silver bullet. I believe any front-of-house testing within a nightclub is probably too late. ""I would look at something along the lines of what I've seen in Zurich, where you drop the drugs off in the week, they get analysed, you then go back and get the results later in the week before you plan to use it and you have all the information. ""Knowing what drugs are out there, the purity and what adulterants there might be, is good to know, but the key is what people do with that information. ""A recurring theme for us in 2016 was people not knowing what they were doing, with no experience of drugs, and getting it tragically wrong."""

However, they will not come into force until after the transition ends, the document states. There is still no agreement on the EU's so-called 'punishment clause' that would restricted Britain's access to the single market during the transition. The draft text appears to have softened following a leak in February. A joint committee of representatives from both sides was also announced to arbitrate on disagreements for the 21 months after Brexit day. But the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, won a battle to define 13 key areas - including health and education - that could form part of a ""common regulatory area"" in Northern Ireland in case of no deal. He also secured the same rights for EU citizens who arrive in the UK during the transition period as those in the country before March 2019. On one of the most contentious areas, the UK also agreed to only be ""consulted"" on future fishing quotas. The terms were announced by Mr Barnier and Brexit Secretary David Davis. Despite calling the breakthrough ""significant"", the EU official warned that ""a decisive step remains a step"". ""We are not at the end of the road,"" he said. ""A lot of work needs to be done."" EU leaders will meet at a special summit on Thursday and Friday, when they are expected to ""rubber stamp"" the deal. While the agreement was hailed in Brussels, it sets Prime Minister Theresa May on course for a series of disputes back home. Influential Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said last month that giving EU citizens who move to Britain during the transition full freedom of movement rights would be ""astonishing"" and ""unconscionable"". And the Scottish Fishermen's Federation raged that only letting Britain ""consult"" on quotas amounted to ""handing back sovereignty over our seas a few seconds later"" after officially quitting the EU. An internal Tory battle looks set to grow, with Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson saying it fell ""far short"" of fishermen's hopes. She had promised to give ""full support"" to a Tory MP who said they could torpedo the final Brexit deal by voting it down in Parliament unless Britain got full control over fish stocks and vessel access during the transition. On Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said the issue of how to avoid a hard border ""remains an issue"". It is a key area where agreement - marked by the colour green in the EU document - has still not been met. Mr Davis was also keen to emphasise that the implementation deal ""includes Gibraltar"". Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said the agreement ""could have been signed months ago"". He blamed Tory ministers for wasting time by ""fighting among themselves, holding out on negotiating objectives that they have failed to achieve and pursuing their reckless red lines"". He also told Sky News the Government had only ""kicked"" the issue of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland ""further down the road"". Business groups cautiously welcomed the news from Brussels. The Federation of Small Businesses said it ""gifted some certainty"" and would protect companies from a ""damaging cliff-edge approach"". But the Institute of Directors said it was ""concerned that not enough attention is being given now to the finer details and practical implications of transition""."

An amber warning for snow - meaning there is a potential risk to life - remains in place for Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset until 3am, with up to a foot (30cm) expected in parts of Dartmoor. Devon County Council has said more than 250 schools will close on Monday following the severe weather, while dozens of school closures were reported in Somerset, Gloucestershire and parts of Wales. Yellow ""be aware"" warnings for ice have been issued for England, Wales and parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland until 10am as temperatures drop widely to -3C (26.6F) overnight. It comes after snow and ice caused disruption to road, rail and air travel and forced several sporting events to be abandoned. All Flybe-operated flights departing from Exeter Airport were cancelled on Sunday, while snow also caused the temporary closure of Bristol airport.

2018-03-19,The state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is working on secret plans to create a standalone digital bank to compete with emerging British fintech champions including Monzo and Revolut.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/rbs-working-on-secret-plot-to-create-digital-challenger-bank-11297020,"Sky News has learnt that RBS has assigned one of its top executives to the project, which is so confidential that few people inside the company are aware of its existence. Sources said on Monday that the work is being led by Mark Bailie, the bank's former chief operating officer. Tens of millions of pounds are already understood to have been earmarked for the new digital platform, which is still in its very early stages and may not result in a viable new lender coming to market, according to one insider. News of the project comes weeks after RBS announced its first annual profit in the decade since it was bailed out with more than ¬£45bn of taxpayer support. RBS has already struck agreements with a number of leading fintech companies such as Funding Circle, with which it works to direct customers to peer-to-peer and other providers of alternative finance. Mr Bailie's efforts to create a standalone digital bank is a tacit acknowledgement of the strides being made digital challengers such as Monzo, which announced on Monday that it had signed up 500,000 current account customers. The financial advantages enjoyed by digital lenders are hastening the closure of high street branches - a subject which continues to draw political opprobrium from critics of Britain's five biggest lenders: Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS and Santander UK. Details of the RBS plan are sketchy and subject to change, with uncertainty about a potential launch date, its autonomy within RBS and the branding of the new venture. In a statement issued to Sky News, an RBS spokeswoman said: ""Our industry is changing rapidly and therefore we need to keep pace with this by launching new approaches to better serve our customers. ""We will not comment on media speculation, but we're focussed on using automation and technology to deliver a more efficient banking experience that better reflects the changing way our customers now bank."" Creating a new lender from scratch is likely to prove technologically much simpler for RBS than its ill-fated efforts to carve out hundreds of branches into a separate network which would have revived the Williams & Glyn name. Those attempts, which involved two separate agreements to sell the business to Santander UK, collapsed, resulting in RBS having to secure approval from Brussels for an alternative plan to reduce its market share. RBS has now overcome many of the legacy issues which have plagued it since the era of Fred Goodwin, its former chief executive, and it is expected to conclude the biggest remaining hurdle - a multibillion dollar fine from the US Department of Justice for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities - in the coming weeks. As RBS's chief operating officer since April 2016, Mr Bailie played a pivotal role in the conclusion of its winding down of RBS Capital Resolution, the so-called 'bad bank' set up after its bailout. Prior to that, he was in charge of its Non-Core Solutions unit, and has also worked at Barclays. His responsibilities as COO have since been handed to other senior executives. Mr Bailie could not be reached for comment."

She is expected to slam the sharp disparities revealed in a racial disparity report released last October and pledge more funding to improve opportunities. Mrs May is due to speak at a Birmingham-based charity that helps young people into work, inviting organisations like it to apply for the money. It is being funded by cash seized from UK bank accounts that have remained dormant for more than 15 years. On her visit, the PM will say unemployment racial disparities among young people ""blights communities and wastes talent and potential"". She is expected to say: ""Too many young people from deprived and ethnic minority backgrounds face barriers preventing them from entering the world of work. ""Talent, ability and hard work should be the only factors affecting a young person's ability to get on in life - not their background or ethnicity."" Mrs May will point to young people from ethnic minorities are twice as likely to be unemployed as their white peers. The money will ""help address the barriers holding many young people back"", she will add. Nine workshops will also be set up in England - with two regional events in the north and south - to let young jobseekers have their say on how the money should be allocated. A new Race Disparity Audit Advisory Group has also been set up, led by founder of Operation Black Vote Simon Woolley. It will be charged with steering government departments to oversee ""interventions"" to tackle race disparities in youth unemployment."
2018-03-19,"A feud between rival Minecraft gamers is the reason why 24,000 threatening emails were sent to schools and colleges in the UK,  Sky News has learned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/school-bomb-hoaxes-revealed-to-be-part-of-minecraft-gamer-feud-11297062,"Hundreds of schools were on alert and some evacuated their buildings, telling parents to collect their children after receiving messages containing what police described as a ""bomb hoax"". Police forces around the country have said there are not believed to be any ""viable threats"". Sky News has learned the emails were spoofed to look like they had been sent by a gaming network known as VeltPvP. The malicious emails were designed to result in the domain being suspended for abuse. VeltPvP is a Minecraft player-versus-player server - a type of server run by businesses that sell items in-game to players. Those involved in the conflict, which centres around the Velt server operators, claimed their opponents have engaged in illegal activities to harass each other. Sky News has been able to contact one of those responsible for sending the hoax emails. Asked whether he regretted frightening children whose schools were evacuated, the hoaxer replied: ""It is horrible, it's not the nicest thing."" He added that the reaction from schools showed failures on their part and that he understands there is a chance he will be arrested. Humberside Police said 400 schools were affected across the country. Detective Superintendent Tony Cockerill said: ""We have spoken to all schools who have contacted us, reassured them that there is no need to evacuate and offered them security advice."" Assistant Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine of Greater Manchester Police said: ""I want to reiterate that there is not believed to be any direct threat following these reports which at this stage are believed to be malicious hoax communications."" Pointing the finger at VeltPvP, the hoaxer accused the network of engaging in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and targeting other rival Minecraft servers. Abusive behaviour features in images and video purporting to be of individuals connected to VeltPvP. ""What that network has done is horrible,"" the hoaxer said. But Carson Kallen, Velt LLC's chief executive, hit back telling Sky News: ""That's completely false‚Ä¶ I hope this person gets caught."" It is not the first time Velt has been targeted. Mr Kallen told Sky News he had been the victim of so many swatting attacks he now knows the officers at his local police station. This is the first time the gamers' grievances have spilled over to affect hundreds of schools. In a statement, VeltPvP said: ""We've been being harassed by a group of cybercriminals that are trying to harass us in any way possible. ""We're extremely sorry for anyone who had to deal with this, but just know it's fake."" Asked if he felt remorse for Monday's scares in schools, one of the attackers said: ""Mentally, kind of, yes - that's human nature - but within the community, you have to become very thick skinned or you'll get exploited."" He added: ""I'm not going to lose sleep over it."""
2018-03-19,"Deaths linked to ecstasy and cocaine are at their highest level since records began, according to a new report by academics from Durham University, advice service The Loop and drugs think tank Volte Face.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/my-two-beautiful-sons-died-from-ecstasy-overdoses-we-need-regulate-drugs-11296800,"Ray Lakeman - whose two sons Jacques, 20, and Torin, 19, died after taking ""five to six times"" the lethal dose of ecstasy - tells Sky News why he is fighting for drug regulations to be rewritten. The new report released today deeply saddens me. Nobody expects their children to die before them. Unfortunately that is my experience. On 3 December 2014 I was due to travel to London. I planned to visit my son Jacques who had recently moved to London to find work. I did see Jacques that day, but not in London. Instead he was lying on a mortuary slab in the Royal Bolton Hospital beside his younger brother, Torin. Jacques had just moved to London where he was a budding chef and a talented guitarist. Torin was at Aberystwth University where he studied physics and astro science. The pair had booked a room above a pub in Bolton as part of a trip to watch their team, Manchester United, play on 29 November. Sadly they were found dead in the room two days later. We first knew something was wrong when Jacques did not arrive at his grandmother's as he had planned - I knew he would never let her down. We reported the boys missing and spent the night trying to get in touch with them, awaiting a call that never came. The next evening police knocked on our door - and I knew immediately they had died. An inquest revealed they had died of an overdose of MDMA - the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets - that Torin had bought on the Dark Web. Toxicology tests revealed they had taken ""five to six"" times the lethal dose of the drug. The devastation their deaths brought to my family and friends is incalculable. Nobody should have to endure it, but it is preventable. Jacques and Torin were beautiful, creative, intelligent and sensitive boys. They had everything to live for, but like so many others, despite knowing drugs were potentially dangerous and illegal, enjoyed their effects. That is the reality of drug usage and society needs to accept reality. I do not condone drug usage but clearly the current legislation does not work. :: Call for city centre drug testing stations 'to save lives' There is no doubt they are dangerous, they killed my sons, but they are more dangerous than they need to be because they are illegal. Criminals produce, adulterate and strengthen the content and they have no concern for the user - only their profit. I'd rather that doctors, pharmacies and licensed retailers were put in charge than the market being 100% controlled by criminals. Only the Government can change this.:: Ray is a member of Anyone's Child: Families for Safer Drug Control, an international network of families whose lives have been wrecked by current drug laws and are now campaigning for the legal control and regulation of drugs.Ôøº"
2018-03-19,Martina Navratilova has claimed fellow tennis legend and Wimbledon pundit John McEnroe is paid at least 10 times more than her by the BBC.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/navratilova-slams-bbc-for-paying-her-10-times-less-than-mcenroe-for-wimbledon-role-11296983,"The 61-year-old revealed she receives around ¬£15,000 for being a commentator for the broadcaster during the Grand Slam tournament in London. McEnroe's pay packet, of ¬£150,000 to ¬£199,999, was revealed in a list of the BBC's top-paid talent last summer. Navratilova, who won 18 Grand Slam singles titles in a career spanning three decades, said she was told she was getting paid a comparable amount to men doing the same job as her. The tennis star said she would be asking for more money in the future. ""It was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least ¬£150,000,"" she said. ""I get about ¬£15,000 for Wimbledon and unless John McEnroe's doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon he's getting at least 10 times as much money."" She continued: ""We were not told the truth, that's for sure.... ""(I'm) not happy... It's shocking... It's still the good old boys network.... The bottom line is that male voices are valued more than women's voices."" Navratilova made the revelations to Panorama, the BBC's investigative documentary programme, in an episode to be aired later this evening. BBC Sport told Panorama that ""John and Martina perform different roles in the team, and John's role is of a different scale, scope and time commitment"". It said that ""along with Sue Barker"", McEnroe - who retired with seven career Grand Slam singles titles to his name - ""is regarded as the face of our Wimbledon coverage"". ""He is a defining voice within the BBC's coverage,"" it said. ""He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission."" It said their roles were ""simply not comparable"", adding: ""His pay reflects all of this; gender isn't a factor."" The dispute adds to an ongoing and broader gender pay row at the publicly-funded broadcaster after the disclosure of the salaries of its biggest stars. Figures published in 2017 revealed just two of the top 10 earners were women, and examples of huge disparities between the salaries of male and female actors and presenters, with the men earning more for doing similar jobs with similar experience. Radio 2's Chris Evans topped the list on more than ¬£2m, while the highest paid woman was Claudia Winkleman on between ¬£450,000 and ¬£499,999."

It is feared she was killed by a Turkish airstrike. The 26-year-old from Lewes in East Sussex is the first British woman to have been killed in Syria fighting with the Kurds. Seven other Britons have died in the country fighting alongside Kurdish groups. Her father, Dirk Campbell, said he had tried to stop her travelling to Syria. He last heard from her two months ago when she told him she would not be doing any fighting - but Mr Campbell said he had suspected she was. He described her as ""very positive, optimistic and happy"" and a person who ""knew she was doing something meaningful"". ""She was trying to make a better world and knew she was risking her life,"" he said. Mark Campbell, co-chairman of the Kurdistan solidarity campaign, described Ms Campbell, who is no relation to him, as an ""inspiration"" and a ""hero"". ""Anna is a woman who seemed to have more humanity in her little finger than the whole of the international community,"" he said. ""I did not know her but I met with her father this morning. I have the utmost respect and condolences for her family."" Turkish troops and Syrian opposition fighters seized control of Afrin from Kurdish forces over the weekend. Dozens of children have been killed and tens of thousands of people have been displaced from Afrin, according to the UN, as the conflict in Syria enters its eighth year. The EU's foreign policy chief criticised Turkey's military offensive in northern Syria on Monday. Federica Mogherini said international efforts in the war-savaged country are supposed to be aimed at ""de-escalating the military activities and not escalating them"". The Syrian government says the Turkish invasion has nothing to do with protecting its borders and is instead simply a ""land grab"". Turkey denies it is targeting civilians, or is engaged in expansionism. It says its campaign - codenamed Operation Olive Branch, which saw it launch incursions into northern Syria - is about protecting its territory from Kurdish terrorists. Turkey regards the YPG as a terror group and an offshoot of the separatist PKK which it has been battling for decades inside its own borders."

The team of independent investigators from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrive in the UK on Monday from The Hague. :: Why are they here? They were invited by the Government last week to verify analysis of the nerve agent used in the 4 March attack in Salisbury. After that, the UK's Permanent Representative to the OPCW wrote to the Technical Secretariat, inviting them to come to the UK to take a sample, under Article 8 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. :: What is the nerve agent they will be looking at? Novichok is a Soviet-designed military grade nerve agent which was used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the UK Government says. It was identified by experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok meets the Chemical Weapon Convention's definition of a chemical weapon, toxic chemical and precursor. :: What will the inspectors do first? They will meet officials from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and police to talk about the process for collecting samples, including environmental ones, the Foreign Office has said. The samples will be sent to ""highly reputable international laboratories"" selected by the OPCW for testing. :: How long will this take? Results are expected to take at least two weeks. :: Who is to blame for the attack? Russia has been blamed by the UK Government for the attack in Salisbury. On 12 March, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson summoned the Russian Ambassador and asked for an explanation, setting a deadline of midnight the next day for Moscow to respond. The Foreign Office said that there was ""no meaningful response"". ""It is therefore Russia which is failing to comply with the provisions of the convention,"" they concluded. :: What does Russia say? Russia denies any role in the poisoning and its ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, even appeared to suggest the UK was behind it. ""When you have a nerve agent, you check it against certain samples you have in your laboratories,"" he said on Saturday. ""And Porton Down, as we now all know, is the largest military facility in the UK that has been dealing with chemical weapons research - and it's actually only eight miles from Salisbury."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country does ""not have such means"". He added: ""We have destroyed all our chemical weapons under international oversight unlike some of our partners."" :: What is the Foreign Secretary doing next? Mr Johnson will be in Brussels to brief EU foreign ministers on the Salisbury situation on Monday, before meeting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. He has alleged that Russia has ""been engaged in investigating the delivery of such agents, Novichok agents, for the purpose ... very likely for the purposes of assassination and that they have been producing and stockpiling Novichok"". This would be a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The National Security Council will meet later this week to decide what further measures could be taken, including targeting Russian wealth in Britain. :: A poisoned spy - the story so far"

2018-03-19,The Gambling Commission has recommended the maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) should be set at ¬£30 or less.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180319184432/https://news.sky.com/story/gambling-machine-review-recommends-30-stake-limit-11296585,"Shares in bookmakers William Hill and Ladbrokes Coral were up 4% in early trading as the proposals stopped short of speculation that the commission would go further. Anti-FOBT campaigners - who call the terminals the ""crack cocaine of gambling"" - have criticised the regulator after it failed to adopt a maximum stake of ¬£2. High-stake, high-speed electronic casino games are said to be dangerously addictive and currently allow a stake of up to ¬£100 every 20 seconds, enabling a player to theoretically gamble away ¬£18,000 an hour. The ¬£30 limit would apply to ""non-slot"" games such as roulette - by far the most popular FOBT game. The Commission's investigation was launched to try to reduce the risk to consumers. It found that there should be a stake limit of ¬£30 or less ""if it is to have a significant effect on the potential for players to lose large amounts of money in a short space of time"". There are more than 30,000 fixed-odds betting terminals around the country, which currently have a maximum ¬£100 stake limit. A long-awaited review published last October recommended this should be cut to ¬£2, ¬£20. ¬£30 or ¬£50. Cutting the stake limit across FOBTs to ¬£2 could have resulted in a sharp reduction in revenues for many bookmakers. Jim McMahon, Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, said he is ""disappointed"" with the guidance and tweeted: ""I hope Gov go further"". Carolyn Harris MP described it as ""outrageous"" that the watchdog was not ""brave enough"" to adopt the ¬£2 limit and said the machines ""blight"" lives. Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur said: ""We've put consumers at the heart of our advice - advice which is based on the best available evidence and is focused on reducing the risk of gambling-related harm."" Ministers must now decide whether to implement the recommendations, which also include additional restrictions on the way gambling machines can be played. They include bans on the ability of players to switch between different types of games in a single session. There is also a call for bookmakers to track customers' habits in using gaming machines, and extending player protections that already apply to FOBTs to other gaming terminals. The Gambling Commission said the stake limit should be ¬£2 on FOBT slot games, such as fruit machines. The Association of British Bookmakers, responding to the announcement, said it was now considering the recommendations and that it fully understood public concern. ""In the interim, we remain committed to introducing further measures to address problem gambling and will continue to work with all interested parties,"" it added. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""While certainly not the outcome the bookmakers would have originally hoped for, this is better than what had been feared following January's news sharp cuts in stake limits was on the cards. ""Gambling machines are big money-spinners for the bookies. ""The new limits will likely see this fall in the future, but a higher cap on roulette-based games could help protect some of the huge revenues these machines make."""

2018-03-20,"Inflation fell to a seven-month low last month raising hopes there has been a ""turning point"" in Britain's Brexit-linked cost-of-living squeeze.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/inflation-falls-to-seven-month-low-says-ons-11297717,"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation fell to 2.7% in February, from 3% the month before, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That raises the prospect that wage growth, which has been lagging behind price increases and leaving consumers feeling worse off, could catch up soon. Phil Gooding, ONS head of CPI, said: ""Many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system."" Lower petrol prices and cheaper hotel rooms - compared to a period last year when price readings were taken on Valentine's Day - were among the reasons for the decline in CPI in February, which was slightly bigger than expected. There was also a more muted rise in the cost of food and drink than in the same period of 2017, when a shortage of vegetables from Europe such as lettuce and courgettes affected supply. The figures come two days before the Bank of England's next interest rate decision but are unlikely to change expectations about the timing of the next hike - with many experts pencilling in May for a rate rise but others urging the Bank to keep it unchanged until later. Inflation had been steadily climbing in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in June 2016 - whose result led to a collapse in the pound, driving import prices higher and feeding through to the cost of goods in shops. It has been at 3% or slightly above since September. But that effect is now tapering out while the pound has recovered much of its lost ground. Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the fall in inflation ""confirms that we have now reached a turning point"" but that this did not diminish the case for a rate hike in May. Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Businesses and households will be relieved that the peak impact of sterling's depreciation on inflation now appears to have largely washed through. ""This is certainly a boon for consumers who have been wedged between high food prices on the one hand and subdued earnings on the other for an extended period."" Labour market data to be published on Wednesday - covering the three months to January - is expected to show wage growth climbing to 2.6%, not far off the latest inflation reading. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the ""living standards crisis"" was far from over despite the relief provided by the latest figures. ""Working people will still be worse off at the end of this Parliament than before the crash,"" she said."

The company's founder and chief executive has not commented on reports or made any public appearances following their publication. Damian Collins MP, the chair of the culture committee, has written to Facebook's chief executive to formally request that he appear before them in an oral evidence session. Mr Collins wrote that the DCMS committee ""has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent. ""Your officials' answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the Committee,"" Mr Collins informed Mr Zuckerberg. ""It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process."" In his letter, Mr Collins continued: ""There is a strong public interest test regarding user protection. Accordingly we are sure you will understand the need for a representative from right at the top of the organisation to address concerns. ""Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to 'fixing' Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you."" Conservative MP and minister for international trade, Greg Hands, noted that the Zip Code on the letter was incorrect, however. ""Old technology (ironically) but the letter may not even get there. Zip Code 94205 is Sacramento, in an entirely different part of California. Menlo Park is 94025,"" he wrote. Old technology (ironically) but the letter may not even get there. Zip Code 94205 is Sacramento, in an entirely different part of California. Menlo Park is 94025. #DetailsMatter. https://t.co/1aUdqtvWMU The letter comes just hours before Facebook plans to hold a crisis meeting for all employees following the allegations that data belonging to its users was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica is accused of illegally harvesting the personal data of 50 million Facebook users. This crisis meeting follows a stock fall of 7% on Monday which wiped $37bn (¬£26bn) off its value as investigations are launched by the UK's Information Commissioner as well as European authorities. Facebook shares were nearly 3% lower in early trading on Tuesday while other platforms, including Twitter and Snapchat's owner, were also hit. The letter stated that the committee would like to receive Mr Zuckerberg's response by Monday 26 March. The UK's data regulator, the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has sought an urgent court warrant to search the premises of Cambridge Analytica in London for evidence of any breaches of the Data Protection Act. Ms Denham is pursuing evidence as part of her look at the company's use of data analytics for political purposes and has filed for the warrant after Cambridge Analytica failed to respond to a deadline for access to its records. Facebook may also be facing an investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission regarding whether it may have violated the terms of a consent decree, according to Bloomberg. This investigation related to whether it allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest user data in violation of its policies, according to Bloomberg's anonymous source. It follows news that Facebook's staff were themselves attending Cambridge Analytica's offices on Monday night, which Ms Denham demanded they cease, stating that the social media company's search ""would potentially compromise a regulatory investigation"". Cambridge Analytica told Sky News it has been in touch with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) since February 2017, when it hosted the ICO's team in its London office ""to provide total transparency on all the data we hold, its usage, and other aspects of our business"". ""We have been fully compliant and proactive in our conversations with the ICO,"" the company added. ""Since early last year we have subsequently cooperated with the ICO on multiple lines of enquiry, including most recently on the Facebook data and derivatives that we received from GSR, the research company that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research. ""On this point we have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection. ""We remain committed to helping the ICO and all other concerned organisations in their investigations and audits."" On Tuesday afternoon, around 10 plastic boxes were removed from an address in Oxford Street, central London, where Cambridge Analytica is based. The building is home to several companies and the men removing the boxes would not confirm where they had come from. At least one box contained files, documents and papers. On the second floor, where Cambridge Analytics has its offices, the blinds were drawn, but earlier chief executive Alexander Nix was seen walking around."

2018-03-20,"A new report by the Women and Equalities Committee says the law must be reformed to give fathers 12 weeks' leave in their child's first year, higher paternity pay and rights to more flexible work.¬†",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/shared-parental-leave-even-in-peppa-pig-daddy-pig-is-the-one-who-works-11297559,"MPs say men want to take a more active parenting role, but the law currently blocks it. Jeremy Davis from the Fatherhood Institute tells Sky News why so many men don't feel able to take up paternity leave. Britain's dads already want to spend more time with their children. The last thing they need is a hashtag to persuade them to do so. The government's #sharethejoy campaign, which urges more dads to take time off as shared parental leave, shows how out of touch the government is with the realities of modern family life. Men aren't taking significant chunks of time off work when they become fathers - not because they don't want to, but because they can't afford to. The Women and Equalities Committee's report on Fathers and the Workplace recognises this, and shows in spades that the UK's infrastructure for supporting new parents is no longer fit for purpose. The gap between mothers' and fathers' entitlements to parenting leave is wider in the UK than anywhere else in the developed world. Mums can take 52 weeks' maternity leave (albeit mostly on low or no pay); men get just two weeks' paternity leave. Shared parental leave, launched against that backdrop in 2015, has been a damp squib. Why? Because really it's just transferable maternity leave - so it's still built on the concept that mums should be ""in charge"" of looking after the baby, the same belief that underpins our unacceptably high levels of pregnancy discrimination and the gender pay gap. Most families can't afford to share the leave anyway (even if they're eligible) because employers don't have to offer the same pay for dads on shared parental leave as they do to mums on maternity leave. Add to that the fact that many employers don't promote the system, and certainly don't clarify to men that it's an option, and it's not hard to see why take-up has been so pathetic. Parenting leave isn't the only problem we dads face, of course. There are lots of ways in which British culture fetishises motherhood and relegates dads to the status of secondary parents. It's 2018 and our leading high street retailer of baby clothes and equipment is still called Mothercare. Parenting books aimed at dads have patronising titles like The New Dad's Survival Guide, Pacify Me and Dude, You're Gonna Be A Dad. TV shows like Motherland, adverts and children's books portray fathers as hapless fools. In Peppa Pig, for example, Daddy Pig is the one who makes mistakes while Mummy Pig is in the background sorting everything out. And publicly-funded services continue to view fathers as an afterthought, providing services designed for and promoted only to mothers, despite the mountains of evidence showing how important fathers can be, both for child outcomes and in terms of their impact on mothers, not to mention how useful fathers themselves might find some external support. It's still common for men entering children's centres and nurseries to be looked at as if they're an alien - and for the very few men who dare to get jobs in such settings to suffer unfounded assumptions that they are closet paedophiles. Only last year Andrea Leadsom, the then candidate for Prime Minister, the highest office in our land, went on record with claims that it would be ""cautious and sensible"" to not employ a male nanny. So it's refreshing that the WEC report recognises the obstacles that currently block dads from greater involvement - and proposes ways of shifting the balance, including more (and, crucially, better-paid) time-off for men when they become fathers. Research shows that three months' well paid, use-it-or-lose-it fatherhood leave in the first year (as the WEC recommends) could have a huge impact. It would equalise roles at home, transform fathering, boost children's outcomes, and improve parental relationships, leading to higher couple satisfaction and lower rates of separation. And because the change begins to put men and women on similar footings at work, it would challenge pregnancy discrimination and the gender pay gap. Let this be the start of the UK's next gender revolution. For dads and mums alike, it's long overdue."

Her remarks come after Sky News revealed UK police forces have lost track of 485 registered sex offenders including rapists and paedophiles - a 22% rise on March 2015. Dr Payne, who works with The Phoenix Post campaign group for victims of paedophiles, told Sky News: ""The Government have used the austerity argument to virtually deconstruct child protection in this country, until it is exactly what you see before you - a sex offender's playground, protected by an anti-victim prejudice-groomed government, unwittingly force-funded by good and decent taxpayers. ""For the sake of the children, it's long past time that we change the way this works."" :: How many registered sex offenders are missing in your region? A Ministry of Justice report published last October showed there were a total of 55,236 registered sex offenders living in England and Wales in 2016/17. They are subject to Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappas), where authorities manage the risk posed by certain sexual and violent criminals living in the community. Peter Kirkham, a former detective chief inspector with the Metropolitan Police, said cuts to forces and the probation service meant it had become more difficult to monitor registered sex offenders. He told Sky News: ""The Government keeps pursuing the idea that you can keep doing more with less. ""There is no mystery to police work. If you have more officers and resources, you will have better results. ""There has been a massive increase in the number of people on the sex offenders' register. At the same time, there have been massive cuts to the police and probation service. ""The probation service has suffered from privatisation which has been an unmitigated disaster."" The Home Office has insisted the UK has ""some of the toughest powers in the world"" to deal with registered sex offenders and the number missing is less than 1% of the total on the register. ""We have significantly strengthened the system of reporting that sex offenders are subject to, and a range of civil orders have given police more powers to manage their behaviour,"" the spokesman said. ""When a registered sex offender goes missing, their details are recorded on national and international systems and the police will actively seek out further information and intelligence to locate them."""

Despite Britain formally accusing Russia, Mr Corbyn maintained there still needed to be an ""absolutely definitive answer to the question (of) where did the nerve agent come from"". ""I asked the Russians be given a sample so that they can say categorically one way or the other,"" Mr Corbyn told the BBC's World At One. The Labour leader added that the chemical, believed to be a nerve agent known as novichok, was ""made from Russia, clearly"". His comment sparked fury from several Labour MPs. John Woodcock, a long-standing critic, said it was ""worrying"" Mr Corbyn was ""asserting a different position"" on Russian culpability to other frontbenchers. He claimed shadow chancellor John McDonnell had gone further, by saying he ""agreed completely"" that ""Russia is culpable"". Mr Woodcock told Sky News: ""Labour MPs being threatened with retribution unless they toe the line cannot be sure which line they are supposed to toe. ""But, more importantly, this needs to be resolved as it is obviously not an approach that would work if we were in charge of the country during a national security crisis."" Another Corbyn critic, Ian Austin, mocked his leader's suggestion. He wrote on Twitter: ""Does anyone seriously think Putin will say: 'Thanks for the sample. We have now examined it and yes, I'm sorry to say that it did come from Russia and was then given to one of our agents to murder Mr Skripal in the way we have murdered lots of other opponents?' Who thinks that?"" Tory housing minister Dominic Raab compared the suggestion to ""asking the bank robber to identify the bullets from a heist"". Scottish Conservative MP Paul Masteron also called it ""naive to the point of being dangerous"". The Labour leader's office declined to comment when approached by Sky News. Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed claims his country sanctioned or conducted the attack over two weeks ago in Wiltshire as ""nonsense"". He called it a tragedy but added: ""It is complete drivel, rubbish, nonsense that somebody in Russia would allow themselves to do such a thing ahead of elections and the World Cup."""
2018-03-20,A glacier larger than Spain could raise sea levels dramatically after scientists found more of it is being melted by seawater than previously thought.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/sea-level-warning-as-scientists-find-larger-part-of-massive-totten-glacier-floating-11298094,"Antarctica's Totten Glacier could increase sea levels by about three metres (9.8ft) if it all melted, scientists from the Australian Antarctic Division warned. After spending the southern hemisphere's summer on the glacier, scientists discovered more of the ice is floating on the ocean than initially thought. Totten is one of the fastest-flowing and largest glaciers in Antarctica so scientists wanted to keep an eye on how fast it is melting due to the massive amounts of water it could unleash. Using artificially created seismic waves to see through the ice, researchers found parts which they thought were on solid ground were actually floating, meaning they risk melting faster. Recent research had already found Totten's underbelly was being eroded by warm, salty sea water flowing hundreds of miles inland through underwater gateways. ""In some locations we thought were grounded, we detected the ocean below indicating that the glacier is in fact floating,"" said Paul Winberry from Central Washington University, who spent the summer studying the glacier. He said the discovery could help explain recent periods of accelerated melting. ""It also means the Totten might be more sensitive to climate variations in the future,"" he added. Glaciers hold most of the Earth's fresh water and as they move down valleys, mountains and slopes over many centuries they melt into the water causing sea levels to rise. Between 2002 and 2016, Antarctica lost 125 gigatonnes of ice annually, causing global sea levels to rise by 0.35mm a year, NASA found. Ben Galton-Fenzi, from the Australian Antarctic Division, said: ""Since the 1900s the global sea level has risen by around 20cm and by the end of the century it's projected to rise by up to one metre or more, but this is subject to high uncertainty which is why studying glaciers such as the Totten is important. ""These precise measurements of Totten Glacier are vital to monitoring changes and understanding them in the context of natural variations, and the research is an important step in assessing the potential impact on sea-level under various future scenarios."" The team has left instruments on the glacier to measure flow, speed and thickness over the next 12 months."

The move left on-air staff without significant protections from their employer - including sick pay. ""If you didn't do it, you didn't work - no choice,"" Radio 4's Money Box presenter Paul Lewis revealed. He told the Commons culture committee on Tuesday: ''This isn't the story of well-paid presenters trading through companies to avoid tax. ""This is the story of the BBC forcing hundreds of presenters to form companies and treat them as freelancers."" Kirsty Lang, presenter of the arts programme Front Row since 2004, said ""all my worst fears came true"" when she was moved on to the new contract. ""Not long after I went freelance, my stepdaughter died suddenly,"" she said. ""I was unable to take bereavement leave, in fact I went back and did my first show even before her funeral because I had to get some money in. ""And then two years after that I was diagnosed with cancer. ""I had surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy. I worked the whole way through."" Ms Lang said she took a month off after the treatment because she had ""set money aside"" and gone to a financial adviser for help. BBC radio presenter Liz Kershaw also claimed colleagues had ""gone through hell"". ""There are people who've nearly died,"" she said. ""The hell they've been through and nobody has listened to them."" Ms Kershaw added she worked for the BBC for six months without being paid ""a penny"" - because she refused to set up a PCS for her salary to be paid into. She accused her employer of making a ""disgusting"" and ""tactical"" move by releasing a statement the night before responding to criticism when they ""realised what evidence was coming out"". The announcement was that a new independent dispute resolution process would be set up, which might lead to the BBC paying towards historical bills that run up to six figures. Following the evidence hearing on Tueday, Labour MP and committee member Julie Elliott described the corporation as a ""bullying employer, whether by design or a result of strange management practices"". The BBC said in a statement that it had ""always tried to balance our responsibilities to presenters with our responsibility to spend the licence fee appropriately"". It added: ""The BBC is aware that there is a very high hurdle where public money is concerned and the whole purpose of the work is to inform and advise, so we cannot prejudge the outcome. ""The process will only consider whether the BBC should contribute towards demands for employer's National Insurance Contributions, not demands for other taxes which individuals are liable for."""

The low level of joy among Britons has been uncovered in time for International Day of Happiness, which is marked on 20 March each year. So what is it about Britain that makes Britons so miserable? Six out of 10 blamed rudeness and 53% blamed the weather. Other choices were queues (25%), litter (34%) and, strangely enough, moaners (43%). The state of politics (41%) was also a popular choice as a cause of everyday unhappiness. According to the research, Britons cope with their unhappiness through music (47%), family time (44%) and TV(44%). Some 31% turn to sugar, while 24% use exercise. The study is by Swiss herb drop manufacturer Ricola and seems keen to encourage Britons to recognise Switzerland as a happier country. Unfortunately, however, the study also found that only 36% of British people are able to pinpoint Switzerland on a map of Europe. Instead, Britons are more likely to identify Australia as the happiest place on Earth. According to a UN study last week, the world's happiest place is Finland and Burundi is the least happy. Finland was followed by Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Netherlands Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Australia in the top 10. Britain was 19th, one behind the US."

The figures come as Childline launches Understand Me, a campaign encouraging young people to ask for help if they suffer racial bullying and discrimination.

2018-03-20,Plans to crack down on irresponsible bosses of failed companies - and give increased protection to affected workers and suppliers ‚Äì have been announced by the Government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/government-plans-crackdown-on-reckless-company-bosses-11297668,"It follows controversy over the recent collapse of construction and outsourcing giant Carillion and before that the demise of retailer BHS. The Government said that most firms were run responsibly but that recent cases had raised concerns that company directors could ""unfairly shield themselves from the effects of insolvency and ‚Äì in the worst cases ‚Äì profit from business failures while workers and small suppliers lose out"". Proposals include clawing back money for workers and suppliers who are owed cash, by reversing inappropriate ""asset stripping"" of companies on the verge of going bust. Directors would also be held personally liable - and face possible disqualification - if found to have ""recklessly"" sold a struggling company knowing it would fail. In addition, the Insolvency Service would be given new powers to investigate directors, while there would be a drive for more transparency over the way dividends pay-outs are decided, and the role of shareholders would be strengthened. The consultation, being launched on Tuesday, will also look for new ways to protect smaller suppliers which can be hit hardest when large companies go bust. The reforms are designed ""to help reinforce public trust and confidence in businesses"", the Government said. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Britain has a good reputation internationally for being a dependable place to do business, based on required high standards. ""This framework has been regularly upgraded and in the light of some recent corporate failures I believe the lessons should be learned and applied. ""These reforms will give the regulatory authorities much stronger powers to come down hard on abuse and to make irresponsible directors bear the consequences of their actions."" But shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: ""The Tories have spent years turning a blind eye to bad business behaviour. ""Scandals like the failure of BHS and Carillion showed how quickly the future of a company and its workforce can be sacrificed for the sake of a quick buck. ""The Government should have taken action then, instead of choosing to ignore alarm bell after alarm bell."""
2018-03-20,"A student armed with a handgun has opened fire at a US high school in Maryland, injuring two classmates.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/high-school-on-lockdown-after-shooting-in-maryland-11297932,"Great Mills High School said a gunman entered the building just before 8am (12pm GMT) on Tuesday and shot a female and male student in a hallway. A school resource officer responsible for security then fired at the attacker after hearing gunfire shortly before classes were due to begin. The gunman died later in hospital while the female victim is in a critical condition and the male victim is described as stable. The officer was not injured. It is not clear if he had struck the gunman or if the attacker had shot himself. County Sheriff Timothy Cameron said: ""When the shooting took place, our school resource officer, who was stationed inside the school, was alerted to the event and the shots being fired. ""He pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter - during that engagement, he fired a round at the shooter. Simultaneously the shooter fired a round as well."" He added: ""In the hours to come, in the days to come, through detailed investigation, we will be able to determine if our school resource officer's round struck the shooter."" The sheriff said the motive of the gunman was unclear. He said: ""You train to respond to this and you hope that you never ever have to. This is the realisation of your worst nightmare."" A St Mary's County Public School spokesman said: ""The building is orderly and the Sheriff's Office is conducting an investigation."" Witnesses tweeted from a secure area on site while other students were evacuated to a nearby school where they were reunited with their parents. Mollie Davis, a student at the school, tweeted: ""Hi Twitter. I am in Great Mills HS. My school is on a very real lockdown threat and there's already someone possibly dead. Please pray for us. ""You never think it'll be your school and then it is. Great Mills is a wonderful school and somewhere I am proud to go. Why us?"" I just boarded the bus to leave the school to go to the pick up center. I feel like there‚Äôs so much I want to say but I can‚Äôt find the right words. I wish everything was different. She later added: ""I am safe. The police came to my classroom and saw us to the bathroom and back and said we would be leaving soon."" St Mary's County sheriff's office told parents not to go to the school, but to report to nearby Leonardtown High School. Jonathan Freese, a student at the school, spoke to CNN from inside his maths classroom. He said the incident happened around 8am (12pm GMT), almost as soon as school had started. He said: ""I've heard one person got hurt trying to get the gun. ""I'm a little shaken up. I didn't think it would really happen. It happened in the art hallway. ""I'm surprised I didn't (hear gunshots). ""Police are checking on students and seeing if they are safe and we are going to be escorted out. We are told to leave our stuff. ""The police have responded really quickly."" He said they had completed training for the event of a gunman in school. He said: ""I know I'm safe. Everyone responded, I heard sirens within five minutes."" The county public schools' tweeted: ""There has been a Shooting at Great Mills High School. The school is on lock down the event is contained, the Sheriff's office is on the scene additional information to follow."" Students are being evacuated from GMHS and being bused to the reunification center at the Leonardtown HS campus. The building is orderly and the Sheriff‚Äôs Office is conducting an investigation. We will continue to update as more information becomes available. The school has faced threats of a shooting in the past, and just last month, the principal Jake Heibel told parents a threat was ""not substantiated"". Three years ago the school was evacuated and every locker searched after a hoax call was made threatening the school. Previous threats are going to be examined as part of the investigation. According to the Baltimore Sun, St. Mary's Ryken High School, a private school about 15 minutes away from Great Mills, has gone into lockdown. The shooting comes four days before the planned March For Our Lives, organised after the Florida shooting in February, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed."
2018-03-20,Fish and chips and chicken tikka masala could become rare treats rather than British staples because of climate change. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/climate-change-threatens-uks-favourite-foods-as-ingredients-increase-in-price-11297579,"Research by WWF suggests even the humble ploughman's could be under threat as heat stress on dairy herds hits milk and cheese production. Published ahead of Earth Hour, a world-wide environmental event, it examined how changing weather and temperature patterns could impact food production by 2050. Warmer sea temperatures could see significant reductions in cod. Chicken, rice, tomatoes and onions, key ingredients in Britain's most popular dish, the tikka masala, could all become more expensive. Other increasingly popular dishes such as ""smashed avocado on toast"" and even a cup of coffee, are at risk from climate change. Gareth Redmond-King from WWF said: ""The threat to these classic dishes just shows that climate change could impact every aspect of our lives in future if we don't act now. ""That's why this Earth Hour we want people to eat more sustainably. That doesn't necessarily mean going vegan or vegetarian - it means each of us cutting back on the amount of fish, meat and dairy. ""If each of us takes a small action, together we can combat climate change and future-proof our best-loved dishes."" :: Diners should look to 'fish of the future' The report also looked at the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing some of the UK's classic dishes. Lamb cawl, a traditional Welsh stew, was found to be the worst, because of the methane produced by sheep. Making a lamb cawl creates the same emissions as boiling the kettle for a cup of tea 258 times. Earth Hour takes place at 8.30pm on Saturday, 24 March. WWF is urging people to make promises to change their life in one small way to help the environment, such as refusing plastic cutlery, carrying a keep cup or cutting back on meat."
2018-03-20,The economy of the dark web is driven by its ability to resist the enforcement of laws prohibiting the trade of particular items.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/can-you-buy-chemical-weapons-on-the-dark-web-11297819,"Drugs are the primary commodity on sale there, but vendors are also available for weaponry, stolen financial details, and images of child sexual exploitation. Following the British assessment that the Kremlin was behind the attempted murder of former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal, a number of alternative hypotheses began to cite the dark web. One claimed that the nerve agent used to poison him - one of a series developed by the Russian state called novichok - could have been reproduced by organised criminals and sold to someone else with a grievance via the dark web. Cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows found plenty of drugs manufacturing guides available on the dark web, but there was no indication that these covered chemical weapons. Equally, there was no suggestion that chemical weapons themselves were being sold on dark net markets. Becky Pinkard, Digital Shadows' vice president of IT and threat intelligence, explained to Sky News there could be a number of reasons for that. ""Part of it is dependent on the consumer market approach, on consumer demand. The market for chemical weapons is tiny compared with the market for fake currency or drugs. ""The other angle is the return on work for the criminals, and the kind of sentencing and prison time associated with that risk. ""The time to be served for developing and selling a nerve agent means that the risk outweighs the reward, and the challenge regarding transporting the material is very difficult."" There is a thriving research chemical community that exists and is active on the dark web, Ms Pinkard told Sky News, which informs people of how to build their own drugs laboratory in a similar fashion to the television show Breaking Bad. These ""mainly focus on the production of MDMA"", according to Ms Pinkard, and are resistant to talking about manufacturing poisons. In 2015, a software programmer from Liverpool was jailed after attempting to purchase the toxin ricin from an undercover FBI agent in the US. The fear that the attempted procurement of materials which could be used for terror purposes will result in a sting operation is even common among jihadist forums, Ms Pinkard to Sky News. Terror group al Qaeda had designed a poison gas bomb which it intended to detonate in the subway system of New York, although this attack did not take place. Digital Shadows told Sky News that one of its ex-military staff members was involved in handling dangerous materials as part of his military career. They reported him saying: ""You would need significant skills to develop a chemical weapon and not kill yourself. There's no guarantee you wouldn't harm yourself or screw up in the process."" Stewart Bertram, the director of threat intelligence at Digital Shadows, told Sky News: ""If nerve agents are being sold, then we're not seeing it. ""We're not specifically looking for it - we're a cybersecurity company,"" he added, but chemical weapons groups were definitely not among the thriving economic communities on the dark web. ""If you get involved in that kind of thing, you'll have every agency in the world coming after you."""
2018-03-20,An RAF engineer has died after a Red Arrows jet crashed at RAF Valley in Anglesey.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/raf-engineer-has-died-after-red-arrows-crash-11298178,"The pilot of the Hawk aircraft survived and is receiving medical treatment. The plane crashed at the air base in North Wales and photos purporting to be of the scene showed a large cloud of smoke exploding from the ground, reaching dozens of metres high. Others showed wreckage on the ground in the centre of an airfield. Group captain Nick Tucker-Lowe said in a statement: ""It's with great sadness that the RAF can confirm the death of an engineer from the RAF aerobatics team The Red Arrows in a tragic accident today. ""The engineer's family have been informed and have asked for a 24-hour period of grace before further details are released. ""The pilot of the aircraft survived the incident and is currently receiving medical care."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of the RAF engineer at this incredibly sad time."" The Welsh Ambulance Service said it was called shortly before 1.30pm on Tuesday to reports an aircraft had crashed at RAF Valley in Holyhead. A spokesman said they sent an emergency ambulance to the scene and Wales Air Ambulance was also in attendance. An eyewitness said they saw someone parachute from the plane just before it crashed. Sian Williams told the Daily Post: ""I was sat at Rhosneigr train station waiting for the train and you can see the airfield from there. ""I was watching the Red Arrow flying because you hardly ever see them and then it looked like it was about to land. Then, next thing I saw was the parachute and then the plane hit the runway and went up in flames."" The RAF is asking anybody with photographs of the incident to send them in to help with an investigation. Prince William served with the RAF's Search and Rescue Force at the Anglesey air base for three years. RAF Valley is used as a training base for Hawk aircraft, which is the jet used by the Red Arrows team. Sky News Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said: ""The Red Arrows are located at RAF Scampton during the summer season but during the off-season they train at various bases across the UK, including RAF Valley."" The Red Arrows are the RAF's aerobatic display team which performs at summer events, including the annual Trooping The Colour ceremony in London which the Royal Family watches from the Buckingham Palace balcony. Famous for their red, white and blue vapour trails, impressive stunts and trademark diamond formation, they are a familiar sight at air shows and military parades. In 2011 two Red Arrows pilots died - one when their jet crashed after taking part in an air show and another when the pilot was ejected from his aircraft while it was on the ground."
2018-03-20,"A cap on ""punitive"" costs will form part of the Government's social care reforms, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-hints-at-cap-on-social-care-costs-11298054,"In a move that would reverse the controversial and electorally damaging decision to ditch a cap from the Conservative election manifesto, Mr Hunt said it would be reinstated to help spread the risk posed by the ""illness lottery"" of conditions such as dementia. In his first speech since he took responsibility for a Government Green Paper on social care, he said the cap would be part of a number of ""risk-pooling"" measures. Mr Hunt told an audience of health and social workers that funding would be based on ""a partnership between the state and individuals"". As well as a cap, underwritten by Government, the Green Paper is likely to propose a saving or insurance scheme for young people. The elderly may face tax rises, perhaps in the form of national insurance for working pensioners, or a levy on property wealth. ""The way that our current charging system operates is far from fair,"" he said. ""This is particularly true for families faced with the randomness and unpredictability of care and the punitive consequences that can come from developing certain conditions over others. ""If you develop dementia and require long-term residential care, you are likely to have to lose a significant chunk of your savings and the equity in your home to pay for that care. ""But if you require long-term treatment for cancer you won't find anything like the same cost. ""So people's financial wellbeing in old age ends up defined less by their industry and service in their working lives and more by the lottery of which illness they get. ""We therefore need a system that includes an element of risk pooling."" Social care was hugely controversial during the election after the Conservative manifesto abandoned a cap on care costs, instead proposing a ""floor"" of ¬£100,000 beyond which assets would be protected. Within days, the Prime Minister said she would introduce an ""absolute limit"" on the money people will have to pay. Mr Hunt said seven principles would guide the reforms: quality and safety; integrated NHS and social care; giving control to those receiving care; a valued workforce; better practical support for families and carers; a sustainable funding model; and greater security for all. In 2011 a review by Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a cap of ¬£35,000, a proposal accepted and subsequently ditched by David Cameron ahead of the 2015 election. The level of any new cap, and the wider mechanism for meeting rising social care costs, will be determined by the Green Paper due to be published in the summer. As well as a cap other proposals understood to have been floated include an insurance model for younger people to pay into, and requiring working pensioners to pay National Insurance. Social care is acknowledged as one of the most pressing issues facing the country, with rising demand already having a huge impact on NHS services. It has also emphasised the disparity between free provision of healthcare costs for illnesses such as cancer, and means-testing for conditions such as dementia. While healthcare is met from the ring-fenced NHS budget social care is met by local authorities, which have faced declining budgets over the last eight years. Outlining a ""blueprint"" for the Green Paper, Mr Hunt said health and social care services will need to work more closely in future, and standards of care needed to rise. Jeremy Hughes, Alzheimer's Society Chief Executive said: ""Jeremy Hunt's seven principles must not be wishful thinking for those impoverished by having dementia. ""The Government must now commit the funding to make good on these principles. ""Without the necessary funding, vulnerable people will continue to struggle needlessly. ""By 2021, a million people in the UK will have dementia, and we need urgent action to create a system that can meet that challenge."""

However, the top Brussels official immediately was attacked for neglecting to include a reference to the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia using the chemical weapon novichok. Mr Juncker was also criticised for ignoring accusations of ballot box rigging over Mr Putin's victory in Russia's presidential election. In his letter, Mr Juncker sent Mr Putin his ""congratulations on your re-election as President of the Russian Federation"". ""I have always argued that positive relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation are crucial to the security of our continent,"" he wrote. ""Our common objective should be to re-establish a cooperative pan-European security order. ""I hope that you will use your fourth term in office to pursue this goal. I will always be a partner in this endeavour. ""I wish you every success in carrying out your high responsibilities."" Asked if the Prime Minister was disappointed Mr Juncker had not referred to the Salisbury attack in his letter to Mr Putin, Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""What I would point to is the strong response which you have seen from across the EU, from leaders in condemning what happened in Salisbury and standing with the UK."" However, the leader of Conservative MEPs in the European Parliament, Ashley Fox, branded the letter ""disgraceful"" as he accused Mr Juncker of ""appeasing"" the Russian President. ""To congratulate Vladimir Putin on his election victory without referring to the clear ballot rigging that took place is bad enough,"" he said. ""But his failure to mention Russia's responsibility for a military nerve agent attack on innocent people in my constituency is nauseating. ""The European Commission President is appeasing a man who poses a clear threat to Western security."" Prominent Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU, also called Mr Juncker's letter ""shameful"". This is no time for congratulations. We will always need dialogue with Russia, but closer ties must be conditional on respect for the rules based international order & fundamental values https://t.co/iVfhLB6TrL Guy Verhofstdat, a leader of one of the European Parliament's largest groupings of MEPs, told Mr Juncker ""this is no time for congratulations"". ""We will always need dialogue with Russia, but closer ties must be conditional on respect for the rules based international order & fundamental values,"" he wrote on Twitter. On Monday, EU foreign ministers condemned the attack on the Skripals in Salisbury as a ""reckless and illegal act"" and expressed ""unqualified solidarity"" with the UK. However, despite calling on Russia to ""urgently"" answer questions over the attack, they stopped short of fully backing the UK Government's assessment the Russian state was responsible. Mr Putin's decisive victory in Russia's presidential election attracted allegations of vote rigging by opponents. Earlier this month, the European Parliament announced it would not be observing the election as MEPs declared an offer by Russian officials to cover the travel expenses of international observers ""goes against the fundamental ethics of election observation"". According to the Kremlin, US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Putin on his victory in a telephone call."
2018-03-20,"Michael Gove has admitted the Government accepted a ""sub-optimal outcome"" for the UK's fishing industry in negotiations over a Brexit transition period.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/michael-gove-admits-brexit-transition-deal-sub-optimal-for-uk-fishing-industry-11298167,"The Environment Secretary faced anger from MPs after the Government was accused of a ""betrayal"" of coastal communities. It follows the Prime Minister's decision to allow the EU to maintain control of fisheries policy until the end of 2020 - more than 21 months after the UK formally leaves the bloc. Mr Gove confessed UK negotiators had failed to move their EU counterparts on fishing matters in discussions over a Brexit transition deal, the draft terms of which were revealed on Monday. Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Gove told MPs the Government had initially asked for the UK to be treated as a ""third country and equal partner"" in annual negotiations over fishing quotas. ""We pressed hard during negotiations to secure this outcome, and we are disappointed that the EU was not willing to move on this,"" he said. However, Mr Gove stressed the ""hard work"" of UK negotiators had resulted in some concessions for the country's fishing industry. ""The revised text clarifies that the UK's share of quotas will not change during the implementation period, and that the UK can attend international negotiations,"" he said. A number of Tory MPs have expressed anger at the terms of the draft Brexit transition deal, with Mr Gove insisting he is also dissatisfied. ""The first thing I will happily acknowledge is that there is disappointment in fishing communities,"" he said. ""As someone whose father was a fish merchant and whose grandparents went to sea to fish, I completely understand how fishing communities feel about the situation at the moment, and I share their disappointment."" The Brexit campaigner also told MPs to focus on the post-Brexit ""opportunities"" for the UK's fishing fleet. He said: ""The opportunities available to us after the transition deal are critically important. We must secure them. ""That has meant that in the transition deal we have accepted a sub-optimal outcome. ""But it is only for an additional 12 months and we must keep our eyes on the prize."" Earlier, Tory MP Douglas Ross had warned Mr Gove there is no way he can ""sell this deal in the transitional period as anything like a success to fishing communities"" to constituents in his Moray seat, who he claimed ""feel let down and angered by the Government"". Fellow Scottish Conservative MP John Lamont also told Mr Gove he feels ""badly let down by this deal, because we are not going to be taking control of our waters as quickly as we had hoped"". Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood urged the Government to deem the draft transition deal ""unacceptable"" and to tell the EU ""we voted to take back control of our fish, our money, our borders and our laws"". Mr Gove was also repeatedly attacked by SNP MPs, with the party's Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins accusing the Government of using the UK's fishing fleet as a ""bargaining chip"", with the industry now left in the ""worst of all worlds"". On Wednesday, leading Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage will support a protest against the terms of the transition deal. Reviving a scene from the 2016 EU referendum campaign, a fishing boat will sail up the River Thames before dumping baskets of fish outside Parliament, in order to highlight how EU policies force fishing vessels to do the same on a daily basis. The row came as a new BMG Research poll revealed most Britons (63%) believe the EU will come out better than the UK in Brexit negotiations, with the survey showing only 37% think the UK will fare better. EU leaders will meet later this week to decide whether to back a Brexit transition deal for the UK, with European Council President Donald Tusk warning on Tuesday some countries are still yet to sign up to the plans. In an invitation to EU leaders ahead of the summit, Mr Tusk wrote: ""Yesterday our negotiators reached a solution on parts of the withdrawal agreement. ""Whether all 27 member states can welcome this at the European Council remains open. ""I still need a couple more hours to consult with some of the most concerned member states."""

2018-03-20,Counter Terrorism police say more than one in five tip-offs from the public provides useful intelligence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180320190158/https://news.sky.com/story/tip-offs-from-the-public-are-helping-in-the-fight-against-terror-11297574,"The revelation is being made as part of a national advertising project urging people to report suspicions. Research suggests that while more than 80% of people feel motivated to report suspicious activity or behaviour many are unclear about exactly what they should be looking for. Police have released a video highlighting attack methods in phase two of the ACT (Action Counters Terrorism) campaign. The film is based on real-life foiled plots and shows examples of terrorist-related suspicious activity. Head of Counter Terrorism in the North West, Detective Chief Superintendent Dominic Scally, praised to public's willingness to respond following last year's unprecedented rise in terrorist activity saying record numbers of people had contacted the police online, or via a confidential hotline. He said: ""We want people to trust their instincts and act by reporting in confidence something they feel is unusual or suspicious. ""Like other criminals, terrorists need to plan and that one piece of information could be vital in helping us to stop an attack. ""We need the help of communities to defeat terrorism and this campaign will inform people of what to look out for and how to report their concerns."" Det. Chief Supt. Scally said that any piece of information, no matter how small, could make the difference between a lethal attack and a successful disruption. Examples of suspicious activity could include: :: Hiring large vehicles or similar for no obvious reasons :: Buying or storing a large amount of chemicals, fertilisers or gas cylinders for no obvious reasons :: Taking notes or photos of security arrangements, or inspecting CCTV cameras in an unusual way :: Looking at extremist material, including on the so-called Dark Web, or sharing and creating content that promotes or glorifies terrorism. :: Someone receiving deliveries for unusual items bought online. :: Embracing or actively promoting hateful ideas or an extremist ideology. :: Possessing firearms or other weapons or showing an interest in obtaining them :: Holding passports or other documents in different names, for no obvious reasons :: Anyone who goes away travelling for long periods of time but is vague about where :: Someone carrying out suspicious or unusual bank transactions The new campaign comes amid criticism that the Government's Prevent strategy to turn vulnerable individuals away from extremism is deeply flawed. The Parsons Green terrorist Ahmad Hassan had been on the programme for more than a year before planting a bomb on a crowded London tube train. Dr David Lowe is a former Merseyside police officer who now works with the Home Office on 'Prevent'. He accepts that improvements should be made. He told Sky News: ""It's worthwhile re-branding and re-marketing it and saying it is about all of us in society. Its about protecting all of us...those who are vulnerable to being drawn in. ""Look at the circumstances behind it, what can we do to help them. It's about helping people and not just about picking on them."""

""Anthony McPartlin, 42 (18.11.75) of Chiswick has been charged by postal requisition on Wednesday, 21 March with drink-driving. ""He will appear at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on 4 April."" McPartlin was reportedly seen at Kingston police station in southwest London earlier today - the first time he has left his house since the arrest. He was involved in a collision with two other cars while driving his black Mini in Richmond just before 4pm on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/CjiMYPHTwl A child passenger in one of the cars - a green Mini - was taken to hospital as a precaution. She is believed to be a three-year-old girl. Others involved were treated at the scene for minor injuries. McPartlin's publicist has said the presenter is taking time out from his TV commitments, while the remaining episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway will be hosted solo by Declan Donnelly. Long-time presenting partner Donnelly said in a statement: ""Whilst I never thought I'd be in this position, after much discussion and careful consideration we've decided that the remaining two shows of this series of Saturday Night Takeaway will go ahead. ""We made a promise to take hundreds of deserving winners to Florida to watch the series finale, and we will honour that. ""Everyone at ITV and the Takeaway team feels we owe it to the audience to complete the series."" In January, McPartlin announced he was divorcing wife and Strictly Come Dancing make-up boss Lisa Armstrong after 11 years of marriage."
2018-03-21,Nigel Farage dumped dead fish into the Thames as he led a protest against the Government's Brexit transition deal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/nigel-farage-dumps-dead-fish-in-thames-in-protest-over-brexit-transition-deal-11298733,"The former UKIP leader and other Leave campaigners sailed on a fishing trawler dubbed ""HMS Brexit"", stopping outside Parliament to ceremonially throw crates of dead haddock overboard. Watching on from the Commons balcony were a small gathering of MPs - including Tory Sir Desmond Swayne, carrying a Union Jack flag. The stunt came after Brexiteers slammed the Government's agreement that the UK will only be ""consulted"" on fishing quotas during the Brexit transition, a deal Environment Secretary Michael Gove admitted was ""sub-optimal"". Farage dumps dead haddock into the Thames in protest over the Brexit transition deal which he says will hit the British fishing industry pic.twitter.com/FmTVjZm66p Mr Farage said he was ""very"" disappointed and that ""promises were made that haven't been kept"". He told Sky News: ""The ludicrous situation is that haddock stocks in the West Country are very good indeed. ""And yet the total allocation of haddock for the British fleet is 9%. ""What that means is the guys are going out fishing for other species, catching haddock because they can't avoid them - and fish like this are being thrown back dead. ""It's just mad, the whole thing."" :: Fishing industry could be hung out to dry He added: ""I don't think this Government's got the guts or the strength to stand up and take back our territorial waters."" Mr Farage admitted the fishing protest reminded him of the clash between Leave and Remain campaigners in 2016 - when Sir Bob Geldof led a flotilla of boats to disrupt a Brexiteer stunt. There were similarly comic scenes on Wednesday, when the Fishing for Leave organisers realised they could not dock at Embankment Pier for a press conference led by backbench Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. A Transport for London spokeswoman told Sky News no permission had been given to the group to dock, leaving the boat officially named ""Holladays R8"" to do laps on the Thames. A police boat later followed them back up the river. Pro-EU campaign group Best for Britain said: ""The Brexiteers are lost at sea with a stupid stunt like this. Today's comedy of errors is a metaphor for their Brexit plans. ""Taking back control from faceless bureaucrats maybe needs to start with Transport for London who run the pier they tried to dock at. All in all this was a fishing farce that made them all look ridiculous."" The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said Nigel Farage ""should have done his job as a member of the fisheries committee"" of MEPs rather than ""throwing dead fish in the Thames""."
2018-03-21,A former Playboy model has filed a lawsuit asking to be released from an agreement forbidding her from talking about an alleged affair with Donald Trump.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/playboy-model-news-firm-is-stopping-me-from-talking-about-trump-11298548,"Karen McDougal is suing American Media Inc (AMI), which publishes the National Enquirer, alleging the company took advantage of her ""to achieve its own political and financial ends"". Ms McDougal was paid $150,000 in 2016 for rights to the story of her affair with the business tycoon in 2006 and 2007. The story never ran but the agreement effectively stopped her from talking to any other publications about what her lawsuit described as a ""10-month romantic relationship"". McDougal says Mr Trump and AMI's owner David Pecker were close personal friends and the media company ""worked secretly"" with Mr Trump's personal ""fixer"" and Ms McDougal's then lawyer to ""buy her silence"". The lawsuit says Ms McDougal's relationship with Mr Trump and the ""cover-up"" are now ""open secrets"", due to recent news reports. And, while Ms McDougal's agreement was amended to allow her to respond to ""legitimate press inquiries"", AMI was not allowing this. ""...Every time prominent reporters contact Ms McDougal, AMI tells her exactly what she must say - nothing,"" the lawsuit adds. ""They threaten her with financial ruin if she does not remain 'loyal'. ""AMI, meanwhile, feeds those same reporters false information about Ms McDougal, her relationship with Mr Trump, and its own machinations to bind her to silence."" Mr Trump has denied allegations of sexual misconduct made by more than a dozen women during and after his 2016 presidential campaign. The lawsuit comes just weeks after porn star Stormy Daniels filed a lawsuit asking a judge to invalidate a non-disclosure agreement preventing her from talking about her affair with Mr Trump. She described the agreement as ""null and void and of no consequence"" because Mr Trump did not sign it. Ms McDougal, a fitness model who was named Playmate of the Year in 1998, had become aware of ""the broad effort to silence her and others"" and felt she ""must speak out"", according to her lawsuit. ""She will no longer allow AMI to profit from and control her with a fraudulent and illegal contract. ""She therefore asks this court to declare that contract void."""
2018-03-21,Sky News has been given exclusive access to an interactive 3D model of the Grenfell Tower which aims to provide an unrivalled understanding of the fire that killed 71 people.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/computer-imaging-and-real-footage-used-to-recreate-grenfell-tower-fire-11298550,"The team of architects, designers and academic researchers are called Forensic Architecture and they focus on investigating human rights violations throughout the world. Grenfell is their first project in the UK. The agency has scoured TV footage of the night, mobile phone data and witness testimony to recreate what people would have seen and heard and has used this to build a minute-by-minute account of the fire, covering eight hours. Bob Trafford is one of the researchers working on the project. He said: ""We realised that this was an event unprecedented in British history and in London's history and we resolved that there must be a way that we could make a unique contribution to the public understanding of this catastrophe. ""This will be a historical tool, this will be a tool that we hope will be the most complete publicly available record of the circumstances of the night of the fire and it's a record that will be built from all the publicly available information, information that we hope and that we are asking that the public will share with us."" One person with a powerful story to share is Jacqui Haynes. She has lived next to Grenfell Tower for 40 years and was outside that night and saw the flames engulf the building. She said: ""When you watch it just go up in seconds, it just didn't fit with what your mind knows should be happening. ""Then the people screaming and then realising they can't get out and shouting at the windows and waving their phones and screaming. At one point we were standing on the lane and we saw two people come flying out of the window."" Jacqui has spent the last nine months fighting to get justice for the Grenfell Community and now heads up the Lancaster West Residents Association. She said: ""We need to stand up for ourselves and make sure we are not just left to live in these conditions. We have to stand up now. ""It's our neighbours, it's our friends, people who we've known long enough to be like family. It wasn't just the tower burning that night it was like we were on fire."" :: Grenfell fire doors effective for half as long as expected Antonio Roncolato was one of hundreds of people trapped inside the Tower as the fire raged. He lived on the 10th floor with his son Christopher for almost 30 years. He survived in his flat for five hours, doing all he could to stay safe as the fire spread around him. He said: ""The moment I opened the door, a lot of smoke came in. Very hot, very strong, very dark. Pitch dark. And I realised, hold on a second, here you're in big trouble. ""So I closed the door quickly, went to the bathroom and I rinsed my eyes a little bit and then Christopher from downstairs sent me a picture of the tower burning and it was not, like, a small fire, it was like the whole side of the tower was on fire. ""So then I said 'Okay, you have to make sure that you now do the right thing because if you do something wrong you might not be able to get out alive from here'."" ""I made all my towels, bed towels, bath towels, bed linen, everything wet, and I tried to put it against the windows or on the windows themselves to try and contain the smoke from coming in. Smoke did come in and started filling up the living room and kitchen."" Antonio was one of the last people to leave the building alive. He was finally rescued at 6.30 in the morning. ""I was leaning my elbow onto the handrail because I could not see anything. Don't forget, I was totally blind because of the towel that I had on me. ""So, basically, we went down very quickly, synchronised, and as we reached the lower part of the tower then I could hear voices and, in no time, we were downstairs."" Antonio and Christopher have now moved out of a hotel and into temporary accommodation and are trying to get their lives back to some sort of normality. But like all those affected by the fire, they say their most pressing concern is getting the answers they need. The team at Forensic Architecture are hoping their digital model might provide some."

 but wage growth improved, official figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/unemployment-grows-but-wage-growth-improves-11298696,"It is the second month in a row the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported an increase in the jobless total - a rare setback in a broad trend of falling unemployment going back to 2011. But hopes for an end to the cost-of-living squeeze for those who are in work were boosted as the figures showed wage growth - excluding bonuses - improving to 2.6%. That was the highest rate since November 2016, and up from 2.5% reported last month. Average pay is still falling, in real terms, because wage settlements lag behind the increase in the cost of living. But separate figures published on Tuesday, showing a fall in inflation for February, suggested the gap was narrowing and that pay growth would soon pull ahead. Wednesday's jobs data also showed an increase of 168,000 in the number of people in work to 32.2 million, a record high. The pound - already buoyed this week by the announcement of a Brexit transition deal - rose by nearly a cent against the US dollar to nearly $1.41. Signs of a pick-up in pay growth could be seen as likely to fuel higher inflation and add pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates as soon as May. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Wage growth still isn't quite beating inflation, but both pay and prices now appear to be moving in the right direction for UK consumers. ""However there are a number of competing factors which muddy the short term picture for wages. ""The collapse of Carillion and the continued problems faced by high street outlets will act as a constraint on further progress in the labour market."""

The plane crashed at the air base in North Wales and photos purporting to be of the scene showed a large cloud of smoke exploding from the ground, reaching dozens of metres high. Others showed wreckage on the ground in the centre of an airfield. Group captain Nick Tucker-Lowe said in a statement: ""It's with great sadness that the RAF can confirm the death of an engineer from the RAF aerobatics team The Red Arrows in a tragic accident today. ""The engineer's family have been informed and have asked for a 24-hour period of grace before further details are released. ""The pilot of the aircraft survived the incident and is currently receiving medical care."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and colleagues of the RAF engineer at this incredibly sad time."" The Welsh Ambulance Service said it was called shortly before 1.30pm on Tuesday to reports an aircraft had crashed at RAF Valley in Holyhead. A spokesman said they sent an emergency ambulance to the scene and Wales Air Ambulance was also in attendance. An eyewitness said they saw someone parachute from the plane just before it crashed. Sian Williams told the Daily Post: ""I was sat at Rhosneigr train station waiting for the train and you can see the airfield from there. ""I was watching the Red Arrow flying because you hardly ever see them and then it looked like it was about to land. Then, next thing I saw was the parachute and then the plane hit the runway and went up in flames."" The RAF is asking anybody with photographs of the incident to send them in to help with an investigation. Prince William served with the RAF's Search and Rescue Force at the Anglesey air base for three years. RAF Valley is used as a training base for Hawk aircraft, which is the jet used by the Red Arrows team. Sky News Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall said: ""The Red Arrows are located at RAF Scampton during the summer season but during the off-season they train at various bases across the UK, including RAF Valley."" The Red Arrows are the RAF's aerobatic display team which performs at summer events, including the annual Trooping The Colour ceremony in London which the Royal Family watches from the Buckingham Palace balcony. Famous for their red, white and blue vapour trails, impressive stunts and trademark diamond formation, they are a familiar sight at air shows and military parades. In 2011 two Red Arrows pilots died - one when their jet crashed after taking part in an air show and another when the pilot was ejected from his aircraft while it was on the ground."

Miss Lionnet was allegedly beaten, killed and thrown on a bonfire by her employers after being accused of being ""in league"" with Kouider's ex-partner Mark Walton, a founding member of the Irish boy band. Mother-of-two Kouider and Medouni interrogated their nanny for hours to confirm their ""perverted suspicions"", the court was told. Jurors heard Kouider had become obsessed with the false idea Miss Lionnet was in league with Mr Walton and in rambling complaints she said he controlled the nanny through ""black magic"". Snippets of more than eight hours of mobile phone recordings of the defendants' interrogations were played to the jury. Jurors were told the aim of the recorded interrogations was to extract some sort of ""confession"", possibly to later embarrass Mr Walton. A scientist found she suffered a fractured jawbone hours before her death and she is also known to have suffered bruising, and fractures to her sternum and ribs between 36 hours and three days before dying. Mr Horwell said by looking at ""the state of Sophie"" you could tell that the final confession was ""anything but voluntary"". Mr Walton has categorically denied the allegations against him. The Old Bailey heard that the couple tortured Miss Lionnet in the bath then threw her body on a bonfire in the garden as they barbecued chicken. When Miss Lionnet's remains were uncovered by firefighters at the home in Southfields, southwest London, they were initially passed off as the carcass of a sheep. ""Medouni was asked what it was and he replied 'it's a sheep' which he said he had bought from Wimbledon market,"" the prosecutor said. He said she was subjected to a ""campaign of intimidation, torture and violence"" which left her completely ""crushed"" in the weeks before her death. Kouider and Medouni, who are both French nationals, deny murder but have admitted perverting the course of justice by burning the body. Medouni claimed Miss Lionnet died by accident in the bath while he interrogated her, but Kouider said in her defence statement she died in her sleep. Days before the trial, Medouni served a second defence statement saying that what he said before was untrue and designed to protect Kouider, and claimed instead that he was woken by Kouider and found Miss Lionnet in the bath. The trial continues on Wednesday."

He said he became concerned about the way data was being used by third-party application developers when he was employed there from 2011-2012. Mr Parakilas, a former operations manager, said executives who are still at the company were made aware of his concerns but failed to act. When asked if the company had ""turned a blind eye because they didn‚Äôt want to face the truth"", he replied: ""Yes, that was my impression."" Mr Parakilas made his comments to Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee this afternoon. The revelations come as Facebook faces increasing pressure to answer questions about exactly what was known about the data security scandal surrounding Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica is accused of using data from 50 million Facebook account holders which was obtained through a third-party application called 'This Is Your Digital Life'. It also alleged the data was then used in political profiling to aid Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. :: Zuckerberg 'to break silence' on Facebook data scandal Mr Parapkilas was responsible for policing data breaches at the company for two years. He told the committee he believed ""the practices in my time were far outside what should have been allowed"". At the time, he says, third-party application developers were only required to sign up to a set of rules about not passing on any user data. They were subject to data audits from the social network, but Mr Parakilas told MPs: ""I do not remember a single physical audit of a developer's storage."" Facebook changed its rules in 2014 to stop users' friends' data from being harvested by apps without their permission. When asked what Facebook should have been doing differently at the time to protect users' data, he said: ""Deeper audits and more aggressive regimes."" Mr Parakilas told the committee he believes the social network is now very different and has improved its systems. However, he expressed disappointment at how the company has dealt with the Cambridge Analytica case since it was discovered. Meanwhile, the social media trend #where'sZuck gathered pace before the Facebook CEO publicly addressed the scandal. Company founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted his company ""made mistakes"" over the alleged misuse of users' data. The social media giant's chief executive posted a long statement on his Facebook page explaining the steps he has taken, and will continue to take, to protect users."

It said on Wednesday that 98% of creditors and landlords had accepted the proposals. Under the plans 60 under-performing stores, including six further sub-let sites, are expected to close within the next year. The retailer said rent reductions and revised lease terms of up to 55% had been agreed at another 393 of its 593 stores. New Look, which has 15,300 UK staff, said it would attempt to redeploy many of those at risk of redundancy. It is the latest big high street name to seek help following the demise of Toys R Us and Maplin last month. This week has seen Carpetright and Mothercare's finances come back into focus while Moss Bros was another brand to report trading troubles amid consumer caution that has hurt spending and economic growth this year. Earlier this year, New Look revealed a nine month pre-tax loss of ¬£123.5m - with like-for-like sales in the UK down almost 11%. CVAs are aimed at helping not only New Look reduce costs but also protect creditors from getting less - or nothing - if the retailer's problems were to get worse. Toys R Us UK and BHS are among chains to have used them in the past - only to fall later. New Look's executive chairman, Alistair McGeorge, said: ""In order to help restore long-term profitability, it is clear we need to reduce our fixed cost base. ""We are therefore pleased to have gained the support of our creditors to address our over-rented store estate. ""Launching a CVA has been a tough decision and our priority remains keeping all potentially affected colleagues informed during this difficult time. ""The CVA is one of a number of necessary actions we are taking to get the company back on track. In addition to implementing other cost-saving initiatives, we are already focusing on driving future full price sales by realigning our pricing to offer significantly better value, adding flexibility to our buying model, and improving our speed to market. ""Additionally, we have further strengthened our alignment between e-commerce and stores. ""New Look is a great brand and today represents another important step in helping to rebuild our position within the UK market."" :: The stores slated for potential closure are: Aberdeen - Bon Accord; Beckton; Bolton Mens; Borehamwood; Brynmawr; Burton Mens; Cameron Toll; Cardiff - Queen Arcade; Cheshunt; Clevedon; Craigleith; Doncaster Mens; Dundee - Wellgate; Exeter Mens; Fleet; Gateshead - Team Valley; Glasgow - Buchanan Street Mens; Gorleston; Hanley Mens - Intu Potteries; Hounslow Mens; Hull - Whitefriargate; Keynsham; Kingswood; Leeds - The Core Shopping Centre; Leicester - Haymarket; London - Marble Arch; London - Moorgate/ London Wall; London - Oxford Circus; Maidenhead; Maidstone Mens; Merry Hill Mens; Metro Centre - Mens; Monmouth; Newport Mens; Newton Mearns; North Shields; Nottingham Mens; Ocean Terminal; Peterbrough Bridge Street; Pontypool; Portswood; Ramsgate; Reading - Broad Street; Reading Oracle Mens; Rhyl; Romford Mens; Rugby; Shrewsbury Mens; Sidmouth; Stockport - Merseyway; Stockton-on-Tees; Stratford Upon Avon -Bridge Street; Thornaby; Tonypandy; Torquay - Union Street; Tredegar; Troon; Wallsend; Weston Favell; Wigan Mens."
2018-03-21,Israel's military has confirmed it was behind an airstrike that destroyed what it believed to be a nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/israel-admits-to-2007-airstrike-on-syrian-nuclear-reactor-11298571,"Newly-declassified material showed the decision was made the strike should not be linked to Israel due to the possibility of war. Instead, it was ordered to be kept secret until further notice. The airstrike saw eight F-15 fighters bomb the reactor in the Deir el-Zour region, about 300 miles northwest of Damascus on 6 September. It had been in development for years and was due to begin operations at the end of that year. In a statement, Israel described the strike as having ""successfully removed an emerging existential threat to Israel and to the entire region - Syrian nuclear capabilities"". Syria had denied it was building a nuclear reactor but the UN nuclear watchdog said the site was ""very likely"" to be a nuclear reactor and the North Koreans could have been helping to build it. Also included in the material was footage of the strike, which caused ""irreversible"" damage, and pictures of secret army intelligence communiques regarding the target. Israel's role had been widely suspected but it was not confirmed until now. One reason could be the upcoming memoir of former prime minister Ehud Olmert, who ordered the strike. Or it could also be a warning to Iran, Israel's bitter enemy which is increasingly active in Syria, where it is an ally of Syrian President Bashar al Assad. Military chief Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot said in a statement: ""The message from the 2007 attack on the reactor is that Israel will not tolerate construction that can pose an existential threat."" According to Air force commander Major General Amikam Norkin, the strike has been vindicated by the conflict and chaos in Syria, as the reactor was in an area that was later under the control of Islamic State. ""Imagine what situation we would be in today if there was a nuclear reactor in Syria,"" he said.

It all started earlier this week when The Sun reported that Sheeran's plans to build a 14-metre-tall chapel in the garden of his Suffolk mansion could endanger the plot's previous tenants. All the singer wanted was a beautiful place to marry his fiancee Cherry Seaborn, but the move put the incumbent wildlife at risk, prompting villagers nearby to raise planning objections. One called his plans ""a total disregard to the local ecology"". It turned out Sheeran's piece of land was home to one of the largest populations of great crested newts in the area. ""It would appear that the applicant - in his desire to satisfy the needs of the spiritual world - continues to overlook his obligations to the living world, particularly that of protected species,"" wrote one objector. There has still been no word from Suffolk Coastal District Council on whether the plans to build the Saxon-styled chapel will be allowed to go ahead. We were so glad that Ed Sheeran could visit us today! He is officially a #WildlifeWarrior! üíöüêä pic.twitter.com/hG6z2Si9hr In the meantime, Sheeran paid a visit to Australia, where he decided to face one of the country's most dangerous predators - the saltwater crocodile. In a stunt described on social media as ""Steve Irwinesque"", Sheeran visited the Australia Zoo, where he fed a giant crocodile called Greg. Greg is seen in a photo jumping in Sheeran's direction, in a move the star dubbed ""Crocodile salt bae"" - referencing the famous internet meme of a Turkish chef delicately sprinkling salt over meat. Founded in the 1990s by Irwin, who was nicknamed 'The Crocodile Hunter', the zoo said it was ""so glad"" Sheeran had visited. ""He is officially a Wildlife Warrior,"" the zoo wrote. That he is."

Realising what had happened, the pupil immediately told station staff at King's Cross and was put on the next available service, travelling first class with railway staff, and was met by a teacher at York. Principal Gareth Rowe said: ""He was never in any danger as he had the presence of mind to immediately let station personnel know what had happened. ""He was put on the next train and looked after by the guards in first class until he could be reunited with his teacher in York. However, there is no excuse for what was a serious error on our behalf. ""Our first priority is always the safety of our pupils and obviously this incident highlights a failure in our processes which will now be reviewed and amended so this can never ever happen again.""

I'm Sarah and I'm 26. And I've got Down's syndrome. But that's just part of me, I'm not a Down's syndrome girl called Sarah. I find some things difficult - money and numbers and I can't drive - although my Dad says he is relieved that I'm not behind the wheel. And that's got nothing to do with Down's syndrome! Let me tell you something about me. When I was born it was a bit of a shock to my mum and dad because they weren't expecting me - a baby with Down's syndrome. They weren't told whether I would be able to walk or talk or be independent, so they were sad for a while. But they soon started to love me. When I was four, my grandpa and my dad wrote a radio series called Minor Adjustment, which I was in. Peter Davison and Samantha Bond played my parents. I am also lucky to have had two books written about me. The new one, A Major Adjustment, has just been published. I attended mainstream school and achieved the same as four GCSEs with lots of help from my teachers and special needs assistants. In 2014, I graduated from Foxes Academy and catering hotel in Minehead. When I first moved there, I felt nervous about leaving home. But soon I said to myself I love it here in Foxes. Everyone was great. All the learners and staff were caring and kind and taught me a lot. It was a whole new experience for me. When I was cooking at home, I told my family all about the dangers of ""cross contamination"" and safety in the kitchen. And my two brothers, Daniel and Joel, used to tease me when I came home and called out: ""Mind your backs, sharp knife coming through!"" But... I was right! I had a wonderful time at Foxes and loved every minute. They taught me so much about working life and I became more confident. I made lots of friends and had lots of fun, but what was most important was that I learned to be independent and how to work in a team. Then a very exciting thing happened. I was chosen to be on the television show Kitchen Impossible with Michel Roux Jr and they helped find me a job as a waitress and trainee barista in a central London hotel. I travel to work for an hour on the underground by myself. I love to work and help people. It's my dream job. I sometimes get tips from the guests! (I'm saving up to go to New York.) I moved out of home nearly three years ago and live in supported accommodation in north London. I love my house and my housemates and my support workers are amazing. There's lots to do - like going to the gym, to the pub and even going on holiday with them. I also have a boyfriend called Leon. My hobbies are dancing, listening to music, going to films and theatre and socialising with my friends. I talk to my mum and dad most days and my brothers take me out. They are cool. I sometimes wonder what I would be like if I didn't have Down's syndrome - but then I wouldn't be who I am. I wouldn't have the life that I have. I am very happy. People don't need to feel sorry for me and others because we have Down's syndrome. They should be nice to us and treat us equally. Let us enjoy our lives the same as everyone else. Don't limit us! I'm so lucky because I love my life! :: A Major Adjustment: How a Remarkable Child Became a Remarkable Adult is available to buy March 22"
2018-03-21,"A pilot whose aircraft crashed during the Shoreham Airshow and killed 11 people will be charged with manslaughter, according to the CPS.¬†",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/shoreham-airshow-disaster-pilot-andy-hill-to-be-charged-with-manslaughter-11299230,"Andy Hill, from Sandon, Hertfordshire, will also be formally charged with endangering the safety of an aircraft. Police and prosecutors met families of victims of the disaster on Wednesday evening to confirm that the pilot is now facing criminal charges. Eleven men died when the vintage Hawker Hunter aircraft came down onto the busy A27 in West Sussex when Mr Hill attempted a loop manoeuvre on 22 August 2015. Simon Ringrose, CPS specialist prosecutor, said: ""Following a careful review of the evidence I have found there is sufficient evidence to charge Mr Hill with the manslaughter by gross negligence of the eleven men who died. ""I have also authorised a further charge against Mr Hill of endangering an air craft, contrary to Article 127 of the Air Navigation Order 2009."" Mr Hill, who turns 54 on Thursday, is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on April 19. He will be charged with 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and one count of endangering an aircraft, which can incur a jail term of up to five years, the CPS said.An earlier investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found a series of pilot errors caused the crash. The final report by the AAIB found that Mr Hill failed to gain enough height to complete the ""bent loop"" manoeuvre he attempted moments before crashing. It would have been possible for him to abandon the manoeuvre, but it was concluded that Mr Hill either deemed it unnecessary or did not know how to pull out. Mr Hill survived the crash after being thrown clear from the plane. He was taken to hospital in a critical condition and placed in a medically induced coma. He was discharged from hospital the following month after recovering. Mr Hill received flying training with the RAF and served as an instructor and fast jet pilot before going into commercial aviation. He was authorised by the Civil Aviation Authority to fly the Hawker Hunter in displays and was issued with a medical certificate in January 2015, which was valid for 12 months. The AAIB report said: ""The pilot had not received formal training to escape from the accident manoeuvre in a Hunter and had not had his competence to do so assessed. ""He had not practised the technique for escaping from the accident manoeuvre in a Hunter, and did not know the minimum speed from which an escape manoeuvre could be carried out successfully"". The report also found the plane was not supposed to have been performing its display over the A27, but instead over the airfield. The error meant that event organisers had no control over where the plane came down. An interim report by the AAIB had found that the Shoreham organisers were unaware of Mr Hill's display plans before his jet crashed. A risk assessment had been carried out, identifying that crowds often gathered on the A27. However, the assessment was not fit for purpose and did not consider which particular aircraft would be displaying and the people most likely to be at risk. In the immediate aftermath of the crash, the Civil Aviation Authority grounded all Hawker Hunter aircraft and restricted other vintage jets flying over land to performing fly-pasts only. The distance between display lines and crowds was also increased."

It is believed Kiara's mother, Kim Rowlands, stopped the car before running inside the shop to grab some money after accidentally breaking her bank card. Dyfed-Powys Police warned people to ""think very carefully"" before posting comments about the death and not to speculate about what happened. The force said: ""We are aware of comments on threads across social media which are being looked at. Posts considered to be malicious will be recorded and police action may follow."" In a Facebook post which has since been removed, Kiara's father, Jet Moore, said: ""They got in the car to go home. Sat on bank card which snapped and needed money to get home etc. ""Went back to the office to get money from the desk and came back to no car. Looked in the river no signs.

Ms Rowlands initially thought her car had been stolen with her daughter in it and posted an appeal for help in finding the vehicle and Kiara on social media. She later posted a now-deleted emotional tribute to her daughter, blaming herself for the tragedy. She said: ""Sadly yesterday my beautiful baby girl passed away! Due to my own stupidity, I will have to live with the guilt for the rest of my life! Mummy loves you baby girl and I'm so sorry!""

The pilot of the Hawk T1, named as Flight Lieutenant David Stark, is being treated for non-life threatening injuries sustained in the crash. Witnesses reported seeing someone eject from the aircraft with a parachute before it smashed into the ground then ""burned bright orange"". Sergeant Will Allen, who leads the Red Arrows' group of travelling engineers, said Corporal Bayliss ""could lighten up any dull moment or lift spirits when needed"". He said: ""[Corporal Bayliss] was so proud to have been chosen to join the circus team for 2018 and, in being one of the small group of engineers whose job it was to fly in a Red Arrows jet, had fulfilled a schoolboy dream. ""Both inside and outside of work, he was a generous, kind and caring man who could also always be relied upon."" Squadron leader Richard Bland, senior engineering officer of the Red Arrows, said: ""He was known as a top bloke with an infectious smile, cheeky grin and possessing a dry sense of humour that had the ability to fill a room with laughter. ""At the same time, Jon was the ultimate professional and embodiment of excellence."" Paying tribute to Corporal Bayliss, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""It's clear from his colleagues that he was an incredibly skilled engineer and held in the highest regard as a teammate. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones at this terrible time."" Born in Dartford, Corporal Bayliss, 41, worked at the Brands Hatch racing circuit before joining the RAF in 2001. He became a member of the Red Arrows in 2016 and earlier this year was promoted to the circus team, the group of engineers who travel with the aircraft and provide technical support to the Red Arrows when the aircraft operate away from their home base. The Red Arrows are the RAF's aerobatic display team which perform at summer events, including the annual Trooping The Colour ceremony in London, which the Royal Family watches from the Buckingham Palace balcony."
2018-03-21,Health workers are being urged to accept a pay deal for NHS staff worth up to 6.5% over three years after unions reached agreement with the Government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/unions-to-recommend-65-nhs-pay-rise-11298838,"If accepted the deal will provide the first significant pay rise for around one million NHS staff in eight years. Doctors and dentists are not covered by the deal. Pay was frozen by the coalition Government for two years following the 2010 election and has risen at just 1% a year for the last five years. The GMB - a general union with almost 639,000 members - will recommend a rejection of the proposed deal, saying it means a real terms pay cut for the most loyal, longest-serving workers. The Government offer announced by unions is for an increase of 3% in 2018-19, followed by rises of 2% in 2019-20 and 1% in 2020-21. The deal means every NHS worker will receive at least ¬£8.93 an hour, 18p above the real living wage of ¬£8.75, and take the lowest full-time pay rate to ¬£17,460, an increase of ¬£2,056. By the end of the deal in 2020-21 the highest-paid staff will receive ¬£104,927. The pay rise will be stepped, targeting larger rises at the lowest-paid workers who could receive up to 29% increases. The cost to the Treasury is ¬£4.2bn. Crucially for unions and NHS staff the deal is fully-funded with money rather than cuts to existing budgets. It remains to be seen if the deal will impact on the new financial settlement for the NHS promised by the Chancellor in his spring statement earlier this month. Commenting on the proposed deal, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said over one million NHS workers would ""get pay rises that see starting salary increased from ¬£15,404 to ¬£18,005 in 2020/2021"". He went on: ""The starting salary of a nurse will rise to ¬£24,907 which will have a significant impact on retention and recruitment issues"". The starting salary of a nurse is currently ¬£22,128. Mr Hunt also said shared parental leave rights would be extended and said an increased focus on staff health and well being should help reduce NHS sick leave, which are a third higher than the public sector average. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: ""So the secretary of state has finally given the lowest NHS staff a pay rise‚Ä¶ this pay cap should have been scrapped years ago"". The increase means wages will match inflation, forecast to be 2.4% next year, for the first time in a decade. The most recent figure is 2.7%. The rise does not make up for the estimated 14% real-terms cut nurses, porters and other staff have endured in the last seven years. The Government has come under consistent criticism for failing to address NHS pay, with stalled salaries cited as a significant factor in the number of nurses leaving the service. A shortage of staff across all disciplines has been a significant factor in the NHS winter crisis, which saw performance against key targets fall to their lowest-ever levels."

The cashless technology was developed with Mastercard after Wagamama's chief investment officer wanted a way to ease stress among diners waiting to pay up at one of its airport outlets. Wagamama claims the app will save people an average 12 minutes every meal through not having to ask for a bill, waiting for it to turn up and then waiting to pay. The company told Sky News it did not believe it would have a detrimental effect on tips or staff numbers because only starters and some drinks can be ordered via the app, which it said was purely aimed at saving people time when they are ready to leave. The app has to be opened on entering a restaurant when the customer is supplied with a four digit code. That code is given to the waiter to pair with the till - later taking payment automatically with a receipt emailed to the bill-payer, or payers as the cost of meals can be split. Wagamama customer director Emma Woods said: ""We wanted to bring truly frictionless payment to restaurants as we know waiting for the bill is frustrating. ""No more waving your hand in the air, trying to catch the waiter's eye, once you're ready you just go, and customers are automatically charged with the receipt emailed directly. ""Customers are accustomed to one-click payments for online retailers and walk-out payments from Uber, but there hasn't been an app offering all of these functions for restaurants, which is what we have now created."" Jennifer Macrae, vice president of product innovation at Mastercard, said: ""We are bringing our digital ordering and payment technology - Qkr - into an app tailor-made for Wagamama's loyal customers. ""We can adapt this technology to any kind of restaurant and Wagamama is the first to use it in this way."""

But the Government Office for Science Foresight warns the UK will miss out if it continues to rely on established industries such as oil and gas, fishing and shipbuilding. It says emerging sectors like offshore renewable energy, marine biotechnology and seabed mining offer huge opportunities for economic growth. The report, Future of the Sea, underlines Britain's expertise in ocean science, with autonomous and robotic vehicles increasingly being used to map the seafloor and understand the marine environment. Professor Ed Hill, executive director of the National Oceanography Centre, told Sky News that we know less about the bottom of the sea than the moon or Mars. ""We are going to move into the deep sea, because of the importance of sustaining life on earth, so we need to learn more about it so we can do that sustainably, and so we can manage the ocean in a more effective way. "" More than 500,000 people in the UK have jobs connected to the sea, and it adds ¬£47bn a year in value to the national economy. But dwindling oil and gas reserves, fragile fish stocks and the impact of climate change mean Britain needs to re-think its 'blue economy.' Deep sea mining of metals on the seafloor, including cobolt for the massive growth in phone and car batteries, could be worth ¬£40bn to the UK over the next 30 years. Britain could also take a 10% share of the global market in autonomous and robotic ships which is set to be worth ¬£97bn over the next 15 years. And with more offshore windfarms than any other country, exports of skills and technology could be worth a further ¬£2.9bn a year by 2030. Professor Ian Boyd, co-author of the report and a scientific adviser to the government, said: ""Our use of the ocean is going to continue to increase. Transport, fish and geological resources, wind and wave energy, all going to increase in the future, and further out into sea, in deep oceans."" But the report warns that exploiting the world's oceans needs to be done sustainably. Almost of a third of the world's fish stocks are harvested to biologically unsustainable levels. And the warming seas, increasingly polluted with chemicals and plastic, will add to pressure on the marine environment. :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

On one occasion he remembers being asked: ""Have you been out robbing old grannies again with the rest of the darkies on your estate?"" The ex-pro told Sky News: ""I just thought, how dare you say that to me. My parents bought that with their hard-earned money."" He told no one, not even his wife, what went on from the age of 13 to 18 until three former youth players at the club spoke out in January about similar alleged abuse. Now solicitors for the man are taking legal action against Chelsea FC, claiming they failed in their duty to protect him from the abuse. He said: ""It's not about money for me. It's about what I went through at the club... the traumatic experience. ""There was a couple of times when I threw up because I felt physically sick about going back into the club and I used to think 'what abuse will I face today? What will today bring?' ""It's destroyed me as a person. It's destroyed my self-confidence."" The man, now in his early 50s, says he used a minor injury as an excuse not to go into the club, resulting in his contract being terminated and with it his dreams of a professional career as a footballer. Renu Daly, from Hudgell Solicitors, says the time has come for ""the true scale"" of historical racial abuse of boys in football to be fully investigated. Ms Daly said: ""What I want from the club is acknowledgement that the way this individual was treated, and perhaps other individuals at the time were treated, was in an appalling fashion, which to be honest was as unacceptable back in the 1970s and 1980s as it is now. ""It was not something limited to the terraces. It was happening within their changing rooms."" In response, a club spokesman said: ""We take allegations of this nature extremely seriously. ""We are absolutely determined to do the right thing, to assist the authorities and any investigations, and to fully support those affected which would include counselling for any former player that may need it."" Individuals implicated in similar allegations have previously denied racial abuse."

Carpetright announced the strategy as it confirmed that it had secured ¬£12.5m in funding from a major investor - confirming a report hours earlier on Sky News. It was the latest bleak update from the high street on a day which also saw a profit warning from menswear business Moss Bros and Kingfisher, the owner of B&Q, reporting deteriorating sales at the DIY chain. Meanwhile, Mothercare said that it was making progress in talks with lenders as it seeks new funding and that it had agreed to push back a deadline later this week for ensuring its finances were in order. Carpetright, which trades from 409 shops across the country, warned earlier this month that it was likely to report a loss for the year to 28 April and was looking at a range of options to beef up its balance sheet. On Wednesday, the retailer said it was looking into a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with the aim of ""rationalising the company's property portfolio in order to improve the long-term prospects of the business"". Chief executive Wilf Walsh blamed previous bosses of the company for pursuing an ""aggressive store opening strategy"". He said this had left Carpetright ""burdened with an oversized property estate consisting of too many poorly located stores on rents which are simply unsustainable"". Efforts to close underperforming stores had been hampered by the fact that many had long leases. ""The board is therefore exploring the feasibility of a CVA in order to expedite the rationalisation of its property portfolio, with the clear objective of establishing a right-sized estate of contemporary stores, on economic rents, complemented with a compelling online offer,"" Mr Walsh said. Carpetright's plan would see it seek the approval of creditors for closures or rent reductions at underperforming stores, arguing that this would be in the long-term interest of the business. If given the go-ahead, the closures would take place over the coming months. The plan would also see Carpetright seek to raise ¬£40m-¬£60m from investors to fund plans to reboot the business and bring down debt."

""The simple logic here tells us there are two possible options: the British authorities are either unable to insure protection against such terrorist acts on their territory or they themselves directly or indirectly, I am not accusing anyone of anything, have directed this attack against a Russian citizen. ""There is simply no other third option here. In these circumstances requiring any explanations from the Russian side is simply absurd."" He added: ""It is becoming more and more obvious that this attack against the Skripals in Salisbury is most probably a blatantly framed illegal adventure. ""Only one thing is clear, Russia has nothing to do with this. We do not benefit from it in any way."" Mr Yermakov went on to say: ""Pull yourselves away a little bit from your Russophobia, your island mentality."" Britain has blamed Moscow for the nerve agent attack on the Skripals earlier this month, saying novichok - a Russian-made nerve agent - was used. Moscow has denied responsibility. The crisis has seen relations between the two nations plunge to their worst level since the Cold War. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has begun examining the nerve agent used, and OPCW inspectors were seen working in Salisbury on Wednesday. Appearing before MPs, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson rejected claims of ""Russophobia"", saying: ""We continue to hold out a hand of friendship to the Russian people - because our quarrel is not with them, it is with Vladimir Putin."" He also suggested the poisoning was used the help the Russian President's re-election bid, saying: ""As many non-democratic figures do when facing some critical political moment, it is often attractive to conjure up in the public imagination the notion of an enemy. ""And that is what I think it was an attempt to excite amongst the Russian electorate."" Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the British snub of the meeting was ""another vivid example of the absurd situation when questions are asked and an unwillingness to hear even any answers is demonstrated"". A British embassy spokesman said earlier that ambassador Laurie Bristow would not attend, with an embassy representative being sent instead. The French and American ambassadors also did not go, according to Russian news agencies. After the briefing, the British embassy in Russia wrote on Twitter that Moscow ""continues to spread lies and disinformation"". A British Embassy representative attended @MID_RF briefing on Skripal. We received no credible explanation why a nerve agent produced in Russia was used on UK soil. Instead of providing answers, Russia continues to spread lies & disinformation https://t.co/c34yTaKY2G Speaking before the briefing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it would be a chance for ""Russia's view to be expressed to official representatives of foreign states"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia wanted Britain to tell it where Mr Skripal and his daughter were currently located. He said Moscow also wanted to know why Britain had accused Russia of being responsible when the police investigation had not yet been completed. ""Overall there is no doubt that the current British leadership has consciously taken a course to undermine Russian-British relations,"" Mr Lavrov said at a news conference during a visit to Japan. ""If this will continue in the form of any tangible new anti-Russian actions then of course nobody has cancelled the principle of reciprocity. ""It would be good for everyone and for (the British Government) if they stopped getting agitated and calmed down."" It comes after 23 Russian diplomats left Britain on Tuesday after being expelled. Moscow has responded in kind, with 23 British diplomats in Russia due to leave in the coming days."

NAO chief Sir Amyas Morse said many of the claimants have severely limiting disabilities and illnesses. He blamed the Department for Work and Pensions for ""failing to get a grip on the problem"". He added: ""The department has now committed to fixing this error by April 2019, but not everyone will be repaid all the money they have missed out on."" A review of 1,000 sample cases found that around 45,000 people may be entitled to around ¬£2,500 each, but 20,000 could be owed around ¬£11,500 each and ""a small number of people"" could have been underpaid by ¬£20,000. As well as the arrears, which date back to 21 October, 2014, the Government will face higher ongoing payments due to the corrected claims. The DWP said it would need to pay between ¬£570m and ¬£830m more ESA than previously expected by the end of 2022/23. According to the NAO investigation, the DWP's process for moving people from benefits that were being phased out to the ESA ""did not reflect its own legislation"". The problem was not recognised until 2014 and even then steps were not taken to correct the mistakes. It was not until July 2017 that the DWP admitted it had a responsibility to find the people affected. Since then, it has reviewed more than 4,000 cases and paid just over ¬£9m to 1,500 people who were underpaid. A DWP spokesman said: ""We're committed to ensuring people get what they are entitled to receive as quickly as possible. ""Everyone who could be affected will be contacted directly by the department."""

Officers were waiting for tactical teams to arrive to arrest the suspect when his vehicle began to drive away, Mr Manley said. Authorities followed the car, which ran into a ditch at the side of the road, and the suspect detonated an explosive device when a SWAT team approached. One of the SWAT team members shot at the vehicle and a second officer was injured in the explosion. Police said the suspect - who has not been formally identified - suffered ""significant injuries"" in the bomb blast. He lived in Pflugerville, 25 miles outside Austin where four of the bombings took place, the city's mayor Victor Gonzales said. Mr Manley said the motive behind the series of bombings, which killed two people and injured a number of others, was still unknown. :: 'Smart and happy': Who was Texas serial bomber Mark Anthony Conditt? He also urged Texas residents to be ""vigilant"" for other possible explosives, adding: ""We do not know where he has been in the past 24 hours."" FBI agent Chris Combs, head of the agency's San Antonio office, said, ""We are concerned that there may be other packages that are still out there."" Following the suspect's death, police attended a suspicious package at a FedEx in south east Austin as part of the investigation. US president Donald Trump, who had earlier branded the Texas bomber a ""sick individual"", praised law enforcement officials. AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned! Michael Luna, who was outside a nearby hotel in Round Rock, said he heard the explosion after seeing a large group of officers arrive at around 2am. He told KXAN-TV: ""I'm ex-military so it kind of sounded like two grenades went off at one time. After the bomb went off, I heard another pop after it."" The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had earlier confirmed it was at the scene ""of the individual suspected in the package bomb murders"" on the I-35 highway.

Authorities found store receipts showing suspicious transactions and obtained a search warrant for his Google search history which also showed suspicious behaviour, an official told the newspaper. Police then used mobile phone technology to trace the suspect to the hotel, according to reports. Earlier, CCTV images of a ""person of interest"" were shared on US media showing a white man with blond hair carrying packages at a FedEx store in Austin. Two African-American men - Anthony Stephan House, 39, and Draylen Mason, 17, - have been killed and several other people hurt in a series of bombings over the past two weeks. Mr House died after a device exploded at his home in Austin in the first attack on 2 March. Mr Mason was killed and his mother critically injured in a blast on 13 March after a package was left on his doorstep. Hours later, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman was also critically injured after another package exploded in Austin. On Sunday, two men, aged 22 and 23, were seriously hurt in an explosion involving a tripwire device. In the early hours of Tuesday, a FedEx worker was hurt after a package bound for Austin containing nails and shrapnel blew up at a distribution centre in the San Antonio town of Schertz. Later that day, another explosive package was intercepted before going off at a FedEx facility outside Austin airport. A sixth explosion in Texas on Tuesday night was not linked to the previous incidents."
2018-03-21,Theresa May will tell EU leaders they will succeed in the face of Russia's threat if they remain united.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322010118/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-to-tell-eu-leaders-united-we-succeed-against-russia-11299360,"At a European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday, the Prime Minister will speak of the ""indiscriminate and reckless"" nerve agent attack in Salisbury as part of a pattern of recent behaviour from Moscow. Addressing EU leaders, Mrs May is expected to say: ""The challenge of Russia is one that will endure for years to come. ""As a European democracy, the UK will stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU and with NATO to face these threats together. ""United, we will succeed."" The Prime Minister is also expected to thank those allies who have shown solidarity and backed the UK's assessment that Russia is to blame for the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, using chemical weapon novichok. The US, France and Germany have all joined Mrs May in finding the Russian state responsible for the attack. However, as a bloc, the EU have stopped short of directly blaming Moscow. The decision of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his recent re-election as Russian President, while neglecting to mention the Salisbury attack or reports of vote-rigging, has also caused splits within Brussels. In contrast, European Council President Donald Tusk pointedly remarked on Wednesday: ""After the Salisbury attack, I'm not in the mood to celebrate President Putin's reappointment."" The UK's National Security Advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, briefed officials from EU member states on Wednesday about Britain's response to the use of a chemical weapon in Wiltshire. He said in a statement: ""I set out the reasons for our clear assessment of Russian responsibility, the measured but clear response we were taking, the wider pattern of malign behaviour into which Salisbury fits, and the importance of a renewed and wider international focus, including from the EU, on the challenge Russia represents to our shared interests and values. ""It was clear from my discussions not only the strong solidarity with my country but also the shared sense of gravity and determination to look carefully, calmly but purposefully at the implications, given the high stakes involved for our shared European security and the rules based international order."" As well as the Salisbury attack, EU leaders will discuss a growing trade row with the US, Turkey's military offensive in Syria, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when they gather in Brussels on Thursday. Mr Tusk has also recommended to EU leaders that they welcome, in principle, the agreement on a Brexit transition deal, details of which were published earlier this week. Speaking on Wednesday, the European Council President said: ""In practice, the transition phase will allow to delay all the negative consequences of Brexit by another 21 months. ""It is important - not least to our people and businesses - to buy this time, so that everyone is prepared for the real impact of Brexit."" On Friday, the leaders of the remaining 27 EU member states will remain in Brussels to discuss the next stage of Brexit negotiations and adopt a set of guidelines for the future EU-UK relationship."

Mr Sharif's political party described the ruling as ""disappointing"", while Maryam Nawaz said she had not seen her mother Kulsoom for four months. In 2017, Mr Sharif was disqualified from office for life over undisclosed assets said to be held by his family. In February, Pakistan's Supreme Court made a further ruling against the 68-year-old, declaring that anyone disqualified from holding office cannot serve as head of a political party. Documents revealed during the Panama Papers leak indicated that Mr Sharif's sons failed to declare several offshore companies, some of which helped them to buy properties in London's Mayfair. The case against Mr Sharif was filed by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan and two other opposition leaders. It accused the leader of making mis-statements in a speech to the National Assembly, and in an address to the nation last year. The Sharif family are accused of being unable to account for their wealth. Maryam Nawaz was said to be the main beneficiary of the alleged corruption, but attempted to prove her innocence in 2016. However, documents she produced, allegedly written and signed in 2006, used the font Calibri, not commercially available until 2007. The Sharifs have denied any wrongdoing."

DS Bailey, 38, fell seriously ill at the scene and was taken to Salisbury District Hospital. In a statement read out by Wiltshire chief constable Kier Pritchard, DS Bailey thanked medical staff for their ""phenomenal"" care and said the attention surrounding the case was ""really overwhelming"". He said: ""People ask me how I am feeling - but there are really no words to explain how I feel right now. ""Surreal is the word that keeps cropping up - and it really has been completely surreal. ""I have been so very overwhelmed by the support, cards and messages I have received - everyone has been so incredible."" Asking for privacy, the police officer said he was ""just a normal person with a normal life, and I don't want my wife, children, family or I to be part of that attention"". His wife, Sarah, also released a statement that said their world had been ""turned upside down"" and the attack was ""the most traumatic event of our life"". ""Nick doesn't like the term 'hero', but he has always been a hero to me and our children,"" she said. :: LIVE: PM raises spy poisoning with EU leaders Following the police officer's discharge from hospital, chief constable Pritchard said thoughts were now with the Skripals and their family. Earlier, a court heard the mental capacity of the former double agent and his daughter may be compromised to an unknown degree. The Court of Protection in London said it was ""not possible to say when or to what extent"" they may ""regain capacity"". ""The precise effect of their exposure on their long term health remains unclear albeit medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree,"" said a judgment by Mr Justice Williams. The pair remain stable in hospital and under heavy sedation after the Salisbury attack, an unnamed consultant told the court. They said Mr Skripal ""is unable to communicate in any way"" and Ms Skripal ""is unable to communicate in any meaningful way"". While their health is ""not expected to change in the immediate or near future"", the judgment added that ""it is not inconceivable that their condition could rapidly deteriorate"". The court also confirmed that blood samples from the Skripals had been analysed by experts at Porton Down, with findings indicating exposure to novichok or a closely related nerve agent. The judgment, which will allow experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to obtain samples of the Skripals' blood, said the Russians were being treated on the basis ""they would want to be kept alive"". The Court of Protection makes rulings for people who lack the required mental capacity to decide for themselves. Britain has blamed the Russian state for the attack - claims the country and its leader strongly deny. The diplomatic row between the two countries continues to grow, with Russia's ambassador hitting back after Boris Johnson suggested Vladimir Putin will ""glory"" in this summer's World Cup in a similar way to Adolf Hitler the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Alexander Yakovenko held a news conference during which he called the Foreign Secretary's comments ""unacceptable and totally irresponsible"". ""Nobody has the right to insult the Russian people, who defeated Nazism and lost more than 25 million people, by comparing our country to Nazi Germany,"" he said. On Tuesday, 23 Russian diplomats, accused of working as spies, were expelled from Britain over the poisoning row.  Russia has said it will kick out the same number of staff from the British embassy."

In a speech to journalists and MPs at Westminster, Mr Hancock declared the events of the past week marked a ""turning point"" in public attitudes. He also revealed he had spoken to the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, about the scandal and was ready to back her data protection demands. The emergency measures will be added to the Government's Data Protection Bill, currently in its committee stage in the House of Commons after passing through the House of Lords, and are likely to receive all-party support. The two key measures to be added to the bill will be: :: The right to gain access to social media companies without giving notice, bringing the Commissioner's powers into line with other enforcement agencies :: The right to obtain testimony from individuals as well as organisations, so the Commissioner can interrogate companies' former employees Ms Denham has complained to the Government that she is still waiting for a court warrant to be granted in order to raid and search the London offices of Cambridge Analytica, as part of her investigation into the firm's use of data. The company is accused of election meddling and obtaining the personal data of 50 million Americans from social media giant Facebook without their consent. Coinciding with Mr Hancock's announcement, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee of MPs announced it has recalled Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, to a further hearing as part of its ""Fake News"" inquiry. Mr Nix previously gave evidence to the committee's inquiry three weeks ago, but following damning newspaper and TV reports about Cambridge Analytica, he has been called back for further questioning. Answering questions from journalists, Mr Hancock said: ""After this week's revelations, I think it is time that social media platforms come clean with what data they really hold on people."" He added: ""I have actually been worrying for quite some time about this sort of problem. ""We didn't know the details of the revelations that came out at the weekend but the Information Commissioner already had an investigation to get to the bottom of these sorts of problems. ""It is clear to me that the rules need to be strengthened to make sure that she has the enforcement powers that we need."" Mr Hancock, who has faced privacy concerns as well as ridicule over his own social media app for constituents, said the Data Protection Bill would strengthen the rules. ""I think this week has marked a turning point in people's attitude towards the big platforms,"" he said. ""You can't just let the companies decide what is the balance between privacy and use of data and innovation. That is a decision for society, reflected in the laws that we pass here."" Asked about Facebook customers deleting their accounts in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Mr Hancock said: ""Of course I understand why people are deleting Facebook accounts. ""Without trust people will understandably continue to remove their Facebook accounts and without transparency over how data is used there can be no trust."" The DCMS committee has given Mr Nix until next Tuesday to respond to its demand for him to return to give evidence a second time. What happened when? We‚Äôve put together a timeline to help. https://t.co/IgHIK6FxiS In a letter to Mr Nix, committee chairman Damian Collins said there were ""a number of inconsistencies"" in the evidence he gave on 27 February. These were: :: His denial that Cambridge Analytica received data from the Global Science Research company :: His claim that Cambridge Analytica did not work with Facebook data and did not have Facebook data Mr Collins wrote: ""You agreed at the 27 February session to send a series of further follow-up answers; we have not received these. ""We call on you to answer them now. Giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter."" Breaking his silence on the scandal, Facebook's boss Mark Zuckerberg has said it was a mistake to rely on Cambridge Analytica to delete the data of tens of millions of users, apologised for a ""major breach of trust"", and said he is open to appearing before MPs. In response to the ongoing allegations against it, Cambridge Analytica tweeted out what it described as a ""timeline"" of ""what happened when""."

She had previously been looked after by her grandparents as a baby after Butler was accused of shaking her. In a statement read to the court, Ellie's grandfather Neal Gray said the day she was sent back to her parents was ""simply heart-breaking"" and accused social workers at Services for Children (S4C) of failing in their duty of care. ""S4C lost sight and started to pander to the parents' unreasonable wants and demands,"" Mr Gray said. He told the inquest that Ellie repeatedly said she wanted to continue living with him and the youngster's grandmother Linda but their concerns were ignored. ""We felt utterly helpless and unsupported,"" he added. ""Linda was fearful of the risk posed by the parents, chillingly her fears turned out to be justified but no one would listen to us.""

Social worker Steven Atherton told the hearing: ""We were part of a system that failed this little girl."" He added that Ellie was ""emotionally struggling"" with the move away from her grandparents. The inquest continues."

Transport for Greater Manchester's Metrolink boss, Danny Vaughan, called it a ""sickening and sustained attack"" and said there had been a ""spike"" in crime and antisocial behaviour in the Oldham area recently. People travelling on the tram that stopped on the opposite tracks at the Freehold Metrolink platform and have video of the incident are urged to contact detectives. Anyone else who has information can contact police on 0161 856 8267, quoting reference number 2239 of 08/03/18, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2018-03-22,The new owner of dozens of well-known British magazines including Marie Claire and TV Times is plotting a potential merger with the company that publishes titles such as Viz and The Week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322200155/https://news.sky.com/story/tv-times-owner-plots-300m-merger-with-viz-publisher-dennis-11300153,"Sky News has learnt that Epiris, the private equity firm which recently bought Time Inc UK, is at the early stages of examining a takeover of Dennis Publishing, the magazine empire founded by the late media tycoon Felix Dennis. Dennis has been put up for sale by the executors of its eponymous founder's estate, with the proceeds expected to be distributed to The Heart of England Forest Charity, which was also set up by tree-loving Mr Dennis. The charity's trustees are chaired by Jon Snow, the Channel 4 News presenter. Information about Dennis' business has been sent to prospective bidders including buyout firms and rival media companies. Epiris is said to be a ""very likely"" bidder for at least parts of Dennis Publishing, with The Week said to account for roughly half of its annual profits, according to insiders. However, they cautioned that a formal offer was not yet guaranteed. If it succeeded with a bid, Epiris would seek to combine the Dennis assets with those of Time Inc UK, they added. The executors' advisers at Livingstone, a corporate finance firm, are said to be seeking offers for the entirety of Dennis Publishing, although they are also expected to consider bids for individual titles. Both Dennis and Time Inc UK have provided evidence of the toll being exerted on print-media groups in recent years amid growing pressure on advertising revenues as readers increasingly shift online. In 2009, Dennis ceased publication of Maxim UK's print edition following a catastrophic decline in sales in the lads' mag‚Äé category. However, the company's most successful title, The Week, has seen its circulation rise steadily even as the newspaper titles it summarises have seen demand shrink at a rapid rate. Time Inc UK, meanwhile, announced this month that the print edition of NME, the weekly music title, would cease after 66 years. The publisher's sale to Epiris was held up for several months by a separate deal involving the takeover of its American company by rival media group Meredith. Previously known as IPC Media, the Time Inc UK business owns about 50 titles, including Country Life, Cycling Weekly and Wallpaper. While many of them continue to be market leaders in their respective fields, the titles have seen sharp declines in circulation - and as a consequence, advertising revenue - during the last decade. The media research firm Enders Analysis said Time Inc UK aggregate circulation was 168.7m in 2016 - the highest in the British magazine industry. However, figures produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggest that print advertising revenue for consumer magazines will fall to $6.7bn in the US by 2021, less than half the $13.6bn that magazines took in 2012. Print circulation sales are projected to drop 23% to $6.1bn over the same period, and industry trends are broadly similar in the UK. Epiris declined to comment on Thursday."
2018-03-22,"Moscow's ambassador to Britain has condemned Boris Johnson for likening Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler, accusing the Foreign Secretary of ""insulting the Russian people"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322200155/https://news.sky.com/story/russian-ambassador-brands-boris-johnsons-putin-hitler-comparison-insulting-11299806,"Speaking during a news conference in London, Alexander Yakovenko said Mr Johnson's comments were ""unacceptable and totally irresponsible"". He added: ""The British Government is free to take a decision about its participation in the World Cup. ""But nobody has the right to insult the Russian people, who defeated Nazism and lost more than 25 million people, by comparing our country to Nazi Germany. ""That goes beyond common sense and we do not think British war veterans, including those of the Arctic convoys, would share this opinion."" The Foreign Secretary suggested the Russian President will ""glory"" in this summer's World Cup in a similar way to the German dictator during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Mr Johnson told a committee of MPs it was ""an emetic prospect"" to think of Mr Putin ""glorying in this sporting event"", as he agreed it would be comparable to the Olympics held in Nazi Germany. ""I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right,"" Mr Johnson said. He was responding to a question from Labour MP Ian Austin, who suggested Russia's President was planning to use the event ""in the way Hitler used the 1936 Olympics"" as a propaganda exercise to ""gloss over"" Russia's ""gross human rights abuses"". Downing Street said Prime Minister Theresa May had ""full confidence"" in her Foreign Secretary, despite the uproar his remarks had provoked. Mr Johnson has not commented since his appearance before MPs, but has posted on his official Twitter account about a HS2 meeting in his Uxbridge constituency. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock suggested the best response to Russia hosting the World Cup would be for England to win it. When asked if the PM agreed, her official spokesman said: ""I think the Prime Minister would, of course, want our team to win the World Cup."" Mr Johnson's comments drew an immediate response from Russia after he made them on Wednesday, with its foreign ministry accusing the British Foreign Secretary of being ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"". Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov kept up the attack earlier on Thursday, saying it was ""a completely disgusting statement"". The 1936 Olympics provided a propaganda opportunity for Hitler and his Nazi regime in Germany, with the run-up to the Games marked by debate over whether it should be boycotted by other nations - most prominently in the US. Hitler officiated at both the opening and closing ceremonies, but saw his dream of a triumph for ""Aryan"" athletes famously undermined by black American athlete Jesse Owens winning four gold medals. Mr Johnson's remarks represent an escalation of the war of words between Britain and Russia over the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury earlier this month. London has blamed the nerve agent attack on Moscow, something Russia has denied. In an extraordinary rant on Wednesday, the country's foreign ministry accused Britain of ""Russophobia"" and having an ""island mentality"". Responding to that briefing, Britain's Russian ambassador Laurie Bristow said it was a ""two-hour marathon of personal insults, lies and disinformation"". In his news conference, Mr Yakovenko said Russia had yet to receive any information on the poisoning from Britain and added that Moscow had been blamed without evidence. Mr Yakovenko said Russia ""can't take British words for granted,"" and accused the UK of having a ""bad record of violating international law and misleading the international community."" He went on to say that ""history shows that British statements must be verified. We demand full transparency of the investigation and full cooperation with Russia"" and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons."" Meanwhile, Mrs May is set to tell EU leaders they will succeed in the face of Russia's threat if they remain united. At a European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday, the PM will speak of the ""indiscriminate and reckless"" attack in Salisbury as part of a pattern of recent behaviour from Moscow. The deterioration in ties has seen 23 Russian diplomats expelled from Britain, with the same number also set to be kicked out of Russia. Moscow has also told the British Council in the country to shut down. The state-funded body, which promotes British culture overseas, said on Thursday it had ceased all activity in Russia. As well as plunging ties between Britain and Russia to their lowest level since the Cold War, the poisoning has raised a number of questions about this summer's World Cup. Mr Johnson told the MPs that he was ""deeply concerned"" at the treatment travelling England fans would likely receive in Russia. He suggested the Foreign Office - which has until this point stopped short of advising fans not to travel - could reconsider its position given recent events. But Mr Yakovenko said English fans would be safe and would enjoy visa-free travel as guests of the country."

In them, the current occupant of the Oval Office said that ""when you're a star"", women will let you ""grab them by the p****. You can do anything"". After the remarks became public in October 2016, he said he was sorry ""if anyone was offended"" by the ""locker room banter"". Mr Biden also referred to those remarks in the month they emerged, again saying that if he and Mr Trump were in high school, he would take him ""behind the gym"".

The package is worth $2.6bn (¬£1.8bn) at current stock values but for each of 12 milestones Tesla achieves, Mr Musk will get stock worth one percent of the company. The 46-year-old currently owns more than 20% of it. Among the goals are raising the company's market capitalisation tenfold to $650bn (¬£460bn) as well as increasing income and revenue. Reaching these milestones would make Tesla the fourth most valuable US company - and Mr Musk would be one of the richest people in the world. But his mission won't be easy - despite 15 years of business, Tesla has yet to report a full-year net profit. Tesla board member Antonio Gracias said: ""We believe as a board and executive team that we can actually achieve these milestones. ""It's very important to think about the specifics of Tesla and what we have already achieved."" In a statement, the company said: ""This ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla's management over the long-term, while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future."" The company said, however, that he would ""receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind -- no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time"". He would only be compensated if shareholders ""do extraordinarily well"". Mr Musk is already reportedly worth around $21bn, making him one of the 100 wealthiest people on the planet. Shares in Tesla Motors were up 1.9% after the pay package was approved."

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) described it as an ""extremely challenging incident"" that would be ""protracted"". Flames were seen in the roof of the building that houses Victoria's nightclub, and which also contains several shops. Streets were cordoned off as thick smoke billowed into the air. The occupants of nearby properties were evacuated, the SFRS said. Emergency services were called at 8.18am. An onlooker who did not want to be named said it was a ""massive blaze and it appears to be spreading. The amount of smoke is quite incredible"". General manager of the Pavilion Theatre, Iain Gordon, where firefighters were spotted gaining entry, said he was ""very concerned"". The theatre - one of the city's oldest - has been there ""for a long time and is a major part of Glasgow"". He added: ""When you see how quickly the fire spread to other parts of the buildings in Sauchiehall Street we just hope the flames don't jump across the lane. ""It's a lane's distance but that's not very far when it's heat and flames going across."" No injuries were reported, but Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said it appeared to be ""extremely serious"". ""This is a deeply concerning incident in the city of Glasgow,"" she said at First Minister's Questions. Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay said: ""This is an extremely challenging incident but the response and professionalism of our firefighters has been outstanding. ""We would urge the occupants of surrounding buildings to remain indoors and keep their windows closed due to the suspected presence of asbestos. ""This will be a protracted incident and crews will remain on the scene as they work to prevent further fire spread and damage in this prominent city-centre location."""
2018-03-22,World stock markets have tumbled as investors fret over the prospect of a damaging trade war between the globe's two largest economies.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322200155/https://news.sky.com/story/world-markets-sink-on-fears-of-trump-trade-war-11300262,"Tech shares - already under pressure over the Facebook data scandal - was the sector feeling the most pain as Donald Trump proposed action against China over what he sees as intellectual property theft. The US President first launched his protectionist agenda earlier this month - to save US jobs. While the EU, including the UK, will escape imminent trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports because of continuing negotiations, China is expected to face their full force when the measures come into force on Friday. At a news conference, Mr Trump confirmed additional sanctions against Beijing were being prepared for the alleged theft of US technology across a wide range of goods and services - from software to fake Ralph Lauren polo shirts. He pointed to a $504bn trade deficit with the country and said tariffs on up to ¬£60bn of Chinese goods could be in place following a 60-day consultation period. Officials are also drawing up potential restrictions on Chinese investments in the US. ""We want reciprocal (trade)"", Mr Trump said. The government in Beijing has vowed to take ""all necessary measures"" to defend its interests and has already threatened retaliatory tariffs on US cars and agriculture. Fears of a tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China saw US and European stocks markets fall sharply, by around 2% generally, and bonds rally as investors took some shelter. US-traded shares in Chinese digital marketplace Alibaba were down almost 5% after the announcement. The FTSE 100 had earlier closed below the 7,000 point barrier for the first time since December 2016 - leaving it perilously close to losing 10% of its market value in the year to date. It shed 1.2% - equating to around ¬£22bn - to end the session at 6952. Micro Focus, the UK's largest technology firm, was the biggest loser down 6.3%. The markets have taken fright because of the potential for a trade war damaging the global economic recovery. Higher costs pose a big risk to jobs, wages and investment. While US officials have confirmed that no EU nations will be hit by the 25% steel and 10% aluminium tariffs being introduced from Friday morning, the UK steel union Community and industry body UK Steel said it only provided some comfort. Community's general secretary, Roy Rickhuss, said: ""This exemption is of course welcome but it is only part of the solution. ""If the Trump tariffs go ahead, then that will still mean millions of tonnes of steel looking for a new market, putting at risk thousands of steelworkers' jobs. ""That's why the UK government needs to ensure that the EU takes the necessary steps to introduce safeguards for all steel products which are affected by the US tariffs."""

But the company said that in more recent weeks ""unseasonal weather"" both in Europe and the US east coast had ""an impact on the early part of trading for spring/summer"". The group added: ""We anticipate that external trading conditions will remain challenging across many of our global markets."" Ted Baker also said that after stripping out currency movements, sales in its UK and Europe stores had fallen over the year. Shares fell 8% in morning trading. The weather impact warning comes after online grocery retailer Ocado said recent conditions in the UK had knocked millions off its sales and profits. Some economists think the cold snap that saw much of the country grind to a halt will take a chunk out of economic growth figures for the first quarter. The latest results follow a black day for the high street on Wednesday which saw Carpetright set out plans which could mean 100 store closures, a profit warning from Moss Bros, and a squeeze on ""big ticket"" sales such as kitchens at B&Q. Ted Baker, which operates in markets from the UK and Europe to America and the Middle East, presented a sunnier picture overall. In the UK and Europe, representing about half of revenue, sales grew more slowly than in other regions, though were still up by 6.4% - when stripping out currency movements - despite what were described as ""challenging trading conditions"". Sales in Ted Baker's stores in this part of the world actually fell on a constant currency basis, by 1.4%, though the company said this reflected a shift to online - where sales rose 34.7% - while wholesale revenues climbed by 9.3%. Ted Baker now has 532 stores and concessions worldwide, including 195 in the UK, 113 in Europe, 127 in North America, 88 in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, and nine in Australasia. Founder and chief executive Ray Kelvin said: ""I am pleased to report a year of continued progress on Ted Baker‚Äôs expansion as a global lifestyle brand. ""Our new collections have been received positively and although we anticipate external trading conditions will remain challenging across many of our global markets, the strength of our brand and business model means we remain well positioned to continue to the group‚Äôs momentum."""

Long-haul flights are not affected, however. Within the country, just one in four regular mainline trains will be running, while some suburban commuter lines in Paris will be affected too. Metro and bus services are expected to run normally. The dispute is over public sector reforms wanted by President Emmanuel Macron, who argues the sector has too much debt. His government is targeting the SNCF rail operator in particular, which is carrying ‚Ç¨46.6bn (¬£40.7bn) of debt. ""We're never happy when things change, yet we want things to change - that's the paradox of France,"" he tweeted last week. The unions have accused Mr Macron of wanting to dismantle the public sector, while workers are angry that pay has not kept up with inflation. Seven trade unions called on public sector workers including school and hospital staff, civil servants and air traffic controllers to walk out, with more than 140 protests expected across the country. Unless the reform plans are dropped, rail workers say they will strike on two days out of every five between 3 April and 28 June. On Friday, Air France staff including pilots and cabin crew will be striking, demanding a 6% rise in salary."

For almost three weeks, residents of Austin lived on edge as hundreds of police and federal agents conducted a massive manhunt for the person behind the bombings. But on Wednesday, the hunt came to an end and Conditt died after detonating a device in his car. A 25-minute recording was found on a phone, described by Austin police chief Brain Manley as a ""confession"". It was thought to have been recorded late on Tuesday night, as police closed in on their suspect. Mr Manley said that Conditt ""does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate"". ""Instead, it is the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point,"" he added. Mr Manley said that Conditt described seven devices on the recording and that police had ""accounted for the devices that we have known about"". The motives for the bombings and how Conditt chose his victims remain unclear, however. Earlier in the day, police searched a home in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, where Conditt lived with two roommates. Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge, said: ""I wouldn't call it a bomb-making factory, but there are definitely components consistent with what we've seen in all these other devices."" Conditt was part of a religious family and was home-schooled, except for a brief spell at a community college, according to the Houston Chronicle. In a 2012 blog he described himself as ""conservative"", arguing against gay marriage, saying homosexuality was ""not natural"", slamming the sex offenders' registry and backing the death penalty. In a statement released to CNN, Conditt's family described themselves as ""normal in every way"", saying they were not aware of the ""darkness"" their son ""must have been in"". :: 'Smart and happy' - Who was Texas serial bomber Mark Anthony Conditt? Among Conditt's victims were two African-American men - Anthony Stephan House, 39, and Draylen Mason, 17. Mr House died after a device exploded at his home in Austin in the first attack on 2 March. Mr Mason was killed and his mother critically injured in a blast on 13 March by a package left on their doorstep. Hours later, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman was also critically injured after another package exploded in Austin. On Sunday, two men, aged 22 and 23, were seriously hurt in an explosion involving a tripwire device. In the early hours of Tuesday, a FedEx worker was hurt after a package bound for Austin containing nails and shrapnel blew up at a distribution centre in the San Antonio town of Schertz. Later that day, another explosive package was intercepted before going off at a FedEx facility outside Austin airport.

The footage, taken from inside the Volvo XC90, shows her walking out from a darkened area and stopping the moment before she was struck. The vehicle had been travelling in the right-hand lane of a four-lane highway. Ms Herzberg was not seen in the SUV's lights until a few seconds before it hit her, raising doubts over whether the vehicle would have been able to stop in time. This is a factor investigators are likely to focus on as they examine the self-driving technology. But they will also ask why the car's sensors did not pick up Ms Herzberg's presence, considering she had crossed three lanes of traffic before being hit. Ms Herzberg's death is the first involving a pedestrian and an autonomous vehicle. The video also shows the car's operator, Rafael Vasquez, looking down before the collision, only looking up a few moments before the impact. Uber said: ""The video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine's loved ones. ""Our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can."" The ride-hailing firm had been testing the self-driving vehicles in Tempe and Phoenix for months."

The remains of her 87-year-old mother were discovered four days later, the South Wales Evening Post reported. One neighbour said he had not seen the two women for four years despite living virtually next door. Dyfed Powys Police said they were treating the death as ""unexplained"".

The inspectorate said that, in some cases, victims of violence and other serious crimes face long delays as forces are unable to dispatch officers promptly. Inspectors found instances where 999 calls that were graded as needing a ""prompt"" response - meaning they require action within 60 minutes - were left unattended for several hours or even days. The annual assessment of police effectiveness found thousands of emergency calls were being held in queues, largely because officers were not able to respond to them. The watchdog said it was ""concerned by this finding, because it shows that the system is under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing"". Inspectors said ""life and limb"" and ""crime in action"" cases were generally dealt with quickly. But responses were sometimes delayed for 999 calls in the next most serious category - such as where someone has been assaulted but the offender is no longer on the scene. In two forces there were ""considerable delays"" in allocating calls for assistance. And in one area, between 20% and 50% of incidents to which a unit should have been sent within 24 hours did not meet the target, according to the report. HM Inspector Zoe Billingham said: ""About a quarter of forces are all too often overwhelmed by the demand they face, resulting in worrying backlogs of emergency jobs. ""We can see people waiting a long, long time for that 999 response and our concern here, in particular, is where there are vulnerable victims in that backlog."" :: Police lose track of 485 registered sex offenders The inspectorate's review also detailed how: :: A large number of crimes are effectively written off, denying victims the service they are entitled to. :: In some cases, basic tasks such as carrying out house-to-house inquiries to search for witnesses or checking for CCTV were overlooked at crime scenes. :: Forces are failing to track wanted suspects and develop intelligence to identify their whereabouts. The inspectorate said earlier concerns about a significant shortfall in the number of detectives were being addressed, but the process is slow. Currently, one-in-five detective desks is empty or filled with unqualified staff amid a national shortfall of 5,000 investigators. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) emphasised that most forces are continuing to do a good job keeping the public safe in the face of ""dramatic"" increases in demand and significant pressures on their budgets. Overall one force, Durham Constabulary, was rated ""outstanding"". A further 30, including West Yorkshire and Thames Valley, were given a ""good"" rating. But 12, including the three biggest forces, Greater Manchester, West Midlands and the Metropolitan Police were said to ""require improvement"". :: Gwent police investigated for hiding potential hack Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""HMICFRS finds good service overall and improvements since last year's inspection, but it is also evident that increases in demand are impacting on forces' ability to meet standards in some important areas."" Peter Kirkham, a former Detective Chief Inspector with the Metropolitan Police told Sky News that 25% budget cuts over recent years were now having ""dangerous consequences"". He added: ""Chief officers have got impossible decisions every day and frankly it is like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. ""They tend to take resources to where they've been criticised, sort that out. Then in that area where those resources were taken, that place starts to flounder."""
2018-03-22,The Bank of England has cut its expectation for GDP growth after the cold snap - but still looks poised to hike interest rates later this spring. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322200155/https://news.sky.com/story/bank-of-england-leaves-rates-on-hold-at-05-in-split-vote-11299962,"Officials now forecast that the UK economy will have expanded by just 0.3% in the first quarter after the ""Beast from the East"" brought the country to a standstill - though they see the effect as ""likely to be temporary"". The Bank's latest interest rate decision saw it leave the cost of borrowing on hold at 0.5% - though an unexpected split saw two policy makers break cover to call for an immediate hike. Sterling briefly surged past $1.42 to reach a two-month high against the US dollar as the 7-2 vote on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appeared to add to the likelihood that there will be a rise in rates as soon as May. But the pound later settled back near its opening level at just above $1.41. There was a further note of caution on the prospects for the world economy as officials warned Donald Trump's tariff plans risked escalating protectionist trade policies, causing a ""signficant negative impact on global growth"", though they judged that the direct impact of the policy was likely to be small. The Bank had signalled last month that rates would need to rise sooner than previously thought. Experts are divided on whether a move up to 0.75% will come in May or not until later in the year. MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders argued in the latest meeting that evidence of a pick-up in pay growth, risking higher inflation, meant now was the time for a hike. Minutes of the Bank's meeting indicated that prospects for the economic outlook were broadly unchanged from its view in February, when it saw an improved path for wage prices putting upward pressure on inflation - though for most members, not so much that a rate rise was needed straight away. Its view remained that ""given the prospect of excess demand over the forecast period, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate"" to return inflation towards its 2% target. Officials shrugged off a downward revision to fourth quarter GDP figures though acknowledged snow disruption would have a ""measurable adverse effect on growth in the first quarter"". Bank officials judged underlying GDP would grow by 0.4% in the first quarter, in line with its previous estimate. But the minutes added: ""After incorporating an initial judgment on the impact of the snow-related news, staff had revised down their estimate of headline GDP growth to 0.3%."" Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""A rate hike in May is not set in stone. ""If the economy turns out much weaker than the MPC expects, wage growth falls back, or if the recent signs of US protectionism evolve into a full-blown trade war, then that might cause the MPC to remain on hold. ""But we think that a May hike is on the cards."""
2018-03-22,Princes William and Harry were rumoured to have been cut out of the latest Star Wars movie for being too tall for stormtroopers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322200155/https://news.sky.com/story/star-wars-deleted-scene-are-these-the-royals-you-were-looking-for-11299728,"But a recently-released deleted scene from the Last Jedi could be of the Royal siblings. It shows three stormtroopers stuck in a lift with John Boyega's character Finn. Before the movie was released, actor Tom Hardy and the two brothers were said to have shot a scene in a lift in full trooper costumes. Unfortunately, neither Kensington Palace nor Lucasfilm have confirmed the cameos - only Boyega has, confessing to have been starstruck by the Royals. There is no way of confirming whether or not the two unusually tall stormtroopers are in fact William and Harry, but the third one engages in dialogue with Finn, in a southern accent which at the very least channels Tom Hardy's character in the 1930s prohibition film Lawless. ""Is there a problem soldier?,"" Boyega's character asks the third stormtrooper, who looks suspiciously at him. ""FN-2187? You don't remember me? I remember you,"" the stormtrooper answers, referencing Finn's past as a member of the evil First Order. Time for a lightsaber battle! @starwars @PinewoodStudios pic.twitter.com/9hHxPxfTti ""926 please don't do this,"" Finn replies in desperation, while Benicio del Toro's character looks at the troopers. The scene is a mixture of suspense and comedy, with Hardy's supposed character jokingly tapping Finn on the bottom and saying: ""Look at you captain!"". In November, Boyega said in an interview that the experience of shooting with the royals was ""great"" because ""it makes you feel like you're part of history in a sense"". In photos shared in April from the set of the new film, Harry is seen taking piloting advice from actor Mark Hamill inside an X-Wing fighter, while William is pictured having a chat with R2D2's successor BB8. The Royal siblings also took a photo fighting with Jedi lightsabers and hugging Chewbacca. This isn't the first time famous faces have secretly starred as stormtroopers. In the previous film, The Force Awakens, Daniel Craig was the stormtrooper guarding Daisy Ridley's character Rey."
2018-03-22,Theresa May has been urged to visit the factory of a UK security firm and explain why a French company is taking over their contract to make British passports.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322200155/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-passport-firm-demands-theresa-may-explain-moving-manufacture-to-france-11299774,"De La Rue boss Martin Sutherland said the Prime Minister and Home Secretary Amber Rudd should look workers ""in the whites of the eyes"" and defend the decision. His firm, which has produced UK passports for the last decade, said it lost in the tendering process to make new post-Brexit blue passports. Gemalto, a French company, has reportedly won the bid by undercutting competitors by ¬£50m. Shares in De La Rue fell 6% after the news. Mr Sutherland told Sky News: ""I'm going to have to go and face those workers, look at them in the whites of the eyes and try and explain to them why the British Government thinks it's a sensible decision to buy French passports not British passports."" ""I would actually like to invite Theresa May or Amber Rudd to come to my factory and explain to my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon."" He added the move amounted to ""offshoring the manufacture of a British icon"" because new passports would be ""manufactured in France"". Leading Brexiteers have condemned the decision, with Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom saying she was ""very sympathetic"" to criticism. Tory MP and former international development secretary Priti Patel also raged that it amounted to a ""national humiliation"". A new contract was put out to tender for British passports after Brexit as the current one is due to run out. It was put out across the EU under the bloc's single market rules. The new manufacturer will be responsible for printing new blue-fronted travel documents, after Britain has left the EU and ditches the current standard burgundy. Gemalto's bid will save taxpayers around ¬£100m-120m, according to the Home Office. A spokeswoman said: ""The preferred bidder has been selected following a rigorous, fair and open competition and all bidders were notified of the outcome last night. ""The chosen company demonstrated that they will be best able to meet the needs of our passport service with a high quality and secure product at the best value for money for our customers and the taxpayer.""It's been the case since 2009 that we do not require passports to be manufactured in the UK. A proportion of passports have been made overseas since then with up to 20 percent of blank passport books currently produced in Europe with no security or operational concerns."" In a statement, Gemalto said: ""As the process is still ongoing and the terms of engagement are confidential, we cannot make any further comment on it at this stage."""

2018-03-22,"One of Russia's leading dissidents has accused the UK of ""turning a blind eye"" towards money-laundering and corruption.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180322200155/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-has-turned-a-blind-eye-towards-money-laundering-11300102,"Vladimir Ashurkov told Sky News that ""there are special interests that would like to screw Government policy in certain directions, and that one such influence is that we turn a blind eye to corrupt money"". The Home Office has responded to those claims by saying there had been no ""premeditated mistake"" but he admitted successive governments ""were focusing on other priorities"" when confronted by accusations of money-laundering. The minister responsible for economic crime told me there were now an array of tools to chase dirty money, and he wanted to push through new laws next year to limit secrecy around property ownership in the UK. The plans are being pushed through amid growing fears over the amount of ""dirty money"" swilling around in the UK economy. It's believed up to ¬£90bn of criminal cash is ""laundered"" through the UK each year. A significant percentage of that is believed to derive from Russia. Mr Ashkurov is a former Russian banker, and a prominent supporter of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny. Mr Ashkurov fled his country and claimed asylum in the UK. He now lives in London, and told me he hoped the Skripal attacks in Salisbury, Wiltshire, would lead the UK Government to examine ""the flow of dirty money"". ""It is important for the UK to remain a centre of commerce, but we have learnt in the past year that Britain has become a haven of dirty money,"" he told me. ""There is a lobby of kleptocrats, enablers, bankers, lawyers and estate agents who service this dirty money."" Among these, he said, ""one influence is that we turn a blind eye to corrupt money"". Ben Wallace, the minister for security and economic crime, told me: ""We have committed with draft legislation due this year and next year we'll hopefully introduce it, to force overseas companies, who own property in the UK, to register those details in a public register. Then we'll all know who owns what in London. That is real action."" Mr Wallace described the battle against money-launderers as ""a massive challenge"" and said: ""The speed of modern technology means we're trying to track needles in an enormous haystack."" He confirmed there would be greater use made of a newly-introduced power called the unexplained wealth order, which gives police the power to force ""politically exposed"" people to explain surprising wealth. If they cannot give a legitimate explanation, there is a possibility that some, or all, of that money can be seized. So far, two orders have been made, both against the same person. Sources have told Sky News that more orders are being prepared against ""a range of people"". However, wholesale action against super-rich Russians still seems unlikely. For one thing, you can't seize someone's assets without evidence of wrongdoing. For another, such action may backfire. Yevgeny Chichvarkin made a fortune in Russia by selling mobile phones. Like Mr Ashkurov, he moved to London after facing arrest in Moscow, and now runs a business selling wines and spirits. Despite his own antipathy towards Vladimir Putin, he says it would be foolish to target rich Russians in the UK. ""Sanctions would affect Russian companies and banks, and that would be the next stage of the Cold War. But if you go after the oligarchs, that will just make them angry and I don't see any positive result from that. ""If you want to punish Putin then punish him personally. Don't punish people who have lived here for 15 or 20 years. ""If that happens, if you put sanctions on the oligarchs, then Putin will just say 'I was right, the UK Government are the enemies, come back home to Russia.' Who is the winner from that? Putin."""

Across the UK, the number of reported knife crimes has been steadily rising since 2015, as have hospital admissions for people assaulted with a sharp object. The Home Office's six-week campaign, costing ¬£1.35m, uses true stories of young people who have previously carried knives. Using the hashtag #knifefree, the stories are being promoted via social media and a nationwide poster campaign. As #knifefree was launched, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""The emotional stories at the heart of the new Knife Free campaign bring home in powerful fashion just what a far-reaching impact [carrying a knife] can have on a young person's life. ""I hope any young person who is seriously thinking about carrying a knife listens to what the implications can be."" In 2008, 16-year old Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death in north London in an unprovoked attack by a group of teenagers. The Ben Kinsella Trust was set up in his memory to raise awareness about knife crime among young people. Its chief executive, Patrick Green, told Sky News he welcomed the Government's investment in the #knifefree campaign, but said it was just part of the solution. ""Since 2015, many youth services have suffered cuts,"" Mr Green said. ""We've seen drops in police numbers across may forces across England and Wales. ""These are the tools that you need to address knife crime. ""With less of those and an increasing knife crime problem I fear that, as bad as this week has been, I can't see any immediate resolution to this.

Included in the portrait, which was removed by Tower Hamlets Council after a number of complaints were made, also included an activist holding a banner which read: ""The new world order is the enemy of humanity"". Mr Corbyn left a comment on a Facebook post by Mear One, real name Kalen Ockerman, in 2012 after the artist revealed his work was set to be whitewashed. The Labour MP wrote: ""Why? You are in good company. ""Rockerfeller (sic) destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Mr Corbyn's response to the post was highlighted by Labour MP Luciana Berger, who said she had asked the party leader's office for an explanation on Friday. The response from the Spokesperson is wholly inadequate. It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about Antisemitism.  I will be raising this further. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: ""In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. ""However, the mural was offensive, used anti-Semitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed."" But hours later, Mr Corbyn released another statement, which read: ""In 2012 I made a general comment about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. My comment referred to the destruction of the mural Man at the Crossroads by Diego Rivera on the Rockefeller Center. ""That is in no way comparable with the mural in the original post. I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic. ""I wholeheartedly support its removal. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form. That is a view I've always held."" Luciana won't be alone. I think lots of Labour members will want an explanation for this. https://t.co/alaI1oorjA Fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting said Ms Berger was ""not alone"" in demanding answers. Ian Austin, Labour MP for Dudley North, also tweeted, saying: ""Luciana won't be alone. I think lots of Labour members will want an explanation for this."" Meanwhile, Gavin Shuker, Labour and Co-operative MP for Luton South, said the statement from Mr Corbyn's spokesman ""isn't even an apology"". It isn‚Äôt even an apology. I know this is like screaming into the wind; it‚Äôll make zero difference; but I want to state that this is just so wrong. It‚Äôs impossible to confront anti-semitism in our party if this is the response from the very top. https://t.co/Z1hs7y7Y1u He added: ""I know this is like screaming into the wind; it'll make zero difference; but I want to state that this is just so wrong.

Officers had responded to reports of a man breaking into at least three vehicles and a home in Sacramento. Bodycam footage shows Mr Clark, 22, being pursued by officers as he enters his grandparents' back garden in the dark of night. An officer can be heard shouting ""show me your arms, gun, gun, gun"" before he starts firing rounds. In the footage, both officers reassure each other that they have not been hit. One adds later: ""He's still down, he's not moving. We can't see the gun."" No weapon was found at the scene after Mr Clark's death, and it is believed he was holding an iPhone 6. ""He was at the wrong place at the wrong time in his own backyard,"" Mr Clark's grandmother Sequita Thompson told the Sacramento Bee. Police training expert Ed Obayashi told the newspaper: ""It looks bad but (the officers) are still perceiving a threat, he's not obeying. ""The problem is he's got an object in his hand which unfortunately even during daylight could easily be considered a gun."" Sacramento Police spokesman Sgt Vance Chandler said officers gave Mr Clark commands to show his hands after he fled. ""(Mr Clark) turned and advanced towards the officers while holding an object which was extended in front of him,"" he told the Sacramento Bee.

He explained his decision in a written ruling after a private hearing in the Court of Protection in London, where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make their own choices. The woman, who is delusional and believes medics want to drink her blood, cannot be identified. Mr Justice Mostyn said doctors treating the woman had asked him to approve a planned treatment regime, which would see medication administered ""on a basis of deception"". The judge said the woman had not been suffering from a mental illness when she became infected nearly 20 years ago. She had sought treatment and willingly been treated for nearly a decade. But following a ""major deterioration"" in her mental health she had become ""strongly opposed"" to treatment. Specialists had told how the woman was ""in the grips of very powerful delusions"" which prevented her from addressing many aspects of normal life rationally. Mr Justice Mostyn said: ""She believes that she is a participant in a film about HIV, in which she will be participating with her husband. ""She does not, in fact, have a husband, but she believes that she is married to a celebrity sportsman. ""She believes that the person who is her husband will come back for her and take her away to live in connubial bliss. ""She believes that when blood samples are taken from her by the hospital staff it is done by them for the purposes of drinking her blood."" The judge added: ""Above all, she is positive that she is not HIV infected, and were she to learn that she was being secretly and clandestinely administered with anti-retroviral treatment the evidence is that she would be exceedingly aggrieved."" Mr Justice Mostyn said he had placed ""considerable weight"" on the woman's ""past wishes"". He added: ""I am wholly satisfied that the treatment proposed and the means of administration are plainly in (her) best interests."""

He is replaced by the veteran former minister Tony Lloyd, who only returned to the Commons last year after quitting as an MP in 2012 to become police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester. With Mr Corbyn already under attack over his response to the Russian poisoning crisis and rows in the party over anti-Semitism, Mr Smith's sacking threatens to reopen the civil war in the Labour Party. Immediately after his dismissal, a defiant Mr Smith tweeted: ""Just been sacked by @jeremycorbyn for my long held views on the damage #Brexit will do to the Good Friday Agreement & the economy of the entire U.K. ""Those views are shared by Labour members & supporters and I will continue to speak up for them, and in the interest of our country.""

""This is an incredibly important job, with a huge in-tray and I am looking forward to starting work."" Mr Smith's dismissal came within hours of him breaking ranks with Mr Corbyn by reopening the question of whether Brexit is ""the right choice for the country"", and urging Labour to offer the public a referendum on the final deal. The Pontypridd MP, who challenged Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership in 2016, only returned to the Shadow Cabinet less than a year ago after last year's general election. He has argued strongly for Labour to back a customs union with the EU27, something that has now become party policy. But in an article for the Guardian, he said Labour could only ""serve democracy"" by recommending a poll on the Brexit deal. ""Labour needs to do more than just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland,"" he argues. ""Given that it is increasingly obvious that the promises which the Brexiters made to the voters, especially, not only their pledge of an additional ¬£350m a week for the NHS, are never going to be honoured, we have the right to ask if Brexit remains the right choice for the country,"" he wrote. ""And to ask, too, that the country has a vote on whether to accept the terms and true costs of that choice once they are clear."""
2018-03-23,Russia has denied involvement in the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/russias-novichok-programme-exists-i-worked-on-it-scientist-tells-sky-news-11300710,"However, Sky News has spoken to a man who played a key role in the development of Soviet nerve agents - and the novichok programme. Sky Correspondent John Sparks went to visit him. Amongst the water-logged fields of southern Russia, there is a modest looking town with an unusual resident - a scientist who played a key role in the development of Soviet nerve agents. His name is Vladimir Uglev and he told us he was willing to talk about his role in the novichok programme. The 71-year-old retired scientist did not want to meet us at his home - instead we found him waiting at a bus stop just off the main highway and as he got in, he blamed us for the cold weather. ""You've got me frozen,"" he grumbled. But Mr Uglev was prepared to speak about his career at a secretive government laboratory in the region of Saratov. ""I worked there until 1993,"" he said. ""The Americans asked me to keep on working and I was offered a job in the Russian government - but I declined."" Later, at a quiet spot by the Black Sea, Mr Uglev told us he invented two of four substances that were later classified as novichok agents at a facility led by fellow scientist Pyotr Kirpichev. ""I was in the Kirpichev laboratory at the right time and the right place. ""Some people had worked there for dozens of years and didn't achieve anything but in just three months I managed to create two of the most promising substances."" The UK has blamed Russia for using one of the novichok substances to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury earlier this month. But a succession of senior Russian officials have denied the existence of any novichok programme in the Soviet Union and Russia. I asked the former scientist how he felt about it. ""Then it means I don't exist, I could disappear into thin air. I am standing here in front of you. For 15 years I worked on it. Not only on novichok - there were different projects, they were changing every year."" Mr Uglev also has a problem with comments made by Vladimir Putin, just after he had won himself a commanding victory in last Sunday's presidential election. Responding to a journalist's question about the Skripal affair, President Putin rubbished claims of Russian involvement. If a ""military-grade"" nerve agent had been used in Salisbury he said, Sergei and Yulia Skripal would have died instantly. But the former scientist told me that was silly - it depends how much liquid or powder (novichok agents were produced in both) is used. ""Sometimes the President is saying one thing, and I listen to him and I think 'My God, who is telling you to say such nonsense'. ""In the eyes of the professionals and I say it gently but you look‚Ä¶"" Mr Uglev did not finish the point. He holds out little hope for the Skripals. He knows what novichok can do because he has accidentally exposed himself to it ""on two or three occasions"". ""You are overwhelmed with fear, it's difficult to understand where it is coming from.

2018-03-23,Prosecutors have refused to review the case of a woman who was attacked by Black Cab rapist John Worboys. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/cps-refuses-to-review-rape-case-of-woman-attacked-by-john-worboys-11301035,"The victim, who can only be identified as DSD, was told this week her case would not be heard even though new evidence had emerged that she had been drugged. The woman claims she was raped by the serial sex attacker in 2003 but Worboys was never charged. She sued Worboys in the civil courts and received compensation, but he did not admit he raped her. Earlier this year the married mother-of-three asked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to rethink its decision and charge Worboys with rape. DSD told Sky News: ""I'm furious about the turn of events. ""Why are we having to fight so hard to get justice here? They say they will give us justice, but then at the same time they are sticking to their guns. ""I got a phone call from a police officer yesterday afternoon telling me they would not review the decision. It just feels like we are going round and round in circles."" Worboys was arrested in 2008, but DSD's case was not among the 12 taken to court. The CPS decided not to overload the indictment against Worboys by prosecuting him for every attack. Dozens of women were told the prosecution would be more powerful if the court heard only the strongest cases. Worboys was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, an attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. He was given an indeterminate sentence - but late in 2017 the parole board decided it was safe to release him after he had served only 10 years in prison. A number of women whose cases were not brought to court have asked the CPS to reconsider bringing new charges, but prosecutors insist they can only bring charges where there are new cases put forward. In January the CPS said if cases did not pass ""the evidential test"" at the time they were put before prosecutors, the victims would have to present new evidence before they would consider prosecuting. DSD said in her case new evidence had been produced, including a toxicology report that proved she had been drugged. She said: ""The police always said no drugs were found in my system, but it was confirmed during the civil proceeding that there were Nytol and anti-depressants in my system."" She said that even before the toxicology report she was told her case was strong enough to be taken to court. ""The only reason the CPS apparently didn't pick me is because I couldn't identify his picture,"" she said. ""A lot of the victims couldn't identify his picture. A lot of victims couldn't identify him. They went for the ones that ticked the boxes because they didn't want any doubts."" DSD, who received a payout from the Metropolitan Police for ""their gross failings"" in handling the Worboys investigation, said her case needed to be heard because Worboys was convicted of only one rape. She said: ""It wasn't a sexual assault, it was rape and he was only ever convicted of one. We are all convinced that he will come out and reoffend. No woman is safe."" A CPS spokesman said: ""The CPS has been providing early investigative advice to the Metropolitan Police but no files have been submitted for a charging decision."" A judicial review is currently taking place to decide whether the Parole's Board's decision to release Worboys was lawful."

Police found the bodies of a man and two boys just before 5pm on the beach at Birling Gap seafront in East Sussex. Ms Navarrete De Figueira's body was found at around 6pm when police arrived at her home in South Road, Twickenham, southwest London, after concerns were raised about the family's welfare. She was found dead at the scene with stab wounds. The bodies at Birling Gap were later confirmed to be the woman's husband and two young sons, after Sussex Police contacted Scotland Yard when they learned officers were looking for a man and his two sons. A post-mortem examination found that Ms Navarrete De Figueira died from multiple stab wounds. An examination of Mr Figueira de Faria showed that he died from multiple injuries consistent with falling from height. The same cause of death was given for the two boys. Officers from the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command are leading the investigation, supported by Sussex Police, and police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

He had only intended to sell half that but increased the amount of stock he disposed of after ""significant"" demand from institutional investors, the company said. Fever-Tree's share price has risen by more than 1,000% since its stock market flotation in late 2014 with a 90% increase in the last 12 months alone. Last year, Mr Rolls banked ¬£73m in another shares sale. He continues to own an 8.6% stake in the group. Fever-Tree makes premium tonic water with no artificial sweeteners, preservatives or flavourings, cashing in on the demand in recent years for upmarket gin. Its main manufacturing site is in Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Mr Rolls and fellow founder Tim Warrillow produced the company's first bottle in 2005. It now sells a range of 14 different flavours in markets from the UK to the US, Spain and Belgium. It is looking to replicate its success with gin mixers to create drinks that go with dark spirits such as rum and whisky. Fever-Tree, named after the plant that produces the key tonic water ingredient quinine, is now one of the largest companies on London's junior AIM market, with a market value of around ¬£3.4bn. Earlier this month it reported a 64% rise in annual profits to ¬£56m. Shares were down 6% on the announcement of Mr Rolls's share placing."

The Skripals were found on the bench earlier this month, with UK tests concluding they were poisoned by a novichok-class nerve agent. :: 'I helped make nerve agent novichok' Britain has said the Russian state directed the attack - a view that the EU and the US have said they share.

2018-03-23,A teenage asylum-seeker who detonated a bomb on a rush hour Tube train has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 34 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/devious-parsons-green-bomber-ahmed-hassan-jailed-for-life-11301392,"Described by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave as ""very dangerous and devious"", Ahmed Hassan had his head bowed and his eyes closed as he was handed a life sentence. He was found guilty earlier this month of the attempted murder of 93 people who escaped when a fireball engulfed a District Line Tube carriage at Parsons Green on 15 September last year. A jury rejected his explanation that he only wanted to act out a fantasy like the Tom Cruise film Mission: Impossible and convicted him of multiple attempted murder. The 18-year-old pretended to engage with the anti-terrorism Prevent scheme as he plotted mass murder in the capital, the court heard. He created a bomb with 400g of ""Mother of Satan"" explosives and 2.2kg of shrapnel while his unsuspecting foster parents were on holiday in Blackpool. ""It must have come as a disappointment that the carnage you hope to create had not occurred,"" the judge said during sentencing on Friday. The judge said it was ""sheer luck"" that the main charge did not fully detonate, and said he was satisfied that the offence of attempted murder was an act of terrorism. Hassan plotted his attack with ""ruthless determination and almost military efficiency while pretending to be a model asylum seeker"", the court heard. The judge added: ""Your intention that morning was to kill as many members of the British public as possible. ""I'm satisfied you were determined to create as much death and carnage that day as possible."" On the morning of the attack, Hassan left his home and caught a train to Wimbledon carrying his bomb inside a Lidl bag. He set the timer on the District Line and got off one stop before the bomb partially exploded on the floor of the carriage at Parsons Green. He was motivated by Islamic State extremism, ""deep-seated hatred"" of Britain, revenge for the death of his father and anger at continued bombing in Iraq, the judge said. For nearly two years, the highly intelligent college student had lived a ""double life"", he said. Hassan had been shown ""every kindness"" since he arrived in Britain yet harboured ""dark thoughts"" and significant hatred and animosity towards the country that took him in. The court heard Hassan had arrived in Britain illegally in 2015 and told officials he had trained with IS in Iraq. He was also older than he purported to be. Hassan was referred by Barnardo's and Surrey social services to Prevent, but kept his murderous plans a secret. In what the judge said was a ""remarkable act of cynicism"", he used his student of the year award of a ¬£20 Amazon voucher to buy one of the key chemicals online. The night before the bombing, his foster father Ron Jones went to find out why Hassan was not sleeping, unaware he was sitting next to the highly unstable TATP explosives. Some 51 people were injured in the explosion - many suffering burns but others suffering crush injuries in the stampede to get off the platform. A review of Hassan's dealings with Prevent is under way."
2018-03-23,EU leaders have agreed their opening negotiating position for the final round of Brexit talks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/eu-gives-green-light-for-brexit-trade-negotiations-to-begin-11301023,"The guidelines adopted at the European Council summit in Brussels, which focus on the future relationship between the UK and the EU, will provide the mandate for the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the coming months. Both sides remain committed to a timetable that aims to reach a political declaration outlining the basis of a future agreement by the end of this year, ahead of the UK's exit from the EU in March 2019. Decision: EU27 has adopted guidelines for the future EU-UK relations after #Brexit Broadly unchanged from draft versions published earlier this month, the final document reasserts the EU's ""determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the UK in future"" while warning Theresa May's insistence on leaving both the customs union and single market ""will inevitably lead to frictions in trade"" and ""negative economic consequences"". There is also a call for ""intensified efforts"" on issues that remain unresolved from the earlier stages of negotiations, not least around the Irish border and Gibraltar. The guidelines say the EU is committed to working towards a ""balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging"" future free trade agreement, but insists it cannot offer the ""same benefits"" as single market membership. However, the document also suggests the EU would be prepared to reconsider some of the guidelines if the UK's position on the single market or customs union were to ""evolve"". While the free trade agreement envisaged by the EU would include zero tariffs on goods across all sectors, and close co-operation in security and intelligence sectors as requested by Theresa May recently in Munich, there are a number of areas that will be seen as problematic by UK negotiators. Given the recent outrage expressed by some Brexiteers in relation to the continuation of the Common Fisheries Policy during the implementation period, one obvious flashpoint will be the EU demand that ""existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources"" should remain on current terms. Other areas of likely contention will be demands for UK alignment with EU rules and standards in competition, state aid, tax and environmental policies in order to preserve a ""level playing field"". Responding to the EU27's decision, Theresa May said: ""I believe there is a new dynamic in the negotiations. ""I believe we are approaching this with a spirit of co-operation, a spirit of opportunity for the future as well, and we will now be sitting down and determining those workable solutions for Northern Ireland, but also for our future security partnership and economic partnership. ""I believe it is in the best interest of both the UK and the EU that we get a deal that actually is in the interests of both."" According to Sky sources, EU leaders also discussed the possibility of a UK-US trade deal threatening a post-Brexit one with the bloc. On Thursday evening, Mrs May addressed fellow leaders at a dinner in which she acknowledged ""compromise on both sides"" had been required to reach agreement on the legal terms of an implementation period, which has now been rubber-stamped by the EU. The implementation, or transition, period will see the UK leave the EU in March 2019, but continue to observe EU rules until the end of 2020. However, UK negotiators will be able to set up and ratify free trade deals with non-EU countries during the period."

He made 15 loan applications in one day a week before his wife's death - eight in his name and seven in hers. Leanne McKie was a fellow police officer with Greater Manchester Police and was described by colleagues as ""popular and professional"". She and her husband had three children and were thought of by friends as ""the perfect couple"". In a statement after the trial at Chester Crown Court, Mrs McKie's parents Ray and Ellen Dodd said: ""Justice has been served today. Our lives will never be the same again. ""There are no winners in this trial. We have lost our beautiful daughter and our grandchildren have lost their beloved mummy."" When Leanne McKie discovered the extent of their debt towards the end of last September she sent two texts to her husband describing him as a liar and asking ""are we in such a mess?"" On the same day he strangled her before driving her car down the road to make it look as though she was not at home. He then walked back to meet a surveyor who had come to value their house in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The surveyor described McKie's demeanour as ""perfectly normal"". Witnesses saw him laughing as he picked his children up from school later that day. During the night he drove his wife's body to Poynton Park several miles away and threw her into the lake. As he walked home he was stopped by a night-shift police patrol before being allowed to continue his journey home. Dashcam footage from the police car shows the headlamps illuminating reflectors on his training shoes. The shoes were later found dumped in a wheelie bin. Traces of his wife's blood were found on them. Detective Superintendent Arron Duggan said that when interviewed about his wife, McKie tried to outwit his fellow officers. Nine days into his trial McKie changed his plea of ""not guilty"" to murder to ""guilty"" of manslaughter. It took the jury just over nine hours to reject his plea finding him guilty of the murder of his wife."
2018-03-23,"Labour MP Dan Jarvis, once seen as a rising star and tipped as a potential party leader, will have to quit Parliament within weeks after being selected as a mayoral candidate in South Yorkshire.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/would-be-mayor-dan-jarvis-must-now-quit-as-mp-11301536,"A former major in the Parachute Regiment and MP for Barnsley Central since 2011, Mr Jarvis has been selected as Labour's candidate to fight the new post of mayor of the Sheffield City Region. He is now virtually certain to be elected to the job, since South Yorkshire is a rock-solid Labour stronghold. After Nick Clegg's defeat in Sheffield Hallam last year, all the region's MPs are Labour. Mr Jarvis, 46, had hoped to stay in the Commons as an MP after the mayoral election on 3 May, combine the two roles and campaign in Parliament for a wider devolution deal covering the whole of Yorkshire. But in a controversial move, condemned as ""vindictive"" by Mr Jarvis's supporters, Labour's national executive made a new ruling on Tuesday that MPs should not hold more than one full-time elected post at a time. That means another by-election in Barnsley Central, which Mr Jarvis won with a majority of more than 15,000 at last year's general election. But in the EU referendum in 2016 68.2% voted Leave and only 31.8% Remain. In the selection for Labour's candidate for the new mayor, Mr Jarvis received 2,584 votes, 58% of the votes cast, comfortably defeating his only rival, Sheffield city councillor Ben Curran, who polled 1,903 votes. Thanking party members for selecting him, Mr Jarvis said: ""I am proud to have been chosen, grateful for the opportunity to serve, and pleased to have been part of such a comradely contest; the conduct of our members has been in the best traditions of our Labour movement. ""The election of a mayor comes at a pivotal moment for the Sheffield City Region. ""To make the most of new opportunities, our first mayor will need to work with both local and national government to negotiate the best possible deal for the people of South Yorkshire."" ""Only then will the mayor be able to end the status quo of how decisions are made and how public services are delivered; and use both devolution and cooperative principles to offer a more radical and effective way of serving the public. ""Today's result is a vote of confidence in the platform on which I am standing, and the potential of devolution; first in the Sheffield City Region and then across 'wider Yorkshire'. ""Thank you again to all those who have placed their trust in me. The Labour campaign to make South Yorkshire a stronger and more co-operative community has begun, and I stand ready to serve."" But the decision by Labour's national executives - now firmly in the grip of Jeremy Corbyn and his left-wing allies - forcing him to quit as an MP has been bitterly attacked by current and former Yorkshire MPs and is a huge blow to Mr Jarvis. Before the NEC ruling, Mr Jarvis said: ""If my first act as mayor was to stand down as an MP, I'd be needlessly squandering my ability to inflict pressure on the Government through championing our cause in Parliament. ""I take that responsibility extremely seriously and believe that not only is serving the people of Barnsley compatible with serving people across the region, but that the two roles are complimentary - the delivery of better infrastructure and public services will benefit everyone."" Vindictive move by Lab‚Äôs NEC. Dan clear that being both Mayor of South Yorks & an MP would be temporary in order to pursue the Yorkshire-wide mayor that most people want. Why don‚Äôt the NEC trust the members to choose whether or not to back Dan, rather than try & fix the race? https://t.co/uSXGMMNdQk One of his closest allies, former Barnsley East MP and Shadow Cabinet member Michael Dugher, tweeted after the NEC decision: ""Vindictive move by Lab's NEC. ""Dan clear that being both Mayor of South Yorks & an MP would be temporary in order to pursue the Yorkshire-wide mayor that most people want. ""Why don't the NEC trust the members to choose whether or not to back Dan, rather than try & fix the race?"" John Grogan, Labour MP for Keighley, complained: ""This is like a referee changing the offside rules in the 87th minute of a football match without consulting the Football Association. My understanding is that only party conference can change the rules."" When Mr Jarvis was elected as an MP in 2011 he became the first former Army officer to resign a military commission to contest a parliamentary by-election since the Second World War. He was tipped as a leadership contender in 2015 after Ed Miliband quit after Labour's election defeat, but ruled himself out, saying he wanted to put his family first. At the time, he was recently widowed and was bringing up young children. He has since remarried. He is no fan of Mr Corbyn and the current Labour leadership, who will be glad to see him leave Parliament. He nominated Andy Burnham - now Greater Manchester mayor - in 2015 and backed Mr Corbyn's challenger Owen Smith in 2016."

The ICO says it is ""pleased with the decision of the judge"". ""This is just one part of a larger investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes and we will now need time to collect and consider the evidence,"" it said. The firm, which uses data to change the behaviour of internet users, was hired by Donald Trump's campaign team during the 2016 presidential election. There are claims the information it unlawfully obtained was given to Mr Trump's campaign strategists to provide an insight into the thoughts of American voters, ultimately influencing the 2016 presidential election. The data watchdog's investigation includes the acquisition and use of the data by Cambridge Analytica, its parent company SCL and academic Dr Aleksandr Kogan. ICO granted warrant: We‚Äôre pleased with the decision of the judge and we plan to execute the warrant shortly. This is just one part of a larger investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes and we will now need time to collect and consider the evidence Dr Kogan is the University of Cambridge professor who developed the app 'This Is Your Digital Life' through his company Global Science Research (GSR) in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica. The app offered payment in return for users filling out a personality test and Facebook says it was downloaded by 270,000 people. The app also allegedly gave Mr Kogan access to the lists of the downloaders' Facebook friends. Cambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix has been suspended while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been called on to give evidence to MPs. The judge told the court he will give his reasons for granting the application for the warrant on Tuesday. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday admitted the company ""made mistakes"" but said steps had been taken to protect users. He says he is ""open"" to testifying before the US Congress on the scandal."
2018-03-23,"Obesity could soon be the new smoking, health professionals have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/obesity-could-soon-be-the-new-smoking-cancer-risk-study-shows-11300817,"The claim comes as new research reveals that, as smoking rates decline and obesity levels increase, obesity could overtake smoking as the biggest cause of avoidable cancer. The Cancer Research UK study ranked the causes of the disease: smoking, excess weight, overexposure to UV radiation from the sun and sunbeds, drinking alcohol, eating too little fibre, and outdoor air pollution. Nearly 40% of cancers could be avoided through changes in lifestyle, including quitting smoking and reducing weight, they found. According to 2015 figures - the latest available - more than 135,500 cases of cancer a year (37.7% of the total diagnosed) could be prevented. This rises to 41.5% in Scotland. Smoking remains the biggest preventable cause, responsible for around 32,200 cases of cancer in men (17.7% of all male cancer cases) and around 22,000 (12.4%) in women. Being overweight or obese is the second biggest preventable cause of cancer, with around 22,800 (6.3%) cases. Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar said: ""Obesity is potentially the new smoking, if we're not careful. ""My sense would be it'll be some time in next couple of decades that we'll see those two switch around."" Obesity causes 13 types of cancer, including bowel, breast, kidney and womb. Also, more than one in 20 cases could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight. Dr Katrina Brown, Cancer Research UK's statistical information and risk manager and the study's lead author, said the public would eventually come to understand the dangers of obesity, just as they eventually did with smoking. Dr Brown added: ""People regard being large as increasingly normal - that is a shift in cultural norms and acceptability, so we need to not only convey the message about the health risks, but also that our population is getting larger."" In terms of other preventable causes of cancer, overexposure to UV radiation from the sun and sunbeds causes around 13,600 cases of melanoma skin cancer a year (3.8% of all cases), while drinking alcohol causes around 11,900 cases and eating too little fibre is responsible for around 11,700. Sir Harpal added: ""Leading a healthy life doesn't guarantee that a person won't get cancer, but it can stack the odds in your favour."" The research is published in the British Journal of Cancer."
2018-03-23,It is tempting to blame the FTSE-100's lurch into correction territory simply on concerns over trade wars between the US and China.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-unloved-ftse-100-is-lagging-rivals-11301394,"After all, all of the Footsie's European peers have also fallen sharply since it became clear President Trump was going to slap tariffs on a number of Chinese imports, a measure to which Beijing has retaliated overnight. Yet none of the main European indices have fallen to the same extent as the Footsie. The UK's main index has on Friday hit a level last seen on 12 December 2016. By contrast, the Xetra Dax in Germany is merely back to a position it touched earlier this month and the CAC 40 in France at a level where it had been at the beginning of February. Further afield, the main US stock index, the S&P 500, has merely slipped to a point last seen on 12 February, while the Shanghai Composite in China has drifted to a level previously reached on 9 February. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is where it was on 7 March. Only the Nikkei in Japan, which contains a lot of companies that could be at risk in the event of a major trade war between the US and China, has experienced anything approaching the reverses the Footsie has suffered of late - and even it has only fallen to levels last seen at the beginning of October last year. So the Footsie has fallen harder and faster than any of its main international peers. The longer term graph is more pitiful still. At the time of writing, the index is actually lower than its closing value of 6,930 achieved on the final trading day of 1999. In other words, if you had bought a fund tracking the index in the dying hours of the 20th century, you would have absolutely no capital gain to show for the intervening period - although you would still be up on the investment thanks to dividend payments yielding roughly 3% each year. By comparison, the S&P 500 has almost doubled in value, as has the Xetra Dax. Even the sleepy old Nikkei is up almost 9% on its close at the end of 1999. So the FTSE-100 does seem particularly unloved among major stock indices. This was confirmed this week by the influential monthly survey of fund managers, compiled by the stockbroker Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which revealed that pessimism towards UK equities is at an all-time high. A net 42% of investors told BoAML they were ""underweight"" the UK. Not only that, but UK equities were revealed to be the most-favoured ""short"" position among market professionals, which is to say that the UK stock market is the most popular asset for investors to sell in the expectation of further drops in prices. There are a number of reasons why investors are shunning the UK. The most obvious is that the UK economy has the weakest growth prospects of all of the major global economies. That in turn means a lacklustre outlook for profits growth at companies that are particularly exposed to the UK economy. However, the FTSE-100 is an international index, with the companies in it deriving more than half of their earnings from outside the UK. Only about a quarter of earnings enjoyed by FTSE-100 companies are generated in the UK. To that extent, the prospect of trade wars is a concern, particularly with the Footsie being packed with miners like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom rely on Chinese demand to a significant extent. Another factor is Brexit. Some Footsie stocks, particularly some banks and manufacturers that do a lot of cross-border trade with the EU, face a great deal of uncertainty just now. Investors lack clarity over the kind of Brexit deal that the Government will achieve with the EU and, until they have it, they will naturally be cautious about such stocks. Another factor deterring investors from the UK is the possibility of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn pledged to higher personal and corporate taxes and nationalisation of PFI contracts and some utilities. A number of Footsie constituents, including Severn Trent, United Utilities, National Grid and Royal Mail, are among those businesses that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has promised to take into public ownership - a prospect that Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, said last week was frightening investors when combined with the prospect of a hard Brexit. He said: ""Confidence is everything. And every day, I'm hearing of potential investors in this country reaching for their coats. ""Because they're not going to risk putting their money into an economy that soon might face export barriers to its single biggest market, let alone invest in companies, assets and services that could soon be taken over by the state."" The people at the helm of most UK businesses are now at least as worried, if not more so, about a hard-Left Labour government as they are about a hard Brexit. And, accordingly, so are the market professionals who invest in those companies. As Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment officer at wealth manager Tilney Group, put it recently: ""A Labour government is unambiguously bad for capital markets."" One factor particularly worrying investors is the hint of capital controls that prevent investors getting their money out of the country. Mr McDonnell admitted at a fringe meeting at last September's Labour conference: ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? ""I don't think there will be, but you never know, so we've got to scenario-plan for that."" As Iceland discovered, when it imposed capital controls after the financial crisis, people will not invest in your country if they do not think there is a reasonable chance of later being able to get their money out."

""We agree with ITV and Ant & Dec that it was the correct decision not to broadcast Saturday Night Takeaway this weekend,"" a statement from Suzuki GB said. ""As a car brand we recognise the seriousness of Ant's charge."" The company said it ""completely supports Ant's decision to seek treatment"". ""Suzuki will however continue to sponsor the last two episodes of this series of Saturday Night Takeaway with our current idents,"" it said. ""Suzuki very much supports Dec and ITV's decision to broadcast the shows and as headline sponsors we also want to support the competition winners who have won places on the plane to Florida for the series finale."" McPartlin was charged with drink-driving following his arrest on Sunday, when his black Mini collided with two other cars in Richmond, London. A child passenger in one of the cars - a green Mini - was taken to hospital as a precaution. She is believed to be a three-year-old girl. Others involved were treated at the scene for minor injuries. McPartlin's publicist has said the presenter is taking time out from his TV commitments, while the remaining episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway will be hosted solo by Declan Donnelly. Long-time presenting partner Donnelly said in a statement: ""Whilst I never thought I'd be in this position, after much discussion and careful consideration we've decided that the remaining two shows of this series of Saturday Night Takeaway will go ahead. ""We made a promise to take hundreds of deserving winners to Florida to watch the series finale, and we will honour that. ""Everyone at ITV and the Takeaway team feels we owe it to the audience to complete the series."" In January, McPartlin announced he was divorcing wife and Strictly Come Dancing make-up boss Lisa Armstrong after 11 years of marriage."
2018-03-23,CCTV has been released of a gang breaking into a house in a terrifying burglary where they dragged around the family's children and squirted an 81-year-old in the face with liquid.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/cctv-shows-men-smashing-through-patio-door-in-terrifying-burglary-11301568,"Described as four stocky white men with Irish accents and in their mid-20s, two of them rang the doorbell while the others went behind bushes. When no one answered, they all went to the rear patio door of the property in affluent Chislehurst, southeast London, and smashed the glass with a crowbar. Piling into the property, one man grabbed an 11-year-old boy from the lounge and dragged him through the hallway to where the rest of the family were sitting. Another squirted an elderly man with liquid, believed at the time to be a corrosive substance. They threatened to harm the family unless they told them where money and jewellery was kept. As three of the gang searched the house, one of them grabbed a teenage girl and dragged her upstairs to find the valuables. Luckily, one of the family was able to dial 999. When the men found out police were on their way they stuffed the girl's schoolbag with jewellery and sped away in a silver Mercedes. The gang all wore matching Converse All Star-style trainers, baseball caps and puffa-style jackets. It happened at an address on Cookham Dene Close on 5 March, at around 6pm. Police believe the men are behind a number of burglaries in the Chislehurst area, including one last month in nearby Keston where a safe was stolen and lifted into a car. All the properties have been broken into through the rear after the door bell was rung. Detective Constable Ben Briselden, from Bromley Burglary Squad, said: ""This was a terrifying burglary where a family were at home enjoying their evening and were threatened, and attacked, by four men who then stole their most valued possessions, which were of great sentimental value."" Anyone with information is asked to call Bromley Burglary Squad on 07795 334919 on or 101, or tweet @Metcc. To call anonymously, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

A minibus driver and seven passengers on their way to Disneyland died in the collision during the August bank holiday weekend. Cyriac Joseph was behind the wheel of the minibus which was crushed between the lorries when Masierak came to a complete stop in the slow lane while twice the legal alcohol limit. Wagstaff had his vehicle on cruise control and was chatting on his hands-free set when he ploughed into the back of the minibus at 56mph, forcing it under Masierak's lorry near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. Mr Joseph, along with Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan were killed. Four other people, including a four-year-old girl, were seriously injured in the tragedy. At Aylesbury Crown Court, Masierak was found guilty of eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving and four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Judge Francis Sheridan said to Masierak: ""What you have tried to do is blame everyone and everybody except yourself. ""In short, you are a persistent, unmitigated, if not very accomplished, liar."" He said he had shown ""no remorse"" and that there was ""no mitigation"" in his case. Wagstaff, from Stoke, admitted eight counts of causing death by careless driving and four counts of careless driving, but was cleared of more serious charges of causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving. Turning to Wagstaff, he said: ""You had between nine and 11 seconds to see the vehicles ahead had you not been so distracted by using the phone, albeit on Bluetooth. ""You took no action whatsoever because you weren't concentrating on what was in front of you - they were there to be seen and you didn't see them."" Judge Sheridan acknowledged Wagstaff had not broken the law in using his Bluetooth headset at the wheel, but added: ""It would be wrong of me not to take the opportunity to urge the public to download the app that deactivates your phone when you are on the move."" He also thanked the victims' families, many of whom were present at trial, saying: ""They conducted themselves with utmost dignity which was utterly humbling, and allowed these defendants to have a fair trial."" Both drivers were disqualified from driving and ordered to take an extended test if they ever wish to get behind the wheel again. Masierak was banned for 17 years, while Wagstaff was banned for five. Poland-born Masierak was also told he may face deportation upon his release."
2018-03-23,"A ""large number"" of EU countries are set to impose tougher sanctions on Russia after the Salisbury poisoning.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180323202532/https://news.sky.com/story/large-number-of-eu-countries-plan-more-russia-action-11301420,"Member states are said to be considering a range of measures - including expelling diplomats - to take effect on Monday. France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark and the Czech Republic have all warned of further action. It is understood nations including France, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania are preparing to expel Russian diplomats or spies posing as diplomats from their countries. ""Coordinated measures"" will be announced ""very shortly"", French President Emmanuel Macron announced. It came after the EU withdrew its ambassador to Russia, a move described by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as ""extraordinary"". Speaking after a special summit of EU leaders concluded in Brussels, Mr Macron said it was highly likely Russia was behind the attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. ""We consider that this is an attack on all European sovereignty,"" the French President said. ""We therefore call for a coordinated and responsible reaction of the EU and of its member states. ""A number of member states - including France and Germany - will very shortly set out some coordinated measures."" Latvia has promised to expel ""one or several"" Russian diplomats, with the Czech Republic saying it will ""probably"" follow suit. Denmark is also ""very seriously considering"" unilateral action to support Britain. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney later revealed his country would carry out a ""security assessment"" on all Russian diplomats as part of the consideration of ""additional measures"". ""Such actions are also under consideration by a large number of other EU member states,"" he said. Challenged at a news conference about whether the EU had hit back hard enough at Russia, European Council President Donald Tusk said ""we will never have the chance to respond adequately"". ""We are completely different from the perpetrators - if you know what I mean,"" he raged. Earlier, the Russian foreign ministry said it ""regretted"" the EU's ambassador being temporarily withdrawn ""for consultations"". A spokesperson claimed the bloc was ""heading towards an anti-Russia campaign, instigated by London and Washington"". A collective EU decision to find Russia ""highly likely"" to have carried out the nerve agent attack three weeks ago was only made to ""help"" British Prime Minister Theresa May ""out of a difficult situation"", they added. Friday also marked the day when 23 British diplomats and their families in Russia were forced to leave the country. It came in retaliation for the UK Government kicking out 23 Russian diplomats accused of being ""undeclared intelligence officers"". Speaking as she left the EU summit in Brussels, Mrs May said there was ""no plausible alternative explanation"" than that Moscow sanctioned the attempted murder in Salisbury. ""The threat from Russia is one that respects no borders,"" she warned. ""I think it is clear that Russia is challenging the values we share as Europeans. ""And it is right that we are standing together in defence of those barriers."""

In an interview on a US talk show, the Maggie May singer said he tried to contact the Rocket Man star to get more details on the tour. ""I did email her [Elton] and said 'what, again dear?' - I didn't hear anything back,"" he told the show's hosts and guest Cyndi Lauper. Lauper said she did not think the tour was such ""a bad idea"", to which Sir Rod replied: ""It's dishonest. It's not rock and roll.

Bieber, who was alone in his car at the time, was able to drive home but the Range Rover was badly damaged and had to be towed away. Earlier in March, Bieber reportedly split up from his girlfriend Selena Gomez."
2018-03-24,A biometric wristband designed to predict epileptic seizures may soon be helping people with severe autism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/biometric-wristbands-could-help-those-with-autism-11302172,"David Adamson, a resident at Raby Hall in the Wirral for 17 years, is the first autistic subject to be given the device, which researchers say will measure his levels of stress and anxiety. They hope this will be able to predict what carers call a ""meltdown event"". For Mr Adamson, 34, those events regularly happen in the evenings, resulting in poor or no sleep. They also often lead to him self-harming. It is hoped that by monitoring his biometric data, the team at Raby Hall, which is owned and run by the charity Autism Together, will be able to determine what triggers Mr Adamson's stress events, and therefore help him to avoid those factors. ""What we know is that many people who are autistic and non-verbal can only express how they're feeling through their behaviours,"" says Robin Bush, chief executive of Autism Together. ""And of course the more anxious people get, the more extreme those behaviours become. ""So what we're hoping is to use this technology to help carers and professionals around the individual to understand when people are becoming distressed and then reduce their anxiety."" For Mr Adamson's mother, Kim, there is hope that the wristband could help provide the information needed for him to have a better quality of life. ""If we could sort the sleep out and get rid of whatever they are, night terrors, or whatever he's feeling anxious about then it would mean the world,"" she said. ""We've lived with it for 34 years. ""I'd love to see him improve enough to be able to enjoy life without hurting himself."" In a few weeks, Mr Adamson will be joined on the pilot scheme by seven other residents at Raby Hall. The trial will gather data for six months before reviewing the system. If the individual's triggers can be identified and avoided, it could mean less stress and fewer serious episodes for people like Mr Adamson."

After Mr Corbyn was criticised for his apparent support for an anti-Semitic mural, Mr Smith said the Labour Party needed to be ""more robust"" to tackle anti-Semitism. He said: ""The reality is there are anti-Semites in all form of politics but we do, I think, have people in the Labour Party who have been readmitted having expressed anti-Semitic views. ""I think there should be no place for those views and, frankly, no place for those people if they have expressed those views."" Mr Smith's sacking was criticised by a number of prominent Labour politicians including Chuka Umunna and ex-Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain who called the decision a ""terrible Stalinist purge"".

The Russian Embassy has since denied that claim, writing on Twitter: ""Kremlin spox: there was no letter from Sergei Skripal to President Putin to allow him to come back to Russia.""

He added that his friend ""regretted"" being a double agent ""because his life had become all messed up"". Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were poisoned with the nerve agent novichok in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March. Theresa May and European Union leaders have blamed the Russian state for the attack but Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement. The incident has caused a major diplomatic row, with the EU recalling its ambassador to Moscow and several EU countries set to follow Britain's suit in expelling diplomats it believes are posing as spies. Russia responded by expelling UK diplomats and shutting down the British Council cultural organisation. Moscow's denial of the letter comes as Russia's ambassador to the UK wrote to Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was recovering in hospital after being exposed to novichok whilst investigating the case. Alexander Vakovenko wrote: ""I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you for your bravery when reacting to the assault on two Russian nationals, Sergei and Yulia Skripal, on 4 March in Salisbury, who I hope will get well soon too.

His wife, Sarah, also released a statement that said their world had been ""turned upside down"" and the attack was ""the most traumatic event of our life"". The ambassador's letter strikes a different tone to his news conference in London earlier this week where he hit back at UK government assertions that Russia was behind the nerve agent attack. Mr Yakovenko told reporters that Russia ""can't take British words for granted,"" and accused the UK of having a ""bad record of violating international law and misleading the international community"". The diplomatic fallout from the Salisbury incident on 4 March continues. A ""large number"" of EU countries are set to impose tougher sanctions on Russia after agreeing with the UK claim that the Russian state is to blame. It is understood nations including France, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania are preparing to expel Russian diplomats - or spies posing as diplomats - from their countries. Britain has already expelled diplomats from the London embassy, and Russia has now followed suit. Meanwhile, the bench where the Skripals were found frothing at the mouth and unable to control their bodies has been removed. Police in chemical suits wrapped it in plastic film and used an angle grinder to cut it from the ground, before hauling it into a back of a van. It is being kept as evidence as part of the attempted murder investigation. Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain critical and largely unresponsive in hospital. A court on Thursday approved a request for international chemical weapons experts to take a sample of their blood to check the UK's view that they were poisoned with the novichok nerve agent. The Court of Protection said it was unclear whether they will recover, and if they do their mental capacity could be affected to an unknown degree."

Judge Francis Sheridan said to Masierak: ""What you have tried to do is blame everyone and everybody except yourself. ""In short, you are a persistent, unmitigated, if not very accomplished, liar."" He said he had shown ""no remorse"" and that there was ""no mitigation"" in his case. Wagstaff, from Stoke, admitted eight counts of causing death by careless driving and four counts of careless driving, but was cleared of more serious charges of causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving. Turning to Wagstaff, he said: ""You had between nine and 11 seconds to see the vehicles ahead had you not been so distracted by using the phone, albeit on Bluetooth. ""You took no action whatsoever because you weren't concentrating on what was in front of you - they were there to be seen and you didn't see them."" Judge Sheridan acknowledged Wagstaff had not broken the law in using his Bluetooth headset at the wheel, but added: ""It would be wrong of me not to take the opportunity to urge the public to download the app that deactivates your phone when you are on the move."" He also thanked the victims' families, many of whom were present at trial, saying: ""They conducted themselves with utmost dignity which was utterly humbling, and allowed these defendants to have a fair trial."" Both drivers were disqualified from driving and ordered to take an extended test if they ever wish to get behind the wheel again. Masierak was banned for 17 years, while Wagstaff was banned for five. Poland-born Masierak was also told he may face deportation upon his release."
2018-03-24,It is tempting to blame the FTSE-100's lurch into correction territory simply on concerns over trade wars between the US and China.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-unloved-ftse-100-is-lagging-rivals-11301394,"After all, all of the Footsie's European peers have also fallen sharply since it became clear President Trump was going to slap tariffs on a number of Chinese imports, a measure to which Beijing has retaliated overnight. Yet none of the main European indices have fallen to the same extent as the Footsie. The UK's main index has on Friday hit a level last seen on 12 December 2016. By contrast, the Xetra Dax in Germany is merely back to a position it touched earlier this month and the CAC 40 in France at a level where it had been at the beginning of February. Further afield, the main US stock index, the S&P 500, has merely slipped to a point last seen on 12 February, while the Shanghai Composite in China has drifted to a level previously reached on 9 February. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is where it was on 7 March. Only the Nikkei in Japan, which contains a lot of companies that could be at risk in the event of a major trade war between the US and China, has experienced anything approaching the reverses the Footsie has suffered of late - and even it has only fallen to levels last seen at the beginning of October last year. So the Footsie has fallen harder and faster than any of its main international peers. The longer term graph is more pitiful still. At the time of writing, the index is actually lower than its closing value of 6,930 achieved on the final trading day of 1999. In other words, if you had bought a fund tracking the index in the dying hours of the 20th century, you would have absolutely no capital gain to show for the intervening period - although you would still be up on the investment thanks to dividend payments yielding roughly 3% each year. By comparison, the S&P 500 has almost doubled in value, as has the Xetra Dax. Even the sleepy old Nikkei is up almost 9% on its close at the end of 1999. So the FTSE-100 does seem particularly unloved among major stock indices. This was confirmed this week by the influential monthly survey of fund managers, compiled by the stockbroker Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which revealed that pessimism towards UK equities is at an all-time high. A net 42% of investors told BoAML they were ""underweight"" the UK. Not only that, but UK equities were revealed to be the most-favoured ""short"" position among market professionals, which is to say that the UK stock market is the most popular asset for investors to sell in the expectation of further drops in prices. There are a number of reasons why investors are shunning the UK. The most obvious is that the UK economy has the weakest growth prospects of all of the major global economies. That in turn means a lacklustre outlook for profits growth at companies that are particularly exposed to the UK economy. However, the FTSE-100 is an international index, with the companies in it deriving more than half of their earnings from outside the UK. Only about a quarter of earnings enjoyed by FTSE-100 companies are generated in the UK. To that extent, the prospect of trade wars is a concern, particularly with the Footsie being packed with miners like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom rely on Chinese demand to a significant extent. Another factor is Brexit. Some Footsie stocks, particularly some banks and manufacturers that do a lot of cross-border trade with the EU, face a great deal of uncertainty just now. Investors lack clarity over the kind of Brexit deal that the Government will achieve with the EU and, until they have it, they will naturally be cautious about such stocks. Another factor deterring investors from the UK is the possibility of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn pledged to higher personal and corporate taxes and nationalisation of PFI contracts and some utilities. A number of Footsie constituents, including Severn Trent, United Utilities, National Grid and Royal Mail, are among those businesses that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has promised to take into public ownership - a prospect that Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, said last week was frightening investors when combined with the prospect of a hard Brexit. He said: ""Confidence is everything. And every day, I'm hearing of potential investors in this country reaching for their coats. ""Because they're not going to risk putting their money into an economy that soon might face export barriers to its single biggest market, let alone invest in companies, assets and services that could soon be taken over by the state."" The people at the helm of most UK businesses are now at least as worried, if not more so, about a hard-Left Labour government as they are about a hard Brexit. And, accordingly, so are the market professionals who invest in those companies. As Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment officer at wealth manager Tilney Group, put it recently: ""A Labour government is unambiguously bad for capital markets."" One factor particularly worrying investors is the hint of capital controls that prevent investors getting their money out of the country. Mr McDonnell admitted at a fringe meeting at last September's Labour conference: ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? ""I don't think there will be, but you never know, so we've got to scenario-plan for that."" As Iceland discovered, when it imposed capital controls after the financial crisis, people will not invest in your country if they do not think there is a reasonable chance of later being able to get their money out."
2018-03-24,A teenage asylum-seeker who detonated a bomb on a rush hour Tube train has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 34 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/devious-parsons-green-bomber-ahmed-hassan-jailed-for-life-11301392,"Described by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave as ""very dangerous and devious"", Ahmed Hassan had his head bowed and his eyes closed as he was handed a life sentence. He was found guilty earlier this month of the attempted murder of 93 people who escaped when a fireball engulfed a District Line Tube carriage at Parsons Green on 15 September last year. A jury rejected his explanation that he only wanted to act out a fantasy like the Tom Cruise film Mission: Impossible and convicted him of multiple attempted murder. The 18-year-old pretended to engage with the anti-terrorism Prevent scheme as he plotted mass murder in the capital, the court heard. He created a bomb with 400g of ""Mother of Satan"" explosives and 2.2kg of shrapnel while his unsuspecting foster parents were on holiday in Blackpool. ""It must have come as a disappointment that the carnage you hope to create had not occurred,"" the judge said during sentencing on Friday. The judge said it was ""sheer luck"" that the main charge did not fully detonate, and said he was satisfied that the offence of attempted murder was an act of terrorism. Hassan plotted his attack with ""ruthless determination and almost military efficiency while pretending to be a model asylum seeker"", the court heard. The judge added: ""Your intention that morning was to kill as many members of the British public as possible. ""I'm satisfied you were determined to create as much death and carnage that day as possible."" On the morning of the attack, Hassan left his home and caught a train to Wimbledon carrying his bomb inside a Lidl bag. He set the timer on the District Line and got off one stop before the bomb partially exploded on the floor of the carriage at Parsons Green. He was motivated by Islamic State extremism, ""deep-seated hatred"" of Britain, revenge for the death of his father and anger at continued bombing in Iraq, the judge said. For nearly two years, the highly intelligent college student had lived a ""double life"", he said. Hassan had been shown ""every kindness"" since he arrived in Britain yet harboured ""dark thoughts"" and significant hatred and animosity towards the country that took him in. The court heard Hassan had arrived in Britain illegally in 2015 and told officials he had trained with IS in Iraq. He was also older than he purported to be. Hassan was referred by Barnardo's and Surrey social services to Prevent, but kept his murderous plans a secret. In what the judge said was a ""remarkable act of cynicism"", he used his student of the year award of a ¬£20 Amazon voucher to buy one of the key chemicals online. The night before the bombing, his foster father Ron Jones went to find out why Hassan was not sleeping, unaware he was sitting next to the highly unstable TATP explosives. Some 51 people were injured in the explosion - many suffering burns but others suffering crush injuries in the stampede to get off the platform. A review of Hassan's dealings with Prevent is under way."
2018-03-24,"Police chiefs have condemned the ""appalling"" behaviour of a ""large number"" of England football fans after dozens were arrested in Amsterdam.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/appalling-england-fans-criticised-after-more-than-100-arrests-in-amsterdam-11302765,"The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said the arrest of 100 England fans in the Dutch capital on Friday was the most for a single game in ""several years"" and part of a ""worrying trend"". It comes after 25 England supporters were held on Thursday amid ugly scenes before the team's friendly win over the Netherlands. Amsterdam Police said ""mostly drunken"" fans had thrown beer bottles towards officers and a mobile unit was deployed as ""unrest by the English supporters grew larger in the city centre"". Deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, the NPCC's lead for football policing, told Sky News: ""Last night resulted in the largest number of arrests for a single game we have seen for several years and, unfortunately, it follows a worrying trend observed at recent fixtures. ""It also brings into question the wisdom of having this game in Amsterdam on a Friday night. ""The police were not consulted before the fixture was announced and we would have raised significant concerns had we been. ""We had a large contingent of UK officers in Amsterdam working with the Dutch police and we will now conduct an investigation to seek banning orders against those responsible. ""The behaviour of a large number of England supporters was appalling; it was witnessed by our officers and any attempts to downplay it are wide of the mark. ""The sad fact is that the drunken mob's behaviour reinforces the negative stereotype of England supporters, and will impact on the treatment all fans can expect when they follow the team abroad."" Amsterdam Police said 102 people were arrested on Friday, including ""100 Englishmen"" and two Dutch fans. Thirty five of those arrested spent the night in cells and 94 were fined, police said. Eight people were still being questioned ""mainly for violence against the police"", the force added. England manager Gareth Southgate had urged supporters to behave on the eve of Friday's friendly and criticised fans who booed the Dutch national anthem before the game. ""I heard some of the booing of the anthem which obviously isn't acceptable,"" Southgate said. Football Supporters' Federation chief executive Kevin Miles said: ""England fans have worked hard over the last decade or so to improve their reputation and disorder has become a rarity. ""It is not in the interests of the regular England followers for the anti-social behaviour to creep back in as it will inevitably impact on how we are received and treated by host police forces elsewhere."" The trouble in Amsterdam comes a year after unsavoury scenes marred England's friendly against Germany in Dortmund. Then, two people were caught making Nazi gestures, prompting the England Supporters Travel Club to hand out lifetime bans for the first time. A total of 27 members were suspended for their behaviour in Dortmund. England fans are preparing to travel to Russia for the World Cup this summer after violent clashes between the two countries' supporters at Euro 2016 in France. An FA spokesman said: ""We condemn the unacceptable scenes in Amsterdam. As was reiterated ahead of the fixture, we always urge supporters to respect our hosts and behave in a responsible manner. ""As ever, the FA will work in partnership with the UK Football Policing Unit to help identify those involved and we will sanction any England Supporters Travel Club member found to be responsible for disorder."""
2018-03-24,A police inspector who strangled his wife before dumping her body in a lake has been found guilty of murder.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/police-inspector-darren-mckie-found-guilty-of-wifes-murder-11301399,"Darren McKie had racked up debts of more than ¬£100,000 fraudulently applying for loans in his wife Leanne's name without her knowledge. He made 15 loan applications in one day a week before his wife's death - eight in his name and seven in hers. Leanne McKie was a fellow police officer with Greater Manchester Police and was described by colleagues as ""popular and professional"". She and her husband had three children and were thought of by friends as ""the perfect couple"". In a statement after the trial at Chester Crown Court, Mrs McKie's parents Ray and Ellen Dodd said: ""Justice has been served today. Our lives will never be the same again. ""There are no winners in this trial. We have lost our beautiful daughter and our grandchildren have lost their beloved mummy."" When Leanne McKie discovered the extent of their debt towards the end of last September she sent two texts to her husband describing him as a liar and asking ""are we in such a mess?"" On the same day he strangled her before driving her car down the road to make it look as though she was not at home. He then walked back to meet a surveyor who had come to value their house in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The surveyor described McKie's demeanour as ""perfectly normal"". Witnesses saw him laughing as he picked his children up from school later that day. During the night he drove his wife's body to Poynton Park several miles away and threw her into the lake. As he walked home he was stopped by a night-shift police patrol before being allowed to continue his journey home. Dashcam footage from the police car shows the headlamps illuminating reflectors on his training shoes. The shoes were later found dumped in a wheelie bin. Traces of his wife's blood were found on them. Detective Superintendent Arron Duggan said that when interviewed about his wife, McKie tried to outwit his fellow officers. Nine days into his trial McKie changed his plea of ""not guilty"" to murder to ""guilty"" of manslaughter. It took the jury just over nine hours to reject his plea finding him guilty of the murder of his wife."

The 44-year-old died in hospital from his injuries after he was shot three times by radical Islamist Redouane Lakdim in Trebes, southwest France, on Friday. The 25-year-old attacker was shot dead by police after Lt Col Beltrame left his mobile phone on so his colleagues could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Cedric, the officer's brother, said he had given his life ""for strangers"" and knew he had ""almost no chance"" of surviving. ""He did not hesitate, one second,"" Mr Beltrame told RTL radio. ""He did what needed to be done and thanks to him, many lives were saved and yes, I think the word hero is very appropriate."" Lt Col Beltrame's mother, who has not been named, said she was ""not surprised"" by her son's actions. ""He has always been like that,"" she said. ""It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland."" Mr Macron said of Lt Col Beltrame: ""In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""saddened"" by the officer's death, adding: ""His sacrifice and courage will never be forgotten."" Britain's ambassador to France, Ed Llewellyn, also paid tribute, saying Lt Col Beltrame ""gave his life to save the lives of others"" and was ""truly a hero"".

And our solidarity with France pic.twitter.com/Ly2xIl90h9 Samia Menassi, the manager of the supermarket targeted in the attack, said her colleague who was swapped for Lt Col Beltrame during the siege was in a ""catastrophic state"". Lt Col Beltrame, who joined France's elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had reportedly organised a training session last December to prepare for hostage situations. Mr Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how Morocco-born Lakdim obtained his weapon and how he became radicalised. Lakdim was known to police for petty crimes and drug dealing and had been on a watch list from 2014, according to France's prosecutor Francois Molins, but he was not believed to be preparing any terrorist acts. Islamic State has claimed the attack was in response to its call to target Western enemies. Lakdim hijacked a car in the city of Carcassonne - seriously wounding the driver and killing the passenger - before driving toward Trebes. He shot at police officers before hiding in the supermarket, taking several people hostage. During the resulting stand-off with police, Lakdim demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam - the only surviving member of the Islamic State cell that attacked Paris in 2015. Lakdim killed two people before giving up most of the hostages, keeping one woman as a human shield, who Lt Col Beltrame traded places with. Police have detained a 17-year-old boy, who was allegedly a friend of Lakdim, in connection with the terror attack. Another woman who was also allegedly connected to the attacker was taken into custody on Friday."

2018-03-24,CCTV has been released of a gang breaking into a house in a terrifying burglary where they dragged around the family's children and squirted an 81-year-old in the face with liquid.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/cctv-shows-men-smashing-through-patio-door-in-terrifying-burglary-11301568,"Described as four stocky white men with Irish accents and in their mid-20s, two of them rang the doorbell while the others went behind bushes. When no one answered, they all went to the rear patio door of the property in affluent Chislehurst, southeast London, and smashed the glass with a crowbar. Piling into the property, one man grabbed an 11-year-old boy from the lounge and dragged him through the hallway to where the rest of the family were sitting. Another squirted an elderly man with liquid, believed at the time to be a corrosive substance. They threatened to harm the family unless they told them where money and jewellery was kept. As three of the gang searched the house, one of them grabbed a teenage girl and dragged her upstairs to find the valuables. Luckily, one of the family was able to dial 999. When the men found out police were on their way they stuffed the girl's schoolbag with jewellery and sped away in a silver Mercedes. The gang all wore matching Converse All Star-style trainers, baseball caps and puffa-style jackets. It happened at an address on Cookham Dene Close on 5 March, at around 6pm. Police believe the men are behind a number of burglaries in the Chislehurst area, including one last month in nearby Keston where a safe was stolen and lifted into a car. All the properties have been broken into through the rear after the door bell was rung. Detective Constable Ben Briselden, from Bromley Burglary Squad, said: ""This was a terrifying burglary where a family were at home enjoying their evening and were threatened, and attacked, by four men who then stole their most valued possessions, which were of great sentimental value.""

The conservation group wants governments to implement policies to tackle the problem, including a ""latte levy"" on single-use drinks cups, and a deposit return scheme to encourage plastic bottle recycling. The predictions for rising plastic use in the UK are based on modelling existing available data and take into account factors such as rising economic output and the impact of new European legislation. This year alone, the UK will use 10.8 billion wet wipes, 16.5 billion pieces of plastic cutlery, 42 billion straws and 4.1 billion single-use drinks cups and lids, the report said. Tanya Steele, chief executive of WWF, said: ""We are polluting our world with plastic, suffocating our oceans and overwhelming our wildlife. ""The amount of plastic which the UK is throwing away is set to rocket by over a million tonnes by 2030 - that's the equivalent of 87,000 more double decker buses worth of plastic waste each year. ""We must act now - banning avoidable single use plastic by 2025 - and introducing incentives to help people and businesses make the right choices to reduce, reuse and recycle."" The report also warned that while plastic waste would rise dramatically without action, recycling rates for plastic would increase more slowly. Less than a third (31%) of plastic waste is recycled, a figure which is expected to rise to 42% by 2030, while single-use plastic recycling rates are predicted to increase from 29% to 37% over the next 12 years. Responding to the report, a Defra spokesman said: ""We want to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it, and we have already taken significant steps to tackle plastic through banning microbeads and taking nine billion plastic bags out of circulation with our 5p charge. ""But we all need to do more, which is why we have committed to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste and recently launched a call for evidence on how changes to the tax system can reduce waste from single-use plastics."" :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

Russia is making final preparations to host the sport's most prestigious tournament with England playing group games against Tunisia, Panama and Belgium in the cities of Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod and Kaliningrad. Given the current political climate between the two countries, the FCO is urging travellers to steer clear of any protests and avoid commenting publicly on political developments while in Russia. ""Due to heightened political tensions between the UK and Russia, you should be aware of the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment at this time,"" warns the official FCO advisory. England fan Max Bell, 25, from Scunthorpe had been planning a ""two-week trip of a lifetime"" with university friends, using public transport to travel across Russia, but has scaled back the itinerary. ""It has been a wrench, trying to work out what to do and where we should stay, but we've made our minds up,"" Max told Sky News. ""We have decided to fly into Lithuania, stay there and drive up to Kaliningrad just for the final group game against Belgium. This was meant to be the trip of a lifetime but we've changed things round now. ""We've watched the news about Salisbury and followed it all closely and this is what we're going to do. ""Of course, if England progress from the group and go a long way into the knockout stages we will have to look at it again."" One report in The Times suggests the Football Association has sold fewer than 2,000 tickets to official supporters for England's group games against Tunisia and Panama, and England does not even register in the top 10 countries for tickets already sold. But one London-based tour operator is adamant that it will be a tournament to remember - for all the right reasons. ""The Russians have been superbly well-organised and extremely hospitable in all our dealings with them,"" said Miles Saward from Sportoptions.com, the UK's largest football and sports operator. ""We attended the Confederations Cup last year and that went very well indeed. As far as we are concerned it's business as usual. There has been no drop off whatsoever. ""This is England at a World Cup Finals and England fans will travel and enjoy the tournament as they always do. ""Russia will want to put on a World Cup to remember and I'm sure they will.""

He is now virtually certain to be elected to the job, since South Yorkshire is a rock-solid Labour stronghold. After Nick Clegg's defeat in Sheffield Hallam last year, all the region's MPs are Labour. Mr Jarvis, 46, had hoped to stay in the Commons as an MP after the mayoral election on 3 May, combine the two roles and campaign in Parliament for a wider devolution deal covering the whole of Yorkshire. But in a controversial move, condemned as ""vindictive"" by Mr Jarvis's supporters, Labour's national executive made a new ruling on Tuesday that MPs should not hold more than one full-time elected post at a time. That means another by-election in Barnsley Central, which Mr Jarvis won with a majority of more than 15,000 at last year's general election. But in the EU referendum in 2016 68.2% voted Leave and only 31.8% Remain. In the selection for Labour's candidate for the new mayor, Mr Jarvis received 2,584 votes, 58% of the votes cast, comfortably defeating his only rival, Sheffield city councillor Ben Curran, who polled 1,903 votes. Thanking party members for selecting him, Mr Jarvis said: ""I am proud to have been chosen, grateful for the opportunity to serve, and pleased to have been part of such a comradely contest; the conduct of our members has been in the best traditions of our Labour movement. ""The election of a mayor comes at a pivotal moment for the Sheffield City Region. ""To make the most of new opportunities, our first mayor will need to work with both local and national government to negotiate the best possible deal for the people of South Yorkshire."" ""Only then will the mayor be able to end the status quo of how decisions are made and how public services are delivered; and use both devolution and cooperative principles to offer a more radical and effective way of serving the public. ""Today's result is a vote of confidence in the platform on which I am standing, and the potential of devolution; first in the Sheffield City Region and then across 'wider Yorkshire'. ""Thank you again to all those who have placed their trust in me. The Labour campaign to make South Yorkshire a stronger and more co-operative community has begun, and I stand ready to serve."" But the decision by Labour's national executives - now firmly in the grip of Jeremy Corbyn and his left-wing allies - forcing him to quit as an MP has been bitterly attacked by current and former Yorkshire MPs and is a huge blow to Mr Jarvis. Before the NEC ruling, Mr Jarvis said: ""If my first act as mayor was to stand down as an MP, I'd be needlessly squandering my ability to inflict pressure on the Government through championing our cause in Parliament. ""I take that responsibility extremely seriously and believe that not only is serving the people of Barnsley compatible with serving people across the region, but that the two roles are complimentary - the delivery of better infrastructure and public services will benefit everyone."" Vindictive move by Lab‚Äôs NEC. Dan clear that being both Mayor of South Yorks & an MP would be temporary in order to pursue the Yorkshire-wide mayor that most people want. Why don‚Äôt the NEC trust the members to choose whether or not to back Dan, rather than try & fix the race? https://t.co/uSXGMMNdQk One of his closest allies, former Barnsley East MP and Shadow Cabinet member Michael Dugher, tweeted after the NEC decision: ""Vindictive move by Lab's NEC. ""Dan clear that being both Mayor of South Yorks & an MP would be temporary in order to pursue the Yorkshire-wide mayor that most people want. ""Why don't the NEC trust the members to choose whether or not to back Dan, rather than try & fix the race?"" John Grogan, Labour MP for Keighley, complained: ""This is like a referee changing the offside rules in the 87th minute of a football match without consulting the Football Association. My understanding is that only party conference can change the rules."" When Mr Jarvis was elected as an MP in 2011 he became the first former Army officer to resign a military commission to contest a parliamentary by-election since the Second World War. He was tipped as a leadership contender in 2015 after Ed Miliband quit after Labour's election defeat, but ruled himself out, saying he wanted to put his family first. At the time, he was recently widowed and was bringing up young children. He has since remarried. He is no fan of Mr Corbyn and the current Labour leadership, who will be glad to see him leave Parliament. He nominated Andy Burnham - now Greater Manchester mayor - in 2015 and backed Mr Corbyn's challenger Owen Smith in 2016."
2018-03-24,Jeremy Corbyn has been criticised by his own MPs over his apparent support for an anti-Semitic mural on a street in east London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-slammed-by-labour-mps-for-criticising-removal-of-anti-semitic-mural-11301595,"The mural, made by street artist Mear One, depicted a group of Jewish financiers and white businessmen playing a Monopoly-style game on a board balanced on the backs of people. Included in the portrait, which was removed by Tower Hamlets Council after a number of complaints were made, also included an activist holding a banner which read: ""The new world order is the enemy of humanity"". Mr Corbyn left a comment on a Facebook post by Mear One, real name Kalen Ockerman, in 2012 after the artist revealed his work was set to be whitewashed. The Labour MP wrote: ""Why? You are in good company. ""Rockerfeller (sic) destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Mr Corbyn's response to the post was highlighted by Labour MP Luciana Berger, who said she had asked the party leader's office for an explanation on Friday. The response from the Spokesperson is wholly inadequate. It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about Antisemitism.  I will be raising this further. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: ""In 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. ""However, the mural was offensive, used anti-Semitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed."" But hours later, Mr Corbyn released another statement, which read: ""In 2012 I made a general comment about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. My comment referred to the destruction of the mural Man at the Crossroads by Diego Rivera on the Rockefeller Center. ""That is in no way comparable with the mural in the original post. I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic. ""I wholeheartedly support its removal. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form. That is a view I've always held."" Luciana won't be alone. I think lots of Labour members will want an explanation for this. https://t.co/alaI1oorjA Fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting said Ms Berger was ""not alone"" in demanding answers. Ian Austin, Labour MP for Dudley North, also tweeted, saying: ""Luciana won't be alone. I think lots of Labour members will want an explanation for this."" Meanwhile, Gavin Shuker, Labour and Co-operative MP for Luton South, said the statement from Mr Corbyn's spokesman ""isn't even an apology"". It isn‚Äôt even an apology. I know this is like screaming into the wind; it‚Äôll make zero difference; but I want to state that this is just so wrong. It‚Äôs impossible to confront anti-semitism in our party if this is the response from the very top. https://t.co/Z1hs7y7Y1u He added: ""I know this is like screaming into the wind; it'll make zero difference; but I want to state that this is just so wrong. ""It's impossible to confront anti-Semitism in our party if this is the response from the very top."" Later, Ms Berger said the response from the Labour leader's office was ""wholly inadequate"". She added: ""It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about anti-Semitism. I will be raising this further."" Mear One denied the mural was anti-Semitic, saying it was about ""class and privilege"" and contained a group of bankers ""made up of Jewish and white Anglos""."

""We agree with ITV and Ant & Dec that it was the correct decision not to broadcast Saturday Night Takeaway this weekend,"" a statement from Suzuki GB said. ""As a car brand we recognise the seriousness of Ant's charge."" The company said it ""completely supports Ant's decision to seek treatment"". ""Suzuki will however continue to sponsor the last two episodes of this series of Saturday Night Takeaway with our current idents,"" it said. ""Suzuki very much supports Dec and ITV's decision to broadcast the shows and as headline sponsors we also want to support the competition winners who have won places on the plane to Florida for the series finale."" McPartlin was charged with drink-driving following his arrest on Sunday, when his black Mini collided with two other cars in Richmond, London. A child passenger in one of the cars - a green Mini - was taken to hospital as a precaution. She is believed to be a three-year-old girl. Others involved were treated at the scene for minor injuries. McPartlin's publicist has said the presenter is taking time out from his TV commitments, while the remaining episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway will be hosted solo by Declan Donnelly. Long-time presenting partner Donnelly said in a statement: ""Whilst I never thought I'd be in this position, after much discussion and careful consideration we've decided that the remaining two shows of this series of Saturday Night Takeaway will go ahead. ""We made a promise to take hundreds of deserving winners to Florida to watch the series finale, and we will honour that. ""Everyone at ITV and the Takeaway team feels we owe it to the audience to complete the series."" In January, McPartlin announced he was divorcing wife and Strictly Come Dancing make-up boss Lisa Armstrong after 11 years of marriage."
2018-03-24,A Pennsylvania school district has placed buckets of rocks in all 200 of its classrooms to be used in the event of a mass shooting. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/buckets-of-rocks-placed-in-pennsylvanian-schools-to-thwart-mass-shootings-11302473,"The Blue Mountain School District in Orwigsburg has also installed security cameras, secured building entrances and fortified classroom doors in an attempt to thwart future attacks. Superintendent David Helsel said: ""We didn't want our students to be helpless victims. ""River stones were my idea. I thought they would be more effective than throwing books or book bags or staplers."" February's massacre of 17 pupils and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, sparked fresh debate in the US about how to prevent school shootings. Hundreds of thousands of Americans joined rallies in Washington and around the world on Saturday calling for tighter gun laws in March For Our Lives protests organised by survivors of the Valentine's Day attack. Superintendent Helsel said the idea of equipping classrooms came from his reading of the active-shooter defence programme known as ALICE - Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate. He said his school board approved the rock buckets before they were put in the classrooms at the district's five schools. Parents in Orwigsburg, about 92 miles northwest of Philadelphia, have been mostly supportive, he said. Robert Conroy, director of organising with gun control group CeaseFirePA, said: ""We should be talking about real reform of gun laws. ""It is so unbelievably tragic that our society has come to a point where schools have to arm themselves with buckets of rocks to defend them against active shooters."""
2018-03-24,"Britain's retailers are facing ""a perfect storm"" that will see businesses squeezed and more corporate failures, according to the UK boss of McDonald's.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180324204918/https://news.sky.com/story/perfect-storm-for-retailers-warns-mcdonalds-boss-11301756,"In an exclusive interview for Sky News, Paul Pomroy said he had made the ""bold decision"" to keep investing in restaurants and staff since Brexit, but said conditions were getting ever tougher. Describing a ""perfect storm of challenges, Mr Pomroy said: ""I am really concerned by the amount of inflation that companies are carrying at the moment. ""Food inflation is running at between 4% and 7% across retail, there's pressure on wage inflation, interest rate movements and now you are seeing businesses becoming less brave in their decision-making. ""They're not making the investment decisions they would normally make and that will affect their business. ""You're seeing that up and down the country - businesses who are failing, and others who are becoming really tight and squeezed."" Mr Pomroy said one of the most important challenges for British businesses was to keep innovating at a time of economic nervousness, but he believes companies that stand still run the risk of being overtaken by new, dynamic rivals. ""You will be able to spot those brands that have listened to their customers and disrupted their own markets,"" he said. ""For retailers, to be successful, you have got to keep changing and look to disrupt the market yourselves before you are disrupted. ""Other people will undercut you, or disrupt the market that you're in. So it's going to be a tough three or four months, and unfortunately there will be closures. We need to make sure we're doing the right things, and be bold in our decision making."" Mr Pomroy has overseen a transformation of restaurant design at McDonald's, with red and yellow plastic furniture replaced by stripped wood, touchscreen tablets and table service. He has introduced a 'gourmet burger' range in an effort to widen the brand's appeal and has also started a delivery service. He also took the decision to offer staff a choice between remaining on a zero-hours contract or switching to full-time jobs (the vast majority have remained on zero-hour deals). Mr Pomroy has also had to deal with a small but high-profile strike that he maintains was to do with a very specific disciplinary issue rather than a reflection of wider working practices. But at its heart, his job is about keeping a lot of customers happy. ""We serve 3.8 million customers a day, and 90% of the population come to us at least once a year,"" said Mr Pomroy. ""We work on lots of scenarios and, at the moment, there's a lot of change on the way. And businesses can only handle so much change."""
2018-03-25,It is tempting to blame the FTSE-100's lurch into correction territory simply on concerns over trade wars between the US and China.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180325222431/https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-unloved-ftse-100-is-lagging-rivals-11301394,"After all, all of the Footsie's European peers have also fallen sharply since it became clear President Trump was going to slap tariffs on a number of Chinese imports, a measure to which Beijing has retaliated overnight. Yet none of the main European indices have fallen to the same extent as the Footsie. The UK's main index has on Friday hit a level last seen on 12 December 2016. By contrast, the Xetra Dax in Germany is merely back to a position it touched earlier this month and the CAC 40 in France at a level where it had been at the beginning of February. Further afield, the main US stock index, the S&P 500, has merely slipped to a point last seen on 12 February, while the Shanghai Composite in China has drifted to a level previously reached on 9 February. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is where it was on 7 March. Only the Nikkei in Japan, which contains a lot of companies that could be at risk in the event of a major trade war between the US and China, has experienced anything approaching the reverses the Footsie has suffered of late - and even it has only fallen to levels last seen at the beginning of October last year. So the Footsie has fallen harder and faster than any of its main international peers. The longer term graph is more pitiful still. At the time of writing, the index is actually lower than its closing value of 6,930 achieved on the final trading day of 1999. In other words, if you had bought a fund tracking the index in the dying hours of the 20th century, you would have absolutely no capital gain to show for the intervening period - although you would still be up on the investment thanks to dividend payments yielding roughly 3% each year. By comparison, the S&P 500 has almost doubled in value, as has the Xetra Dax. Even the sleepy old Nikkei is up almost 9% on its close at the end of 1999. So the FTSE-100 does seem particularly unloved among major stock indices. This was confirmed this week by the influential monthly survey of fund managers, compiled by the stockbroker Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which revealed that pessimism towards UK equities is at an all-time high. A net 42% of investors told BoAML they were ""underweight"" the UK. Not only that, but UK equities were revealed to be the most-favoured ""short"" position among market professionals, which is to say that the UK stock market is the most popular asset for investors to sell in the expectation of further drops in prices. There are a number of reasons why investors are shunning the UK. The most obvious is that the UK economy has the weakest growth prospects of all of the major global economies. That in turn means a lacklustre outlook for profits growth at companies that are particularly exposed to the UK economy. However, the FTSE-100 is an international index, with the companies in it deriving more than half of their earnings from outside the UK. Only about a quarter of earnings enjoyed by FTSE-100 companies are generated in the UK. To that extent, the prospect of trade wars is a concern, particularly with the Footsie being packed with miners like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom rely on Chinese demand to a significant extent. Another factor is Brexit. Some Footsie stocks, particularly some banks and manufacturers that do a lot of cross-border trade with the EU, face a great deal of uncertainty just now. Investors lack clarity over the kind of Brexit deal that the Government will achieve with the EU and, until they have it, they will naturally be cautious about such stocks. Another factor deterring investors from the UK is the possibility of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn pledged to higher personal and corporate taxes and nationalisation of PFI contracts and some utilities. A number of Footsie constituents, including Severn Trent, United Utilities, National Grid and Royal Mail, are among those businesses that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has promised to take into public ownership - a prospect that Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, said last week was frightening investors when combined with the prospect of a hard Brexit. He said: ""Confidence is everything. And every day, I'm hearing of potential investors in this country reaching for their coats. ""Because they're not going to risk putting their money into an economy that soon might face export barriers to its single biggest market, let alone invest in companies, assets and services that could soon be taken over by the state."" The people at the helm of most UK businesses are now at least as worried, if not more so, about a hard-Left Labour government as they are about a hard Brexit. And, accordingly, so are the market professionals who invest in those companies. As Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment officer at wealth manager Tilney Group, put it recently: ""A Labour government is unambiguously bad for capital markets."" One factor particularly worrying investors is the hint of capital controls that prevent investors getting their money out of the country. Mr McDonnell admitted at a fringe meeting at last September's Labour conference: ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? ""I don't think there will be, but you never know, so we've got to scenario-plan for that."" As Iceland discovered, when it imposed capital controls after the financial crisis, people will not invest in your country if they do not think there is a reasonable chance of later being able to get their money out."

His old school friend Vladimir Timoshkov told the BBC on Saturday that Mr Skripal phoned him in 2012 and said he wanted to be allowed to visit Russia. The Russian Embassy has since denied that claim, writing on Twitter: ""Kremlin spox: there was no letter from Sergei Skripal to President Putin to allow him to come back to Russia."" Mr Timoshkov said he lost touch with Mr Skripal after they left school, but that he had contacted Yulia when her father was imprisoned for treason. Kremlin spox: there was no letter from Sergei Skripal to President Putin to allow him to come back to Russia pic.twitter.com/xwXbfAUfUd He told the BBC: ""In 2012 he called me. We spoke for about half an hour. ""He called me from London. He denied he was a traitor."" Mr Timoshkov added that Mr Skripal told him that ""he wrote to Vladimir Putin asking to be fully pardoned and to be allowed to visit Russia. His mother, brother and other relatives were here"". He added that his friend ""regretted"" being a double agent ""because his life had become all messed up"". Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were poisoned with the nerve agent novichok in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March. Theresa May and European Union leaders have blamed the Russian state for the attack but Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement. The incident has caused a major diplomatic row, with the EU recalling its ambassador to Moscow and several EU countries set to follow Britain's suit in expelling diplomats it believes are posing as spies. Russia responded by expelling UK diplomats and shutting down the British Council cultural organisation. Moscow's denial of the letter comes as Russia's ambassador to the UK wrote to Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was recovering in hospital after being exposed to novichok whilst investigating the case. Alexander Vakovenko wrote: ""I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you for your bravery when reacting to the assault on two Russian nationals, Sergei and Yulia Skripal, on 4 March in Salisbury, who I hope will get well soon too. ""Please be assured that Russia has nothing to do with this reckless incident and is ready to co-operate with the British authorities with regard to the investigation both bilaterally and through international organisations."" The bench that Sergei and Yulia Skripal were sitting on when they were discovered unresponsive in Salisbury was taken away for analysis on Friday."

He was one of the first to respond to the nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Alexander Yakovenko, Russia's UK ambassador, wrote: ""I was relieved to hear you were released from hospital and reunited with your family. I wish you full recovery and hope that you will be able to return to your normal life as soon as possible. ""I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you for your bravery when reacting to the assault on two Russian nationals, Sergei and Yulia Skripal, on 4 March in Salisbury, who I hope will get well soon too. ""Please be assured that Russia has nothing to do with this reckless incident and is ready to cooperate with the British authorities with regard to the investigation both bilaterally and through international organisations."" After leaving hospital, DS Bailey, 38, said in a written statement that his experience had been ""completely surreal"". He said: ""People ask me how I am feeling - but there are really no words to explain how I feel right now. ""I have been so very overwhelmed by the support, cards and messages I have received - everyone has been so incredible."" His wife, Sarah, also released a statement that said their world had been ""turned upside down"" and the attack was ""the most traumatic event of our life"". The ambassador's letter strikes a different tone to his news conference in London earlier this week where he hit back at UK government assertions that Russia was behind the nerve agent attack. Mr Yakovenko told reporters that Russia ""can't take British words for granted,"" and accused the UK of having a ""bad record of violating international law and misleading the international community"". The diplomatic fallout from the Salisbury incident on 4 March continues. A ""large number"" of EU countries are set to impose tougher sanctions on Russia after agreeing with the UK claim that the Russian state is to blame. It is understood nations including France, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania are preparing to expel Russian diplomats - or spies posing as diplomats - from their countries. Britain has already expelled diplomats from the London embassy, and Russia has now followed suit. Meanwhile, the bench where the Skripals were found frothing at the mouth and unable to control their bodies has been removed. Police in chemical suits wrapped it in plastic film and used an angle grinder to cut it from the ground, before hauling it into a back of a van. It is being kept as evidence as part of the attempted murder investigation. Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain critical and largely unresponsive in hospital. A court on Thursday approved a request for international chemical weapons experts to take a sample of their blood to check the UK's view that they were poisoned with the novichok nerve agent. The Court of Protection said it was unclear whether they will recover, and if they do their mental capacity could be affected to an unknown degree."

Although the bus-sized spacecraft is most likely to burn up upon re-entry, some scientists fear that debris could survive the atmosphere and land anywhere 43 degrees either side of the equator. Reseachers have warned that a number of the spacecraft's parts - including its dense rocket engines - would be unlikely to burn up, leaving chunks of the craft to crash towards the planet's surface. The not-for-profit Aerospace Corporation predicts that Tiangong-1 will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere on 1 April, Easter Sunday - or three days either side of that date. It assessed that it was most likely for the debris to fall within the extreme edges of the 43 degree bands, leaving the US, southern Europe and the Balkans as the most densely populated areas which could be hit. On its southern band, the debris could fall on cities in Argentina and New Zealand, although the vast majority of the potential surface where debris could land are covered by ocean. The craft - which is operated by the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSE) - has reached the end of its life-cycle in space. It was launched by China's National Space Administration (CNSA) in 2011 as a prototype ahead of the Chinese large modular space station, the core module of which is expected to launch next year. Predicting exactly where any impact locations could occur is beyond astronomer's current technical capabilities, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA stated: ""Given the uncontrolled nature of this re-entry event, the zone over which fragments might fall stretches over a curved ellipsoid that is thousands of kilometres in length and tens of kilometres wide. ""While a wide area could be affected, it is important to point out that a large part of the Earth is covered by water or is uninhabited. ""Hence the personal probability of being hit by a piece of debris from the Tiangong-1 is actually 10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning. ""In the history of spaceflight, no casualties due to falling space debris have ever been confirmed."""

However, now that Astall passed the 12-week mark, the pair decided to go public with the pregnancy. Their announcement follows the news that both Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly were dropped over an advertising campaign by car company Suzuki over McPartlin's drink-driving charge. Donnelly previously announced he would present the two remaining shows of Saturday Night Takeaway by himself. The show was postponed this weekend. McPartlin, 42, was charged with drink-driving following his arrest earlier this month, when his black Mini collided with two other cars in Richmond, London. A child passenger in one of the cars - a green Mini - was taken to hospital as a precaution. She is believed to be a three-year-old girl. Others involved were treated at the scene for minor injuries. McPartlin's publicist has said the presenter is taking time out from his TV commitments, while the remaining episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway will be hosted solo by Declan Donnelly. McPartlin will appear in court on 4 April."

He died on Saturday evening after falling ill at the Thornford Park Hospital secure psychiatric accommodation in Berkshire, according to police. Police added that Pickering was also a suspect in a historical investigation into the 1965 murder of 14-year-old Wakefield schoolgirl Elsie Frost. ""We strongly suspected that Peter Pickering was responsible for her murder,"" said DS Nick Wallen of West Yorkshire Police. ""We had been liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service and it was our expectation that Pickering would be charged in due course. ""His unexpected death clearly means that will no longer happen. We have informed all those involved in the case of this development and we will be liaising with the West Yorkshire Coroner as to what proceedings are now necessary in relation to Elsie Frost's death."" Shirley Boldy was 14 when Pickering abducted, raped and murdered her in Wombwell near Barnsley. A woman in her 60s told a jury how she was also attacked by Pickering shortly before Shirley Boldy's death. The woman told the jury how Pickering lured her to his van before bringing her to a secluded spot and removed her underwear with a knife, handcuffing her and burning her breasts with cigarettes before raping her and telling her he was going to kill her. She said: ""I remain of the fervent belief that whether he has a mental illness or not the man is a monster and wherever he is now that's the right place for him to be."" Pickering was subjected to a hospital order without time limit in 1972 for the manslaughter of Shirley Boldy by reason of diminished responsibility, and had been held in facilities including Broadmoor since that date."
2018-03-25,Two Cambridge University academics who pioneered the use of Facebook data for science say they were approached by Cambridge Analytica to carry out work for the consultancy firm but refused on ethical grounds.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180325222431/https://news.sky.com/story/cambridge-analytica-academics-refused-to-carry-out-unethical-research-11303320,"Dr David Stillwell, the deputy director of The Psychometrics Centre at the University of Cambridge, is credited with leading the way in harnessing the power of big data through social media with his myPersonality project. The personality quiz was started on Facebook in June 2007 in the very early days of the social network when it had a paltry 20 million users. The survey was jointly worked on by fellow Cambridge academic Michal Kosinski who is now assistant professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business. It was extremely successful garnering more than eight million respondents and helping hundreds of psychologists with their scientific research. The team went on to develop even more powerful computer software that could predict personality through social media, including the Apply Magic Sauce prediction application which is still available online. Now it has been revealed that in 2014, fellow Cambridge University Academic Dr Aleksandr Kogan introduced the two men to Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. It proposed to provide funds to Dr Kogan's private company, Global Science Research (GSR), to collect new data from Facebook users. It also proposed that the academics used the methods they had developed with their Apply Magic Sauce app to predict personality scores from GSR's new data. The academics say they refused and raised concerns about the private research with Cambridge University. In an email thread shown to Sky News between the two academics, Dr Kosinski expresses his worries about the work that Dr Kogan was proposing to do. He wrote: ""In my opinion his approach is highly unethical, but I am not sure if it is worth to stir before his plans are actually materialised (e.g. he receives the contract). ""There is a large chance that he will either correct his ways or simply fail to get it anyway."" It is alleged by a whistleblower and former worker of Cambridge Analytica that the work was carried out by Dr Kogan and that the data of 50 million users was harvested - many without consent. It is also alleged that it was used by Cambridge Analytica to micro-target voters in the presidential campaign to elect Donald Trump. Cambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing and says it deleted the data as soon as it was asked to by Facebook. In another document seen by Sky News, Cambridge Analytica claims that Dr Stillwell and Dr Kosinski were ""demanding a licence fee of circa $500,000"" for their services. Dr Stillwell says he did discuss money in the form of research funding which would have gone to the university but that he wasn't ever agreeing to sell Facebook data to the company. He said: ""As you can imagine, accusing a senior colleague of following a 'highly unethical' approach is no small matter, and one that we would not take lightly and would hope to avoid. ""Even now, I have avoided talking publicly to the press about Kogan's actions, given that he remains a Cambridge colleague. ""However, I hope that our character is supported by the evidence that we did not continue with the project and that we raised our concerns with the university once it became clear what Dr Kogan planned to do."" Dr Aleksandr Kogan has not been contactable for comment but has previously stated that he feels he is being ""scapegoated"". He told the Guardian: ""When we initially envisioned doing the project with SCL, we had planned for it to be collaboration with Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell at the Psychometrics Centre ""Even though I very much wanted to work with Michal and David, SCL felt that their position of a fee of $500,000 for the modelling portion of the project was not warranted. And so SCL asked me to remove Michal and David from the project."""

""This thing wants to kill you 10 different ways,"" said Mr Hughes, who said the crash left him with an aching back. The daredevil blasted off shortly after 3pm local time with no countdown or fanfare. Mr Hughes reached an estimated 350mph before activating his parachute. He was forced to deploy a second chute as his rocket, emblazoned with the words ""research flat earth"", was falling too fast. The daredevil landed bluntly with the rocket's nose breaking in two places - as it was designed to do. ""Am I glad I did it? Yeah. I guess,"" he said. ""I'll feel it in the morning. I won't be able to get out of bed. At least I can go home and have dinner and see my cats tonight."" Mr Hughes uses his Facebook page to address those who doubt his rocket-making skills and his theory that the Earth is flat. ""Do I believe the Earth is shaped like a Frisbee? I believe it is,"" he said in one video. ""Do I know for sure? No. That's why I want to go up in space."" Mr Hughes had converted a mobile home into a ramp and worked on the rocket in his garage. The launch had been scheduled for November last year, but issues over land management and mechanical problems pushed the date back. Saturday's event was at risk but Mr Hughes pushed on despite his rocket losing steam and high winds. ""I'm tired of people saying I chickened out and didn't build a rocket. I'm tired of that stuff. I manned up and did it,"" he said. A video of the launch was filmed by Noize Tv and uploaded to Mr Hughes's Facebook page. A shorter clip, which features a countdown set to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, has been uploaded to YouTube. As hype around the experimental launch mounted, retired NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger told reporters he hoped Hughes ""doesn't blow something up"". Mr Linenger, who orbited the globe more than 2,000 times during four months in 1997, added: ""Rocketry, as our private space companies found out, isn't as easy as it looks."" Mr Hughes has a Gofundme page set up to raise money to help with his expenses. At the time of writing, it had raised $110 (¬£78) out of a $10,000 (¬£7,070) goal over the course of a month. The Saturday launch is ""a wild stunt designed to raise awareness for my ultimate challenge, THE space launch,"" Mr Hughes explains on the money-raising site. He wants to build a ""Rockoon,"" a rocket that is carried into the atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon, then separated from the balloon and lit. This rocket would take Hughes about 68 miles up. Mr Hughes says he previously built and launched a rocket in Arizona which saw him travel 419 metres (1,374ft) high. He collapsed after that landing and needed three days to recover. His next challenge? Mr Hughes says he will be applying to run for governor of California."
2018-03-25,"The official Brexit campaign ""cheated"" by breaching spending limits ahead of the EU referendum, a whistleblower has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180325222431/https://news.sky.com/story/whistleblower-claims-vote-leave-cheated-during-brexit-campaign-11303263,"The allegations centre around Vote Leave's links to the BeLeave campaign which it helped fund. Shahmir Sanni, who worked with Vote Leave, claims the group used BeLeave to get around strict spending limits set by the Electoral Commission. It is a breach of electoral law for different campaign organisations to co-ordinate with each other unless they operate under a shared spending cap. The campaign has strongly denied wrongdoing and said the ¬£625,000 donated to BeLeave was within the rules. Mr Sanni told Channel 4 News: ""I know that Vote Leave cheated, I know that people have been lied to and that the referendum wasn't legitimate."" Mr Sanni has also accused senior Vote Leave figure Stephen Parkinson, now Theresa May's political secretary, of ""outing"" him in a statement in which he disclosed the pair had been in a relationship for 18 months. In that statement, Mr Parkinson said: ""That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement, and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him, but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups. ""I had no responsibility for digital campaigning or donations during the referendum, and am confident that Vote Leave acted entirely within the law and strict spending rules at all times."" Mr Sanni went to the Electoral Commission with two other pro-Brexit friends who claim they helped the Vote Leave campaign two years ago. Their lawyers have given the election watchdog signed statements. Mr Sanni told the broadcaster he was initially a Vote Leave outreach volunteer but he was then assigned to BeLeave. Vote Leave said it did not recall Mr Sanni working as a volunteer, but he was ""like hundreds of others who occasionally visited the offices"". Mr Sanni said that he and BeLeave's co-founder Darren Grimes always reported to Mr Parkinson. He said: ""There was no time where anything BeLeave did didn't go through Stephen."" In the final 10 days of the referendum campaign, Vote Leave donated ¬£625,000 to Mr Grimes, who was registered as a permitted participant. The money was used to pay Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ (AIQ), Channel 4 News reported. Asked whether they could have refused to spend the money on AIQ, Mr Sanni said: ""We didn't ever feel like we had that level of control."" He claimed: ""In effect they used BeLeave to over-spend, and not just by a small amount. ""Almost two-thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn't legal."" Following the Channel 4 interview, Mr Parkinson said he was ""saddened"" by the ""factually incorrect and misleading"" statements by Mr Sanni and his lawyers. He said: ""At the relevant time during the referendum period, the commission advised Vote Leave that it was permissible to make a donation in the way it proposed to do to BeLeave. ""Twice since the referendum the commission has investigated this matter, and twice it has found no evidence of wrongdoing. A third investigation into the same issue is currently taking place."" Mr Grimes also denies all the allegations. A Vote Leave spokesman said it had ""twice been cleared on this matter by the Electoral Commission"". Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the allegations were ""very serious"", adding: ""The leaders of Vote Leave are senior cabinet ministers. We need answers about what really went on."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""These allegations must be examined by the police. If they represent what happened it is outrageous and shameful."" An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: ""The commission has a number of investigations open in relation to campaigners at the EU Referendum; it does not comment on live investigations."""
2018-03-25,A police officer who took the place of a hostage during a terror attack at a French supermarket married his partner while on his death bed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180325222431/https://news.sky.com/story/france-terror-attack-hero-policeman-married-hours-before-he-died-11303626,"Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame voluntarily swapped himself for a female store worker during Friday's siege. The 44-year-old officer died in hospital from his injuries after being shot three times by radical Islamist Redouane Lakdim in Trebes, southwest France. A mass was held, paying tribute to the victims of the attack. It has emerged that hours before his death Lt Col Beltrame married his partner Marielle in a ceremony at a hospital in Carcassonne. According to reports, the couple had been planning a church wedding in June after they met during a tour of an abbey in France in 2016. Father Jean-Baptiste said the couple had spent some 30 hours preparing for their marriage ceremony. He said: ""I gave him the sacrament of marriage, and the sacrament of the sick."" Ladkim, 25, was shot dead by police after Lt Col Beltrame left his mobile phone on so colleagues could hear what was happening inside the supermarket. A national tribute is to take place at a later date for Lt Col Beltrane, who President Emmanuel Macron said had ""died a hero"" and deserved ""the respect and admiration of the whole nation"". The officer's brother, Cedric, said he had given his life ""for strangers"" and knew he had ""almost no chance"" of surviving. ""he did not hesitate one second,"" Mr Beltrame told RTL radio. ""He did what needed to be done and thanks to him, many lives were saved and yes, I think the word hero is very appropriate."" The officer's mother, who has not been named, said she was ""not surprised"" by her son's actions, saying: ""He's always been like that."" ""It's someone, since he was born, who gives everything for his homeland."" Mr Macron said of Lt Col Beltrame: ""In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""saddened"" by the officer's death, adding: ""His sacrifice and courage will never be forgotten."" Britain's ambassador to France, Ed Llewellyn, also paid tribute, saying Lt Col Beltrame ""gave his life to save the lives of others"" and was ""truly a hero"". Samia Menassi, the manager of the supermarket targeted in the attack, said her colleague who was swapped for Lt Col Beltrame during the siege was in a ""catastrophic state"". Lt Col Beltrame, who joined France's elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had reportedly organised a training session last December to prepare for hostage situations. Mr Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how Morocco-born Lakdim obtained his weapon and how he became radicalised. Lakdim was known to police for petty crimes and drug dealing and had been on a watch list from 2014, according to France's prosecutor Francois Molins, but he was not believed to be preparing any terrorist acts. Islamic State has claimed the atrocity was in response to its call to target Western enemies. Lakdim hijacked a car in the city of Carcassonne - seriously wounding the driver and killing the passenger - before driving toward Trebes. He shot at police officers before hiding in the supermarket, taking several people hostage. During the resulting stand-off with police, Lakdim demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam - the only surviving member of the Islamic State cell that attacked Paris in 2015. Lakdim killed two people before giving up most of the hostages, keeping one woman as a human shield, who Lt Col Beltrame traded places with. Police have detained a 17-year-old boy, who was allegedly a friend of Lakdim, in connection with the terror attack. Another woman who was also allegedly connected to the attacker was taken into custody on Friday."
2018-03-25,"A ring-fenced tax solely for the NHS and social care has the backing of the public, Jeremy Hunt has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180325222431/https://news.sky.com/story/public-backs-special-tax-for-nhs-health-secretary-jeremy-hunt-says-11303800,"The Health and Social Care Secretary said Britain's ageing population meant more cash was needed for health, adding it was ""vital to be open to innovative models of taxation"" to provide the funding. His claim will be interpreted in some quarters as a prod to his Cabinet colleagues to back the idea. Indeed, Mr Hunt acknowledged the idea could be resisted by Chancellor Philip Hammond because the measure could restrict his flexibility over how to use tax revenue. :: 3,000 new midwives to 'transform hospital safety' Mr Hunt stressed he had not totally made up his mind on the idea, but told the Mail on Sunday: ""The British people say, 'I don't mind more money going to the NHS but I want to know it is for the NHS and won't be wasted.'"" The Sunday Times reports that Prime Minister Theresa May will back extra spending on the NHS and quotes a senior Cabinet source as saying a special tax is ""still on the table"". A multi-billion pound funding increase announcement could be timed to coincide with the health service's 70th anniversary in July, it has been suggested. But speaking later to ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Hunt said it was ""premature"" to speculate the NHS was set for a short-term funding increase, stressing a structured approach was needed. A full departmental spending review will happen next year and Mr Hunt wants health to be treated differently, with a longer-than-usual 10-year settlement put in place. Mr Hunt acknowledged ""that isn't government policy"" but ""given that it takes seven years to train a doctor and three years to train a nurse, you need to have something that gives you the ability to look ahead"". Mr Hunt also indicated the tax could avoid another social care funding fiasco, after the Conservatives were forced to perform a u-turn on reforms to the system that were dubbed a ""dementia tax"" by opponents. Admitting ""we got our fingers burned"" on the issue in the General Election, he told the Mail: ""It is beyond dispute that with a million more over-75s in 10 years' time, the NHS and social care system are going to need more money. ""The public are very clear that for that specific issue they are willing to pay more tax but want to know that every penny is going to be spent wisely."" When asked if the attraction of such a tax was that it would guarantee money for the elderly and infirm, Mr Hunt said: ""Absolutely. That is the attraction."" Raising income tax by 1p could generate around ¬£5bn to help fund health and social care. A Sky Data poll last year found that more than two-thirds of the public would back an increase in income tax if the money was dedicated to the NHS. But Mr Hunt acknowledged there could be resistance from the Treasury, which ""does not like it because it takes it out of their hands""."

Dr Poulter, who was first elected in 2010, said the five months since the claims were made had been ""incredibly difficult for me and have at times taken a considerable toll on my health"". He said: ""I am pleased although entirely unsurprised that, after five months, I have finally been exonerated of any misconduct or inappropriate behaviour. ""The allegations brought against me were false and scurrilous. ""I have no idea why a fellow Conservative MP should have irresponsibly sought publicity by attaching his name to these claims in a newspaper article."" Dr Poulter said his lawyers were pursuing legal action against the Sunday Times over the allegations. He also called for the way the Conservative Party investigates such claims to be reformed, saying the process should be able to separate ""smears"" from valid complaints. Dr Poulter said: ""I appreciate that the committee left no stone unturned in investigating these unsubstantiated complaints against me. ""It is absolutely right that the Conservative Party wants an exemplary complaints process. ""Such a process is plainly vital in any modern workplace and I know the system constructed in haste by the Conservative Party last year, is already under regular review. ""That review process must ensure that the system evolves to become able to separate unsubstantiated hearsay or smears, from valid complaint which genuinely require investigations. ""I believe this needs to be addressed in the interests of everyone working in Parliament and for the Conservative Party."" A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""A thorough and impartial investigation of a complaint took place and a panel chaired by an independent QC found there was insufficient evidence to support the complaint. ""We will thoroughly investigate all allegations of code of conduct breaches and encourage complainants to come forward, on a strictly confidential basis."""

It comes after 25 England supporters were held on Thursday amid ugly scenes before the team's friendly win over the Netherlands. Amsterdam Police said ""mostly drunken"" fans had thrown beer bottles towards officers and a mobile unit was deployed as ""unrest by the English supporters grew larger in the city centre"". Deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, the NPCC's lead for football policing, told Sky News: ""Last night resulted in the largest number of arrests for a single game we have seen for several years and, unfortunately, it follows a worrying trend observed at recent fixtures. ""It also brings into question the wisdom of having this game in Amsterdam on a Friday night. ""The police were not consulted before the fixture was announced and we would have raised significant concerns had we been. ""We had a large contingent of UK officers in Amsterdam working with the Dutch police and we will now conduct an investigation to seek banning orders against those responsible. ""The behaviour of a large number of England supporters was appalling; it was witnessed by our officers and any attempts to downplay it are wide of the mark. ""The sad fact is that the drunken mob's behaviour reinforces the negative stereotype of England supporters, and will impact on the treatment all fans can expect when they follow the team abroad."" Amsterdam Police said 102 people were arrested on Friday, including ""100 Englishmen"" and two Dutch fans. Thirty five of those arrested spent the night in cells and 94 were fined, police said. Eight people were still being questioned ""mainly for violence against the police"", the force added. England manager Gareth Southgate had urged supporters to behave on the eve of Friday's friendly and criticised fans who booed the Dutch national anthem before the game. ""I heard some of the booing of the anthem which obviously isn't acceptable,"" Southgate said. Football Supporters' Federation chief executive Kevin Miles said: ""England fans have worked hard over the last decade or so to improve their reputation and disorder has become a rarity. ""It is not in the interests of the regular England followers for the anti-social behaviour to creep back in as it will inevitably impact on how we are received and treated by host police forces elsewhere."" The trouble in Amsterdam comes a year after unsavoury scenes marred England's friendly against Germany in Dortmund. Then, two people were caught making Nazi gestures, prompting the England Supporters Travel Club to hand out lifetime bans for the first time. A total of 27 members were suspended for their behaviour in Dortmund. England fans are preparing to travel to Russia for the World Cup this summer after violent clashes between the two countries' supporters at Euro 2016 in France. An FA spokesman said: ""We condemn the unacceptable scenes in Amsterdam. As was reiterated ahead of the fixture, we always urge supporters to respect our hosts and behave in a responsible manner. ""As ever, the FA will work in partnership with the UK Football Policing Unit to help identify those involved and we will sanction any England Supporters Travel Club member found to be responsible for disorder."""

Russia is making final preparations to host the sport's most prestigious tournament with England playing group games against Tunisia, Panama and Belgium in the cities of Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod and Kaliningrad. Given the current political climate between the two countries, the FCO is urging travellers to steer clear of any protests and avoid commenting publicly on political developments while in Russia. ""Due to heightened political tensions between the UK and Russia, you should be aware of the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment at this time,"" warns the official FCO advisory. England fan Max Bell, 25, from Scunthorpe had been planning a ""two-week trip of a lifetime"" with university friends, using public transport to travel across Russia, but has scaled back the itinerary. ""It has been a wrench, trying to work out what to do and where we should stay, but we've made our minds up,"" Max told Sky News. ""We have decided to fly into Lithuania, stay there and drive up to Kaliningrad just for the final group game against Belgium. This was meant to be the trip of a lifetime but we've changed things round now. ""We've watched the news about Salisbury and followed it all closely and this is what we're going to do. ""Of course, if England progress from the group and go a long way into the knockout stages we will have to look at it again."" One report in The Times suggests the Football Association has sold fewer than 2,000 tickets to official supporters for England's group games against Tunisia and Panama, and England does not even register in the top 10 countries for tickets already sold. But one London-based tour operator is adamant that it will be a tournament to remember - for all the right reasons.

""It paints a fairly stark picture and sends a massive warning to the Government that they need to sort this out,"" said Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance. ""If a committee that knows about money is telling you that there isn't enough money in the system, then they need to look at levels of funding. Politicians, parents and providers are all in agreement."" The committee also found that funding figures put out by the Government regarding the policy are ""misleading and out of date"". ""One estimate is of a shortfall of ¬£157m a year,"" said Rushanara Ali MP, who sits on the committee. ""We want the Government to make it affordable, to provide the nursery places that it wants to see provided. The system works for some people, but not for enough people. ""I think the policy is well-intentioned but as with some policies, you can get unintended consequences."" Parents are also being asked to pay for things that were previously free, such as food and activities, and cutbacks have been made in higher qualified staff, the study found. ""What I have chosen to do is just to charge a very small amount and say to parents 'this is voluntary and I hope you will support us' and they have all chosen to do that,"" said Janet Blann, who manages the Northfield Quaker Pre-School in Birmingham. ""It's affordable to all parents but it can make a difference of around ¬£1,000 a term to us and that's worth having."" The report said the Government had put out ""misleading"" and ""out of date"" figures regarding how much it provides in funding per hour because it included money intended for other schemes, or failed to take into account things like the introduction of the National Living Wage. The study said: ""The most recent estimate of the average cost per hour of providing childcare is ¬£4.68. The average rate that the Government actually passed on to providers for 2017-18 was ¬£4.34, meaning some providers will receive less funding than the costs they incur."" The MPs urged the Government to keep the childcare voucher scheme open until winners and losers of discontinuing it are known."

Increasingly unsettled conditions are expected later on Monday and into Tuesday as a frontal system from the west brings a spell of heavy rain followed by lower temperatures by Wednesday. The Met Office's Laura Paterson said; ""The evolution of this system during the middle of next week is uncertain but it does appear increasingly likely to herald the start of another cold spell for many parts of the UK. ""Despite uncertainty regarding the timing and onset of this change, the signal that colder conditions will develop into the Easter weekend has remained consistent."" Forecasters are not expecting the cold spell to cause the major travel disruption that brought chaos to the country in February and March. A second spell of freezing temperatures hit the UK last weekend. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""It's being dubbed as the Beast from the East Mark 3, but as with most trilogies, the third edition is never as good! ""At the moment the exact details for the Easter weekend are uncertain but it looks like from Wednesday onwards colder conditions and spells of snow are likely. ""The snow will be mainly across central and northern areas of the UK, and mostly across the high ground but there is the chance of snow to low levels of these areas too which may lead to some disruption. ""However, it's not expected to be as extreme as the last couple of cold wintry spells we've experienced recently due to the sun being stronger this time of the year and we're also are a lot further into spring now. ""The ground is also warmer so snow may not settle in all areas it falls."" Economists have said the extreme weather in the February and March, which came from the east, could hit economic growth for the first three months of the year because of disruption to transport which meant lost work days and fewer people shopping. :: UK weather: The latest Sky News forecast"

The mural, made by street artist Mear One, depicted a group of Jewish financiers and white businessmen playing a Monopoly-style game on a board balanced on the backs of people. Included in the portrait, which was removed by Tower Hamlets Council after a number of complaints were made, was an activist holding a banner which read: ""The new world order is the enemy of humanity"". Mr Corbyn left a comment on a Facebook post by Mear One, real name Kalen Ockerman, in 2012 after the artist revealed his work was set to be whitewashed. The Labour MP wrote: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller (sic) destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Labour MP Luciana Berger, head of Jewish Labour, said the Labour leader's response to the row was ""wholly inadequate"" and failed to grasp ""on any level the hurt and anguish felt about anti-Semitism"". The response from the Spokesperson is wholly inadequate. It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about Antisemitism.  I will be raising this further. Mr Corbyn has been criticised in some quarters for expressing ""sincere regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"", rather than issuing an apology. The full statement read: ""In 2012 I made a general comment about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech.

He continued: ""He's accepted that he didn't look at it properly, it is anti-Semitic and it should be removed, he couldn't be clearer about it."" Mr Watson, who is also shadow culture secretary, said it was a ""horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down"".

2018-03-25,Three thousand extra midwives are to be trained over the next four years in the largest-ever increase of maternity staff in England.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180325222431/https://news.sky.com/story/thousands-of-new-midwives-to-be-announced-11303509,"The plans will be announced on Tuesday and will include the introduction of a ""continuity of carer"" model, which will see expectant mothers treated by the same midwives throughout their pregnancy. The changes to England's maternity services will start with a target of one in five women benefitting from the model by March next year. By 2021, the majority of pregnant women will be receiving care from the same midwives throughout their pregnancy, labour and birth. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to say: ""There are few moments in life that matter more than the birth of a child, so the next step in my mission to transform safety standards is a drive to give mums dedicated midwives, who can get to know them personally and oversee their whole journey from pregnancy to labour to new parent."" The Government said research shows that women who use the model are 19% less likely to miscarry, 16% less likely to lose their baby and 24% less likely to have premature birth. In order to recruit the extra midwives, the Government will work with industry bodies to develop new routes into the profession. Some 650 more will begin training in 2019, with increases of 1,000 planned in following years. A newly-qualified midwife will start with a salary of ¬£24,907 by 2020/21 - a 12.6% rise from the current starting salary. Royal College of Midwives chief executive and general secretary Gill Walton said: ""This is a very long overdue acknowledgement by the Government that England's maternity services need more midwives. ""The RCM has been campaigning to get successive governments to eradicate the midwife shortage for well over a decade."" But the plans were ""ambitious"", she warned, adding: ""The additional midwives who start training next year won't be qualified midwives working in our maternity services until 2022. ""That will make a difference and it will begin to have an impact on the workload of midwives, but it will not transform maternity services right now. ""It will take seven or eight years before all of the new midwives announced today will be actually working in our maternity services."""

But it would be difficult to walk past the 84 sculptures standing on top of the This Morning studios and ITV's headquarters on London's South Bank without noticing. They are part of a campaign by CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably) to start a conversation about male suicide in a bid for improved suicide prevention and bereavement support.

They are from different backgrounds, of different ages and races, but what many of them have in common is that they tried to keep their struggles from those close to them.

At least 64 people died and many others are missing, while a search is under way for the security guard. Children are thought to be among the dead, local media said. Parents of missing youngsters have been posting pictures in an attempt to find them. Pictures broadcast on Russian television showed people leaping from the windows of the Winter Cherry mall, which was engulfed in black smoke. Health minister Veronika Skvortsova said an 11-year-old boy was being treated in hospital after jumping from the fourth floor. His parents and younger brother died in the fire. A 12-year-old girl, Viktoria 'Vika' Pochankina, became trapped in the mall's cinema while watching a film with classmates, the Siberian Times said. When her aunt Evgenia called her, Vika said: ""Everything is burning, the doors are blocked. I can't go out, I can't breath."" Before the call ended, Vika reportedly added: ""Auntie, tell all my family I love them, tell mum that I loved her."" During a televised briefing, emergency situations minister Vladimir Puchkov did not confirm how many children were among the dead. He said six of the bodies were yet to be recovered. Shopper Ivan told the Siberian Times he had been at an indoor ice rink with his children. ""As we rushed out of the building, I saw a teenager falling out of a window,"" he said. ""'There was no fire alarm, no automatic fire extinguishing."" People are said to have taken refuge in the toilets, sealing gaps around the door with wet clothes. Firefighters said up to 11 people were believed to be missing. The Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes in Russia, said 10 people were being treated in hospital. It added that 44 had sought medical treatment in all. Four people, including one of the mall's tenants, have been held for questioning. The committee did not comment on the cause of the fire.

2018-03-26,It is tempting to blame the FTSE-100's lurch into correction territory simply on concerns over trade wars between the US and China.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180326215512/https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-unloved-ftse-100-is-lagging-rivals-11301394,"After all, all of the Footsie's European peers have also fallen sharply since it became clear President Trump was going to slap tariffs on a number of Chinese imports, a measure to which Beijing has retaliated overnight. Yet none of the main European indices have fallen to the same extent as the Footsie. The UK's main index has on Friday hit a level last seen on 12 December 2016. By contrast, the Xetra Dax in Germany is merely back to a position it touched earlier this month and the CAC 40 in France at a level where it had been at the beginning of February. Further afield, the main US stock index, the S&P 500, has merely slipped to a point last seen on 12 February, while the Shanghai Composite in China has drifted to a level previously reached on 9 February. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is where it was on 7 March. Only the Nikkei in Japan, which contains a lot of companies that could be at risk in the event of a major trade war between the US and China, has experienced anything approaching the reverses the Footsie has suffered of late - and even it has only fallen to levels last seen at the beginning of October last year. So the Footsie has fallen harder and faster than any of its main international peers. The longer term graph is more pitiful still. At the time of writing, the index is actually lower than its closing value of 6,930 achieved on the final trading day of 1999. In other words, if you had bought a fund tracking the index in the dying hours of the 20th century, you would have absolutely no capital gain to show for the intervening period - although you would still be up on the investment thanks to dividend payments yielding roughly 3% each year. By comparison, the S&P 500 has almost doubled in value, as has the Xetra Dax. Even the sleepy old Nikkei is up almost 9% on its close at the end of 1999. So the FTSE-100 does seem particularly unloved among major stock indices. This was confirmed this week by the influential monthly survey of fund managers, compiled by the stockbroker Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which revealed that pessimism towards UK equities is at an all-time high. A net 42% of investors told BoAML they were ""underweight"" the UK. Not only that, but UK equities were revealed to be the most-favoured ""short"" position among market professionals, which is to say that the UK stock market is the most popular asset for investors to sell in the expectation of further drops in prices. There are a number of reasons why investors are shunning the UK. The most obvious is that the UK economy has the weakest growth prospects of all of the major global economies. That in turn means a lacklustre outlook for profits growth at companies that are particularly exposed to the UK economy. However, the FTSE-100 is an international index, with the companies in it deriving more than half of their earnings from outside the UK. Only about a quarter of earnings enjoyed by FTSE-100 companies are generated in the UK. To that extent, the prospect of trade wars is a concern, particularly with the Footsie being packed with miners like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom rely on Chinese demand to a significant extent. Another factor is Brexit. Some Footsie stocks, particularly some banks and manufacturers that do a lot of cross-border trade with the EU, face a great deal of uncertainty just now. Investors lack clarity over the kind of Brexit deal that the Government will achieve with the EU and, until they have it, they will naturally be cautious about such stocks. Another factor deterring investors from the UK is the possibility of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn pledged to higher personal and corporate taxes and nationalisation of PFI contracts and some utilities. A number of Footsie constituents, including Severn Trent, United Utilities, National Grid and Royal Mail, are among those businesses that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has promised to take into public ownership - a prospect that Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, said last week was frightening investors when combined with the prospect of a hard Brexit. He said: ""Confidence is everything. And every day, I'm hearing of potential investors in this country reaching for their coats. ""Because they're not going to risk putting their money into an economy that soon might face export barriers to its single biggest market, let alone invest in companies, assets and services that could soon be taken over by the state."" The people at the helm of most UK businesses are now at least as worried, if not more so, about a hard-Left Labour government as they are about a hard Brexit. And, accordingly, so are the market professionals who invest in those companies. As Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment officer at wealth manager Tilney Group, put it recently: ""A Labour government is unambiguously bad for capital markets."" One factor particularly worrying investors is the hint of capital controls that prevent investors getting their money out of the country. Mr McDonnell admitted at a fringe meeting at last September's Labour conference: ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? ""I don't think there will be, but you never know, so we've got to scenario-plan for that."" As Iceland discovered, when it imposed capital controls after the financial crisis, people will not invest in your country if they do not think there is a reasonable chance of later being able to get their money out."

Cobden, who owns a car storage business, was also banned from driving for two years and ordered to take an extended retest. The 39-year-old's teenage passenger was not wearing a seatbelt as he drove at 50mph in the Ferrari F50. The supercar ""accelerated uncontrollably"", smacked into a fence post, and then launched into the air. The pair were thrown from the vehicle during the crash at Cobden's business premises in North Warnborough, Hampshire. Judge Keith Cutler criticised Cobden for not making the boy wear a seatbelt. He said: ""Knowing that he had no seatbelt on, you drove far too fast, even demonstrating a lack of due care as you drove off from the concrete apron on to the road."" He continued: ""You decided to put your foot down, the Ferrari was unnecessarily in second gear, it could have been in first gear, and you put your foot down in order to provide a thrill for Alexander. ""You were showing off, that is the explanation for the accident and its consequences. ""In accelerating such a powerful vehicle, you lost control of it. ""Your evidence was that while you were experienced in driving such cars, the surge of power took you by surprise."" He added: ""Nothing that this court can do can bring Alexander back to his mother and father and his family. ""Nothing that I can do can properly reflect or compensate that loss of his young life."" Charles Gabb, prosecuting, said: ""The parents wish it to be known they simply find it impossible to turn into words the level, the extent of grief they feel. ""Words on a piece of paper will not do justice, they feel, to the depth of their despair at Alexander's loss."" Robin Sellers, defending, said that his client had ""exhibited significant remorse"". Justin Smith, who supplied car batteries to Cobden, had brought his partner Arabella Worth, and her son, Alexander, to make a delivery on the day of the accident. Cobden told the court during his trial he looked after 160 cars, including a ¬£22m Ferrari Nart Spyder, and that he knew how to ""handle performance cars properly"". He offered to take the teenager for a ride after Mr Smith asked if they could take a photograph of the F50. Cobden claimed neither had seatbelts on because he ""had no intention of going at anything more than a very low speed and just along the track"". The business owner denied careless driving ahead of his conviction and blamed the crash on a ""latent defect"" in the car. The family of Alexander described him as ""our very special boy"". They said in a statement: ""The outcome of this trial will not bring Alexander back but we hope the media coverage has in some way increased awareness of the fragility of life and the danger of driving powerful cars for however short a journey, and the necessity of adhering to all sensible safety measures."""

He will be sentenced on April 27 at the same court after Tyrone Smith QC, defending, said the presiding judge would need to watch ""troubling"" CCTV footage before passing sentence. Judge Anthony Potter told Brown: ""I'm satisfied there's good reason for adjournment in your case. In the meantime, you will be remanded into custody."" Brown remained calm in the dock at Warwick Crown Court today, having shouted ""this is a f****** kangaroo court"" at an earlier magistrates' court appearance. He was emotionless as he admitted all charges - including two counts of death by dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified, using a motor vehicle without insurance and using a motor vehicle without a licence. Brown's co-accused Gwendoline Harrison, 42, denied charges of perverting the course of justice and common assault at the same hearing today. Corey and Caspar's mother Louise Platt-May, who was with her sons at the time of the tragedy, paid tribute to the boys after their deaths. She said Corey was an ""amazing boy"" who had a passion for football, while younger son Caspar was a ""cheeky little boy"" whose ""smile could light up any room"". The two boys were taken to hospital with severe injuries after being struck down by Brown's black Ford Focus. Casper died a short time later, while Corey was rushed into surgery but also later died. Their mother was unhurt. The boys' aunt Chelsea Platt-May also witnessed the crash in the Stoke area of the city at roughly 2pm on Thursday, February 22. She told Sky News: ""We were all in a row crossing the road, doing our usual checks, double checks, we were all bubbling to go to the park. ""It wasn't until we were about halfway that we noticed that there was a car right next to Corey, and then there was a sound of crushing plastic and the screeching of tyres. ""In that moment of hearing crushing plastic we all froze and it wasn't until we heard a scream that we knew something was wrong. ""I hope - it sounds horrible to say - they didn't suffer and I hope they were going with happy thoughts and not thoughts of pain."""

Shahmir Sanni, a Vote Leave volunteer, has claimed the official Brexit campaign donated money to an independent youth operation in order to get around strict spending limits set by the Electoral Commission. The whistleblower alleges ¬£625,000 was given by Vote Leave to youth group BeLeave in the last two weeks of the referendum period, but that Vote Leave retained control over how the cash was spent - which would represent a breach of electoral rules. Both Mr Parkinson and Vote Leave have strongly denied Mr Sanni's claim they ""cheated"" during the EU referendum. But, Mr Parkinson's response to the allegations has put more pressure on his position in Downing Street, after he revealed how he dated Mr Sanni, who helped BeLeave, at the time of the referendum. Mr Sanni has described Mr Parkinson's revelation of their relationship as ""a vendetta"" and revealed he has had to come out to his family as a result. He also expressed fears for his relatives' safety, who are based in Pakistan where homosexuality is illegal. In a statement released before Mr Sanni's allegations were published by The Observer, Mr Parkinson claimed he gave Mr Sanni ""advice and encouragement"" in the context of their personal relationship. He added: ""I can understand if the lines became blurred for him, but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups."" Mr Parkinson has since added: ""I cannot see how our relationship, which was ongoing at the time of the referendum and which is a material fact in the allegations being made, could have remained private once Shahmir decided to publicise his false claims in this way."" The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mrs May continues to have confidence in Mr Parkinson, who has worked as a political appointee in Downing Street since July 2016. However, a friend of Mr Sanni has called for Mr Parkinson to resign. Chris Wylie, the whistleblower who revealed the alleged breach of Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, is said to have introduced Mr Sanni to Vote Leave. ""He was forced to come out to his mum in the middle of the night because No 10 Downing Street decided it was appropriate to out somebody,"" Mr Wylie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""He [Mr Parkinson] should resign for outing somebody and endangering his family."" Former Cambridge Analytica employee Mr Wylie also claims to have set up Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ (AIQ), which was used by Vote Leave during the EU referendum campaign. Leading Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, who spearheaded the Vote Leave campaign and now sit in Mrs May's Cabinet, have rejected The Observer's claims."

Although the bus-sized spacecraft is most likely to burn up upon re-entry, some scientists fear that debris could survive the atmosphere and land anywhere 43 degrees either side of the equator. Reseachers have warned that a number of the spacecraft's parts - including its dense rocket engines - would be unlikely to burn up, leaving chunks of the craft to crash towards the planet's surface. The not-for-profit Aerospace Corporation predicts that Tiangong-1 will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere on 1 April, Easter Sunday - or three days either side of that date. It assessed that it was most likely for the debris to fall within the extreme edges of the 43 degree bands, leaving the US, southern Europe and the Balkans as the most densely populated areas which could be hit. On its southern band, the debris could fall on cities in Argentina and New Zealand, although the vast majority of the potential surface where debris could land are covered by ocean. The craft - which is operated by the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSE) - has reached the end of its life-cycle in space. It was launched by China's National Space Administration (CNSA) in 2011 as a prototype ahead of the Chinese large modular space station, the core module of which is expected to launch next year. Predicting exactly where any impact locations could occur is beyond astronomer's current technical capabilities, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA stated: ""Given the uncontrolled nature of this re-entry event, the zone over which fragments might fall stretches over a curved ellipsoid that is thousands of kilometres in length and tens of kilometres wide. ""While a wide area could be affected, it is important to point out that a large part of the Earth is covered by water or is uninhabited. ""Hence the personal probability of being hit by a piece of debris from the Tiangong-1 is actually 10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning. ""In the history of spaceflight, no casualties due to falling space debris have ever been confirmed."""

Delivery driver Don Lane, 53, from Dorset, died in January after, his widow said, he had missed three hospital appointments. That prompted the company to seek to ""learn from our mistakes"". DPD said its new arrangements would offer drivers some of the protections of being employed, such as paid annual leave, pension entitlement and sick pay, as well as some of the flexibility associated with being self-employed. It said around 6,000 drivers would be given the chance to move to the new arrangements. The courier company also said it was scrapping its controversial ¬£150 ""breach charge"" for drivers who miss work, as part of a strategic review of its operations. This will be replaced by a ""more consistent and transparent points-based service failure system"". DPD chief executive Dwain McDonald said: ""We recognise that we need to improve the way we work with our drivers. ""While the self-employed franchise scheme has benefited thousands of drivers over the past 20 years, it hasn't moved with the times and needs updating."" The company has appointed Lord Watts, former chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and Iain Wright, the former chairman of the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, as external advisers. DPD said earlier this year that it needed to learn from mistakes after the death of Mr Lane, admitting that he was ""incorrectly charged ¬£150 for not providing services, when in fact he was attending a hospital appointment"" and that it was ""profoundly sorry"". Mr Lane's widow told the Guardian in February that there was a ""constant threat of a fine"" and that he had cancelled three hospital appointments. She said at the time: ""He was putting the company before his own health."""
2018-03-26,The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) will send a team of specialists to Telford to talk to grooming victims and survivors.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180326215512/https://news.sky.com/story/child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-to-hear-from-telford-victims-11304987,"The Truth Project will allow victims to share their experiences in a trusted and supportive environment without being questioned or challenged. The announcement comes amid allegations that hundreds of vulnerable children were targeted in the Shropshire town since the 1980s. The sessions have no legal consequences and the participants will be able to give as little or as much detail as they choose and also make recommendations for change. IICSA chairwoman, Alexis Jay, said: ""It's vital that everyone who wants to participate in the Truth Project has the opportunity to do so. ""I would encourage victims and survivors of child sexual abuse in Telford to get in touch with us. We can promise you that you will be heard, recognised and respected. ""Child sexual abuse can take many different forms and we want to hear from as many victims and survivors as possible. ""We can offer support before, during and after your confidential Truth Project session and you can also make recommendations for change that will feed into the inquiry's recommendations."" Academics and the Sunday Mirror newspaper have claimed up to 1,000 young people may have been abused in Telford. There are intense arguments in the town over what kind of inquiry should now take place into the alleged grooming. The Conservative opposition group on the local council have argued for a Rotherham-style inquiry that should be commissioned locally, rather than the national IICSA - which was set up in 2015 to investigate organisations that have failed to protect children. Dru Sharpling, one of the senior figures on the IICSA, said: ""The Truth Project is a really important part of the inquiry because it allows victims and survivors to come forward and give their accounts to the Truth Project facilitators, or indeed a chair or the panel so they can describe what happened to them. ""That's really important to them, they're supported through that process before and afterwards and, if they do decide to participate, then of course what they say to us - and if they agree - we can use to inform our recommendations going forward. ""It's clearly very important for all victims and survivors in Telford to get the opportunity to come and give their accounts. And, of course, all child sexual abuse must be taken extremely seriously. ""This inquiry is determined to get to the bottom of institutional failure, no matter where child abuse occurs throughout the country."""

Police twice searched a landfill site at Milton near Cambridge last year, with the first lasting 20 weeks and the second lasting seven weeks, but no trace of him was found. It is thought the then 23-year-old may have climbed into a waste bin and been taken away by a bin lorry, with his father Martin fearful that he may have killed himself after learning he was to become a father. He told the Daily Mirror: ""I just can't help thinking this would have weighed on him heavily and he may have actually chosen to get in that bin that night knowing what would happen. ""It's as probable as anything else and it makes it no less heartbreaking."" The paper also reported Suffolk Police are to announce that the inquiry is to be stood down. In December, mother Nicola Urquhart told Sky News that officers had received reports that her son had been murdered. She added: ""We don't believe Corrie was ever at the landfill site, but police seemed so set on that theory that they didn't take the crime reports seriously."" Suffolk Police has previously said that a review of its investigation by East Midlands Police Special Operations Unit had endorsed its conclusion that Mr McKeague had ended up in the waste disposal process."

Rent-to-own companies sell consumers household items - such as appliances, furniture and electronics - through hire purchase agreements. About 400,000 people have rent-to-own debt in the UK. Loans can have an annual percentage rate (APR) as high as 99.9% over the course of three years, as well as punitive late payment fees that add to the original cost, Citizens Advice said. Last week, the FCA told Perfect Home, one the country's biggest rent-to-own retailers, to pay back ¬£2.1m to 37,000 customers, through cash payments and writing off debts. Another retailer BrightHouse, which has also faced a big payout to mistreated customers, told the Treasury Committee's household finance inquiry that about half of its rent-to-buy agreements do not result in the customer owning the product they are paying for. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the City watchdog's interventions show there are ""significant"" problems in the sector. ""The FCA needs to put in place measures to protect people from expensive borrowing and spiralling debts. What can appear to be a lifeline shouldn't become a tripwire. ""The evidence is clear - the cap on the payday lending market secured a much better deal for consumers."" The charity says it is also concerned that affordability checks are not picking up on consumers' ability to keep up with repayments. ""One person we helped was referred to Citizens Advice as she owed more than ¬£9,000 to a rent-to-own provider through 12 hire purchase agreements,"" the charity said. ""She was unable to work due to her long-term health conditions and was struggling to meet other bills such as rent, council tax and food."" Citizens Advice is asking the FCA to provide rules for lenders, including checking proof of income. While many rent-to-own retailers do undertake affordability checks, there are no rules on what those should include."

The officer is currently in hospital with ""serious injuries"", the force added. A number of roads around Demesne Road, the residential street where the incident happened, have been closed off. Footage of the incident showed two police vans and a car blocking Demesne Road as officers get out of the vans, some with riot shields. A man can be seen running down from a terraced house and the officers can be seen backing off as one points a stun gun at him. They get the man on the ground on his back. He can then be seen brandishing what looks like a sword from side to side before one officer uses his baton to subdue and then arrest him. One witness, Haroon, said he saw a man being arrested by officers on Upper Chorlton Road at about 2.50pm, who had been ""attacking the police"". He said the man was carrying a ""3ft tool or sword"" and ran across the road into the front garden of a property on the street. A 23-year-old man has been arrested after a police officer was slashed with a sword in Whalley Range.The incident happened about 1.50pm today (Sunday 25 March 2018) on Demesne Road.The officer is currently in hospital with serious injuries.A number of roads remain closed. ""From there the police tried to stun him because he wasn't dropping the weapon... I don't know if the officer made a successful tase,"" he said. ""He became even more aggressive and ran towards them with the weapon up in the air... from there the officers tackled him, pushed him over and then I think he ran backwards and fell over. ""That is when the officer tried to disarm him, and you could see them using their weapons (batons) and they were hitting him on the legs - and he was not letting go. ""You could see him still hitting back while he was on the floor."" He said the man ""had hit a couple of the officers"", and that he saw them bleeding - one from the lip or nose, and another on top of their head. He said the man was shouting during the incident. Greater Manchester Police confirmed a man was arrested at around 2.10pm on Sunday. The force said the injuries the officer suffered were to the face and back and, although serious, are not thought to be life threatening. The officer has since been discharged from hospital and is now recovering at home."

Mr Sparrowhawk was found drowned in a bath in 2013 at Slade House care and assessment unit in Oxford. He was 18 years old and had suffered an epileptic fit. Ms Colvin, 45, died after being found unconscious next to a communal telephone at Woodhaven Adult Mental Health Hospital in Hampshire in 2012. Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said the ¬£2m fine was justified by the ""terrible consequences"" of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust's actions. The trust admitted two counts of failing to discharge its duty relating to their care. Sentencing at Oxford Crown Court, the judge said the penalty was ""a just and proportionate outcome that marks the seriousness of the Trust's offending, the terrible consequences of that offending, and the other material factors that I have indicated"". The trust must also pay costs. An earlier inquest ruled ""neglect"" had played a part in Mr Sparrowhawk's death. Mr Sparrowhawk's mother, Dr Sara Ryan, who has campaigned for justice for her son, accused the trust of ""arming itself with a range of legal weapons and dirty tricks"". ""No one should die a preventable death in the care of the state,"" she said. ""I'm left thinking if Connor was here now in the shadow of Oxford Crown Court and St Aldates police station, he would say: 'Why mum?' And I would say: 'I don't know, but we've done you proud'."" Paul Spencer, the trust's lawyer, had urged the court to be lenient when fining it due to financial struggles. He said ""lessons had been learned"" across the trust since 2016, with more than 98% of staff having epilepsy training following Mr Sparrowhawk's death. Mr Spencer added that the trust already had a budget deficit of about ¬£1.69m and any fine would have a direct impact on services it provides. The trust was due to be fined ¬£1.75m for Ms Colvin's death but this was reduced to ¬£1.15m after the trust pleaded guilty. It was going to be fined ¬£2.45m for Mr Sparrowhawk's death, but this was reduced to ¬£2m due to the trust turning a corner since his death and was reduced further to ¬£1.333m after a guilty plea, the judge said. Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said the final decision to fine the trust ¬£2m overall was ""just and proportionate"". Dr Nick Broughton, Southern's chief executive, said he wanted to ""apologise unreservedly"". The NHS boss, who was ordered to stand during the final part of the sentencing as an acknowledgement of the trust's failings, said: ""Those mistakes and those failures had dire consequences. Both Connor and Teresa should not have died. ""That is a matter of profound regret to me and the organisation, and I am truly sorry. We let them down and we let their families down."" He said the deaths had ""served as a catalyst for change"". In February Dr Valerie Murphy, the senior psychiatrist responsible for Mr Sparrowhawk's treatment, was suspended for 12 weeks following a medical tribunal. Dr Murphy, who now works in Cork, Ireland, admitted failing to spot warning signs before the teenager died. She admitted that she ""dropped the ball"", which Mr Sparrowhawk's mother said was not ""an acceptable statement to make for a situation that's led to a boy's death""."

Employers with 250 or more workers - believed to total around 9,000 companies - have to submit their medianand mean gender pay gap figures to the Government Equalities Office by 4 April - that is the Wednesday after Easter. The deadline for public sector employers is earlier - Good Friday. According to the Government's database of company data, fewer than half have submitted the required information. Figures that have so far been published by 3,745 such firms show 77.6% have a median gender pay gap in favour of men, 8.3% have none, and 14.1% in favour of women. The legal requirement was issued amid warnings of a lack of progress in tackling the gap - with campaigners warning it could take 100 years to close at current rates. The EHRC said any employer failing to meet the deadline would first receive an enforcement letter. It warned that a further failure to comply would leave the company at the mercy of the courts. EHRC chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: ""The clock is ticking and with just 10 days to go, those who haven't reported really are entering the last chance saloon. ""This is not optional. It is the law and we will be fully enforcing against all companies that do not report.

After infecting the financial institutions' computer networks through spear phishing attacks against their employees, the group arranged for thousands of ATMs across Europe to dispense cash to waiting money mules. It also used the e-payment network to directly transfer money out of the victim organisations and into criminal accounts. In some cases, the criminals modified databases with account information to show certain bank accounts with inflated balances - with money mules again being used to collect this cash. The leader of the organised crime group, whose has been identified as Ukrainian and is known only as Denis K, was arrested in Alicante by the Spanish national police after an international investigation coordinated by Europol. Alongside the mastermind, the hackers who had written the two strains of malware in the attacks - known as Carbanak and Cobalt - as well as the mule networks and the money launderers, were also arrested. The Ukrainian cyber police have released an image of a man whom they identify as being part of the international hacking group. In a statement, the agency said that it believes it has identified all of the members of the group and they are believed to be in the territory of the Russian Federation. Wim Mijs, chief executive of the European Banking Federation, said: ""This is the first time that the EBF has actively cooperated with Europol on a specific investigation. ""It clearly goes beyond raising awareness on cybersecurity and demonstrates the value of our partnership with the cybercrime specialists at Europol. ""Public-private cooperation is essential when it comes to effectively fighting digital cross border crimes like the one that we are seeing here with the Carbanak gang."" After taking the money, the cybercrime group converted the cash into cryptocurrencies, according to Europol. The cryptocurrency was used to purchase assets including properties and vehicles in Spain. Steven Wilson, the head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), said: ""This global operation is a significant success for international police cooperation against a top level cybercriminal organisation. ""The arrest of the key figure in this crime group illustrates that cybercriminals can no longer hide behind perceived international anonymity. ""This is another example where the close cooperation between law enforcement agencies on a worldwide scale and trusted private sector partners is having a major impact on top level cybercriminality."""
2018-03-26,The Children's Commissioner for England says the Government must put youngsters at the heart of the Northern Powerhouse project¬†after a report has shown that children in the North are falling¬†behind their southern counterparts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180326215512/https://news.sky.com/story/children-in-the-north-left-behind-by-southern-counterparts-childrens-commissioner-11304420,"Anne Longfield says children in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber are more likely to go to a poor school, do less well at secondary level, and leave school early. Her report found that a child on free school meals living in Hackney, east London, was three times more likely to go to university than a similar child in Hartlepool. And in London, children on free school meals were 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GCSE grade than those in the North. The report added that over half of the schools serving the North's most deprived communities were below a ""good"" rating because of weak leadership, poor governance and difficulties recruiting staff. Mrs Longfield warned the Government that its Northern Powerhouse promise would not be fulfilled unless ""children are put at the heart of the project"". ""Children growing up in the North love and are proud of the place they live,"" she said. ""They want a future where they live near their family and community and they want jobs and opportunities to rival anywhere else in the country."" She added: ""The Northern Powerhouse and the new devolved mayors provide a once in a lifetime opportunity to drive that ambition. ""While many children in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest Northern kids and those in the South. ""Too many children in the North are facing the double whammy of entrenched deprivation and poor schools. They are being left behind. ""We need to ask why a child from a low income family in London is three times more likely to go to university than a child who grows up in Hartlepool."" Mrs Longfield has recommended improving the North's secondary schools in the most deprived areas as a ""priority"" with a renewed focus on teaching recruitment and leadership. She also called for ""local areas"" to have a plan to ensure children are in apprenticeships, training or education until the age of 18. A Government spokesman said it was investing in schools in the north and in projects that improve pupils' chances from an early age. ""As the Children's Commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do,"" he said. ""Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes ¬£3.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, ¬£12m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home."""

He said the world was united behind the British in a ""powerful message to the Kremlin"". The Russian government hit back, saying Britain's accusations over the nerve agent attack on a former spy in Salisbury ""border on banditry"". Moscow said it would retaliate to the worldwide expulsions in kind in due course. ""The response will be symmetrical. We will work on it in the coming days and will respond to every country in turn,"" a source told Russian news agency RIA. Mr Williamson said the universal backing for Britain was in ""itself a defeat for President Putin"". ""The world's patience is rather wearing thin with President Putin and his actions, and the fact that right across the NATO alliance, right across the European Union, nations have stood up in support of the United Kingdom... I actually think that is the very best response that we could have,"" he said. ""Their (the Kremlin's) intention, their aim is to divide and what we are seeing is the world uniting behind the British stance and that in itself is a great victory and sends an exceptionally powerful message to the Kremlin and President Putin."" :: 'Russia's novichok programme exists, I worked on it' Mr Williamson arrived in the Estonian capital on Sunday for a two-day visit to see British troops who are based there as part of a NATO mission in the Baltic states to deter Russian aggression. He addressed the troops with his Estonian counterpart, Juri Luik, who said Estonia was prepared to stand by the UK just as the UK had stood by his country. Poland's counterintelligence agency, ABW, revealed on Monday it detained a Polish official on Friday called Marek W, over suspicions he collaborated with Russian intelligence services, sending them information about investments integral to Poland. Mr Williamson has been vociferous in speaking about Russian involvement in the attack on double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on 4 March. Earlier this month he said Russia should ""go away and shut up"" when asked how the Kremlin should respond to 23 of its diplomats, thought to be spies, being expelled from the UK over the poisoning. He said: ""What we will do is we will look at how Russia responds to what we have done. It is absolutely atrocious and outrageous what Russia did in Salisbury. We have responded to that. ""Frankly, Russia should go away and should shut up."" He accused Russia of ""ripping up the international rulebook"" to subvert other countries as it continues to increase military expenditure despite its flailing economy. The police officer who was also in hospital with the Skripals after being affected by the nerve agent was discharged on Sunday. On the same day the EU's diplomatic chief, Federica Mogherini, held crisis talks with the bloc's Moscow ambassador, Markus Ederer, after he was recalled to Brussels over the Skripals' poisoning. Before the weekend the EU's 27 leaders unanimously backed the UK's assessment that the Kremlin was to blame for the Wiltshire attack. Last week, chemical weapons inspectors arrived in Salisbury to inspect the scene where the Skripals were found slumped on a bench, as well as all the places they had recently visited. The inspectors were given permission by a London court for blood samples to be taken from the Russian father and daughter so they could confirm the conclusion which the Porton Down military research laboratory came to; that a Soviet-era nerve agent called novichok was used."
2018-03-26,"Jeremy Corbyn is the ""figurehead of an anti-Semitic political culture"" and there are ""no safe spaces"" for British Jews within the Labour Party, a top community leader has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180326215512/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-figurehead-of-anti-semitic-culture-jewish-leaders-11304618,"An unprecedented protest by Jewish leaders will take place outside Parliament on Monday, putting Mr Corbyn under renewed pressure over allegations of Jew hatred within Labour. Jewish community leaders will also deliver a letter to Labour MPs in advance of their weekly meeting. It comes as Mr Corbyn saw an apology for ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" within Labour rejected by Jewish groups. The Labour leader said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused"", but has been told the ""time for words is over"". Jonathan Goldstein, the chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council (JLC), told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: ""We've reached the point as a community to say we've had enough of hearing Jeremy Corbyn opposes anti-Semitism whilst the mainstream majority of British Jews and their concerns are ignored by him and those he leads."" He added: ""The time for words is over and I think the time for action is now important. The reality is that there are no safe spaces online or in meetings for Jewish people within the Labour Party. ""Wherever we go, we are told we act on the instructions of Israel, that Rothschilds run the world, that ISIS is a fake front for Israel, that Zionists are the new Nazis. I'm afraid that it's time for action rather than words."" Claiming Jewish leaders have been ""ignored"" by the Labour leadership since Mr Corbyn's election as party leader in 2015, Mr Goldstein continued: ""This is the first time, in my lifetime, that the Jewish community has felt the need to take to the streets to campaign against the leader of a major political party. ""And, rightly or wrongly, Jeremy Corbyn is now the figurehead of an anti-Semitic political culture based upon obsessive hatred of Israel, conspiracy theories and fake news. ""That is doing great harm, not just to the Labour Party but to Britain in a wider sense."" In his apology, Mr Corbyn revealed he will be meeting representatives from the Jewish community over the coming days, weeks and months to address anti-Semitism concerns. But, Mr Goldstein insisted neither he nor the Board of Deputies of British Jews had received an invitation or have a meeting scheduled with the Labour leader. The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism has also told Mr Corbyn it is ""too late"" for an apology. The Labour leader declined to answer questions about anti-Semitism in Labour as he left his north London home on Monday. In recent weeks, Mr Corbyn has faced questions over his past membership of a Facebook group in which anti-Semitic comments were made. He has also apologised for previously expressing public support for an east London mural that had been ordered to be removed due to anti-Semitic imagery. Mr Corbyn said he did not look ""closely"" at the image before commenting on it on Facebook. On Monday, the Guido Fawkes website revealed the Labour leader is still a member of another Facebook group, titled ""The Labour Party Supporter"", in which members have blamed the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury on Israel or Islamic State. In a joint open letter released on Sunday night, which appears to have prompted Mr Corbyn's apology, the JLC and Board of Deputies expressed concern there is ""a repeated institutional failure to properly address Jewish concerns and to tackle anti-Semitism"" within Labour. The European Jewish Congress (EJC) expressed support for the actions of British Jewish leaders. EJC president Moshe Kantor said: ""It has been abundantly clear for too long that the Labour leadership under Jeremy Corbyn has at best a massive blind spot when it comes to antisemitism, and at worst openly encourages hatred and double-standards against Jews. ""Enough apologies, enough insipid justifications, enough excuses."" Stephen Pollard, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle newspaper, highlighted how the problem of anti-Semitism in Labour has emerged since Mr Corbyn's election in 2015. He told Sky News: ""It's been a consistent pattern of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership that even though he says he's got zero tolerance of anti-Semitism and all other forms of racism, when it comes to action, we're still waiting."" Join us tomorrow. Join in solidarity. Join us. pic.twitter.com/9sFRc1jXvV The protest outside Parliament will come ahead of a weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), where Labour MPs may raise questions about Mr Corbyn's support for the mural. The Labour leader is not expected to attend the meeting. Backbench Labour MPs Liz Kendall and Wes Streeting have revealed they will be attending Monday's protest, while the Jewish Labour Movement have urged party members to ""stand in solidarity"" by joining the gathering outside Parliament. Mr Streeting warned Mr Corbyn he will be ""judged by his actions rather than his words"" as he called for the Labour leader to tell those planning a counter-protest against the Jewish leaders' campaign on Monday that they do not act in his name. He told Sky News: ""We've got a big problem of anti-Semitism and I wish it was confined to pockets of anti-Semitism. ""I think the mealy-mouthed statements we've seen in recent days from Jeremy Corbyn are too little, too late. ""Jewish community organisations have repeatedly warned about the problem of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, as have Labour MPs and peers directly with Jeremy Corbyn. ""To have gotten to this point where Jewish community organisations are organising a protest against the Labour Party outside Parliament underpins the scale of the problem."" A truly terrible day when @BoardofDeputies & @JLC_uk feel the need to write such a letter. No one in @UKLabour should try & minimise or downplay this. I will be showing my solidarity in Parliament Square tomorrow. https://t.co/ynDw8GWhAY Very powerful letter by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council on Labour anti-Semitism row. pic.twitter.com/RF83xuORyZ Meanwhile, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet has urged him to attend the PLP meeting. ""I think if members of the PLP have concerns then obviously he should be encouraged to go along and address that,"" Valerie Vaz, shadow leader of the House of Commons, told the BBC. In his apology, Mr Corbyn said: ""Labour is an anti-racist party and I utterly condemn anti-Semitism, which is why as leader of the Labour Party I want to be clear that I will not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in and around our movement. ""We must stamp this out from our party and movement."" However, journalist Paul Mason - one of Mr Corbyn's strongest supporters - appeared to suggest ""smears"" are being directed at the Labour leader. ""It's a different smear each week but with one aim - to stop radical change + social justice,"" he wrote on Twitter."

Cooper is hired by the Smith family to murder its estranged matriarch for the insurance money, but becomes conflicted over the task when he meets their innocent daughter and the plan falls apart. The play was adapted for the big screen in 2011, with Matthew McConaughey playing the lead role. Bloom said: ""I'm always looking for an opportunity to get back on stage, especially in London, the heart of my home. ""Tracy Letts' Killer Joe is an incredible, adrenaline-fuelled piece of writing, with a dark and gritty character to play. ""It's an interesting comment on a disenfranchised view of the American dream,"" he added. ""Whilst Joe may appear to be simply a killer, I believe Letts' intentions for Joe are far more layered. It's very different from many of the film roles I'm most recognised for."" The Pirates Of The Caribbean star says he is certain the play, which will run at Trafalgar Studios from May, will be a hit. ""After talking it through with director Simon Evans, I know we will create a production that is polarising, entertaining, dark and funny,"" he said. ""The play may be 25 years old this year, but the relationships it portrays, especially between Joe and the innocent girl Dottie, speak so brilliantly to the empowerment we're seeing around the world in 2018. ""It's the perfect time to be bringing this play back to London, and I couldn't be more excited to be part of it,"" he added."

Increasingly unsettled conditions are expected later on Monday and into Tuesday as a frontal system from the west brings a spell of heavy rain followed by lower temperatures by Wednesday. The Met Office's Laura Paterson said; ""The evolution of this system during the middle of next week is uncertain but it does appear increasingly likely to herald the start of another cold spell for many parts of the UK. ""Despite uncertainty regarding the timing and onset of this change, the signal that colder conditions will develop into the Easter weekend has remained consistent."" Forecasters are not expecting the cold spell to cause the major travel disruption that brought chaos to the country in February and March. A second spell of freezing temperatures hit the UK last weekend. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said: ""It's being dubbed as the Beast from the East Mark 3, but as with most trilogies, the third edition is never as good! ""At the moment the exact details for the Easter weekend are uncertain but it looks like from Wednesday onwards colder conditions and spells of snow are likely. ""The snow will be mainly across central and northern areas of the UK, and mostly across the high ground but there is the chance of snow to low levels of these areas too which may lead to some disruption. ""However, it's not expected to be as extreme as the last couple of cold wintry spells we've experienced recently due to the sun being stronger this time of the year and we're also are a lot further into spring now. ""The ground is also warmer so snow may not settle in all areas it falls."" Economists have said the extreme weather in the February and March, which came from the east, could hit economic growth for the first three months of the year because of disruption to transport which meant lost work days and fewer people shopping. :: UK weather: The latest Sky News forecast"
2018-03-26,The adult film star seeking to sue Donald Trump claims she was threatened with violence to stay silent about their alleged affair.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180326215512/https://news.sky.com/story/porn-star-stormy-daniels-threatened-with-violence-over-alleged-trump-affair-11304428,"In a highly anticipated TV interview broadcast on Sunday night, porn actress Stormy Daniels said she was approached by a man in a car park when she sought to sell details of the fling, who told her to ""leave Trump alone"" and ""forget about the story"". The 39-year-old told CBS News' 60 Minutes programme she had unprotected sex with Mr Trump in July 2006 when he invited her to his hotel room after he pulled his trousers down and she spanked him with a magazine. :: Top 10 Daniels claims about her 'affair' with Trump She claims she was threatened when she later agreed to tell her story to a sister publication of In Touch magazine for $15,000 (¬£12,000) in 2011. ""A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story',"" she claimed. ""And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom'."" The model - real name Stephanie Clifford - is seeking to be released from a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement she signed shortly before the 2016 presidential election to stay quiet about the alleged affair. She claims most details have already been revealed anyway but she came on 60 Minutes to ""set the record straight"" as she is ""not okay with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money"". Ms Clifford said she had sex with Mr Trump shortly after the billionaire businessman's wife Melania gave birth to the couple's son Barron, having been introduced to the then reality TV star at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. The actress, then 27, claims she laughed at Mr Trump when he started talking about himself and showed her a magazine cover with his face on. She said to him: ""Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it."" Ms Clifford said she did not think anyone had ever spoken to him like that and she then demanded he gave her the magazine before telling him to ""turn around, drop 'em"". She claims he pulled his trousers down a little bit and ""I just gave him a couple swats"". He then stopped talking about himself, invited her to dinner and she met him at his hotel suite, where they later had sex. She said she did not find him physically attractive and did not want to have sex with him but she did not say no, emphasising ""I'm not a victim"". Ms Clifford added: ""He was like, 'Wow, you - you are special. You remind me of my daughter'. You know - he was like, 'You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you'."" The pair allegedly remained in touch for a year after the encounter, with Mr Trump said to have been keen for Ms Clifford to appear on the US edition of The Apprentice, which he hosted at the time. When the adult film actress asked about his wife and newly born son she claims Mr Trump ""brushed it aside, said 'Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even...we have separate rooms and stuff'"". Mr Trump, then 60, has denied that the affair took place. The US President has not used his favourite method of communication, Twitter, to say anything about Ms Clifford's allegations. His lawyer, Michael Cohen has admitted he personally paid the cash to Ms Clifford, but said that neither Mr Trump nor any of his organisations were part of the transaction. Mr Cohen, who Ms Daniels had implied was behind the threat of harm if she did not ""leave Trump alone"", has hit back, demanding Ms Daniels ""cease and desist"" following her 60 Minutes interview. In the letter, Mr Cohen's lawyer Brent Blakely said: ""Mr. Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred."" Ms Clifford has said she is speaking out now to set the record straight, having been left too fearful for her and her family's safety to do so previously. Asked what she would say to the President if he were watching the interview, she replied: ""He knows I'm telling the truth."" Mr Trump arrived back at the White House shortly before the interview aired. First Lady Melania stayed behind in Florida as is her tradition during their son's school holiday, a White House spokeswoman confirmed."
2018-03-26,"Buildings in public areas in Salisbury are to be decontaminated later this week, sources have told Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180326215512/https://news.sky.com/story/poisoned-spy-salisbury-public-areas-to-be-decontaminated-later-this-week-11305043,"The decontamination operation is likely to start in the next few days and will include the Zizzi restaurant - where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia dined just before they were found - and The Mill pub which they also visited. Police say the decontamination is being done only as a precaution and there is no danger to the public. Sky sources say the clean-up operation is likely to take some time. Meanwhile, the investigation into the poisoning continues after the pair were found collapsed on 4 March. Sky's Rebecca Williams, who is in Salisbury, said sources had told her the investigation was painstaking and will take some considerable time. She said: ""I've been speaking to a couple of people who have been giving evidence to the police and they say it's like a maze, going round and round in circles. So clearly this investigation is going to take a long time."" It comes as the US expelled 60 Russian diplomats - an action that was followed by 14 EU countries who announced they were also telling Russian officials to leave their countries. Williams said people she had spoken to in Salisbury were pleased that action was being taken against Russia, while some said they believed nothing had been proved. The decontamination comes after the bench that the pair were sitting on when they were discovered was removed on Friday. It was taken away from outside The Maltings shopping centre to ""preserve as a potential crime exhibit"". Police in chemical suits used an angle grinder power tool and crowbar to remove it from the ground."
2018-03-26,"Ernie Bevin, the great British Labour Foreign Secretary after the war, was in office when Israel was created as a state.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180326215512/https://news.sky.com/story/what-the-muralgate-anti-semitism-row-tells-us-about-jeremy-corbyn-11305055,"Many thought that he was an anti-Semite. On the floor of the House of Commons, Winston Churchill remarked: ""I do not feel any great confidence that he has not got a prejudice against the Jewish."" To which Prime Minister Clement Attlee replied: ""That is entirely and utterly untrue. My right honourable friend has many good friends among the Jews."" Short of repeating this trope, there are many on the Labour benches who feel that Mr Corbyn couldn't have handled the latest accusations of anti-Semitism in the party, ""MuralGate"", much worse. There is incredulity that the Labour leader's office could have handled the initial apology on Friday so badly; in the view of many it was considerably less than full-throated. A senior Labour figure told me: ""They screwed up with the insulting first response - then compounded that with the frankly not brilliant second response. Had the third response been put out first the reaction would have been very different."" Louise Ellman MP, Vice Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement agreed, telling me today: ""His statement has been too slow in coming. ""He must now act decisively to root out anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. He must denounce those who claim that allegations of anti-Semitism are smears against the leadership."" Tonight, Mr Corbyn has issued a fourth statement, the most full-throated yet, where for the first time he has acknowledged the particular problem the left and Labour have had with anti-Semitism in recent years. We will wait to see what the response from Jewish organisations will be. I have written to the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council. I will never be anything other than a militant opponent of antisemitism. In this fight, I am an ally and always will be. pic.twitter.com/QhQnFEpplU But that delay and initial prickliness, alongside similar examples in the past gives us an insight into Mr Corbyn's mind-set on this matter. When challenged about perceived anti-Semitism, he has usually responded with total (and often furious) indignation. As he told Martha Kearney last year: ""The idea that I am some kind of racist or anti-Semitic person is beyond appalling, disgusting and deeply offensive. I have spent my life opposing racism."" I think that exchange reveals much. Mr Corbyn cannot conceive himself as being culpable of action or thought which could be construed as racist or offensive to a minority. He has a long and distinguished history of fighting racism and intolerance. But for many that isn't good enough; You can't be absolved of prejudice by cach√©. Even the most enlightened of us are only human - and capable of making human mistakes, as any disinterested party must observe. Mr Corbyn did by saying what he did about the East London mural. Moreover, as I suspect Mr Corbyn would be the first to say, to some extent racism or prejudice is in the eye of the beholder; it matters what the community sinned against thinks, how they feel about something, especially when it comes to a man who might be prime minister. And they are voting with their feet and taking to the airwaves and indeed, Parliament Square, in protest. As a senior Jewish Labour source told me: ""Had he done a Naz Shah from the start and said, you know what I got it totally wrong and I see what I did was hurtful, that would have been the end of it."" When I asked that person if they thought that Mr Corbyn was actually an anti-Semite- they pause and then answered: ""No‚Ä¶I'm willing to believe that it was a sin of omission. ""I assume he think thinks he understands because he's got a good record on minorities. ""But he doesn't understand and doesn't seem to wish to. It's a blind spot. ""I think it's because anti-Semitism is a form of racism outside his usual cultural understanding - it doesn't fit the anti-colonial, neo-imperial stuff which others do. ""But if he's as passionate about racism as he says he is he should try better."" In terms of the impact of this incident on wider politics, we can say two things: the first is that the fragile truce which reigned after the election between the Labour leadership and the party's MPs is over. Both this and Corbyn's reaction to the Salisbury assassination has brought hostilities back into the open. There could also be a real political cost. Labour already had a problem with the Jewish vote. At the general election, on paper Labour should have won three more seats, Finchley & Golders Green, Hendon and Chipping Barnet. But the swing in all three seats was less than in the rest of the city: the Jewish vote, which is large in these areas, just wasn't turning out for Labour. In the event of another tight election seats like this will be crucial. Moreover, in May every London borough council is up for election and Labour figures fear this incident could cost them dear again. Barnet was one of the great hopes for Labour, they had ambitions to take full control of the council from the Tories for the first time since its creation in 1964. I spoke to one Barnet Labour figure today who says thinks this will put pay to that. Perceptions matter in politics, however unfair we might think them to be. There are plenty of people on social media who claim that questions about this mural and anti-Semitism in the Labour Party more generally are a media smear against the Labour leader. To those people I would simply say this: if an old Facebook post of Theresa May was discovered, inquiring as to ""why"" an anti-Islamic mural was being removed from London's streets, what would your reaction be? What, indeed, would be Mr Corbyn's? I think if we're honest, we know the answer."

He was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges under the Computer Misuse Act and money laundering. Mudd created the Titanium Stresser program when he was 16, and it was used to carry out more than 1.7 million attacks on websites and gaming servers. Companies affected by the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks which his tool made claimed they had to pay millions to mitigate against such attacks in the future. DDoS attacks are not sophisticated attacks capable of stealing any information, but merely involve overwhelming a network service with so much traffic that it can't respond to legitimate queries. While DDoS attacks can take network services offline, the losses they might directly cause to the service will be limited to the time while it is down. The companies claim that the damages the attack caused also include the cost of preventing being affected by further DDoS attacks in the future. On Monday, Judge Michael Topolski QC said that Mudd had financially benefited from his crimes and brought in ¬£171,000. Mudd was ordered to repay ¬£69,000 within three months or face another two years in jail. The court heard that Mudd possessed the funds in a PayPal account located in Luxembourg. Mudd, from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, came from a ""perfectly respectable and caring family,"" according to the judge.

With seven adults and 12 children trapped on the ride five metres (16 feet) above the ground, the situation could have sparked panic. However, thanks to the leisurely pace of the ride, the passengers initially weren't bothered. ""The coaster was moving so slowly, I didn't notice it had stopped,"" a woman in her 30s and her six-year-old son who were on the ride at the time of the accident explained to local media. The ride is billed on the park's website as ""the slowest rollercoaster in Japan"" and is around 140 meters long. Bemusement eventually turned to concern when workmen began to hit the train with hammers and staff attempted to push the train without explaining the situation to those still on board. Customers called the emergency police number 110 and rescue crews arrived at the scene to help evacuate those stuck on the ride. Those involved in the incident are calling on investigators to examine the incident and find the cause of the malfunction to prevent the same problem occurring in the future. No injuries were reported."

His yacht was roughly 1,400 miles west of Cape Horn on the southern tip of South America when the accident happened just after 12:30pm local time. Mr Fisher, originally from Southampton but resident in Adelaide in Australia, was wearing survival equipment and the rest of the crew is reported safe. According to his crew profile this is his first attempt at the Volvo Ocean Race. Teammates have been conducting a search and rescue operation but organisers say that because of the conditions turning other competitors in the race around to help is not an option. Weather conditions were due to deteriorate throughout the day. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre has identified a ship 460 miles away that has been diverted to the scene to help. In a statement, organisers said: ""Naturally we are deeply concerned, especially given the weather conditions, and Race Control in Alicante is supporting the Scallywag team and MRCC throughout the operation."""
2018-03-27,A man who trained children as young as 11 for terrorist attacks has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 25 years. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/25-years-in-jail-for-teacher-umar-haque-who-groomed-kids-for-terror-11305843,"Self-styled teacher Umar Haque, 25, was planning to use guns and a car packed with explosives to hit 30 high-profile targets including Big Ben, Heathrow Airport and the Queen's Guard. Some of the youngsters had been ""almost paralysed with fear"", police said, adding that Haque was a ""really dangerous individual"" who could have ""moved at any time"". Nine youngsters aged between 11 and 13 - assessed by a specialist social worker - suffered ""flashbacks"" and ""nightmares"". Sentencing Haque at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave described him as ""narcissistic"" and a ""dangerous liar"", adding that he ""clearly enjoys the power he wields over others"". Haque was planning to hit ""multiple sites using multiple weapons"". Despite having no teaching qualifications, he had access to 250 youngsters at two east London schools and a madrassa over the course of five years. He tried to radicalise 110 of them, police said. The Islamic State supporter trained youngsters by role playing attacks at Ripple Road mosque in Barking, east London. ""Part of that role play was re-enacting attacking police officers,"" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said. Haque also played IS propaganda to pupils at a fee-paying Muslim school - Lantern of Knowledge in Leyton, where he taught Islamic studies and PE between April 2015 and January 2016. Parents at the school were said to be ""horrified"" when they found out. Police and MI5 were on to Haque after he tried to travel to Turkey in April 2016. In bugged conversations with two conspirators, he spoke about being inspired by the Westminster Bridge attack in March last year. His aim was create an ""army of children"" to help carry out terrorist attacks in London, Mr Haydon said. He added: ""It was apparent he was in the early stages of this long-term attack plan at multiple sites using multiple weapons and assisted by children he had radicalised."" One of the youngsters told police: ""Umar has been teaching us how to fight, do push-ups, given strength and within six years he was planning to do a big attack on London."" After a trial at the Old Bailey, Haque was found guilty of planning terror attacks with help from the two conspirators - fundraiser Abuthaher Mamun, 19, and confidant Muhammad Abid, 27, who were convicted of helping him. Mamun, who is said to have ""renounced"" Haque's extremist view of Islam, was jailed for 12 years with a further year on extended licence. Abid was given four years and three months in prison for failing to report the plot. Haque ranted about ""domination"", hunger and insecurity"" as he was sent down."

Paul Moore, 21, attempted to kill Zaynab Hussein with his Volkswagen Up car on 20 September last year in Leicester, narrowly missing a 12-year-old schoolgirl. Ms Hussein, 47, was struck once and then driven over again moments later as Moore was seen laughing. He then drove at the 12-year-old girl because he wanted to ""do the country a favour"". Moore, of Letchworth Road, Western Park, Leicester, had told a relative he intended to target Muslims. He was convicted earlier this month of attempted murder, attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving. ""The courage of your victims, and the compassion and courage of all those who came to the aid of Ms Hussein in different ways - and who notably come from across the diverse range of this local community - stand in stark contrast to your wickedness that morning,"" the judge said. ""All pedestrians were at risk from you that morning. However, the fact remains that you ultimately launched your assault on those who were in Islamic clothing. ""Your intention to kill Ms Hussein was underlined by your wicked decision to return for a second assault with the car. It was only luck and her quick thinking that saved your second intended victim from injury."" He added: ""In circumstances where you have shown no remorse and where there is reason to believe that you may have taken satisfaction from what you did, the alternatives of an ordinary determinate sentence or an extended determinate sentence would provide inadequate protection to the public."" In Ms Hussein's victim impact statement read to the court by prosecutor Jonathan Straw, the Somali national said she has been bed-bound since the incident. The statement read: ""I have limited mobility. I can only get to the toilet with the assistance of a walking frame. ""I feel I have lost my independence. It is not something I am used to and I do not want to be dependent on others. ""This is really upsetting and hurtful - it is affecting my happiness. ""My younger children come into the room and ask, 'when are you going to start walking again?'. ""I physically cannot go outside, but even if I wanted to I wouldn't. ""I don't understand why someone would want to hurt me - especially somebody I have never met."" Steve Newcombe, defending Moore, said: ""There is nothing in his background to suggest that he has held a grudge against Muslims and people of any other faith."""
2018-03-27,"A deposit return scheme for single-use bottles is going to be introduced in England subject to consultation, the Government has confirmed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/govt-to-launch-deposit-return-scheme-for-single-use-bottles-in-england-11306448,"Plastic, glass and metal containers would be included in the scheme with a goal of increasing recycling rates and slashing the amount of waste polluting the planet. A consultation held later this year will examine the details of how such a scheme would work, but it is likely to be in place by the end of this Parliament. UK consumers use an estimated 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year, but more than three billion are incinerated, sent to landfill sites or left to pollute the country's streets, countryside and seas. :: Bottle return scheme is 'a victory for the seas' Plastic bottles make up a third of marine debris - and their impact on the environment has been under scrutiny since Sky launched its Ocean Rescue campaign, which has highlighted the blight of single-use plastics on the planet. ‚ÄúWe can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment - killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats,"" the Environment Secretary Michael Gove said. ""It is absolutely vital we act now to tackle this threat and curb the millions of plastic bottles a day that go unrecycled,"" he added. :: Deposit return schemes: A small price to pay for clean seas Some parts of the UK have already been considering a deposit scheme. Wales said it would consider such a scheme back in September last year, shortly after Scotland committed to the idea of a deposit return scheme.  The Government says it hopes ""to talk to the devolved administrations about the scope for working together on this important issue"". Similar deposit return schemes already operate in countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Germany. A deposit return scheme sees consumers pay an upfront deposit when they buy a drink, ranging from 8p in Sweden to 22p in Germany, which is redeemed on the return of the empty drink container. Other types of schemes being considered by the UK include cash rewards for returning drinks containers without enforcing an upfront deposit. This could be done through a network of 'reverse vending machines' where money is returned whenever a plastic or glass bottle is inserted. Once a bottle is returned, businesses are then responsible for making sure they are effectively recycled - a move that has led to a 97% recycling rate in Germany. Although the Environment Secretary's announcement was widely welcomed, some are concerned the move is a token effort. Elena Polisano, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Michael Gove has a golden opportunity to introduce an effective deposit return system to help reduce the amount of plastic ending up in our environment. But for (the scheme) to work well, it can't be a token effort. It must include all plastic bottles, glass bottles and drinks cans, and be rolled out in shops all across the UK."" The announcement follows the Government's ban on plastic microbeads and the introduction of a 5p plastic bag charge. The bag fee has led to nine billion fewer bags being distributed in the UK. Earlier this month it was announced that the Chancellor is calling for evidence on how the tax system can be used to cut down on single-use plastics. A powerful committee of MPs launched an inquiry into the impact of disposable packaging on the UK's environment last year. Next month, Commonwealth members will gather in London to agree measures to further protect the world's oceans. There are over 150 million tonnes of plastic in the world's oceans and every year one million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals die from eating and getting tangled in plastic waste. By 2050, it is predicted that the total amount of plastic in the oceans will weigh more than the total amount of fish."

""Russia cannot break international rules with impunity,"" it added in a tweet on Tuesday. Theresa May praised the ""unprecedented series of expulsions"" across the globe, with Belgium becoming the 26th country to take action, expelling one diplomat. The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mrs May had told ministers the action against Russia was ""an unprecedented series of expulsions that has demonstrated to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate their attempts to flout international law, undermine our values or threaten our security"". She added: ""It is also important to note that our partners are not only taking these measures out of solidarity with the UK, but also because they recognise the threat that these Russian networks pose to the security of their own countries and the pattern of Russian aggression which has affected us all."" A spokesperson for Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said it was ""very likely"" Russia was responsible for the Salisbury nerve agent attack. They added: ""Given the gravity of the events in Salisbury and the high probability of Russia's involvement in this attack, we consider this measure to be fully justified. ""The Russian ambassador will be notified about this decision within 48 hours. The person concerned will have 14 days to leave Belgium."" NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the move against the Russian diplomats sent a clear message to Moscow that its actions ""had costs"". He said: ""What triggered this was the Salisbury attack. But it is part of a broader response by NATO allies to a pattern of unacceptable and dangerous behaviour by Russia. ""We have seen the illegal annexation of Crimea, we have seen the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, we have seen cyberattacks, we have seen hybrid tactics, we have seen Russia investing heavily in modern military equipment and the willingness to use military force against neighbours."" Others expelling diplomats on Tuesday included Ireland. Its foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said the use of chemical weapons was ""shocking and abhorrent"". Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russia will proceed with a ""principle of reciprocity"". Moscow has already ordered the expulsion of 23 British diplomats. The Russian foreign ministry said: ""This provocative gesture of notorious solidarity with London, made by countries that preferred to follow in London's footsteps without bothering to look into other circumstances of the incident, merely continues the policy of escalating the confrontation."""

A lack of migrant workers could damage a company's ability to grow, ""forcing firms to relocate to Europe in order to access EU labour without restrictions, or forcing some employers out of business"", the report said. MAC, an independent body, has been asked by the Government to help it design a post-Brexit immigration system. It has heard the views of more than 400 companies and industry bodies on the impact of losing access to workers from the continent. Migration Advisory Committee interim report on EU workers in the UK - Chair: ‚ÄúSome sectors are currently experiencing difficulties in recruiting and retaining EEA migrants..Migrants have a choice..cannot be taken for granted they will choose to come to UK‚Äùhttps://t.co/FyQaCgf9qW While the advisory body has yet to produce a final report, it has said lower migration would have an impact on the economy and businesses are not prepared for having a smaller number of workers available to hire. ""Lower migration would very likely lead to lower growth in total employment, and lower output growth,"" the report said. Britain leaves the European Union in 2019 but the Government has negotiated a transition deal, allowing the free movement of labour, until the end of December 2020, giving business more time to plan for the future. The CBI has also warned tougher immigration rules could have an adverse effect on smaller companies. ""While firms recognise that freedom of movement as we know it will end, restricting access to EU workers - at a time of record employment rates - would leave companies without the staff they need to grow and invest,"" Neil Carberry, CBI managing director, said. ""If Britain is continue competing globally, it will need to take an open approach to migration, with appropriate controls to maintain public support. ""As the report notes, firms are concerned that applying non-EU rules to citizens from our closest trading partner would be disastrous for the economy, with smaller companies hit hardest. ""Overall, EU migration has had a positive impact for the UK economy, creating jobs, growth, and helping to pay for public services such as roads, schools and hospitals."" MAC is expected to publish its final report in September."

The exchange came as Mr Johnson answered questions from MPs on Tuesday, with the Foreign Secretary noting heckles from the Labour front bench as he was urged by Conservative backbencher to David Evennett to hail the upcoming Commonwealth summit. Mr Johnson said: ""'Say no' says the Labour frontbench. That's their attitude... isn't that extraordinary. ""'Say no' says the noble and learned lady, the Baroness... whatever it is, I can't remember what it is‚Ä¶"" Reminded of Ms Thornberry's title, the Foreign Secretary then exclaimed: ""Nugee!"" Mr Johnson's comments prompted an intervention from Speaker Bercow, who told the Cabinet minister: ""First of all, we don't name-call in this Chamber and secondly... we do not address people by the titles of their spouses. ""The shadow foreign secretary has a name and it's not 'Lady something'. ""We know what her name is and it is inappropriate and frankly sexist to speak in those terms.

Reacting angrily to what he termed ""chuntering"" on the government benches, Mr Bercow added: ""I've said what the position is and, believe me, that is the end of the matter. ""I hope I've made the position extremely clear to people who are not well-informed about such matters."" Speaker Bercow's comments brought applause from some MPs while Mr Johnson immediately offered an apology ""for any inadvertent sexism or discourtesy"". He added: ""I meant no harm Mr Speaker and I apologise unreservedly if I have offended the feelings of the right honourable lady."" Mr Bercow thanked Mr Johnson for his ""gracious apology"" and repeated that he considered it the ""end of the matter"". Answering a later question, Foreign Office minister Harriet Baldwin praised Mr Johnson as ""a passionate feminist and without a sexist bone in his body"". Speaker Bercow responded: ""I know she won't take it amiss, but the Foreign Secretary doesn't need to be defended by her and I know she wouldn't argue with the chair, she'd come off rather worse."" Ms Thornberry's husband is Sir Christopher Nugee, a high court judge, but as a former barrister she would normally expect to be referred to in the House by fellow MPs as ""the honourable and learned lady""."

The Insolvency Service has powers to ban individuals from directorships for up to 15 years. Individuals who are notified of potential sanctions have the ability to make representations about why such action is unjustified, before the Insolvency Service files formal court proceedings against them. Sarah Albon, the Insolvency Service's inspector-general, said last year that she wanted to see its BHS inquiry concluded by 2019. The move to disqualify Mr Chappell and three other former directors and related companies is likely to see them facing bans towards the upper end of the two to 15-year spectrum, according to insiders. The Insolvency Service later issued a statement confirming Sky News' report. For Sir Philip, who paid up to ¬£363m into BHS's pension scheme to end the threat of action against him by The Pensions Regulator, the Insolvency Service's decision ends the last regulatory probe involving him. In a statement following an enquiry by Sky News, a spokesman for Sir Philip said: ""On 15 March, the Insolvency Service informed Sir Philip Green that it had concluded its investigation into BHS and confirmed that he will not be the subject of any proceedings under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. ""Identical confirmations have also been sent to a number of other individuals who were BHS directors in the period prior to its acquisition by Retail Acquisitions Limited. ""Sir Philip and his fellow directors have cooperated fully with the Insolvency Service since its investigation commenced in May 2016, and welcome this decision."" The latest news is another blow to Mr Chappell, who has been slapped with a ¬£10m bill by pensions watchdogs as they try to recover money owed to the bankrupt retailer's retirement scheme. He also faces a new trial on charges of failing to produce information requested by the pensions watchdog. Other inquiries into the department store chain‚Äé's demise, led by the Financial Reporting Council, remain ongoing."

Damian Collins, chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: ""I would certainly urge him to think again if he has any concern for the people who use his company's services."" He described the questions that MPs have as of ""fundamental importance to Facebook users as well as to our inquiry"" - and said the seriousness of the allegations meant it was ""appropriate"" for Mr Zuckerberg to appear in person or via video link. Mr Collins' remarks came as a parliamentary meeting heard evidence on the alleged illicit transfer of Facebook users' data by Cambridge Analytica (CA). The committee asked whistle-blower Christopher Wylie to tell them what he knew about the company, which allegedly used data gathered from Facebook users in targeted messages on behalf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Mr Wylie claimed that the suspended chief executive of CA, Alexander Nix, had not been truthful to the committee when he claimed his company did not use Facebook data. He said he also believed that AggregateIQ - a Canadian company that is closely linked to CA - played a ""very significant"" role in securing the UK's vote to leave the European Union in 2016. Facebook's founder and chief executive was sent a formal request to appear before MPs and answer questions regarding a growing scandal about user data last week. The company has offered to send chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer or chief product officer Chris Cox to Parliament next month to provide answers. The hearing took place just as the EU's justice commissioner Vera Jourova wrote to Facebook with her questions regarding the scandal. The EU has given Facebook a two-week deadline to respond."
2018-03-27,The UK's best-known children's hospital charity has rubber-stamped a decision to retain hundreds of thousands of pounds from a scandal-hit fundraising event.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/great-ormond-street-keeps-530000-presidents-club-cash-11306096,"Sky News has learnt that the fundraising arm of Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) agreed at a board meeting on Tuesday to overturn its original decision to return ¬£530,000 donated by the Presidents Club Charitable Trust. The U-turn follows a furore over a Financial Times report in January which alleged improper and inappropriate behaviour by some of the guests at the men-only charity dinner at London's Dorchester Hotel. GOSH's charity trustees initially said they would return money raised at Presidents Club events between 2009 and 2016, although the hospital had not been a beneficiary of this year's dinner. However, furious feedback from a large number of GOSH donors and discussions with the Charity Commission prompted a rethink among the trustees, who are chaired by John Connolly, a businessman who chairs G4S, the outsourcing giant. Returning the money, as originally planned, had been rendered difficult by the Presidents Club's decision to close. In a statement issued to Sky News on Tuesday evening, a spokesperson for GOSH Children's Charity said: ""Our thinking is always guided by our aim to maximise the support we give to the hospital and the families it cares for. ""Following feedback from our supporters, guidance from the Charity Commission and taking into account the impending closure of the Presidents Club Charitable Trust, the trustees have decided to retain the funds donated by the Trust. ""We would like to thank all of our donors for their support, it is only through their generosity that we can make a difference for seriously ill children cared for at the hospital."" Some attendees at January's dinner were reported to have behaved inappropriately towards female staff. The function was waited on by scores of ""hostesses"" who were given instructions about the colour and style of underwear they were permitted to wear. They were also obliged to sign non-disclosure agreements relating to the behaviour of guests attending the dinner, who included dozens of executives from the property and financial services industries. The fallout from the FT's investigation led to the resignation of David Meller - the Presidents Club's chairman - from the board of the Department for Education. The Bank of England was among the organisations which cancelled events auctioned at the Dorchester, while Nadhim Zahawi, the children and families minister, was rebuked for his brief attendance at the dinner. The news came at a torrid time for the voluntary sector, which has been rocked by a sexual abuse scandal involving former Oxfam workers who used prostitutes after the earthquake in Haiti in 2011. In its statement hours after the FT story was published, GOSH's charitable wing said: ""We are shocked to hear of the behaviour reported at the Presidents Club Charitable Trust fundraising dinner. We would never knowingly accept donations raised in this way. ""We have had no involvement in the organisation of this event, nor did we attend and we were never due to receive any money from it. ""All monies raised in our name go to support vital work. ""However, due to the wholly unacceptable nature of the event we are returning previous donations and will no longer accept gifts from The Presidents Club Charitable Trust."" A number of other charities, including the Evelina London Children's Hospital, are also said to have elected to retain Presidents Club event donations."
2018-03-27,Victims of a blood contamination scandal have been refused legal funding to help them prepare for a public inquiry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/blood-contamination-scandal-insulting-decision-to-refuse-victims-legal-funding-11306458,"Campaigners have described the decision as ""outrageous"", with the Cabinet Office accused of treating victims as ""cheaply and insultingly as possible"". More than 7,500 people, most of them haemophiliacs, were infected with HIV and hepatitis C by contaminated blood products imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s. At least 3,000 subsequently died - and last year, after years of campaigning by victims and relatives of those who died, Theresa May agreed to a public inquiry chaired by Justice Brian Langstaff. Eight campaign groups will meet him on Wednesday to discuss the terms of reference for the inquiry, having failed to secure funding for legal representation during a consultation period that concludes at the end of April. They had cited the example of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, in which 71 people were killed, and for which the Prime Minister committed to pay ¬£3.5m to meet the legal expenses of families and victims ahead of their inquiry. This week, victims of the blood contamination scandal were told they would not receive any financial assistance. In a letter seen by Sky News, the Cabinet Office lead for the inquiry said the funding for Grenfell Tower victims was due to the ""exceptional nature and gravity"" of the tragedy and said ""the circumstances of the infected blood inquiry are different"". In response, the blood campaigners noted that 70 more people have been killed as a result of infection since the inquiry was announced last year, and wrote: ""'This is totally unacceptable and has only fuelled the longheld feeling of this community that the victims and families of this scandal should be dealt with as cheaply and as insultingly as possible."" Demanding to know how their case was different to the Grenfell tragedy, it added there were several ""newly grief stricken families in our community also"". The statement continued: ""The ""nature and gravity"" of the contaminated blood scandal goes unrivalled in modern times. The number of dead is in the thousands. ""You seem to be suggesting that the slow and agonising deaths that occur as a result of hepatitis and HIV/AIDS resulting in loss of mental capacity, bodily function and causing severe pain... is in some way a lesser tragedy than the events at Grenfell."" Stuart McLean is one of the victims who has been campaigning for an inquiry and seeking financial assistance. Almost uniquely, he is not a haemophiliac but was infected with hepatitis C when he was eight, and incorrectly treated with a contaminated blood product for a swollen knee. In his first interview, he told Sky News that he did not discover he was infected until 35 years later. ""My world stopped when I found out,"" he said. ""My career came to an end and within a few days I found myself standing on a motorway bridge thinking about jumping off. It was only the thought of my grandson that made me step back from the edge."" Mr McLean said that he needed legal funding to help him argue that he should be a ""core participant"" and that his case should be included in the terms of reference. He added: ""It is disgusting that they have said no to this funding which is crucial to people like me, who need lawyers to help us ensure we are treated fairly. ""And it is an insult to all of us to say we are not as worthy as the Grenfell Tower victims. ""You cannot make comparisons and we are right behind the Grenfell people but 70 people have died from contaminated blood since this inquiry was announced, that's almost the same as Grenfell in less than a year, and in the last 35 years it is the greatest scandal in the NHS. ""I have very little confidence in this inquiry at the moment. ""They seem to be putting stumbling blocks in our way before it has started."" The final decision on who receives legal funding will be made by Justice Langstaff, and a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that we will support those who are affected by this scandal so that they are able to participate in the inquiry. ""Currently the chair is conducting a consultation into the terms of reference and the inquiry will be launched when these are agreed."""
2018-03-27,Superstar magician Dynamo has admitted he is sometimes in too much pain to shuffle cards as he opened up about his health problems.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/and-for-my-next-trick-getting-back-to-health-dynamo-suffering-from-arthritis-11305784,"The Bradford-born illusionist posted a video to say he was ""staying positive"" after spending time in hospital because of a serious case of food poisoning last summer. The sickness bout, combined with his existing Crohn's disease, has meant he has had to take a step back from the limelight. The 35-year-old praised the ""amazing"" NHS, but complained that the ongoing side effects of the food poisoning and subsequent medication had left him with a ""bad type of arthritis"", limiting his magic tricks and affecting his weight. He told fans in a video posted on Twitter: ""There's been a lot of ongoing side effects to do with the food poisoning which I'm still dealing with today. ""The main one is a bad type of arthritis that's affected all the joints in my body. ""My toes, my knees, my neck, ankles, my hands; which really sucks as a magician when you can't shuffle a pack of cards 'cause your hands are in so much pain, which has happened on the odd occasion. ""I'm working with doctors, working with a physio and doing everything in my power to get myself to 100%. ""I'm working on lots of new magic so hopefully you get to see that soon in the future. ""As you can see, my appearance has changed quite a bit due to all the medication I'm on... I'm on quite a lot of tablets. ""All the medication has caused me to put on a lot of extra body weight, as well as a rash which is all over my head... it's actually all over my body."" He added: ""I'm doing everything in my power to get myself better, I wanted to let you guys know what was going on from me personally. ""I'm staying positive, I'm working on new magic, I've got great people looking after me and I know you guys who have supported me from day one will have my back."" The exact cause of Crohn's disease is still unknown, and there is currently no cure. The disease is a relatively uncommon with around 115,000 people living with it in the UK. Most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30, but it can affect people of all ages."
2018-03-27,Anyone wishing to avoid Easter traffic should stay off the roads on Good Friday - during an unsettled bank holiday weekend with below average temperatures. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/freezing-temperatures-and-snow-over-easter-weekend-11305756,"It is expected to be the busiest day of the holiday, with 4.45 million individual journeys being taken, according to the RAC. Maundy Thursday and Saturday are predicted to be joint second busiest, with 3.18 million individual trips each. Across the weekend, drivers will complete almost 19 million separate leisure journeys. Likely hotspots include the M25 between Gatwick Airport and the M1, the M3 southwest of London, the A303 at Stonehenge, the M55 between Preston and Blackpool, and the M53 between Liverpool and Chester. In addition to the holiday traffic, planned upgrades on some parts of the national rail network may make the roads even busier. Buses will be carrying rail passengers in some parts of the North West, South West and the east of England. On the plus side, hundreds of miles of roadworks are being removed ahead of the weekend in England. Around 99% of motorways and major A-roads will be roadworks-free, Highways England said. Drivers are also being warned to expect unsettled weather. Snow is possible on the eastern side of Scotland, but mainly over higher ground. Met Office meteorologist Martin Bowles said low pressure will cause ""wet and windy"" weather in the south, adding that frost is expected overnight. Temperatures will be ""below average but not exceptionally cold"". The mercury may plunge as low as minus 2C ( 28F) in the north, and 1 or 2C (36F) in the south. During the day, temperatures in the south will be lower than average, reaching 8 or 9C (48F). Motorists are urged to be properly prepared. ""We know from experience that almost half of breakdowns are avoidable and these can easily be avoided with simple vehicle checks,"" Melanie Clarke from Highways England said."
2018-03-27,A deposit on plastic bottles is a big win for the ocean.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/deposit-return-schemes-a-small-price-to-pay-for-clean-seas-11306316,"They make up a third of marine debris, breaking down over several decades into tiny pieces that become fish food. The great sweeping ocean currents mean the bottles could come from anywhere. But don‚Äôt just blame the poor waste collection in developing countries - it‚Äôs a problem in the UK too. :: Government to launch deposit return scheme in England About 700,000 bottles a day are littered here. Our roadside verges are an eyesore. Some get blown into drains and rivers, and from there start their journey to the sea. Stand on the banks of the Thames and it is sobering to see how many are bobbing about in the flow. Studies show a deposit of about 15p would be an incentive enough for most people to return their empties, reducing littering by 600,000 bottles a day. But the benefits of a deposit return scheme don‚Äôt end there. :: Bottle return scheme is 'a victory for the seas' Contamination is the bane of the recycling industry - not just because of the confusion over what to put in which household bin. The plastic in a drinks bottle is called PET. But if other types of plastic find their way into the recycling mix the material is worthless, fit only for landfill. So isolating drinks bottles from household recycling could ensure the PET is kept seperate. Certainly that‚Äôs the experience in other countries. Norway has the most successful deposit scheme, with 96% of bottles returned. There rules are set for manufacturers - the glue used on labels is water soluble so they‚Äôre easier to remove, fo example. It‚Äôs often said that a deposit scheme will be too expensive to run. That‚Äôs not the experience in Norway. Remember that figure of 96% of bottles being returned? The deposits on the other 4% go unclaimed and the money makes a huge contribution to the running costs of the scheme. The purity of the plastic also means it gets a higher price on the market. The only cost to the consumer is about a penny on a bottle. It‚Äôs a small price to pay for a cleaner environment and a healthier sea."
2018-03-27,"Manchester's fire service took more than two hours to respond to the bomb attack on the city's arena, a report has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/manchester-arena-attack-fire-service-failed-11305637,"An independent panel report into the bombing, which killed 22 people and injured more than 100, said Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service ""played no meaningful role"" in the two hours after the explosion. Chaired by Lord Bob Kerslake, the panel was commissioned by the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, to assess the city's response to the attack on 22 May last year. Even though police, arena staff and even the military were on the scene within minutes, the fire service did not respond until after midnight, the report said. The bomb went off just after 10.30pm. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack The report blamed the delayed reaction on ""poor communication and poor procedures"" and said the fire service was ""effectively outside the loop"" on the night. Fire crews were eager to get to the scene but were restricted by the procedure that was in place due to uncertainty over what kind of incident had occurred. The report highlighted the following major issues with the fire service and other aspects of the emergency response: :: Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) played no meaningful role in the response for two hours :: GMFRS must reflect on aspects of its culture that meant it failed to respond properly :: A Vodafone telephone system set up for relatives ""completely"" failed :: The panel was shocked and dismayed by the media treatment of some families :: The Police Gold Commander and the Force Duty Officer were required to perform ""testing"" multiple duties :: The subsequent care provided for families was not always carried forward The report said: ""The fire service was effectively 'outside the loop', having no presence at the rendezvous point established by the police, little awareness of what was happening at the arena and only a very limited belated presence at Strategic Gold Control. ""The reasons for the failure of GMFRS to respond adequately to the attack are set out in full in our report. ""There is not one single reason nor one individual that caused this failure. Rather, it was a combination of poor communication and poor procedures. ""GMFRS will need to reflect on the wider issues it raises for their operational culture and approach to multi-agency working."" More than 14,000 people were attending an Ariana Grande pop concert at the Manchester Arena when Salman Abedi detonated an improvised explosive device in the foyer. The attack was the deadliest in the UK since the London bombings on 7 July 2005. The report said the Greater Manchester Police force duty officer on the night was right to declare Operation Plato at 10.47pm - a codename which triggers an armed police response to a possible attacker with a gun. But the report said this was not sufficiently well communicated to other emergency services, including the fire service. Firefighters, some who heard the bomb go off, and trained in first aid and terror scenarios with specialist equipment, did not get permission to go to the scene until hours after the suicide bombing, despite the nearest station being half a mile away. This was due to ""strategic oversights"" and poor communications between Greater Manchester Police and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. :: Manchester attack: How I coped being one of the first on the scene The report described a scene of chaos inside the fire control centre as senior officers tried to establish the nature of the incident. There was confusion in the chain of command as to how to respond and mixed messages about whether it was bomb, explosion or a marauding terror attack. This led to significant delays, the report added. Firefighters on the ground showed ""immense frustration"" after being told they did not have clearance to deploy to the arena area. The panel also concluded that the first meeting of senior members of the response ""Gold"" team should have been called earlier than 4.15am. To add to the confusion, there was a ""complete failure"" of the National Mutual Aid Telephony System, a mobile phone network provided by Vodafone, which should have acted as a back up network but instead collapsed. It meant a telephone line for relatives to check on loved ones could not be set up and this meant families caught up in the attack were unable to communicate, the report said. The panel said it was was ""shocked and dismayed"" by accounts of the families of their experiences with some media outlets in the days and weeks after the attack. Some families spoke of being ""hounded"", of a ""lack of respect"" and of ""sneaky"" attempts to take photos when families were receiving bad news, the report said. There were some areas of success, the report said - a sign of recent investment in multi-agency planning. It said the actions of the arena staff, British Transport Police and members of the public showed ""enormous bravery and compassion"". Police and ambulance personnel were on the scene ""very rapidly"" and emergency personnel exercised ""sound judgement in an extremely stressful, chaotic and dangerous environment,"" the report added."
2018-03-27,SpaceX launched the most powerful rocket in the world back in February when its Falcon Heavy sent Elon Musk's car into space - but it still isn't powerful enough for NASA.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/nasa-spacexs-falcon-heavy-is-too-small-for-our-missions-11305523,"Following the successful launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket, NASA has come under increased scrutiny over its decision not to save money by pursuing it as a commercial option for launches. NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle is currently being developed to fulfil the space agency's planned deep space exploration missions - including a manned mission to Mars. However, according to online tech publication Ars Technica, its development has been slow and very expensive. On Monday, this prompted questions about whether it might be better for the agency to use SpaceX's commercially available craft instead of spending billions developing the SLS. During a NASA Advisory Council meeting, Wayne Hale - the former manager of the space shuttle program - broached the topic. ""So there are a lot of folks who ask why don't we just buy four or five or six of those [SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch vehicles], and do what we need to do without building this big, heavy rocket and assemble things like we did with the space station?"" Bill Gerstenmaier, who is in charge of human spaceflight at Nasa, responded that the Falcon Heavy was simply too small. Referring to the rocket's playload capacity to transport something to the moon, Mr Gerstenmaier said the Falcon Heavy was ""a lot smaller than any of [the SLS craft]"" which NASA is developing, and which would be used to bring ""large-volume, monolithic pieces"" of kit into space. He said the SLS had unique capabilities which nobody else would be able to match, although they could contribute to missions. ""For routine servicing and bringing cargo, maybe bringing smaller crew vehicles other than Orion, then Falcon Heavy can play a role,"" he continued. And this was not limited to SpaceX, as Mr Gerstenmaier added: ""What's been talked about by Bezos can play a role. What United Launch Alliance has talked about can play a role."" While potential contracts for smaller spaceflights seem to be on the table, some astrophiles have criticised Mr Gerstenmaier's position. NASA is yet to develop any of the ""large-volume, monolithic pieces"" of kit which require it to develop the SLS. Nasa's stance has annoyed SpaceX fans as well as those who have spotted potential wastage in the public sector and who would prefer some time to be spent considering whether a Falcon Heavy or similar vehicle could be part of NASA's space programme."
2018-03-27,The FTSE 100 has rebounded from 15-month lows as it rallied on signs that a global trade war could be averted.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/ftse-adds-29bn-in-value-as-trade-fears-ease-but-remains-in-doldrums-11306088,"London's leading share index turned sharply higher, rising 1.6% or 111 points - an improvement which added nearly ¬£29bn to the combined value of its constituent companies. But it remained in the doldrums in comparison with its levels earlier in the year, only just finishing above the 7,000 mark after three sessions below it. One analyst described the recovery as a ""dead cat bounce"" after sharp falls seen last week. The FTSE 100's closing level was well below the record high of just under 7,800 achieved earlier this year. Riskier stocks had come under pressure last week on worries about escalating global trade tensions after the US announced planned tariffs of up to $60bn (¬£42bn) on Chinese goods. However, reports that Chinese and US in officials were in talks eased some of those anxieties. :: Why the unloved FTSE 100 is lagging rivals Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: ""Suddenly the whole show is looking a lot like a negotiating tool rather than any serious intention to initiate a trade war."" That helped New York's Dow Jones surge by nearly 3% on Monday night and also boosted sentiment in London on Tuesday. Germany's Dax also enjoyed a strong session, climbing by 1.6%, while French, Spanish and Italian indices climbed too. The FTSE 100 was ahead by more than 2% for much of the session, rising to more than 7,040, but failed to hold on to all the gains and slipped to 7,000.1 by the close. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: ""The extended gains on Tuesday go some way to unwind losses from one of the worst weeks in recent years for stock markets. ""We would caution investors not to get too excited. These price moves have all the hallmarks of a 'dead cat bounce'."""
2018-03-27,Police inspector Darren McKie has been jailed for at least 19 years for the murder of his wife Leanne.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/police-inspector-darren-mckie-jailed-for-19-years-over-the-murder-of-his-wife-11305886,"Sentencing McKie to life imprisonment at Chester Crown Court, judge Mr Justice Spencer said: ""You strangled her to death in the family home. It was a cruel killing. ""Then, abusing your knowledge with criminal investigations and abusing the public trust in you as a senior police officer, you set about disposing of your wife's body in a callous and despicable way. ""You have robbed your children of their mother. You have robbed Leanne's parents of their beloved only child."" Mrs McKie, a fellow police officer with Greater Manchester Police, was found strangled in Poynton Lake, Cheshire, on 29 September. She was described by colleagues as ""popular and professional"". Mrs McKie and her husband had three children and were thought of by friends as ""the perfect couple"". McKie initially denied responsibility for his wife's death but pleaded guilty to manslaughter nine days into his trial, just before he was due to give evidence. Mr Justice Spencer said today: ""I am quite sure that you did so not out of remorse, but simply as a damage limitation exercise."" A jury found McKie guilty of murder on Friday. He had racked up debts of more than ¬£100,000 - fraudulently applying for loans in his wife's name without her knowledge. A week before his wife's death, McKie made 15 loan applications in a single day - eight in his name and seven in her's. On the morning of her death, Mrs McKie was at their Wilmslow home when her passport and salary details - accessed from the police system by her husband - were returned after being used in an application for a ¬£54,000 loan. He returned home after she sent him text messages confronting him about the loan application and calling him a ""liar"". He then strangled her before driving her car down the road to make it look as though she was not at home, before walking back to meet a surveyor who had come to value their house. The surveyor described McKie's demeanour as ""perfectly normal"". Witnesses saw him laughing as he picked his children up from school later that day. During the night, he drove his wife's body to Poynton Park several miles away and threw her into the lake. As he walked home, he was stopped by a night shift police patrol before being allowed to continue his journey home. Dashcam footage from the police car showed the headlamps illuminating reflectors on his training shoes. The shoes were later found dumped in a wheelie bin with traces of his wife's blood on. Mrs McKie's mother Ellen Dodd was in tears in court as the judge described the ""brutal killing"". He said: ""She must have been aware that she was being strangled to death, in the family home, by the father of her children. ""It was an awful way to die."" In a statement read to the court, Mrs Dodd said: ""We are so sad that Leanne's children have been left without a mother to look after them and watch them grow up. ""They love her so much and miss her. Nothing will bring our beautiful daughter back to us. Our lives will never be the same again."""
2018-03-27,It is tempting to blame the FTSE-100's lurch into correction territory simply on concerns over trade wars between the US and China.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-unloved-ftse-100-is-lagging-rivals-11301394,"After all, all of the Footsie's European peers have also fallen sharply since it became clear President Trump was going to slap tariffs on a number of Chinese imports, a measure to which Beijing has retaliated overnight. Yet none of the main European indices have fallen to the same extent as the Footsie. The UK's main index has on Friday hit a level last seen on 12 December 2016. By contrast, the Xetra Dax in Germany is merely back to a position it touched earlier this month and the CAC 40 in France at a level where it had been at the beginning of February. Further afield, the main US stock index, the S&P 500, has merely slipped to a point last seen on 12 February, while the Shanghai Composite in China has drifted to a level previously reached on 9 February. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is where it was on 7 March. Only the Nikkei in Japan, which contains a lot of companies that could be at risk in the event of a major trade war between the US and China, has experienced anything approaching the reverses the Footsie has suffered of late - and even it has only fallen to levels last seen at the beginning of October last year. So the Footsie has fallen harder and faster than any of its main international peers. The longer term graph is more pitiful still. At the time of writing, the index is actually lower than its closing value of 6,930 achieved on the final trading day of 1999. In other words, if you had bought a fund tracking the index in the dying hours of the 20th century, you would have absolutely no capital gain to show for the intervening period - although you would still be up on the investment thanks to dividend payments yielding roughly 3% each year. By comparison, the S&P 500 has almost doubled in value, as has the Xetra Dax. Even the sleepy old Nikkei is up almost 9% on its close at the end of 1999. So the FTSE-100 does seem particularly unloved among major stock indices. This was confirmed this week by the influential monthly survey of fund managers, compiled by the stockbroker Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which revealed that pessimism towards UK equities is at an all-time high. A net 42% of investors told BoAML they were ""underweight"" the UK. Not only that, but UK equities were revealed to be the most-favoured ""short"" position among market professionals, which is to say that the UK stock market is the most popular asset for investors to sell in the expectation of further drops in prices. There are a number of reasons why investors are shunning the UK. The most obvious is that the UK economy has the weakest growth prospects of all of the major global economies. That in turn means a lacklustre outlook for profits growth at companies that are particularly exposed to the UK economy. However, the FTSE-100 is an international index, with the companies in it deriving more than half of their earnings from outside the UK. Only about a quarter of earnings enjoyed by FTSE-100 companies are generated in the UK. To that extent, the prospect of trade wars is a concern, particularly with the Footsie being packed with miners like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom rely on Chinese demand to a significant extent. Another factor is Brexit. Some Footsie stocks, particularly some banks and manufacturers that do a lot of cross-border trade with the EU, face a great deal of uncertainty just now. Investors lack clarity over the kind of Brexit deal that the Government will achieve with the EU and, until they have it, they will naturally be cautious about such stocks. Another factor deterring investors from the UK is the possibility of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn pledged to higher personal and corporate taxes and nationalisation of PFI contracts and some utilities. A number of Footsie constituents, including Severn Trent, United Utilities, National Grid and Royal Mail, are among those businesses that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has promised to take into public ownership - a prospect that Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, said last week was frightening investors when combined with the prospect of a hard Brexit. He said: ""Confidence is everything. And every day, I'm hearing of potential investors in this country reaching for their coats. ""Because they're not going to risk putting their money into an economy that soon might face export barriers to its single biggest market, let alone invest in companies, assets and services that could soon be taken over by the state."" The people at the helm of most UK businesses are now at least as worried, if not more so, about a hard-Left Labour government as they are about a hard Brexit. And, accordingly, so are the market professionals who invest in those companies. As Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment officer at wealth manager Tilney Group, put it recently: ""A Labour government is unambiguously bad for capital markets."" One factor particularly worrying investors is the hint of capital controls that prevent investors getting their money out of the country. Mr McDonnell admitted at a fringe meeting at last September's Labour conference: ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? ""I don't think there will be, but you never know, so we've got to scenario-plan for that."" As Iceland discovered, when it imposed capital controls after the financial crisis, people will not invest in your country if they do not think there is a reasonable chance of later being able to get their money out."
2018-03-27,"Ernie Bevin, the great British Labour Foreign Secretary after the war, was in office when Israel was created as a state.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/what-the-muralgate-anti-semitism-row-tells-us-about-jeremy-corbyn-11305055,"Many thought that he was an anti-Semite. On the floor of the House of Commons, Winston Churchill remarked: ""I do not feel any great confidence that he has not got a prejudice against the Jewish."" To which Prime Minister Clement Attlee replied: ""That is entirely and utterly untrue. My right honourable friend has many good friends among the Jews."" Short of repeating this trope, there are many on the Labour benches who feel that Mr Corbyn couldn't have handled the latest accusations of anti-Semitism in the party, ""MuralGate"", much worse. There is incredulity that the Labour leader's office could have handled the initial apology on Friday so badly; in the view of many it was considerably less than full-throated. A senior Labour figure told me: ""They screwed up with the insulting first response - then compounded that with the frankly not brilliant second response. Had the third response been put out first the reaction would have been very different."" Louise Ellman MP, Vice Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement agreed, telling me today: ""His statement has been too slow in coming. ""He must now act decisively to root out anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. He must denounce those who claim that allegations of anti-Semitism are smears against the leadership."" Tonight, Mr Corbyn has issued a fourth statement, the most full-throated yet, where for the first time he has acknowledged the particular problem the left and Labour have had with anti-Semitism in recent years. We will wait to see what the response from Jewish organisations will be. I have written to the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council. I will never be anything other than a militant opponent of antisemitism. In this fight, I am an ally and always will be. pic.twitter.com/QhQnFEpplU But that delay and initial prickliness, alongside similar examples in the past gives us an insight into Mr Corbyn's mind-set on this matter. When challenged about perceived anti-Semitism, he has usually responded with total (and often furious) indignation. As he told Martha Kearney last year: ""The idea that I am some kind of racist or anti-Semitic person is beyond appalling, disgusting and deeply offensive. I have spent my life opposing racism."" I think that exchange reveals much. Mr Corbyn cannot conceive himself as being culpable of action or thought which could be construed as racist or offensive to a minority. He has a long and distinguished history of fighting racism and intolerance. But for many that isn't good enough; You can't be absolved of prejudice by cach√©. Even the most enlightened of us are only human - and capable of making human mistakes, as any disinterested party must observe. Mr Corbyn did by saying what he did about the East London mural. Moreover, as I suspect Mr Corbyn would be the first to say, to some extent racism or prejudice is in the eye of the beholder; it matters what the community sinned against thinks, how they feel about something, especially when it comes to a man who might be prime minister. And they are voting with their feet and taking to the airwaves and indeed, Parliament Square, in protest. As a senior Jewish Labour source told me: ""Had he done a Naz Shah from the start and said, you know what I got it totally wrong and I see what I did was hurtful, that would have been the end of it."" When I asked that person if they thought that Mr Corbyn was actually an anti-Semite- they pause and then answered: ""No‚Ä¶I'm willing to believe that it was a sin of omission. ""I assume he think thinks he understands because he's got a good record on minorities. ""But he doesn't understand and doesn't seem to wish to. It's a blind spot. ""I think it's because anti-Semitism is a form of racism outside his usual cultural understanding - it doesn't fit the anti-colonial, neo-imperial stuff which others do. ""But if he's as passionate about racism as he says he is he should try better."" In terms of the impact of this incident on wider politics, we can say two things: the first is that the fragile truce which reigned after the election between the Labour leadership and the party's MPs is over. Both this and Corbyn's reaction to the Salisbury assassination has brought hostilities back into the open. There could also be a real political cost. Labour already had a problem with the Jewish vote. At the general election, on paper Labour should have won three more seats, Finchley & Golders Green, Hendon and Chipping Barnet. But the swing in all three seats was less than in the rest of the city: the Jewish vote, which is large in these areas, just wasn't turning out for Labour. In the event of another tight election seats like this will be crucial. Moreover, in May every London borough council is up for election and Labour figures fear this incident could cost them dear again. Barnet was one of the great hopes for Labour, they had ambitions to take full control of the council from the Tories for the first time since its creation in 1964. I spoke to one Barnet Labour figure today who says thinks this will put pay to that. Perceptions matter in politics, however unfair we might think them to be. There are plenty of people on social media who claim that questions about this mural and anti-Semitism in the Labour Party more generally are a media smear against the Labour leader. To those people I would simply say this: if an old Facebook post of Theresa May was discovered, inquiring as to ""why"" an anti-Islamic mural was being removed from London's streets, what would your reaction be? What, indeed, would be Mr Corbyn's? I think if we're honest, we know the answer."
2018-03-27,Speculation is growing that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has visited Beijing after a diplomatic train arrived from Pyongyang.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/kim-jong-un-likely-in-beijing-after-train-seen-arriving-from-north-korea-11305468,"The train was met with tight security when it rolled into the Chinese capital, and a convoy of 20 cars was seen leaving the city's Diaoyutai State Guest House, where senior foreign leaders often stay during visits. Police blocked roads near the building as the convoy travelled by. Although there has been no official confirmation of the visit from China or North Korea, a presidential official in South Korea said Seoul was ""watching things in Beijing very closely"". ""Right now, the situation surrounding the Korean peninsula is moving very quickly and it would be inadvisable to think with prejudice,"" they added. Heavy security was reported at the Friendship Bridge over the Yalu River which marks the border between China and North Korea before a train passed. The train has since left Beijing's station. A Chinese government spokesman is expected to provide information on the reports ""in due course"". Yoo Ho-yeol, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul, suggested the meeting was likely a bid by Mr Kim to ""reaffirm close ties"" with Beijing before a planned summit with US President Donald Trump. He said: ""If North Korea speaks with the US on its own it might feel it is at a disadvantage, but if it has China as an ally, Pyongyang may think it will be able to protect its interests and profits during the summits."" If the North Korean leader has been in Beijing, which diplomatic sources have said is ""likely"", it would mark his first foreign visit since taking office in 2011. His father, Kim Jong Il, last visited Beijing in 2011 and did so aboard a train similar to the one spotted in the city on Monday. It comes ahead of planned summits between North Korea, South Korea, and the US, with the three having agreed to talk to allay tensions over Mr Kim's nuclear ambitions. His sister, Kim Yo Jong, who some analysts have suggested could be aboard the train, visited the South for the Winter Olympics in February and earlier this month senior officials from Seoul travelled to Pyongyang. Mr Trump has since agreed to meet Mr Kim by May, with the latter's foreign minister's recent visit to Sweden fueling suggestions that the historic summit could take place in the country."
2018-03-27,"Theresa May wants a ""long-term"" health funding plan in order to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the NHS this year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-wants-to-mark-nhs-anniversary-with-long-term-nhs-funding-plan-this-year-11306267,"The Prime Minister has hinted she is backing Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt's call for a 10-year NHS spending deal as she warned of a need to get away from ""annual top ups"" of hospital budgets. Mrs May, appearing before the House of Commons Liaison Committee, described NHS funding as a ""critical priority"" after highlighting ""serious cost and demand pressures"" on the health service. The Prime Minister suggested the Government ""cannot afford to wait until next Easter"" - and a planned spending review for all Whitehall departments - for an answer to NHS spending. ""We need to, I think, get away from this annual approach we see to the NHS budget,"" Mrs May told the group of MPs, made up of the chairs of all Commons committees. ""Recognise that for the NHS to plan and manage effectively we need to get away from those annual top ups of the budget that we see and we do need to have a sustainable long-term plan. ""And that, I think, should build on the work of the five-year forward view, but look beyond it and a plan which allows the NHS to realise greater productivity, to realise efficiency gains. ""This is a critical priority for me, so this year and in advance of next year's spending review, I do want to come forward with a long-term plan."" The Prime Minister told the committee she wants plans for the NHS to be decided ""in conjunction with leaders of the NHS, with clinicians and health experts"" and that the Government would back it with a ""multi-year funding settlement"" to ensure ""the NHS can cope with the rising demand"". ""I would suggest that we can't afford to wait until next Easter,"" she added. ""I think in this, the 70th anniversary year of the NHS's foundation we need an answer on this."" Reacting to the Prime Minister's comments, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""The Prime Minister's announcement of a funded long-term plan for the NHS this year is very welcome, timely and significant. ""The NHS celebrates seven decades of service this July, at a time of great pressure on frontline staff and great promise for improved care. ""So now is absolutely the right time to recommit to all that's best about our NHS, while also accelerating and capitalising on the huge promise of medical advance for the decade ahead. ""Charting a multi-year path for modern efficient and sensibly funded health and social care could mean huge gains for cancer patients, mental health services and support for frail older people, as well as the several million nurses, doctors and other care staff who devote their lives to looking after us."" Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth described Mrs May's comments as ""warm words"", but said voters should ""wait and see what the Prime Minister actually comes out with in a few weeks or a few months' time"". He told Sky News: ""Theresa May has been a leading member of this Government for eight years, and after eight years the NHS is in absolute crisis. ""We've got waiting lists close to four million, we've got people, often elderly people, languishing on trolleys in overcrowded hospitals. ""We've been calling for a long-term funding plan for the NHS for some time. If we were in government now, we'd be putting an extra ¬£5bn into the NHS."" At the weekend, Mr Hunt spoke of the ""crazy way"" the NHS has been funded over the last two decades, describing it as ""feast or famine"" for hospitals. Setting out his wish for a 10-year funding settlement, he said: ""Given that it takes seven years to train a doctor and three years to train a nurse, you need to have something that gives you the ability to look ahead."" The Prime Minister's announcement will be seen as a big political win within Cabinet for Mr Hunt, who Mrs May reportedly tried and failed to move from his health brief during her reshuffle earlier this year."
2018-03-27,Some ugly truths have washed up on our shores and been fished out from our seas. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/sky-ocean-rescue-bottle-return-scheme-is-a-victory-for-the-seas-11306379,"Unsurprisingly - considering a rubbish truck of plastic is dumped in the ocean every minute - one of the enduring stories emerged from the sea in Norway just a month after Sky launched its Ocean Rescue campaign. In February 2017, a whale with a gut full of plastic was fished out of waters off Norway's west coast. Of the 30 plastic bags that clogged the creature's stomach causing it agony, some came from the UK. Ironically, you could still read the recycling symbol on some of the packaging. :: Government to launch deposit return scheme in England Fifteen months ago we set out not just to document the problem, but to make a change. We created a whale out of plastic as our symbol. At the heart of Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign was the vision for a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles across the UK. Early on, we had high-profile support from Prince Charles, who said: ""Reverse vending machines suck your bottle in when you put it in to the machine. When they introduced this in Germany 12 years ago the rubbish problem reduced by 95%. It made the whole difference. ""It seems extraordinary to me that we don't look more closely at these sorts of initiatives that can make such a dramatic difference. So, all I can say is I hope Sky's plastics campaign will raise more awareness about this serious issue."" :: Deposit return schemes - A small price to pay for clean seas It did more than that. In January last year, Sky News unearthed a concerted lobbying effort from the drinks industry to prevent the Scottish government introducing a deposit scheme. A letter to the First Minister warned of ""inconvenience to consumers"" and ""damage to business"" as well as existing recycling schemes - even though evidence showed that in other countries the deposit scheme dramatically improved recycling. We discovered that Coca-Cola had what it called a risk matrix. It showed a fightback strategy against deposit schemes. But a month after our report was aired, the world's biggest soft drinks manufacturer dropped its opposition to the scheme and soon it was actively campaigning for it, with one executive telling Sky News: ""The time is right - we have to look at what else can we do."" As well as putting pressure on industry, Sky sought to educate, to change habits and walk the Government towards improved policies. In March last year, the Environmental Audit committee launched an enquiry into single-use plastics and by December concluded a bottle return scheme should be introduced. That summer, the Scottish government pledged to adopt the scheme - and the new Environment Secretary Michael Gove hinted to Sky News he was considering it. Now it is confirmed. Mr Gove said: ""We can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment - killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats. It is absolutely vital we act now to tackle this threat and curb the millions of plastic bottles a day that go unrecycled."" There is still a consultation to be had and the Government anticipates push back from some quarters. Certainly, there was be scrutiny on the detail of how the scheme will work. But today is a victory for the seas and all who depend on them. The plastic tide is turning, but Sky's campaign to protect the ocean goes on."
2018-03-27,"Labour needs to roll out an education programme for members after Jewish leaders staged a protest against anti-Semitism within the party, a senior MP has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180327222735/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-members-need-educating-on-anti-semitism-says-shadow-minister-11305697,"Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey admitted a demonstration outside Parliament on Monday evening was ""emotional"" for everybody within Labour, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Several hundred people, including a number of Labour MPs, attended the protest in Westminster where Mr Corbyn was told ""enough is enough"". Mrs Long-Bailey, a close ally of the Labour leader, admitted ""more needs to be done"" to tackle abuse of Jews, as she stressed Labour's efforts in dealing with allegations of anti-Semitism needed to be accelerated. She told Sky News: ""We need to speed up the investigatory processes that we have within the party, we also need to roll out a political education programme so that every single member within the Labour Party understands all forms of anti-Semitism. ""And that needs to be enforced at a local level to make sure that we don't have incidences where people are being victimised or language is being used in debates that is, quite frankly, unacceptable."" Mrs Long-Bailey described how ""too often"" anti-Semitism is ""masked within political discourse, within the language that people use to describe certain political situations"". ""Either they deliberately do it, or sometimes accidentally without realising, and we need to be clearer on that in the party,"" she added. The frontbencher confessed the need for greater political education within Labour had been among the recommendations of a report on anti-Semitism by Shami Chakrabarti in June 2016, but had yet to be implemented. Little more than a month after Baroness Chakrabarti ruled Labour is ""not overrun by anti-Semitism"", in the report branded a ""whitewash"" by critics, she was handed a place in the House of Lords by Mr Corbyn. Mrs Long-Bailey cited the case of former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended from Labour since April 2016 pending an internal investigation, as the need to accelerate the party's response to anti-Semitism allegations. She said: ""The investigation process needs to be sped up so that we can restore faith in the process. ""There are a number of cases that have taken a long time to resolve, shall we say, and that's not acceptable. It needs to be dealt with in a far more expedient manner."" Prior to Monday's protest, Mr Corbyn wrote to the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews to offer an urgent meeting and tell them he was ""sincerely sorry"". Mrs Long-Bailey defended Mr Corbyn from the claim he had only offered his fullest apology so far due to the organisation of a demonstration outside Parliament. She said: ""Jeremy as a person has been vehemently opposed to all forms of anti-Semitism throughout his whole life. ""And personally he's devastated there are people within the Jewish community who don't have faith in our party processes. ""He's never been mealy-mouthed whenever he's been asked about anti-Semitism. ""He's always opposed anti-Semitism in any form that it's found and he's called it out wherever that's been found."" The latest concerns about anti-Semitism in Labour have deepened after it emerged Mr Corbyn previously offered support on Facebook against the removal of an east London mural featuring anti-Semitic imagery. Mr Corbyn subsequently apologised for ""not having studied the content of the mural more closely before wrongly questioning its removal in 2012"". On Tuesday, The Guardian reported a formal complaint about Mr Corbyn's Facebook post in apparent support of the mural was lodged with the Labour Party in February last year. It is understood the complaint was handled by Labour's governance and legal unit and Mr Corbyn's Facebook comment was not found to have met the threshold for a breach of the party's rules, as it only questioned the mural's removal. Mr Corbyn's office were not aware of the February 2017 complaint, a party source told Sky News. The Labour Party does not comment on complaints made to the unit. After Mr Corbyn's letter to Jewish leaders on Monday, backbench MP Bridget Phillipson expressed hope the Labour leader would call upon those who support him to ""desist"" from anti-Semitic abuse. She told Sky News: ""It's not what our party is for, it's not in line with our values and it makes me ashamed to see people acting in the name of the Labour Party conducting themselves in such a racist, offensive way."" Ms Phillipson added: ""I feel ashamed. It makes me ashamed to feel that our Jewish friends do not feel the Labour Party is a safe and welcoming place. ""It's right that we condemn anti-Semitism but I've had enough of the talking, we need to see some action now."" Mr Corbyn did not comment to reporters for the second day running as he left his north London home on Tuesday."

Both are putting belts on the line when they appear at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. Briton Joshua, the reigning IBF, IBO and WBA (Super) champion, appeared calm throughout and said of his opponent from New Zealand: ""He is quick and can take a punch, that's what I've heard. ""I'm preparing for a 12-round fight, which isn't a problem to go the distance. I believe I will knock Parker out for sure,"" he added. Parker, the WBO champion, also sounded assured, saying: ""I'm going to beat AJ, I haven't decided how I will win. These belts are mine. ""I'm confident, sharp and my movement is better than ever. I'm taking those belts back to New Zealand,"" he added. The 26-year-old from Auckland has two years on Joshua and claimed that could be a factor. ""It's my time,"" he said. ""I'm young, sharp and am determined to win. ""I'm here to be part of history, doing it for my team, family and country. Joshua is a great champion and we respect him and what he's achieved."" There was none of the traditional pre-fight 'trash talk' from either man, but Joshua left fight fans in no doubt who they should back. ""If I've got ¬£20 in my pocket, I believe Anthony Joshua knocks Joseph Parker out for sure...I don't want to lose. The fear of being defeated keeps me going,"" he said. ""Every fight is a blessing and every one will have reason in the long run. Parker is a champ and has done well, he will add something to my life journey.

He claims the money was donated in the last two weeks of the referendum period but that Vote Leave retained control over how the cash was spent - an arrangement which would represent a breach of electoral rules. He said: ""I'm a big fan of Michael Gove myself but I find it highly doubtful that you wouldn't know that enormous amount of spending was given to a campaign."" Mr Sanni said Mr Gove - along with other pro-Brexit MPs - were ""in the office very often"" and that ""there's no way no one knew about BeLeave"". He added: ""Everyone was aware BeLeave was a Vote Leave outreach group."" When pushed on whether Mr Gove would have know about any possible payments, Mr Sanni said he ""highly doubted"" those who were ""best friends"" with Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings were ""not aware"". He added: ""Just to be clear - the money actually never touched the BeLeave bank accounts."" Mr Gove told Sky News earlier he was unaware of a donation made by Vote Leave to BeLeave until after the 2016 referendum had concluded, despite being the co-convener of the campaign committee tasked with ensuring all pro-Leave groups were working together effectively. He said: ""I wasn't involved in the day-to-day running of the campaign, I was out there making the case for leaving the EU rather than managing the hidden wiring of the campaign. ""But I think this case has been investigated twice by the Electoral Commission since it occurred and I think on both those occasions the Electoral Commission said it's quite right that one campaign can donate to another organisation, and indeed my understanding is that the Remain campaign did pretty much the same thing."" He said his role as co-convener of the campaign committee saw him ""make sure that all of the politicians that were out there making the case and who were part of the Vote Leave coalition were working effectively together and I'm afraid we only met weekly rather than daily"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for the police to investigate the claims by Mr Sanni that Vote Leave ""cheated"" in order to secure victory in the referendum. Key Brexiteer Boris Johnson has rubbished the claims as being ""utterly ludicrous"" - and Vote Leave denies any wrongdoing. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman has said: ""The commission has a number of investigations open in relation to campaigners at the EU referendum; it does not comment on live investigations."""

On the floor of the House of Commons, Winston Churchill remarked: ""I do not feel any great confidence that he has not got a prejudice against the Jewish."" To which Prime Minister Clement Attlee replied: ""That is entirely and utterly untrue. My right honourable friend has many good friends among the Jews."" Short of repeating this trope, there are many on the Labour benches who feel that Mr Corbyn couldn't have handled the latest accusations of anti-Semitism in the party, ""MuralGate"", much worse. There is incredulity that the Labour leader's office could have handled the initial apology on Friday so badly; in the view of many it was considerably less than full-throated. A senior Labour figure told me: ""They screwed up with the insulting first response - then compounded that with the frankly not brilliant second response. Had the third response been put out first the reaction would have been very different."" Louise Ellman MP, Vice Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement agreed, telling me today: ""His statement has been too slow in coming. ""He must now act decisively to root out anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. He must denounce those who claim that allegations of anti-Semitism are smears against the leadership."" Tonight, Mr Corbyn has issued a fourth statement, the most full-throated yet, where for the first time he has acknowledged the particular problem the left and Labour have had with anti-Semitism in recent years. We will wait to see what the response from Jewish organisations will be. I have written to the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council. I will never be anything other than a militant opponent of antisemitism. In this fight, I am an ally and always will be. pic.twitter.com/QhQnFEpplU But that delay and initial prickliness, alongside similar examples in the past gives us an insight into Mr Corbyn's mind-set on this matter. When challenged about perceived anti-Semitism, he has usually responded with total (and often furious) indignation. As he told Martha Kearney last year: ""The idea that I am some kind of racist or anti-Semitic person is beyond appalling, disgusting and deeply offensive. I have spent my life opposing racism."" I think that exchange reveals much. Mr Corbyn cannot conceive himself as being culpable of action or thought which could be construed as racist or offensive to a minority. He has a long and distinguished history of fighting racism and intolerance. But for many that isn't good enough; You can't be absolved of prejudice by cach√©. Even the most enlightened of us are only human - and capable of making human mistakes, as any disinterested party must observe. Mr Corbyn did by saying what he did about the East London mural. Moreover, as I suspect Mr Corbyn would be the first to say, to some extent racism or prejudice is in the eye of the beholder; it matters what the community sinned against thinks, how they feel about something, especially when it comes to a man who might be prime minister. And they are voting with their feet and taking to the airwaves and indeed, Parliament Square, in protest. As a senior Jewish Labour source told me: ""Had he done a Naz Shah from the start and said, you know what I got it totally wrong and I see what I did was hurtful, that would have been the end of it."" When I asked that person if they thought that Mr Corbyn was actually an anti-Semite- they pause and then answered: ""No‚Ä¶I'm willing to believe that it was a sin of omission.

2018-03-28,It is tempting to blame the FTSE-100's lurch into correction territory simply on concerns over trade wars between the US and China.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180328224159/https://news.sky.com/story/why-the-unloved-ftse-100-is-lagging-rivals-11301394,"After all, all of the Footsie's European peers have also fallen sharply since it became clear President Trump was going to slap tariffs on a number of Chinese imports, a measure to which Beijing has retaliated overnight. Yet none of the main European indices have fallen to the same extent as the Footsie. The UK's main index has on Friday hit a level last seen on 12 December 2016. By contrast, the Xetra Dax in Germany is merely back to a position it touched earlier this month and the CAC 40 in France at a level where it had been at the beginning of February. Further afield, the main US stock index, the S&P 500, has merely slipped to a point last seen on 12 February, while the Shanghai Composite in China has drifted to a level previously reached on 9 February. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong is where it was on 7 March. Only the Nikkei in Japan, which contains a lot of companies that could be at risk in the event of a major trade war between the US and China, has experienced anything approaching the reverses the Footsie has suffered of late - and even it has only fallen to levels last seen at the beginning of October last year. So the Footsie has fallen harder and faster than any of its main international peers. The longer term graph is more pitiful still. At the time of writing, the index is actually lower than its closing value of 6,930 achieved on the final trading day of 1999. In other words, if you had bought a fund tracking the index in the dying hours of the 20th century, you would have absolutely no capital gain to show for the intervening period - although you would still be up on the investment thanks to dividend payments yielding roughly 3% each year. By comparison, the S&P 500 has almost doubled in value, as has the Xetra Dax. Even the sleepy old Nikkei is up almost 9% on its close at the end of 1999. So the FTSE-100 does seem particularly unloved among major stock indices. This was confirmed this week by the influential monthly survey of fund managers, compiled by the stockbroker Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which revealed that pessimism towards UK equities is at an all-time high. A net 42% of investors told BoAML they were ""underweight"" the UK. Not only that, but UK equities were revealed to be the most-favoured ""short"" position among market professionals, which is to say that the UK stock market is the most popular asset for investors to sell in the expectation of further drops in prices. There are a number of reasons why investors are shunning the UK. The most obvious is that the UK economy has the weakest growth prospects of all of the major global economies. That in turn means a lacklustre outlook for profits growth at companies that are particularly exposed to the UK economy. However, the FTSE-100 is an international index, with the companies in it deriving more than half of their earnings from outside the UK. Only about a quarter of earnings enjoyed by FTSE-100 companies are generated in the UK. To that extent, the prospect of trade wars is a concern, particularly with the Footsie being packed with miners like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American, all of whom rely on Chinese demand to a significant extent. Another factor is Brexit. Some Footsie stocks, particularly some banks and manufacturers that do a lot of cross-border trade with the EU, face a great deal of uncertainty just now. Investors lack clarity over the kind of Brexit deal that the Government will achieve with the EU and, until they have it, they will naturally be cautious about such stocks. Another factor deterring investors from the UK is the possibility of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn pledged to higher personal and corporate taxes and nationalisation of PFI contracts and some utilities. A number of Footsie constituents, including Severn Trent, United Utilities, National Grid and Royal Mail, are among those businesses that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has promised to take into public ownership - a prospect that Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI, said last week was frightening investors when combined with the prospect of a hard Brexit. He said: ""Confidence is everything. And every day, I'm hearing of potential investors in this country reaching for their coats. ""Because they're not going to risk putting their money into an economy that soon might face export barriers to its single biggest market, let alone invest in companies, assets and services that could soon be taken over by the state."" The people at the helm of most UK businesses are now at least as worried, if not more so, about a hard-Left Labour government as they are about a hard Brexit. And, accordingly, so are the market professionals who invest in those companies. As Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment officer at wealth manager Tilney Group, put it recently: ""A Labour government is unambiguously bad for capital markets."" One factor particularly worrying investors is the hint of capital controls that prevent investors getting their money out of the country. Mr McDonnell admitted at a fringe meeting at last September's Labour conference: ""What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? ""I don't think there will be, but you never know, so we've got to scenario-plan for that."" As Iceland discovered, when it imposed capital controls after the financial crisis, people will not invest in your country if they do not think there is a reasonable chance of later being able to get their money out."

She was a Classical Studies student at the University of Winchester, but was still a member of the council as she ""remained committed"" to serving the people of her ward. Her father Colin Slade, who is also a councillor in the area, said the family had been expecting her back for a visit when they found out she had died. ""It is such a shock,"" he told the Daily Telegraph. ""She was due to come back to visit and the first thing we knew was when she was not on the train. ""She had a bright future ahead, she was very keen on politics and she was a very bright young councillor, the youngest in the country when she was elected. She was looking to possibly pursue a career in politics."" The cause of her death has not yet been established, with police treating it as unexplained. Dozens of fellow councillors and MPs have paid tribute to Ms Slade, with her council leader Cllr Clive Edinton describing her as an ""endearing personality"" who will be missed ""enormously"". Kevin Foster, Conservative MP for Torbay, tweeted he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by her death, while North Devon MP Peter Heaton-Jones said she was ""so upbeat"" and had a ""bright future"". Ms Slade was active on social media, posting pictures with leading Conservative figures including Prime Minister Theresa May, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and Jacob Rees-Mogg."

Detectives will continue to focus their enquiries around the address in Salisbury for the coming weeks - and possibly months - as the investigation continues. In a statement the Metropolitan Police says officers will be carrying out thorough searches in the areas surrounding the former spy's semi-detached property. The searches, it says, will be part of the ongoing investigation as well as a precautionary measure. Dean Haydon, the senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said: ""At this point in our investigation, we believe the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent from their front door. ""We are therefore focusing much of our efforts in and around their address. Those living in the Skripals' neighbourhood can expect to see officers carrying out searches as part of this but I want to reassure them that the risk remains low."" Traces of the nerve agent have been found at some of the other crime scenes that detectives have been examining over the past few weeks, but at lower concentrations to that found at their home address. A dozen policemen, who were not wearing protective overalls, searched an alley beside the victim's house on Wednesday for what is thought to be the first time. The investigation into who poisoned Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter, 33, is one of the largest and most complex investigations undertaken by British counter-terrorism police. The pair were found collapsed on a bench on Sunday 4 March in a critical state. About 250 counter-terrorism detectives are working around the clock on the investigation, according to the Met Police. More than 5,000 hours of CCTV is being examined and more than 1,350 pieces of evidence are being scrutinised. About 500 witnesses have been identified and hundreds of statements taken. On Wednesday, the 24th day of the investigation, Mr Haydon thanked the local community ""for their continued support and understanding"". Specialist search officers are concluding their work at some of the locations involved in the investigation and turning the areas over to Wiltshire Police. These areas include the London Road Cemetery where investigators in hazmat suits were seen early on in the case. The UK has accused Russia being responsible for the attack, resulting in more than 150 Russian diplomats being expelled from countries across the globe. Russia rejects the accusation and has challenged the UK to prove the British intelligence services did not conduct the assassination attempt. The best friend of Mr Skripal told Sky News he believes the poisoned double agent and his daughter are so critically ill they should be allowed to die."

The car hire worker from Hayes, who also had traces of cannabis in his system, was doing 71mph in a 60mph zone and crashed into the boys with such force that they were thrown into the air. He admitted causing their deaths by dangerous driving. Families and friends of the boys filled London's Old Bailey to see Chudasama sentenced, with angry relatives of the victim labelling a ""coward"" for fleeing the scene. In a statement in court, Josh's mother, Tracy Blackwell, told him: ""You are going to rot in hell, mate,"" adding that the boys were killed in ""circumstances I can only describe as murder"". George's mother, Sarah Baker, said: ""That awful night my son was taken from me will stay with me and haunt me for the rest of my life."" Judge Wendy Joseph QC jailed him for 13 years, one year less than the maximum punishment for the offence, but the victims' relatives were not satisfied with the jail term handed down. Harry's brother Matthew, one of a group of protesters outside court, said: ""He should not see the light of day, end of story. ""My brother was ruthlessly taken away with his two friends by a callous driver who got in a car knowing he was going to drive the vehicle under the influence."" The victims were among eight friends walking to a 16th birthday party at Goals five-a-side football club at around 8.40pm on 26 January. The defendant was ""driving like a bat out of hell"", according to another motorist, as he swung his Audi out to overtake on Shepiston Lane, lost control and hit the boys head-on. They were thrown into the air as the car spun around in the road three times. The court heard George suffered terrible head and neck injuries and died instantly, as did Josh, who was struck so hard that he was sent over a fence and into a cemetery. Harry was carried on the bonnet of the car which crashed into the cemetery wall, crushing his body. Chudasama, of Hayes, and his passenger got out and ran off, chased by other boys, who dragged him back to where their friends lay dying. One of the friends who was there at the time described ""flashbacks of seeing the boys' bodies catapulted in the air"". In mitigation, Leila Gaskin said Chudasama would be ""racked by guilt and remorse"" for the rest of his life. The court heard Parliament is considering proposals for life sentences for the most serious cases of causing death by dangerous driving."

He said the Kremlin ""underestimated the strength of global feeling"". Mr Johnson went on to highlight the annexation of Crimea, cyberattacks and the concealing of chemical weapons in Syria. :: Skripals were poisoned at their home, police say ""After all these provocations, this week was the moment when the world decided to say enough to the wearying barrage of Russian lies,"" he said. ""The torrent of obfuscation and intercontinental ballistic whoppers. First they told us that novichok never existed, then they told us that it did exist but they had destroyed the stocks, then they claimed that the stocks had escaped to Sweden or the Czech Republic or Slovakia or the United States. ""And the other day they claimed that the true inventor of novichok was Theresa May."" :: Poisoned ex-spy ""should be allowed to die"" Mr Johnson said that the Foreign Office had heard a total of 24 ""ludicrous fibs"" with regards to Russian involvement in Salisbury. In a colourful comparison, the MP added: ""They make novichok, we make light sabres. One a hideous weapon that is specifically intended for assassination. The other an implausible theatrical prop with a mysterious buzz. ""But which of those two weapons is really more effective in the world of today? ""I tell you that the arsenals of this country and of our friends are not stocked with poison but with something vastly more powerful - the power of imagination and creativity and innovation that comes with living in a free society."" :: Timeline - The day of the nerve agent attack The speech comes after Theresa May spoke to Donald Trump to thank the US leader for his ""very strong response"" as he expelled 60 Russian diplomats. ""The PM said the US had delivered a very strong response and welcomed the breadth of international action in response to Russia's reckless and brazen behaviour,"" a Downing Street spokesperson added. On Wednesday, Russia called on the UK to prove British intelligence services did not poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The Russian foreign ministry also said in the absence of that evidence it will consider the case a murder attempt on Russian citizens as part of a ""massive political provocation"".

Speaking outside court afterwards, he thanked the judge and the jury for ""giving me a fair trial"". After thanking his lawyers and his family for their support, he said he had nothing else to add ""out of respect for my employers"". But his solicitor, Joe McVeigh, claimed the ""prosecution made much of the perceived privileged position provided by virtue of Paddy being an international rugby player"". He added: ""We say that it was this very status as a famous sportsman that drove the decision to prosecute in the first place."" However Marianne O'Kane, from the Public Prosecution Service's serious crime unit, said it was ""ultimately right"" that the case had been brought to trial. She also paid tribute to the ""courage and determination of the complainant and her family"". The teammates, aged 25 and 26, who both play for the Irish side Ulster, had denied raping the same woman at Jackson's home in south Belfast in June 2016 following a night out. Another man, 26-year-old Blane McIlroy, was found not guilty of exposure. A fourth man, 25-year-old Rory Harrison, was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice and withholding information. Jackson, McIlroy and Harrison were permitted to leave the dock first. The court was told a short time later that no evidence had been offered by prosecutors on a charge of vaginal rape against Stuart Olding. Judge Smyth then directed the jury to find him not guilty. Including the four defendants, a total of 30 witnesses gave evidence during the nine-week trial. The complainant gave testimony over eight separate days. The jurors will now be exempt from jury service for life, the judge telling them it had ""probably been the most difficult trial that any jury in Northern Ireland has ever been asked to adjudicate on"". The Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby said officials would now ""review the matter, in line with existing procedures for all contracted players"". ""We wish to acknowledge that this has undoubtedly been a difficult and extremely traumatic time for all involved,"" the organisations said in a statement."

Russia's accusation is its bluntest yet as it continues to deny involvement in the poisoning of former double agent Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March. :: Russian expulsions: The countries kicking out diplomats:: Poisoned ex-spy 'should be allowed to die':: Poisoned ex-Ukrainian president: 'I know what Putin fears' The comments come two days after countries across the world started expelling Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain's view that the Russian state poisoned the pair with a Soviet-designed nerve agent called Novichok. Montenegro, a former close Russian ally, is the latest country to expel a Russian diplomat. A total of 25 other nations - including most in Europe, as well as Canada, the US and Australia - have jointly expelled more than 130 diplomats. The Kremlin on Wednesday reiterated that Russia will ""definitely retaliate"" against the West over the expulsions. Russia's ambassador to Australia, speaking a day after the country expelled him, said the world will enter into a ""Cold War situation"" if the West continues what he alleged is bias against Moscow. Grigory Logvinov said: ""The West must understand that the anti-Russian campaign has no future. ""If it continues, we will be deeply in a Cold War situation."" Washington has called on Russia to ""accept responsibility for its actions and to demonstrate it is capable of living up to its international commitments"".

He told Sky News: ""Quite frankly, what future have they got? I don't know the properties of this weapon that was used on them and my guess is they are probably being kept alive by artificial means and what life will they have if they survive? ""We've already been told they will be severely mentally impaired and I don't think they would want that. I think death would probably be merciful."" :: Poisoned ex-Ukrainian president: 'I know what Putin fears' Mr Cassidy got to know Sergei, his wife Lyudmila, his son Alexandr (who was known as Sasha) and Yulia. Mr Skripal, 66, a military intelligence officer, had been convicted and jailed in Russia for spying for MI6. Mr Cassidy said: ""It was a bit unusual having a Russian family there, but they were very friendly and when they bought their own home nearby and moved out we continued our friendship. Sergei's English was okay, though his wife's wasn't and she didn't mix so much, but Yulia was almost fluent. ""We became great pals and I introduced Sergei to a lot of things, including English beer and he introduced me to vodka."" :: Salisbury public areas to be decontaminated Mr Cassidy, 61, has spent many hours with counter-terror detectives investigating the poisoning, but would not discuss the police operation. ""I was aware of his background and I can't say I approve of treachery, but that was none of my business,"" he said. ""Sergei spent a lot of time out of the country and there were times when I didn't see him, but he used to call me his English friend. He was very generous and never forgot my birthday, usually buying me an expensive bottle of whisky."" :: Britain's ability to respond to Salisbury attack was underestimated On Saturday 3 March, Mr Cassidy drove Mr Skripal to Heathrow to collect Yulia, who had moved back to Moscow and was visiting her father. It had been snowing and Sergei asked his pal if they could use his four-wheel-drive pick-up truck. The next day father and daughter were found collapsed in Salisbury city centre after being attacked with the nerve agent novichok. Mr Cassidy said: ""I remember when my wife Mo came upstairs to tell me. We had heard about the incident in the town and we didn't know who it was, but Mo said the couple who had been poisoned were Sergei and Yulia. ""To say we were shocked is the understatement of the century. I realised from that moment on it was going to be massive and it has occupied every part of our lives."" :: Recap: Belgium joins nations expelling diplomats Mr Cassidy said he had spent so much time with the police and dealing with media inquiries that he had barely considered the serious plight of his friends. ""It wasn't until about 10 days later I started thinking, 'Hang on a minute, Sergei and Yulia are in hospital and are probably going to die', and I actually felt guilty that I hadn't thought more about that,"" he said. Last week, in a court ruling about the Skripals' medical needs, a judge quoted the consultant treating them in Salisbury district hospital: ""The hospital has not been approached by anyone known to the patients to enquire of their welfare."" Mr Cassidy was upset by the suggestion there wasn't anyone who cared enough to want to go and see the Skripals. He said: ""That is misinformation, because we care. I asked the police several times if we could go and see them, quietly and away from the media, but I was told quite categorically that we were not allowed. We asked the question and the answer was 'no'. ""We were also upset that if his family and friends in Russia got to hear about this lack of concern it would cause them extra anguish."" Two weeks after the nerve agent attack, police recovered Mr Cassidy's truck he used to collect Yulia. He has just been told they found no trace of contamination. He said: ""I just want to go back to being the old Ross Cassidy, putting on my boots each morning and going to work, then having a pint at the weekend. But I don't think I will ever see Sergei and Yulia again, even if they recover."" Meanwhile, Viktoria Skripal, Mr Skripal's niece, told the BBC she was hoping for a miracle. She said: ""We are all grown up and we don't believe in miracles but I can't stop thinking that maybe it's not them. ""Maybe a miracle will happen and it will turn out not to be them. ""But everyone is saying that, even if they recover, the long-term prognosis is not good."""

He said: ""The Labour Party is not doing enough about anti-Semitism. We need to take tough action - racism is racism - there should be no hierarchy when it comes to racism. ""I speak to many Londoners of Jewish faith who tell me how disappointed they are that they don't feel welcome in the Labour Party. ""They think that some of the allegations against members should be taken far more seriously, should be investigated far more quickly, and I'm hoping the Labour Party will swiftly investigate allegations against individual members and take decisive actions."" Asked about this week's demonstration in Parliament Square organised by Jewish leaders, Mr Khan said: ""It appals me and breaks my heart that there were Londoners of Jewish faith who don't feel the Labour Party understand their concerns they have, and don't understand the anti-Semitism that exists from people who claim to be Labour members. ""There should be no place in our party for anyone of anti-Semitic views. ""The Labour Party should swiftly investigate allegations against members and kick these members out."" Sky News revealed on Tuesday that around 80 individual cases of alleged anti-Semitism by Labour members are being dealt with by the party's National Constitutional Committee. Some high-profile cases are to be heard in the coming weeks, nearly two years after allegations were made. Mr Khan also revealed he is concerned by Conservative ""dog whistle"" campaigning ahead of May's crucial local elections. This month, Conservative election leaflets for Havering Council, in outer London, warned: ""Havering in danger.. ruled by Mayor Khan will resemble inner city areas like Camden, Newham and Barking rather than a traditional part of Essex!"". Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein has described the leaflets as ""really bad stuff"", adding: ""It's obvious what they are trying to do and they need to be told firmly how wrong the party thinks it is"". Former Tory minister Nick Boles has also called the leaflet ""disgraceful"" and urged his party to act. Mr Khan suggested the campaign was similar to the heavily-criticised Tory efforts against him on behalf of rival Conservative mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith in 2016. ""We've been here before, this is the Tories acting in the way they did in 2016,"" he said. This leaflet is disgraceful. The individuals responsible should apologise, and withdraw it, or face disciplinary action. We cannot attack Corbyn for indulging anti-semitism in Labour and allow messages like this to go unchallenged. @BrandonLewis over to you. https://t.co/QSvYvYE3BN ""I think it's beneath them, I think it should be a positive campaign about what's on offer rather than using a dog whistle to try to suppress voters."" Mr Khan was speaking at the unveiling of a new statue on Trafalgar Square's fourth plinth - a recreation of an ancient Lammasu destroyed by Islamic State in Iraq in 2015. Responding to criticism of the election leaflet, a Conservative spokesman said: ""Romford Conservatives intended to highlight local concerns about housing pressures, high-density urbanisation and badly-run Labour councils in inner London. ""They have apologised for any offence caused and the leaflet has been withdrawn."""
2018-03-28,Home Secretary Amber Rudd has admitted the Government is yet to decide whether the UK's post-Brexit immigration rules will form part of trade negotiations with the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180328224159/https://news.sky.com/story/rudd-no-agreement-on-whether-immigration-will-be-part-of-next-phase-of-brexit-talks-11307246,"The remaining 27 EU member states have stated they want the future UK-EU relationship to include ""ambitious provisions"" for movement of citizens between Britain and the bloc. But, Ms Rudd signalled the Cabinet have yet to agree whether or not to negotiate with Brussels on future immigration rules during Brexit talks. Although Brexit negotiations are likely to be concluded in October this year, Ms Rudd also confirmed the Government will not be presenting their post-Brexit immigration plans to Parliament until ""the end of the year"". She told MPs the Government will wait until the conclusions of a final Migration Advisory Committee report in September. The Home Secretary also refused to commit to the Government's target of reducing net migration to the UK to below 100,000 by 2022. The revelations came in a bruising exchange between Ms Rudd and Labour MP Yvette Cooper, the chair of the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It has been suggested offering more favourable immigration rights to EU citizens after Brexit could allow Britain to negotiate greater access to the bloc's markets. Asked by Ms Cooper whether the Cabinet has a view on whether immigration will form part of negotiations on the future EU-UK partnership, Ms Rudd replied: ""It's for the Prime Minister to decide what the state of the negotiations are going forward. ""We've achieved a lot in the past few months and going forward it's going to be for the Prime Minister to decide."" When Ms Cooper suggested that means there is ""no Government proposal on even whether or not immigration is going to be included in the discussions"", Ms Rudd said: ""You can take it as you want."" At last week's European Council summit, the EU27 adopted guidelines for upcoming negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship. They stated: ""The future partnership should include ambitious provisions on movement of natural persons, based on full reciprocity and non-discrimination among Member States, and related areas such as coordination of social security and recognition of professional qualifications."" When these were put to Ms Rudd by Ms Cooper, the Home Secretary commented: ""It will be up to the Prime Minister and [Brexit Secretary] David Davis to decide to what level they decide to engage with that."" Ms Cooper said: ""The problem is you have got a net migration target on one hand, you have got some unknown hidden objectives in the negotiations on the other, but none of us have any idea what they are. ""Do you think you are remotely being honest and open with the public about what future immigration policy and reality will be?"" Ms Rudd replied: ""I think what the public want is to make sure they have a Government that is committed to reducing the high numbers of net migration, and they are seeing that with this Government."" Ms Rudd was also questioned on whether she is still aiming to meet the Government's net migration target by the end of this parliament, to which she replied: ""I'm still focused on making sure we reduce net migration to sustainable levels."" When challenged, the Home Secretary did not clarify whether that was a ""yes or no"" answer to the tens of thousands target. In her appearance before MPs, the Home Secretary also announced a new recruitment drive for 1,000 border staff ""to improve the quality of our border and prepare specifically for Brexit"". This comes on top of 300 new posts announced in October last year. Although the Home Office could not confirm how many of the 1,000 positions to be advertised will be new roles - rather than to cover upcoming vacancies over the next few months - the recruitment drive is aimed to make sure the Border Force has the staff it needs by the time Britain leaves the EU in March next year."
2018-03-28,Kim Jong Un's wife's outfits and looks attracted much praise during their trip to Beijing - before online comments were deleted by China.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180328224159/https://news.sky.com/story/kim-jong-uns-wife-praised-during-china-visit-before-state-blocks-her-name-online-11307280,"Ri Sol Ju accompanied the North Korean leader on his surprise trip to the Chinese capital this week to meet with President Xi Jinping. The two leaders' wives were photographed with them a number of times over the two-day trip wearing different outfits, prompting discussion on social media. Not much is known about Mr Kim's young wife as she is only ever seen by her husband's side on occasional trips in North Korea. But Chinese people online were full of admiration for her. Many decided she was better dressed and prettier than Mr Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan, who is also a famous singer and in 2014 was listed as the 57th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. Following a flurry of comments about North Korea's first lady, search results for Ri Sol Ju were blocked on Weibo, China's Twitter equivalent. The majority of comments under online news reports had also been deleted. North Korea's first lady had ""a powerful presence"", was prettier than Ms Peng and was more fashionably dressed, one user on Weibo said. Others users compared her to South Korean celebrities, saying she was ""as pretty as Song Hye Kyo"", an actress who is also popular in China. ""Ri Sol Ju is indeed beautiful and amiable. ""I can tell she would be good at 'first-lady diplomacy', better than Kim's sister,"" another Weibo user said. Before rumours the North Korean leader was on a visit to Beijing were confirmed, many thought his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was in the capital. But instead it was the dictator himself, with his wife who wore a cropped camel-coloured jacket with high neck and matching knee length skirt and heels to the opening ceremony. Her counterpart, Ms Peng, wore a white knee length coat with black ink splotches and black heels. During a visit to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ms Ri wore a white jacket with a green dress and at a lunch at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, where they stayed, she wore an ivory skirt suit with flared waist and sleeves. William Tang, a Hong Kong fashion designer, deemed her style ""subtle"" but not conservative. He said her outfits were ""outdated"" but impressive considering North Korea has limited access to fashion. North Korea only confirmed Ms Ri, believed to not be her real name, was the leader's wife in 2012 after she was seen with him at a concert. Since 2014 she has rarely been seen in public and is believed to be a former cheerleader and singer. She is thought to be about 28 years old and has three children with Mr Kim, and is believed to have taken a six month course in being the first lady before marrying him."

Thinking outside the box, Shetland MSP Tavish Scott called for his proposed mapping requirement to be enshrined in law - banning public authorities from the practice in future. The Liberal Democrat told Holyrood's Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee: ""My contention is the islands should be in the right place on the map. ""If I was closer to the Moray Firth or indeed in the Moray Firth I wouldn't need to spend 12 hours going home on the boat from Aberdeen overnight. ""This is simply to ensure that in future that government publications and documents do reflect the reality of Scotland in terms of its geography, and not something that fits neatly on an A4 sheet of paper."" Some members of the committee said they were sympathetic to the proposal - with Orkney MSP Liam McArthur saying his constituency suffered similar treatment. He said: ""There have been number of occasions that we have found ourselves bundled in a box and stuck in the Moray Firth."" Mr McArthur argued that the concern is not just ""presentational or superficial"" because it is a matter of the misconception that the islands are nearer the mainland than they are. Conservative MSP Peter Chapman is against the move and said map specialists had told him it would reduce the scale of any map by about 40%. He said losing detail in favour of a ""whole chunk of sea"" would be counterproductive. Islands minister Humza Yousaf said he would not tolerate a similar situation if maps misrepresented his constituency of Glasgow Pollok. He said since Mr Scott raised the issue, instructions had been issued to publishers that government documents should try to represent all the Scottish islands accurately. Mr Yousaf urged Mr Scott to withdraw the amendment and work with the government to bring about change through agreement rather than law, warning it could be ""largely unenforceable"". He offered to contact all councils to instruct them to follow the Scottish Government's lead on publishing. Although Mr Scott withdrew the amendment, he stressed he wanted the change enshrined in law and would work with the government on a ""correct"" drafting before the final stage of the bill."

The broadcaster wants other firms to join it - and hopes the investment fund could be boosted up to ¬£100m. It comes as Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign - which aims to reduce the amount of single use plastics that end up in the sea - claims a major victory. Yesterday the government announced it would introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use bottles, subject to consultation. There are over 150 million tons of plastic in the world's oceans, and every year one million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals die from eating plastic or getting tangled in waste. By 2050, it is predicted that the total amount of plastic in the oceans will weigh more than the total amount of fish. Alongside the venture fund, Sky also announced it would be launching an ""innovators in residence"" project that would allow businesses to pilot and test their products at its London headquarters. The first company taking up the residency is Skipping Rocks Lab, a start-up which uses natural materials made from plants and seaweeds to reduce plastic packaging. It will test products such as juice and water contained in biodegradable seaweed orbs. Jeremy Darroch, Sky's group chief executive, said: ""We think it's time businesses stop dumping harmful plastic in to the sea and instead start pumping more money into innovation. ""Sky Ocean Ventures is a bold new creation that will support breakthrough thinking and invest in promising new ideas that will help turn off the plastics tap. ""We look forward to working with other like-minded organisations who can help us find and support innovators who are developing products, materials and business models that will create meaningful change.""  Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said the government's push to cut down on plastic waste had been inspired by Sky's campaign welcomed the company's new innovation fund. ""I look forward to seeing how innovation and creativity can help to turn the tide on plastic waste,"" he said. :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

""When somebody comes to you and says that has happened there is not much choice about what you should do,"" she said. Before leaving Miramax in 1998, Ms Perkins has said she made Weinstein sign a legal agreement committing him to attend therapy. She told the AP news agency overnight on Tuesday it also required the company to act if he made any further payouts over alleged wrongdoing. She was hoping to ""create protection for people in the future"", she said, but had ""no idea if any of the obligations were upheld"". Under the terms of the agreement, Ms Perkins chose a therapist for Weinstein, but does not know if he attended any sessions. A year after leaving Miramax, she saw him at the Cannes Film festival, where ""he told me that everything I had done was pointless"". Now, she said she feels ""defrauded"", adding: ""I believed we had done the best we could in terms of stopping his behaviour. ""We signed that agreement with the belief that Miramax and Harvey Weinstein would uphold their obligations,"" she said. :: Harvey Weinstein: UK police receive sexual assault claim from 10th woman As part of a settlement, she signed a non-disclosure agreement. The Women and Equalities Committee has been investigating workplace sexual harassment. Its chair, Maria Miller, said there were concerns that such agreements could be used to ""mask the scale of this problem"". Ms Perkins told the committee: ""There cannot be a legal document that protects criminal behaviour or coercive behaviour."" She called non-disclosure agreements ""morally wrong"". She added that such agreements are ""used abusively and within the law and there isn't enough regulation and there isn't a framework to protect the victims of the situation"". She also said Weinstein ""wanted to keep his enemies close"", and tried to keep her and her colleague in the company. ""He offered us more money - whatever we wanted,"" she said. ""It's a clear admission of guilt throughout the process."" Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex."

The company had stunned investors earlier this month when it revealed a ¬£30m tax bill. PwC would likely be called in, according to insiders, barring a last-minute rescue by banks. Conviviality said: ""Further to the announcement on 28 March 2018, and following discussions with its lending banks, the board has resolved to file notice of intention to appoint administrators to the company. ""Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. ""The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice. ""The directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business."" It is understood any sale would likely be through an administration process. The announcements were made just days after Conviviality confirmed the departure of Diana Hunter, its chief executive, and said it would seek to raise ¬£125m from investors through a placing of new shares. A number of suppliers are understood to have deserted the company, which supplies drinks to thousands of pubs, undermining Investec's efforts to raise the new funding. Conviviality's shares had been suspended after the tax bill was disclosed to the stock market, leaving it with a market value of just ¬£185m. The company, which also owns the Wine Rack chain and the drinks wholesaler Matthew Clark, is a big player in the UK's beverages industry. It supplies more than 700 off licences and 23,000 pubs and restaurants across the country, and employs more than 2,600 people. Pub chains with contracts to be supplied by Conviviality reported on Wednesday that key deliveries ahead of the Easter period had failed to show up. The brewing giant AB InBev had urged shareholders to back the group's fundraising, underlining its importance as a distribution channel for the Budweiser and Stella Artois maker. Administration would mean the company becomes the latest retail sector failure following the collapse of Toys R Us UK and Maplin."
2018-03-28,Victims of black cab rapist John Worboys have succeeded in blocking his release and forcing the Parole Board to rethink its decision to free him from jail.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180328224159/https://news.sky.com/story/decision-to-free-black-cab-rapist-worboys-overturned-11307067,"Lawyers for two women, who cannot be named for legal reasons, argued the panel's decision to approve the 60-year-old's release was ""irrational"" and should be overturned. Three High Court judges upheld the legal challenge on Wednesday and ordered the Parole Board to reconsider its decision. It means Worboys - known as the black cab rapist after attacking victims in his hackney carriage - will remain in prison pending a fresh review. Judges said the panel ""should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending"" and examined how ""the limited way... he has described his offending may undermine his overall credibility and reliability"". They ordered the case be ""remitted to the Parole Board for fresh determination before a differently constituted panel"". Worboys was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years after he was convicted for 19 offences - including rape, sexual assault and drugging - for attacks on 12 women. But last year the Parole Board decided it was safe to release him after he had served only 10 years in prison. Police believe he committed crimes against 105 women between 2002 and 2008, when he was caught. The CPS decided not to overload the indictment against Worboys by prosecuting him for every attack. Dozens of women were told the prosecution would be more powerful if the court heard only the strongest cases. One of the victims who took the case to the High Court said after the judgment: ""It is the whole system that has failed. I feel like I have been let down at every step. ""As victims we should have been supported and not having to fight every step of the way in court."" She added that she was confident the Parole Board will now make the right decision on Worboys. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who brought the challenge with the victims via a judicial review, said the ruling would ""give some reassurance"" to Worboys' victims ""and to all Londoners"". Law firm Slater and Gordon represented 11 of Worboys' victims. Kim Harrison, a lawyer with the firm, said: ""We have said all along that Worboys is a manipulative and calculating individual who conned the Parole Board into granting his release. ""Our clients, who have been terrified that he will track them down after his release, can now sleep easy in their beds safe in the knowledge that this serial sex offender will be kept in jail where he belongs."" As the court announced its decision, Nick Hardwick quit as chairman of the Parole Board, saying he was ""sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case"", but asserted: ""I had no role in the decision of the panel in this case."" He added that both he and the panel were ""wrong"" to believe that only crimes for which Worboys had been convicted could be taken into consideration. The Parole Board said its ""members make incredibly difficult and complex decisions every day that can have a devastating impact on victims and the case of John Worboys is no different"". ""The courts have decided we must go back and look at this case again in light of additional information that wasn't before the original panel and we will do just that,"" it added. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he accepted the court ruling and would not be appealing it. He said he stood by his decision not to challenge the Parole Board because the ""victims succeeded in a different argument"". In light of the court's findings, Mr Gauke said he would be instructing officials to issue new guidance that ""all relevant evidence of past offending should be included in the dossier submitted to the Parole Board, including possibly police evidence"". He also announced that Parole Board rules will be examined in their entirety so victims can receive summaries of the decisions which have been made about offenders."

The carriage was topped with a bouquet of yellow sunflowers, while a tribute to one of Sir Ken's trademark Diddymen was alongside the coffin. Hundreds of mourners gathered under a big screen to watch proceedings from outside. In his address, the acting dean of Liverpool, Canon Myles Davies, said Sir Ken would have been ""so pleased, and probably humbled too, by the way his home city and people from all over poured out their tributes to him in these last weeks"". He said it was a ""wonderful tribute"" to someone who had spent his life ""persuading us all to exercise our chuckle muscles"". Among those attending the service were fellow comedians Jimmy Tarbuck, Stan Boardman, Les Dennis and Roy Chubby Brown. Tarbuck described Sir Ken as ""perhaps our city's greatest hero"", adding that it had been an ""honour"" and a ""joy"" to watch him. ""He was the greatest stage comic I've ever seen,"" he added. ""He never got giggle laughter, never little titters, there were roars of laughter like you've never heard. I've never seen anybody get laughs like him."" Roy Chubby Brown said he did not ""know anyone who didn't admire Ken Dodd"". Sir Ken was ""a Liverpool man"", said Stan Boardman. ""He stayed in Liverpool, was born in Liverpool and died in Liverpool. ""And (he was) respected by everyone in Liverpool, not just as a comedian but as a man. He was a great fella."" Actor Ricky Tomlinson said Sir Ken was ""a one off, wasn't he? You can't compare anyone with Doddy"". At the end of the service, children dressed as Diddymen followed Sir Ken's coffin as it was carried out of the cathedral. ""Ken always said his gift, his talents, were from God and comedians like Ken, they only come once in a lifetime,"" said comedian Jimmy Cricket. ""We thank God today that he came during our lifetime."""
2018-03-28,"The Prime Minister will embark on a daylong tour across the United Kingdom to mark ""Brexit Day"" - a year before the Article 50 timetable elapses and the UK is scheduled to depart the European Union.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180328224159/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-to-strengthen-bonds-as-she-embarks-on-uk-wide-tour-to-mark-brexit-day-11307662,"Her message, carried across all four home nations, will attempt to show unity across the country. ""Today, one year until the UK leaves the EU and begins to chart a new course in the world, I am visiting all four nations of the union to hear from people across our country what Brexit means to them,"" she will say. ""I am determined that as we leave the EU, and in the years ahead, we will strengthen the bonds that unite us, because ours is the world's most successful union."" She will start at a textile factory in Ayrshire before visiting young parents in Newcastle, meeting farmers in Northern Ireland, businesses in Wales, and EU citizens in west London. But the visit, which is also the one-year anniversary of her signing the Article 50 letter, comes at a time when the country appears no less divided than at the referendum. A Sky Data poll shows a country still split down the middle - with 66% telling us they feel we are more divided as a country as we approach Brexit. When asked whether Brexit is good or bad for the country, the margin remains very slim - with 46% responding it is a bad idea and 44% saying it is a good idea. The PM will make a particular appeal for Remain and Leave voters to unite. She will say: ""I am determined that our future will be a bright one. It's a future in which we trade freely with friends and partners across Europe and beyond. ""Having regained control of our laws, our borders and our money, and seized the opportunities provided by Brexit, the UK will thrive as a strong and united country that works for everyone, no matter whether you voted Leave or Remain."" Some in Parliament still believe it is premature to presume that the UK definitely will leave in a year's time. The Government has specifically kept the power to extend the date for a few months should negotiations run out of time. It is still not certain that Parliament will vote for an as yet not negotiated deal in the autumn. The Government is yet to pass any of the eight Brexit bills required to create UK powers to replace EU competences. In any event, the transition phase, as agreed recently, would see little change to anything in terms of laws and regulations until 2021, except that the UK would no longer be represented at EU summits, meetings, and in the European Parliament elections shortly after Brexit Day in 2019. As currently agreed in the draft withdrawal treaty, the official moment of EU departure will be 11pm UK time on 29th March 2019."
2018-03-28,The role of the Parole Board is to decide whether a prisoner is ready for release. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180328224159/https://news.sky.com/story/how-parole-board-rules-may-change-following-worboys-case-11307468,"It is an independent body that makes 25,000 decisions every year - many of which involve serious offences that have changed the lives of victims. In reaching its decision, the panel must decide whether the prisoner is no longer a risk to the public. To do this, members consider how the prisoner has changed and how well they can be rehabilitated in the community. These are difficult decisions, and they don't always get it right. The case of black cab rapist John Worboys is a case in point. When the Parole Board concluded he was eligible for release, there was much outrage and calls for a reform of the system. Justice Secretary David Gauke now says that's now certain to happen. One big change is regarding what's known as Rule 25, under which the Parole Board is not allowed to disclose the reasons behind its decisions to victims or the public. But given the Parole Board acts like a court with its hearings, there is a strong argument it should follow the principle of open justice, and there should be greater transparency with its operation. This is particularly important for victims who often want information and reassurance about the conditions of release. So Rule 25 will change, but there are arguments against full disclosure of the Parole Board's decision-making process. Some victims don't want details of their case made public, and there are also fears full disclosure could lead to vigilantism. It seems more likely summaries of decisions would be made public, as is the case in countries like Canada and New Zealand. There are calls for a wider review of the system which would also examine how the Board works and how expert and legal advice is used in decision-making. Whatever changes are made to the Parole Board following the Worboys case, many say it is crucial the Board maintains its independence. In commenting about the case, the now former chair of the Parole Board Nick Hardwick once argued: ""It would be a bad day for us all if people's rightful abhorrence of Worboys' crimes or even justified concern about a Parole Board decision allowed these basic principles of justice to be overturned."""

2018-03-29,TalkTalk is facing renewed calls to improve its cybersecurity after an anonymous hacker contacted Sky News about a website flaw that went unfixed for years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/talktalk-urged-to-improve-cybersecurity-in-wake-of-worryingly-easy-web-system-flaw-11307730,"The hacker - known as ""B"" - found a ""Cross Site Scripting"" error allowing him to take control of a convincing looking ""talktalk.co.uk"" URL, which meant he could potentially trick any of the company's webmail customers into thinking they were accessing an official TalkTalk website. He then showed us through a secure demonstration how easy it would be to steal a victim's login details, and any other sensitive information, if he could get the individual to click on the link. This could be done, he suggests, through targeting customers with email phishing techniques, or by circulating his own link around tech support forums or social media. TalkTalk fixed the flaw this week after Sky News got in touch, but it has come to light that the company was first alerted to the bug through a so-called ""bug bounty"" platform in March 2016. Bug bounties are rewards or cash given to hackers who alert companies that their website is vulnerable to attack. Speaking before the flaw was fixed, the hacker told Sky News: ""The vulnerability is worryingly easy to locate. The vulnerable page and parameters can be identified within seconds of looking at the website. ""After initially identifying it, we also discovered that it was submitted to a bug bounty platform in 2016. Relevant notification was issued to TalkTalk and we've made multiple attempts to get them to fix it. ""What I can't understand is why such neglect is applied to TalkTalk's website security. TalkTalk's website has a history of vulnerabilities. One would assume that after the attack in 2015, they would pay more attention to the state of their security."" The company was given a record ¬£400,000 fine by the Information Commissioner's Office after the major breach in October 2015, during which 157,000 customer details were stolen, including some bank details. The firm was told to ""be more diligent and more vigilant"", and was fined a further ¬£100,000 after data belonging to 21,000 customers was exposed to ""rogue"" staff at a call centre in India. The company admits that it knew about this latest security flaw but deemed the risk low enough to leave it un-patched. For some in the cybersecurity sector, the flaw should have been fixed no matter how low the perceived risk. Matthew Hickey, co-founder of Hacker House consultancy, said: ""I believe if somebody is masquerading information as though it comes from TalkTalk, then they have an obligation to protect their brand.

The broadcaster wants other firms to join it - and hopes the investment fund could be boosted up to ¬£100m. It comes as Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign - which aims to reduce the amount of single use plastics that end up in the sea - claims a major victory. Yesterday the government announced it would introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use bottles, subject to consultation. There are over 150 million tons of plastic in the world's oceans, and every year one million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals die from eating plastic or getting tangled in waste. By 2050, it is predicted that the total amount of plastic in the oceans will weigh more than the total amount of fish. Alongside the venture fund, Sky also announced it would be launching an ""innovators in residence"" project that would allow businesses to pilot and test their products at its London headquarters. The first company taking up the residency is Skipping Rocks Lab, a start-up which uses natural materials made from plants and seaweeds to reduce plastic packaging. It will test products such as juice and water contained in biodegradable seaweed orbs. Jeremy Darroch, Sky's group chief executive, said: ""We think it's time businesses stop dumping harmful plastic in to the sea and instead start pumping more money into innovation. ""Sky Ocean Ventures is a bold new creation that will support breakthrough thinking and invest in promising new ideas that will help turn off the plastics tap. ""We look forward to working with other like-minded organisations who can help us find and support innovators who are developing products, materials and business models that will create meaningful change.""  Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said the government's push to cut down on plastic waste had been inspired by Sky's campaign welcomed the company's new innovation fund. ""I look forward to seeing how innovation and creativity can help to turn the tide on plastic waste,"" he said. :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

2018-03-29,Australian cricket coach Darren Lehmann has tearfully resigned - just hours after disgraced former captain Steve Smith broke down before the world's media.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/devastated-former-australian-cricket-captain-steve-smith-cries-at-news-conference-11307929,"Lehmann will quit after the current Test series in South Africa after three players were sent home for ball-tampering. The Australian coach was cleared by Cricket Australia of having a role in the cheat scandal but told a news conference ""it's the right time to step away"". He said: ""I'm ultimately responsible for the culture of the team and I've been thinking about my position for a while. ""Despite telling media yesterday that I'm not resigning, after reviewing Steve and Cameron's hurting it's only fair that I make this decision. ""This will allow Cricket Australia to complete a full review into the culture of the team and allow them to implement changes to regain the trust of the Australian public. ""This is the right thing for Australian cricket."" Smith, who has been punished alongside former vice captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft, cried earlier as he said he ""hopes in time he can earn back respect and forgiveness"". Smith told a news conference at Sydney Airport: ""Cricket is the greatest sport in the world. ""It's been my life and I hope it can be again. ""I'm sorry and I'm absolutely devastated."" Smith added that he ""doesn't blame anyone"" and continued: ""I'm the captain of the Australian team. ""It's on my watch and I take responsibility for what happened last Saturday."" The banned cricketer cried when asked about how recent events had impacted his mum and dad, before telling gathered journalists the message he would send to children who love the sport. He said: ""I'll say two things, three things. ""Firstly, I'm deeply sorry, I love the game of cricket, I love entertaining young kids, I love kids wanting to play the great game of cricket that I love. ""The two other things is: any time you think about making a questionable decision, think about who you're affecting. You're affecting your parents and to see the way my old man's been, it hurts."" Smith then forgot the third point he intended to make before he broke down, adding: ""I can't remember what else."" Before leaving the conference he said: ""I just want to say I'm sorry for the pain that I guess I've brought to Australia and the fans and the public. ""It's devastating and I'm truly sorry."" Bancroft, who was caught on camera ball-tampering in the Test match against South Africa, told a news conference in Perth: ""I want to say that I'm very sorry. ""It is something I will regret for the rest of my life. All I can do is ask for forgiveness. ""I will do my best to contribute to the community."" Former vice-captain David Warner, regarded as the ringleader of the ball-tampering scandal, has apologised to fans ""all over the world"". Warner, who Cricket Australia said was responsible for the ""development"" of the cheating plans, tweeted that his actions were a ""stain on the game we all love"". Bancroft was captured on camera rubbing the ball with sandpaper, with it quickly emerging that the conspiracy was Warner's idea and involved a ""leadership group"" that included Smith and Bancroft. The press conferences came as the International Cricket Council announced it is launching a worldwide review of player conduct. Cricket Australia has banned Smith and Warner for 12 months for their roles in the ball-tampering plot, while Bancroft has been hit with a nine-month suspension. pic.twitter.com/BaB8vsSvif ICC chief executive David Richardson said: ""We've seen a number of incidents of poor player behaviour in recent weeks which has included ugly sledging, send-offs, dissent against umpires' decisions, a walk-off and ball tampering."" Richardson said recent weeks have been ""one of the worst periods in recent memory for consistently poor player behaviour and the global outcry in relation to the ball-tampering is a clear message to cricket: enough is enough"". The ICC will invite respected ex-internationals to join a panel to review the existing code of conduct in a bid to clarify and define what is expected of players."

However, Mr Hardwick has revealed he did not resign ""willingly"", and argued the ministry was equally responsible and should shoulder some of the blame. The MoJ pointed out that Justice Secretary David Gauke had apologised to Worboys' victims and acknowledged the department's failings after the judgment was handed down. Mr Hardwick, who was told by Mr Gauke that his position was untenable in a meeting on Tuesday, said: ""I don't think the Ministry of Justice is being correct in this. ""I absolutely accept that the Parole Board was at fault in these matters. ""I don't accept that we were any more at fault than the Ministry of Justice and I don't believe that the right lessons will be learnt from this case if the only people accepting any responsibility for the things that went wrong here is us,"" he told the BBC. He added: ""I don't think the Secretary of State should resign. I do think the Secretary of State should, as I've done, accept responsibility for the mistakes that were made because that is the only way that things will be put right."" Mr Hardwick said the MoJ failed to include the necessary information in a dossier of evidence assessed by the three-member panel that concluded Worboys was safe to be released. He said he had no personal role in the release decision. ""I wouldn't use the word scapegoated but what I would say is that all of those responsible for what went wrong in this case have to take their share of responsibility."" Worboys was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, an attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. He carried out his attacks between 2002 and 2008 and was given an indeterminate sentence - but late in 2017 the Parole Board decided it was safe to release him after he had served just 10 years. The decision was overturned when lawyers for two of his victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, argued the panel's decision to approve the 60-year-old's release was ""irrational""."
2018-03-29,Amazon has seen tens of billions of dollars wiped off its market value after Donald  Trump turned his fire on the online retailer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/trump-takes-amazon-to-task-on-tax-bill-11308192,"Shares were down by nearly 4% in early trading on Thursday as Mr Trump signalled ""concerns"" about the tech giant over its tax contributions and the threat it posed to smaller rivals. That took the company's market value down by more than $20bn. Later the shares partly recovered though they were still down by 1%. It added to a fall of more than 4% - knocking more than $30bn off the valuation - seen the day before, on a report that the President wanted to ""go after"" the company. The comments by Mr Trump in a tweet a day later appeared to add weight to the report. News website Axios said that Mr Trump is obsessed with the retail giant and wants to rein in its power. It follows criticism of Amazon by the President in the past over taxes and jobs. In his message on Twitter on Thursday, the President said that unlike others, Amazon ""pay little or no taxes"" to state and local governments, and that they were ""putting many thousands of retailers out of business"". I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business! The Axios report on Wednesday said Mr Trump had talked of using antitrust law to ""go after"" the company because he was worried about small family stores going under. It also said that he wanted to change Amazon's tax treatment - an issue he raised publicly last year when he called for an internet tax for online retailers, though Amazon already collects sales tax on items it sells direct to customers. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said when asked about the report that the President has ""said many times before he's always looking to create a level playing field for all businesses and this is no differerent"". But she added: ""There aren't any specific policies on the table at this time."" Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which Mr Trump has criticised as ""fake news"". The newspaper last year won a Pulitzer prize for an investigation into the President's donations to charities, which found that many of his philanthropic claims were exaggerated. Amazon is the latest major US tech stock to come under pressure after Facebook acknowledged earlier this month that millions of users' data had been improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica."

They say laughter and porridge are the keys to a long life. The supercentenarians have never met but have exchanged birthday cards for the last few years. It is not known which of the pair, who have lived through two World Wars and 29 general elections, was born first. Mr Weighton, an engineer for most of his working life, credits his longevity to laughter and a healthy dose of good fortune. He said: ""I have not lived my life avoiding being run over by buses or getting cancer or anything else. ""I've done nothing to deserve or achieve this age. ""I'm just one of the lucky ones."" He dismissed smoking as ""horrible"" after trying it in his early teens and said he ""never wanted to become rich"". He added: ""I think laughter is extremely important. ""Most of the trouble in the world is caused by people taking themselves too seriously."" Mr Weighton has spent time in Taiwan, Japan and Canada, and currently lives in a flat in a care home in Alton, Hampshire. He stays busy making windmills and ornaments at a workshop on site. The father-of-three, who is one of seven himself, has 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. Alfred Smith, from the village of St Madoes in Perthshire, was born in Invergowrie in 1908. He is the fifth of six sons. Mr Smith emigrated to Canada along with four of his brothers in 1927, but returned after five years and went on to drive lorries for his brother George. He served in the Home Guard during Second World War and married his wife Isobel when he was 29. Mrs Smith died more than 14 years ago aged 97. The couple ran a farm at Kinfauns where they raised two children, Irene and Allan. His son Allan, who worked with his father on the farm for 40 years, died in 2016. Mr Smith retired at the age of 70 but continued to go to the farm until well into his 80s. Asked for his secret to a long and happy life in an interview last year, he said: ""Porridge is helpful and having a job you enjoy. ""I like to think I've lived a decent life. ""I do ask myself - why me? Why have I lived so long when others haven't?"""
2018-03-29,Rapper DMX managed to avoid the maximum jail term for a $1.7m (¬£1.2m) tax evasion offence after a judge was persuaded to listen to one of his hit tracks to illustrate how tough his life had been.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/rapper-dmx-plays-judge-hit-track-slippin-before-being-jailed-for-tax-fraud-11307706,"The 47-year-old - real name Earl Simmons - managed to convince Judge Jed Rakoff to listen to Slippin' before deciding how to sentence him for tax fraud. DMX and some of his supporters nodded to the beat of the song as it played in the packed courtroom, with lyrics including: ""To live is to suffer, but to survive, well, that's to find meaning in the suffering."" The musical interlude, coupled with the US rapper's admission of guilt that he ""wasn't following the rules"" by not paying his taxes, appeared to have something of a worthwhile outcome. Prosecutors had been pushing for a five-year prison sentence, but Judge Rakoff settled on one year for someone he said was a ""good man"" who had been ""his own worst enemy"". Manhattan Federal Court had heard how DMX - whose 2003 song ,X Gon' Give It to Ya, was featured heavily in the hit Marvel film Deadpool in 2016 - had endured an abusive childhood and been abandoned by his mother at a young age. He had also battled a drug habit. The father-of-15 sobbed in the dock as he asked for leniency so he could spend more time with his 18-month-old son, who has a medical condition that has already required two operations. His lawyer, Murray Richman, wanted the ""model prisoner"" to be free so he could support his children and pay back the tax money he had avoided, but Judge Rakoff said his ""brazen and blatant"" crime could not go unpunished. Although he said he ""did not buy"" the rapper's claim that he did not realise how serious his offence was, he criticised prosecutors for trying to make him appear like a ""villain in a comic book"". In addition to the one-year jail term, he ordered DMX to pay $2.3m (¬£1.6m) to make up for the tax evasion."
2018-03-29,Victims of black cab rapist John Worboys have succeeded in blocking his release and forcing the Parole Board to rethink its decision to free him from jail.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/decision-to-free-black-cab-rapist-worboys-overturned-11307067,"Lawyers for two women, who cannot be named for legal reasons, argued the panel's decision to approve the 60-year-old's release was ""irrational"" and should be overturned. Three High Court judges upheld the legal challenge on Wednesday and ordered the Parole Board to reconsider its decision. It means Worboys - known as the black cab rapist after attacking victims in his hackney carriage - will remain in prison pending a fresh review. Judges said the panel ""should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending"" and examined how ""the limited way... he has described his offending may undermine his overall credibility and reliability"". They ordered the case be ""remitted to the Parole Board for fresh determination before a differently constituted panel"". Worboys was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years after he was convicted for 19 offences - including rape, sexual assault and drugging - for attacks on 12 women. But last year the Parole Board decided it was safe to release him after he had served only 10 years in prison. Police believe he committed crimes against 105 women between 2002 and 2008, when he was caught. The CPS decided not to overload the indictment against Worboys by prosecuting him for every attack. Dozens of women were told the prosecution would be more powerful if the court heard only the strongest cases. One of the victims who took the case to the High Court said after the judgment: ""It is the whole system that has failed. I feel like I have been let down at every step. ""As victims we should have been supported and not having to fight every step of the way in court."" She added that she was confident the Parole Board will now make the right decision on Worboys. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who brought the challenge with the victims via a judicial review, said the ruling would ""give some reassurance"" to Worboys' victims ""and to all Londoners"". Law firm Slater and Gordon represented 11 of Worboys' victims. Kim Harrison, a lawyer with the firm, said: ""We have said all along that Worboys is a manipulative and calculating individual who conned the Parole Board into granting his release. ""Our clients, who have been terrified that he will track them down after his release, can now sleep easy in their beds safe in the knowledge that this serial sex offender will be kept in jail where he belongs."" As the court announced its decision, Nick Hardwick quit as chairman of the Parole Board, saying he was ""sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case"", but asserted: ""I had no role in the decision of the panel in this case."" He added that both he and the panel were ""wrong"" to believe that only crimes for which Worboys had been convicted could be taken into consideration. The Parole Board said its ""members make incredibly difficult and complex decisions every day that can have a devastating impact on victims and the case of John Worboys is no different"". ""The courts have decided we must go back and look at this case again in light of additional information that wasn't before the original panel and we will do just that,"" it added. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he accepted the court ruling and would not be appealing it. He said he stood by his decision not to challenge the Parole Board because the ""victims succeeded in a different argument"". In light of the court's findings, Mr Gauke said he would be instructing officials to issue new guidance that ""all relevant evidence of past offending should be included in the dossier submitted to the Parole Board, including possibly police evidence"". He also announced that Parole Board rules will be examined in their entirety so victims can receive summaries of the decisions which have been made about offenders."
2018-03-29,The role of the Parole Board is to decide whether a prisoner is ready for release. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/how-parole-board-rules-may-change-following-worboys-case-11307468,"It is an independent body that makes 25,000 decisions every year - many of which involve serious offences that have changed the lives of victims. In reaching its decision, the panel must decide whether the prisoner is no longer a risk to the public. To do this, members consider how the prisoner has changed and how well they can be rehabilitated in the community. These are difficult decisions, and they don't always get it right. The case of black cab rapist John Worboys is a case in point. When the Parole Board concluded he was eligible for release, there was much outrage and calls for a reform of the system. Justice Secretary David Gauke now says that's now certain to happen. One big change is regarding what's known as Rule 25, under which the Parole Board is not allowed to disclose the reasons behind its decisions to victims or the public. But given the Parole Board acts like a court with its hearings, there is a strong argument it should follow the principle of open justice, and there should be greater transparency with its operation. This is particularly important for victims who often want information and reassurance about the conditions of release. So Rule 25 will change, but there are arguments against full disclosure of the Parole Board's decision-making process. Some victims don't want details of their case made public, and there are also fears full disclosure could lead to vigilantism. It seems more likely summaries of decisions would be made public, as is the case in countries like Canada and New Zealand. There are calls for a wider review of the system which would also examine how the Board works and how expert and legal advice is used in decision-making. Whatever changes are made to the Parole Board following the Worboys case, many say it is crucial the Board maintains its independence. In commenting about the case, the now former chair of the Parole Board Nick Hardwick once argued: ""It would be a bad day for us all if people's rightful abhorrence of Worboys' crimes or even justified concern about a Parole Board decision allowed these basic principles of justice to be overturned."""

Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith informed MPs of the U-turn on Thursday, in response to an urgent question from Labour MP Diana Johnson in the House of Commons. Earlier this week, victims told Sky News they were appalled and insulted that they would not receive support to help them inform the terms of reference of the public inquiry, which is due to begin later this year. More than 7,500 people, the majority of them haemophiliacs, were infected with HIV and Hepatitis C by contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. At least 2,400 have since died, in what has been described as the gravest scandal in NHS history. Last year, the Prime Minister announced there would be a public inquiry, to be chaired by Justice Brian Langstaff. Families and relatives have been seeking funding to cover legal advice during a consultation over the terms of reference of the inquiry, something that has been guaranteed to the Grenfell Tower victims. Last week, the Cabinet Office informed them that they would not be eligible for funding as Grenfell was ""exceptional"". However, that decision has now been reversed. Ms Smith told MPs: ""The infected blood inquiry is a priority for this Government. ""The infected blood tragedy of the '70s and '80s should never have happened and the victims of this tragedy who have suffered so much pain and hardship deserve answers. ""I can confirm that ministers have decided that reasonable expenses, properly incurred in respect of legal representation for the purpose of responding to the consultation of the infected blood inquiry, on the terms of reference prior to the setting up date, will be awarded. ""It will be up to the solicitor to the inquiry to determine these. I hope that is good news to the House."" Ms Johnson said the comparison with Grenfell Tower had been deeply hurtful to families. ""I welcome this decision, but wish that it had been made earlier,"" she said. ""This is a group of people who have battled for many, many years to get to this inquiry and we want to make sure the terms of reference reflect all the concerns that they had. ""The letter of March 23, drafted by her [Ms Smith's] civil servants, which tried to contrast Grenfell, which had been granted exceptional funding for the families, was somehow more deserving than this group of people and caused an enormous amount of hurt. ""Of course, we want to make sure the Grenfell families find out what happened, and 71 people died in that tragedy. ""But, in this case 2,400 people have already died and 70 have died since the inquiry was announced."""

The company had stunned investors earlier this month when it revealed a ¬£30m tax bill. PwC would likely be called in, according to insiders, barring a last-minute rescue by banks. Conviviality said: ""Further to the announcement on 28 March 2018, and following discussions with its lending banks, the board has resolved to file notice of intention to appoint administrators to the company. ""Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. ""The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice. ""The directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business."" It is understood any sale would likely be through an administration process. The announcements were made just days after Conviviality confirmed the departure of Diana Hunter, its chief executive, and said it would seek to raise ¬£125m from investors through a placing of new shares. A number of suppliers are understood to have deserted the company, which supplies drinks to thousands of pubs, undermining Investec's efforts to raise the new funding. Conviviality's shares had been suspended after the tax bill was disclosed to the stock market, leaving it with a market value of just ¬£185m. The company, which also owns the Wine Rack chain and the drinks wholesaler Matthew Clark, is a big player in the UK's beverages industry. It supplies more than 700 off licences and 23,000 pubs and restaurants across the country, and employs more than 2,600 people. Pub chains with contracts to be supplied by Conviviality reported on Wednesday that key deliveries ahead of the Easter period had failed to show up. The brewing giant AB InBev had urged shareholders to back the group's fundraising, underlining its importance as a distribution channel for the Budweiser and Stella Artois maker. Administration would mean the company becomes the latest retail sector failure following the collapse of Toys R Us UK and Maplin."

But both these Brexit Day messages, though understandable messaging from Number 10, are not yet the racing certainties that the PM tried to project today. And that is because of a decision that flowed from exactly this day one year ago. Brexit Day is also the anniversary of her signing of the Article 50 letter last year. That kickstarted a process that led to a walk in the Welsh hills and then a snap election and finally the loss of her majority that still makes both UK unity through Brexit and the one-year countdown a political promise rather than unavoidable destiny. That fragility evident in the PM's route map through the nations of the UK today. In Ayr in the morning, the PM met the high-value cashmere weavers seeking market share beyond Europe, but not the fisherman still angry at the transition within the Common Fisheries Policy with no say. In Northern Ireland, it was a visit to Bangor, over 50 miles away from the open border that may well define her next 12 months. In Wales, it was Aston Martin not the Welsh hill farmers concerned about what happened to almost every aspect of their business model post-Brexit. The newly-born lambs skipping through the hills right now will be sold into as yet uncertain post-Brexit trading arrangements, having been mainly exported entirely through frictionless borders to the rest of the European Union, up until now. There was a specific message to the devolved administration that has been somewhat lost in the negotiation with Brussels and within Cabinet in recent months. EU membership was hardwired into the devolution settlements for Holyrood, Cardiff and Stormont. It is possible to unpick that over time, but essentially the United Kingdom now needs to actually create a new, smaller UK single market with coherent standards and trading rules, to replace the systems that existed under shared EU membership. It requires new legislation and at times it will necessarily test those sensitive settlements and inevitably be described as a ""power grab"". The PM's trip seemed primarily aimed at assuaging such fears. But the call for unity may also fall on other types of deaf ear. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, for instance, told Sky News that the Government's Brexit strategy tactics and negotiations have been ""appallingly chaotic"" and ""wilfully negligent"" as he called on EU citizens to use the local elections to send a Brexit message to Theresa May. He said: ""EU citizens didn't get a chance to vote in the EU referendum, EU citizens didn't get a chance to vote in the General Election - this is their first chance to get a say, in what happens in the Brexit deal - this is your last chance to send a message to the Government - we do not want an extreme hard Brexit. ""And it's really important we send a message loud and clear to the Government - the course you are taking is bad for jobs, it's bad for London and the country."" Under EU law, EU citizens have the right to vote in local elections, including this year's bumper series in May across metropolitan areas including Greater London. No surprise then that the PM's last stop was to west London and an attempt to reassure Polish citizens settled in the capital. Then again, in Preston today, Trade Secretary Liam Fox was also celebrating the reincarnation of the ancient Board of Trade, ahead of the time in a year when he wins the power to start to negotiate trade deals with the US and China. His aim is to see the ""trade benefits spread across the UK with a year to go before Brexit"". ""Our job is to get Britain battle ready... for the opportunities that lie ahead,"" he told me. I suggested that not a great deal would actually be changing in a year's time because of the transition period. Mr Fox, never the biggest fan of transition, said: ""Of course, we will be an independent sovereign nation - business is now gearing up... for some of those opportunities out there."" Does all this mean that the transition period will definitely end by 2021? What happens if Parliament votes down the deal? ""If Parliament decides not to go with an agreement, we will simply leave without an agreement because we will still be leaving,"" he said. And therein lies the most crucial question of the next 12 months. What does happen if Parliament votes down the deal in a ""meaningful vote""? Mr Fox says we are still out in a year's time and needs to press that argument hard to ensure single market-friendly MPs do not rebel. The honest answer though - is that it is not entirely clear. Indeed the Government's Withdrawal Bill gives it latitude to change the exit date somewhat if negotiations are not concluded. So while Brexit Day may well have been joyous for some, and less so for others, there are still some surmountable but clear hurdles over the next 12 months."
2018-03-29,"Nearly two decades ago, Gavin Quinney and his wife sold their home in south London to move to a vineyard in France.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/im-a-british-winemaker-in-france-but-brexit-puts-my-future-at-risk-11307209,"They have gone on to make house wines for top chefs including Gordon Ramsay, but with Brexit threatening a hard border between Calais and Dover, they are worried about their future. With a year to go until Brexit becomes a reality, Gavin explains his fears about restrictions to freedom of movement: My wife and I sold our house in southwest London, and some shares in a UK computer company that I'd worked at for many years, and moved with our two small children to a 60-acre vineyard called Ch√¢teau Bauduc, near Bordeaux, in 1999. Of all the concerns we had - the language, viticulture, the harvest, winemaking, updating a winery, restoring a chateau, and the gite (cottage) to rent out, the bureaucracy, staff, schools, leaving family and friends behind, money, selling the stuff and so on - we never gave a moment's thought to our right to move here. We simply took freedom of movement for granted. We put our eldest, who was four, into the local 'maternelle' at very short notice with minimal paperwork. We've since had two more children and all have been educated in France. Meanwhile, we've built up the business and the wine has been the house wine at Gordon Ramsay, Rick Stein and Hotel du Vin in the UK for many years now. We also have over 2,000 private customers in Britain, with whom we also deal direct. Since the Brexit vote, the exchange rate has made life pretty tough as our prices have gone up in sterling terms, but of equal concern will be the customs arrangements after the proposed transition period at the end of 2020. We currently ship our wine to a UK bonded warehouse using an EU-wide online system, which took years to develop, which allows for duty and VAT to be charged at the point of delivery in member states. The prospect of a hard border at Dover and Calais, with more than four million lorries a year passing through and no new structures or new systems in place, is a shuddering thought for exporters and importers on both sides of the channel. As for freedom of movement, we couldn't have imagined that, 20 years after moving here, that would be that for future generations. For Britons currently living in the EU27, the majority feel hugely let down by HM Government and Parliament - especially those, like us, who were not allowed to vote (under the 15-year rule) in a referendum that could impact our futures the most. After Brexit, we will no longer have freedom of movement. We will be free to stay where we live, but not to move on. If, for example, we wanted to move to Spain or Italy in a few years (don't tell my wife), the surest way to do that, ironically, would be to apply for French citizenship now. Our two youngest children, who were both born here, have been given French (dual) citizenship by right this year. We too will apply but like for all Brits who qualify by having lived in France for five years or more, applying for French citizenship can be gruelling and usually takes two years. It's being viewed by many Brits as a last resort. Most of us feel very at home in our host nation, and are immensely grateful, but we feel fundamentally British and European, and not really French, British and European. But at least this way - however tough it many be - we can remain both British and EU citizens, so we should be grateful for that opportunity."

2018-03-29,Takeover specialist Melrose has won control of British engineering giant GKN after a bitter ¬£8.1bn battle for the company.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/melrose-claims-victory-in-gkn-takeover-battle-11308460,"Melrose clinched the cash and shares deal despite warnings from GKN's management, who vigorously resisted the approach, by going directly to shareholders with a hostile bid. Christopher Miller, Melrose's chairman, said the business would be in ""very good hands"" but Labour MP Jack Dromey said it was a ""bleak day for British industry"". Critics of the deal fear that the new owners could take an axe to jobs. The takeover is Britain's biggest hostile bid since Kraft snapped up confectionery giant Cadbury in 2009. Business Secretary Greg Clark secured assurances from Melrose about its plans during the bid process. Following the investor vote, Mr Clark said the Government now had a statutory duty to consider whether the takeover gave rise to public interest concerns, and that this would be assessed by the ""appropriate authorities"". GKN employs 60,000 people worldwide including 6,000 in the UK and has roots dating back to the Industrial Revolution, making munitions during the First World War and Spitfires in the Second. Today it manufactures components for aircraft makers including Airbus and Boeing and carmakers such as Volkswagen, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover - and its boss Anne Stevens had argued the bid approach was a high risk move that undervalued the business. But Melrose said that GKN's shareholders had been failed by management for years and that it could do better through a shake-up that would deliver stronger returns. Its business model is typically to break up companies once it has improved their performance. Airbus, GKN's biggest customer, has warned that it would struggle to work with it under a short-termist ownership model. Investors had until 1pm on Thursday to cast their ballots over GKN's future. Hours later, Melrose said it had received acceptances of its offer totalling 52.4% of voting rights. :: The key questions on the attempted hostile takeover of GKN Christopher Miller, Melrose's chairman, said it was ""delighted and grateful"" to have received backing for its plan to create a ""UK industrial powerhouse"" whose value it hopes to boost to more than ¬£10bn. He added: ""We are looking forward to working with GKN's talented workforce and to delivering for customers and all stakeholders. ""Melrose has made commitments as to investment in R&D, skills and people and we are very excited about putting these into action. ""Let me assure you that GKN is entering into very good hands."" GKN said that it ""now intends to work with Melrose to ensure the success of the enlarged company"". Shares closed 9.5% higher. Business Secretary Greg Clark has received a number of commitments from Melrose, including promises to maintain a UK head office and stock market listing, as well as pledges on paying taxes in the UK and on spending on research and development and apprenticeships. But Labour said the Government's action had been ""too little, too late"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: ""They could have intervened to stop this takeover, and they did not. ""As such, they have allowed a takeover to happen which may harm both our national security and industrial strategy."" Jack Dromey, MP for Birmingham Erdington, said: ""Today is a bleak day for British industry. ""The takeover makes a mockery of any talk by Government of an industrial strategy."" ""Britain's takeover rules are in desperate need of reform."" Mr Dromey said that the deal could have been prevented if rules had been in put in place by the Coalition Government meaning that shareholders could not vote unless they had held the stock for at least six months. ""Yet again, as in the Kraft takeover of Cadbury's, we have seen a jewel in the crown of British industry sold off because its shares were bought up by hedge funds,"" he said. The Business Secretary defended the takeover process. He said: ""As a competitive economy Britain has always had vigorous contests for the management of public companies. ""Competition for how a business should best be run drives efficiency and competitiveness, which is important for the economy and stakeholders."" Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace and defence trade body, said: ""This is a worrying time for GKN, its employees, pensioners, suppliers and customers. ""GKN is an important part of the UK industrial landscape and it is important that its owners continue to invest for the long-term and support high value jobs both directly and throughout its UK supply chain."" Based in Redditch, GKN has its biggest factory at Filton, near Bristol, with other locations including Cowes, Birmingham, and Luton."

Her admission comes as Mr Corbyn insisted he is not anti-Semitic after admitting there had been 300 cases of anti-Semitism referred within Labour since he became leader in 2015. Ms Shawcroft, a senior Momentum figure, claims she was unaware of all aspects of the case in which Alan Bull was accused of being responsible for a number of anti-Semitic posts on social media. One Facebook post was for an article entitled: ""International Red Cross Report Confirms the Holocaust of Six Million Jews is a Hoax."" Mr Bull said he was suspended based on ""doctored screenshots"", according to reports, and that he reposted an article for the purpose of debate. Ms Shawcroft, 62, apologised for calling for his suspension to be lifted. She only became chair of the disputes panel, which investigates anti-Semitism and harassment breaches, in January. ""I sent this email before being aware of the full information about this case and I had not been shown the image of his abhorrent Facebook post,"" she said. ""Had I seen this image, I would not have requested that the decision to suspend him be re-considered. I am deeply sorry for having done so. ""This week we have seen a clear expression of the pain and hurt that has been caused to Jewish members of our party and the wider Jewish community by anti-Semitic abuse and language, and by the reality of anti-Semitism being denied and downplayed by others. ""In light of this, I have decided to stand down as Chair of the Disputes Panel to ensure my wrong and misguided questions on this case do not cause doubt or anxiety about our processes. ""We must eliminate anti-Semitism from our party and wider society. ""To do this we must make sure our processes are as robust as possible and have the faith and confidence of our members."" Other political figures said she should be suspended from the Labour Party but Mr Corbyn's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said stepping down from the disputes committee was enough. Labour MPs John Mann and Louise Ellman, who is Jewish, have called for her to be kicked out of the party. Labour's Luton South MP, Gavin Shuker, wrote on Twitter: ""If this is true, Christine Shawcroft doesn't just need to step down from chairing the disputes panel; she needs referring to it."" Jennifer Gerber, director of the Labour Friends of Israel, said: ""Christine Shawcroft should be suspended from the Labour Party and kicked off the NEC."" Mr McDonnell told Sky News: ""Jeremy's asked her to stand down. She's stood down from the disputes committee and has moved on and accepted that she was wrong. ""Her position on the National Executive Committee, it's an elected position and it's up to the electorate to decide whether she should be elected again. ""We thought we'd put in a proper system to keep a check on anti-Semitism, but it hasn't been implemented properly and we've been open about this, saying this is not good enough. ""Let me be clear, we will not tolerate anti-Semitism or any form of racism in our party and we will be ruthless in rooting it out and that's what we will do."""

The carriage was topped with a bouquet of yellow sunflowers, while a tribute to one of Sir Ken's trademark Diddymen was alongside the coffin. Hundreds of mourners gathered under a big screen to watch proceedings from outside. In his address, the acting dean of Liverpool, Canon Myles Davies, said Sir Ken would have been ""so pleased, and probably humbled too, by the way his home city and people from all over poured out their tributes to him in these last weeks"". He said it was a ""wonderful tribute"" to someone who had spent his life ""persuading us all to exercise our chuckle muscles"". Among those attending the service were fellow comedians Jimmy Tarbuck, Stan Boardman, Les Dennis and Roy Chubby Brown. Tarbuck described Sir Ken as ""perhaps our city's greatest hero"", adding that it had been an ""honour"" and a ""joy"" to watch him. ""He was the greatest stage comic I've ever seen,"" he added. ""He never got giggle laughter, never little titters, there were roars of laughter like you've never heard. I've never seen anybody get laughs like him."" Roy Chubby Brown said he did not ""know anyone who didn't admire Ken Dodd"". Sir Ken was ""a Liverpool man"", said Stan Boardman. ""He stayed in Liverpool, was born in Liverpool and died in Liverpool. ""And (he was) respected by everyone in Liverpool, not just as a comedian but as a man. He was a great fella."" Actor Ricky Tomlinson said Sir Ken was ""a one off, wasn't he? You can't compare anyone with Doddy"". At the end of the service, children dressed as Diddymen followed Sir Ken's coffin as it was carried out of the cathedral. ""Ken always said his gift, his talents, were from God and comedians like Ken, they only come once in a lifetime,"" said comedian Jimmy Cricket.

2018-03-29,Footage of Kim Jong Un's diplomatic train has emerged following the North Korean leader's secretive trip to Beijing this week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180329232847/https://news.sky.com/story/bulletproof-with-a-maximum-speed-of-37mph-inside-kim-jong-uns-train-11307938,"The 21-car train carried the North Korean leader from Pyongyang to the Chinese capital on Sunday and was welcomed by an armed guard at Beijing Train Station on Monday. His two-day trip to China was Mr Kim's first overseas trip since he became leader in 2011. Speculation was rife at the beginning of the week after the dark green train was seen travelling through eastern China, passing straight through stations on its way to the capital. :: Kim Jong Un agrees date for summit with South:: China deletes praise for Kim's wife from internet It is believed to be bulletproof - just as Mr Kim's father and grandfather's trains were when they travelled on rare overseas trips. On Wednesday, the Chinese government confirmed the North Korean leader had been on a visit to Beijing and on Thursday Chinese state media released footage of the mysterious train. Intelligence reports have said Mr Kim has at least 90 high-security carriages which he can use, with three trains operating each time a leader travels - an advance security train, the leader's train and another with bodyguards and supplies. Because each carriage is bulletproof, the weight slows the train down, with an estimated maximum speed of just 37mph. The journey from Pyongyang to Beijing is about 685 miles so would have taken at least eighteen-and-a-half hours, passing through 20 train stations in North Korea built just for the leader's use, according to reports. The dining car is believed to be stocked full of wine and any cuisine which takes his fancy is available - he has a particular penchant for cheese following his education in Switzerland. Footage shows a handful of Chinese politicians greeting the dictator in the empty train station in central Beijing, which is larger than London Waterloo and usually just as busy. Mr Xi appeared to board the train to greet the North Korean leader in one of the carriages, with one of his assistants presenting Mr Kim with a bunch of flowers for his wife, Ri Sol Ju, who was behind him. The pair can be seen shaking hands as they both smile and then sit down in the carriage which has large mauve armchairs down each side. Both leaders were given extra wide armchairs compared to their delegations, who sat and laughed at appropriate times as the pair spoke. A woman dressed in a navy blue skirt suit, who appears to be North Korean, can be seen next to Mr Kim at all times, scribbling down what he is saying on a notepad. When the North Korean delegation eventually disembarked, Mr Kim walked down a small green ramp onto a red carpet lined with Chinese soldiers who saluted the leader. He and his wife walked before the Chinese team. During his trip the North Korean leader visited the Chinese Academy of Sciences, attended a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and was also thrown a banquet. He appeared to have a good time, waving goodbye from the train's window with a big grin on his face as he departed Beijing Train Station."

The car hire worker from Hayes, who also had traces of cannabis in his system, was doing 71mph in a 60mph zone and crashed into the boys with such force that they were thrown into the air. He admitted causing their deaths by dangerous driving. Families and friends of the boys filled London's Old Bailey to see Chudasama sentenced, with angry relatives of the victim labelling a ""coward"" for fleeing the scene. In a statement in court, Josh's mother, Tracy Blackwell, told him: ""You are going to rot in hell, mate,"" adding that the boys were killed in ""circumstances I can only describe as murder"".

""My brother was ruthlessly taken away with his two friends by a callous driver who got in a car knowing he was going to drive the vehicle under the influence."" The victims were among eight friends walking to a 16th birthday party at Goals five-a-side football club at around 8.40pm on 26 January. The defendant was ""driving like a bat out of hell"", according to another motorist, as he swung his Audi out to overtake on Shepiston Lane, lost control and hit the boys head-on. They were thrown into the air as the car spun around in the road three times. The court heard George suffered terrible head and neck injuries and died instantly, as did Josh, who was struck so hard that he was sent over a fence and into a cemetery. Harry was carried on the bonnet of the car which crashed into the cemetery wall, crushing his body. Chudasama, of Hayes, and his passenger got out and ran off, chased by other boys, who dragged him back to where their friends lay dying. One of the friends who was there at the time described ""flashbacks of seeing the boys' bodies catapulted in the air"". In mitigation, Leila Gaskin said Chudasama would be ""racked by guilt and remorse"" for the rest of his life. The court heard Parliament is considering proposals for life sentences for the most serious cases of causing death by dangerous driving."

He said the Kremlin ""underestimated the strength of global feeling"", adding: ""After all these provocations, this week was the moment when the world decided to say enough to the wearying barrage of Russian lies."""

Named locally as Jaiden, or JJ by his family, he was taken to hospital but died of his injuries shortly after. His devastated mother revealed on Facebook on Friday that it should have been his fourth birthday. The 23-year-old, who has a daughter called Miyah, wrote: ""Happy birthday my precious little man your 4 today. ""I hope you get all the presents you want in heaven and I'm sure great nanny will make you a birthday cake. ""I love you so much baby boy and I miss you, I hope you have a lovely day up there and your spoilt."" She also changed her profile picture to one of JJ. A fundraising page has been set up to help the family as they grieve for the little boy. The JustGiving page, set up by Susie Johnson, said they were raising ¬£1,000 ""to help James and his family for the tragic loss of his beautiful son"". By 1pm on Friday 102 people had donated ¬£1,726. A friend of JJ's dad, James Mangan, wrote a message of support from pals at Ferndown Boxing Club. Jay Weaver wrote: ""Yesterday we learned of a tragic event affecting one of our senior boxers, his 3 year old son (due to turn four today) was involved in a horrific road accident in Wareham. ""Myself, my family and our extended family at Ferndown ABC are heartbroken for James and all those affected. ""We want to do all we can to raise as much money as possible to assist in funeral arrangements and making sure James can be with his daughter and loved ones and grieve in his own space and time."" He told Mirror Online that Mr Mangan ""lived for his children"" and spent every penny on them. Dorset Police arrested a 43-year-old man from Basingstoke on suspicion of driving offences shortly after the incident just before 8.45am. He has been released under investigation. Detectives are asking any witnesses who saw the incident or saw how the lorry was being driven before the collision to come forward. :: Anybody with information should contact Dorset Police on scit@dorset.pnn.police.uk, call 101 quoting 29:65 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
2018-03-30,For the PM it was a chance to wish all four nations a very Happy Brexit Day.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180330234913/https://news.sky.com/story/uncertainty-persists-as-may-faces-clear-hurdles-despite-brexit-day-joy-11308787,"A message of both unity of the nations of the Union, and an attempt to signal certainty on the day of the Britain's formal exit from the European Union at 11pm on the 29 March 2019. But both these Brexit Day messages, though understandable messaging from Number 10, are not yet the racing certainties that the PM tried to project today. And that is because of a decision that flowed from exactly this day one year ago. Brexit Day is also the anniversary of her signing of the Article 50 letter last year. That kickstarted a process that led to a walk in the Welsh hills and then a snap election and finally the loss of her majority that still makes both UK unity through Brexit and the one-year countdown a political promise rather than unavoidable destiny. That fragility evident in the PM's route map through the nations of the UK today. In Ayr in the morning, the PM met the high-value cashmere weavers seeking market share beyond Europe, but not the fisherman still angry at the transition within the Common Fisheries Policy with no say. In Northern Ireland, it was a visit to Bangor, over 50 miles away from the open border that may well define her next 12 months. In Wales, it was Aston Martin not the Welsh hill farmers concerned about what happened to almost every aspect of their business model post-Brexit. The newly-born lambs skipping through the hills right now will be sold into as yet uncertain post-Brexit trading arrangements, having been mainly exported entirely through frictionless borders to the rest of the European Union, up until now. There was a specific message to the devolved administration that has been somewhat lost in the negotiation with Brussels and within Cabinet in recent months. EU membership was hardwired into the devolution settlements for Holyrood, Cardiff and Stormont. It is possible to unpick that over time, but essentially the United Kingdom now needs to actually create a new, smaller UK single market with coherent standards and trading rules, to replace the systems that existed under shared EU membership. It requires new legislation and at times it will necessarily test those sensitive settlements and inevitably be described as a ""power grab"". The PM's trip seemed primarily aimed at assuaging such fears. But the call for unity may also fall on other types of deaf ear. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, for instance, told Sky News that the Government's Brexit strategy tactics and negotiations have been ""appallingly chaotic"" and ""wilfully negligent"" as he called on EU citizens to use the local elections to send a Brexit message to Theresa May. He said: ""EU citizens didn't get a chance to vote in the EU referendum, EU citizens didn't get a chance to vote in the General Election - this is their first chance to get a say, in what happens in the Brexit deal - this is your last chance to send a message to the Government - we do not want an extreme hard Brexit. ""And it's really important we send a message loud and clear to the Government - the course you are taking is bad for jobs, it's bad for London and the country."" Under EU law, EU citizens have the right to vote in local elections, including this year's bumper series in May across metropolitan areas including Greater London. No surprise then that the PM's last stop was to west London and an attempt to reassure Polish citizens settled in the capital. Then again, in Preston today, Trade Secretary Liam Fox was also celebrating the reincarnation of the ancient Board of Trade, ahead of the time in a year when he wins the power to start to negotiate trade deals with the US and China. His aim is to see the ""trade benefits spread across the UK with a year to go before Brexit"". ""Our job is to get Britain battle ready... for the opportunities that lie ahead,"" he told me. I suggested that not a great deal would actually be changing in a year's time because of the transition period. Mr Fox, never the biggest fan of transition, said: ""Of course, we will be an independent sovereign nation - business is now gearing up... for some of those opportunities out there."" Does all this mean that the transition period will definitely end by 2021? What happens if Parliament votes down the deal? ""If Parliament decides not to go with an agreement, we will simply leave without an agreement because we will still be leaving,"" he said. And therein lies the most crucial question of the next 12 months. What does happen if Parliament votes down the deal in a ""meaningful vote""? Mr Fox says we are still out in a year's time and needs to press that argument hard to ensure single market-friendly MPs do not rebel. The honest answer though - is that it is not entirely clear. Indeed the Government's Withdrawal Bill gives it latitude to change the exit date somewhat if negotiations are not concluded. So while Brexit Day may well have been joyous for some, and less so for others, there are still some surmountable but clear hurdles over the next 12 months."
2018-03-30,Lindsay Lohan has lost her battle with the makers of hit video game Grand Theft Auto V for creating a character which she claimed shared her likeness.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180330234913/https://news.sky.com/story/lindsay-lohan-loses-court-appeal-over-likeness-of-grand-theft-auto-v-character-11308906,"A lawyer representing the actress argued that Take-Two Interactive Software, which owns Rockstar Games, violated her right to privacy by using ""look-a-like"" images of her in the game. However, New York's Court of Appeals ruled that satirical representations of a young woman, who was ""modern"" and ""beach-going"", were not identifiable as the Mean Girls star. The court upheld a ruling from a lower state appeals court, which dismissed her lawsuit. The court ruled the depictions were ""nothing more than cultural comment"" and said the game's makers did not owe any damages. The 31-year-old former child star had objected to the character Lacey Jonas, who calls herself ""really famous"", an ""actress slash singer"" and hides from photographers as part of the game, first released in 2013. She also took issue with the depiction of a blonde woman shown being frisked by a police officer and another wearing a red bikini and taking a selfie while flashing a peace sign. But Judge Eugene Fahey said Lohan's case could not prevail as the game merely showed a generic ""20-something"" woman, without suggesting it was her. ""The amended complaint was properly dismissed because the artistic renderings are indistinct, satirical representations of the style, look, and persona of a modern, beach-going young woman that are not reasonably identifiable as plaintiff,"" the judge ruled. Lohan's claims follow similar allegations against the company by Mob Wives star Karen Gravano, which were also thrown out in a separate ruling."

He also starred in five Carry On films and 1980s TV shows The Gaffer, Worzel Gummidge and Minder. Maynard initially retired from acting in 2000 after suffering a number of strokes, but returned to his role in Heartbeat spin-off The Royal in 2003. He chose his stage name as a reference to the makers of wine gum sweets. His daughter-in-law, actress Jacqueline Reddin, said: ""He was larger than life and he just loved showbiz. ""He was so proud of the fact that he had been working for 81 years."" Maynard, who was born in Surrey but lived most of his life in Leicestershire, leaves a son and daughter, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His first wife, Muriel Linnett, died from cancer to leave Maynard widowed. He went on to marry Tonia Bern, the widow of Donald Campbell, who died attempting a land speed record. Maynard first appeared on TV in 1953 in the BBC's Face The Music, while his varied career saw him placed fourth in the UK heat of the 1957 Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984, Maynard stood for election to Parliament as an independent Labour candidate in the Chesterfield by-election. He was beaten by former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn, whose candidacy Maynard stood to oppose. In 2015, having released an album of songs, Maynard told the Daily Express: ""I've done everything in this business from acting and singing to tap dancing, opera and one-man shows. ""People can't understand why I still want to work at my age and I tell them it's not work. I love it."" Ms Reddin told the Press Association her father-in-law had recently visited her and her husband in France, while he had been looking forward to the airing of an episode of BBC game show Pointless he filmed."

Rural communities risk becoming cut off and there is a chance power cuts will occur, affecting mobile phone service, the UK's national weather forecaster said. Outbreaks of rain and sleet are forecast for Saturday in the Midlands, Wales and southern England, with localised flooding and tricky driving conditions. There will be some respite from the bad weather on Sunday, which is expected to be mainly dry for the UK. The AA said because Easter falls early this year it is likely to be one of the busiest bank holiday weekends in recent years. An AA poll of more than 20,000 people found more than four out of five UK motorists were planning a leisure trip by car over the weekend, which equates to nearly 26 million drivers on the road. The group believes the longer gap between Easter and summer is encouraging more people to take advantage of the four-day weekend. A spokesman for the Met Office said: ""Obviously things are improving - the worst conditions are out of the way in terms of snow although we're looking at some chilly nights ahead. ""There will be some widespread frosts and temperatures could get down as low as -8C (17.6F) in northwestern parts of the UK overnight. ""The winds are turning around into a northerly, cutting off that very cold air so things are becoming less cold and less windy. ""In the next couple of days most places are going to be quieter and it could become fairly mild by Wednesday."" Highways England is removing 300 miles of roadworks from motorways and major A-roads to help those travelling by road. However, more than 400 projects will be carried out on the country's railways as part of a ¬£118m investment by Network Rail. Rail replacement buses will feature heavily across the country so passengers are advised to check online before they travel to stations. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said the rain on Sunday will move north through the night and into Monday, and, as it hits, the cold air over the UK it is likely to turn to snow. She added: ""At the moment the exact locations and amounts of snow expected are still uncertain, but areas most at risk are Wales, most of England and southern Scotland, where the Met Office has issued a yellow warning for snow. ""Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic and northern England will enjoy drier and brighter conditions through Good Friday and Saturday, although some showers are likely, especially to the northeast where they may be wintry over the high ground. ""The snow could potentially cause some travel disruption as some people return home from their Easter break. ""Some may be fed up with the wintry weather returning again, especially as snow is something most of us would expect to see in winter rather than spring. ""But we are actually more likely to experience snow in the UK at this time of the year. ""Statistics from the Met Office show on average snow or sleet falls for 3.9 days in December, but 4.2 days in March."""

She had been in a serious condition since the accident. Ms Boor, who ran a jewellery company called Kayla's Creations, was hit by the bricks after she dropped her son at school in Tower Hamlets.

Mr Bristow told reporters: ""I have just had a further discussion with the foreign ministry in Moscow about measures both sides have taken after events in Salisbury. ""I am not going to go into details... but we will study what we have been told and make our decisions accordingly."" He added: ""It is important to remember why this crisis has arisen in the first place. ""It's the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of the United Kingdom that has threatened the lives of a number of people in my country. We asked certain questions of the Russian state and have not received adequate answers.

It comes as Russia faces mass expulsions of its diplomatic staff around the world, with more than 150 sent back from 25 countries, and NATO. Ambassadors from Germany, Italy, Poland and France were also summoned to the ministry on Friday for talks. The ministry said it was summoning the envoys of countries which had taken ""unfriendly steps"" since the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Retaliatory measures were announced to ambassadors, with Germany losing four, Italy told it would lose two diplomats, and Finland to lose one. Other countries are expected to find out throughout the day how their own diplomatic missions will be affected. The German ambassador said they were open for dialogue with Russia, but said the country ""must respond"" to allegations about the Skripal poisoning. Russia has said it will respond by expelling the same number of diplomats from each country. The US Consulate in St Petersberg will also close and 60 diplomats have been expelled. Ms Skripal is understood to be conscious and talking having been poisoned with novichok while visiting her father in Salisbury. Police are treating the attack as attempted murder.

It takes a skilled village to raise a child with additional needs. Having a child with additional needs is rarely what a parent is hoping for when they are expecting a baby. You wonder about whether it'll be a boy or a girl, will it have lots of hair, or Dad's eyes? You don't really consider that you might one day get a diagnosis that will change your life because it formalises what you probably already knew: your child is different. When you have a child who needs extra support, you become more reliant on a lot of things: the services which are so often under threat, the support of your friends and family, even the kindness of strangers. :: :: 'My legal battle to protect autistic son's education' We have been incredibly lucky with the support we have received for our son. He is 10 now, and six years ago was diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum when concerns about delayed speech became concerns about delayed understanding, became autism. He had input from a speech and language therapist who helped us understand his communication and how to work with him to improve it - his speech is now normal. We had input from an occupational therapist who helped improve his writing - it's still pretty terrible, but it's improved. And he had a lot of support from his pre-school and his school, especially some amazing teaching assistants who showed extraordinary commitment to his development and helping him enjoy learning. That team, the specialists from the autism team, and a great group of friends who like him for who he is, are why he's now happy in school, and learning well. Children with additional needs can achieve amazing things, but only if everyone involved in their lives pull together as a team. I am the Special Educational Needs governor at my son's school, and I get more and more worried about children like him getting the right support, as staff numbers reduce and budgets are cut. As a society we need these children to grow into adults living independent lives, and that can't possibly happen without the right support in their early years. Every parent wants what's best for their child. What that looks like will vary from child to child, and some will face significant challenges their whole life. But a committed family and a committed school, with the right specialist support, will help a child with a disability reach for the stars. And surely that's what we all want?"

He goes on to say: ""All three Abrahamic faiths have known and continue to know the bitterness of persecution when religion has fallen into the barbaric grip of those who distort and misrepresent faith."" This is the first time the Prince has recorded a message to be released at Easter. He was inspired by discussions with religious leaders throughout the past 12 months, and by meeting people who have been forced to flee their homes after being targeted for their Christian beliefs, especially in the Middle East. In their annual report, Aid To The Church In Need described the actions of Islamic State and other Islamist militant groups in Iraq and Syria as genocide against Christians. John Pontifex from the charity said: ""The reality is that the persecution of Christians has got to the stage where the very presence of Christians in countries where they've lived, is now threatened to the extent that they may well disappear in our lifetime. ""And this is a terrible injustice for those people who believe they belong to the land. ""So we're talking about Syria, we're talking about Iraq, we're talking about other countries in the Middle East where there have been indigenous Christian communities right back almost to the time of Christ who are now threatened with extinction."" Sky News met Christine Denkji who grew up in Syria and now lives in London. The church has been a big part of her family life but she had to escape from Aleppo six years ago when the civil war made worshipping too dangerous. She told us: ""They took Christian girls, they raped them, they used them. Yeah it was bad. ""I told my mum and brothers... if anybody took me in and raped me, they usually do that and return the girl... I told them please kill me because I can't live with this anymore."" Last year in Egypt over 120 Coptic Christians were killed in attacks at Easter and close to Christmas. Archbishop Angaelos from the Coptic Orthodox Church hosted Prince Charles when he visited their cathedral in Stevenage five years ago. Speaking to Sky News, the Archbishop said Easter was an important time to remember the plight of those being persecuted. He said: ""At a time when we all gather as families and celebrate the things we have, to see and be reminded of the sufferings of others will have a great impact. ""Because the things we take for granted like families around us, like churches we can celebrate in, a faith we can have or indeed choose not to have, without any repercussions - seeing that other people don't have that luxury, will make us think again."" Prince Charles's Christian beliefs are very important to him, as is his commitment to interfaith work. In December he visited St Barnabas Church in Pimlico, London, an Anglican Church where Melkite Catholics also worship. Speaking during the service, the Prince said that no one should take for granted their own freedom to worship. It is a message he hopes will resonate with congregations across the country who are able to openly pray together this Easter weekend."

Taylor Fulton-Ward, 18, from Hertfordshire, who was flying to Dublin with her family for the Easter weekend, said: ""Announcements were telling us to leave the building, but the doors were not open - so people began pushing and panicking."" I honestly don't know who made all the calls tonight at #Stansted but that was so poorly managed. Bloody chaos and putting people through so much hell for nothing. No one got to fly!

Why did everything else fall apart?! pic.twitter.com/tfKkvRH9C8 We‚Äôre at RyanAir Gate 57 waiting with hundreds of people with no communication from anyone and we were just told that we now have to leave and go through security again because people had to go through security without being checked in order to evacuate. Evan Roth tweeted: ""We‚Äôre at RyanAir Gate 57 waiting with hundreds of people with no communication from anyone and we were just told that we now have to leave and go through security again because people had to go through security without being checked in order to evacuate.""

He later posted a photo showing a huge crowd, saying: ""What's happening? @STN_Airport we can't hear your announcements"". A spokesman for the airport said some exits were cordoned off to protect passengers from the burning bus, which was very close to some of the doors, but staff were doing all they could to guide passengers to alternative exits.

We are aware of a story circulating on social media. Please be advised that Metropolitan Police are not conducting a search of an Airbus inbound from Moscow at Heathrow. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said British authorities did not state a reason for the search of the Aeroflot plane, which she called ""the latest provocation."" She claims the jet was searched at a London airport. The news comes as Russia continues to expel foreign diplomats in a tit-for-tat response to countries across the world sending home Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain following the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Russia faces mass expulsions of its diplomatic staff around the world, with more than 150 sent back from 25 countries, and NATO. Britain's ambassador to Russia was been summoned to the country's foreign ministry for talks - as were ambassadors from other nations, including Germany, Italy, Poland and France. Laurie Bristow confirmed the UK had been given one month to cut its diplomatic mission to Russia to the same size as the Russian mission to Britain. He said: ""It is important to remember why this crisis has arisen in the first place. ""It's the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of the United Kingdom that has threatened the lives of a number of people in my country. We asked certain questions of the Russian state and have not received adequate answers."" Ms Skripal is understood to be conscious and talking having been poisoned with novichok while visiting her father in Salisbury. Police are treating the attack as attempted murder. Mr Skripal, a former Russian spy, has been in a critical condition since 4 March."

Some 39 Labour MPs and peers have written to Mr Corbyn urging him to suspend a close ally from Labour's ruling body. The group wants Christine Shawcroft removed from the National Executive Committee after she backed a local council candidate accused of anti-Semitic social media posts. In his Passover message, Mr Corbyn described the holiday as ""a time to celebrate a journey from oppression to freedom"". In a video published on his social media channels, the Labour leader said: ""We remember all our Jewish brothers and sisters, who have battled against discrimination and faced the most horrific acts of violence and mass murder."" Mr Corbyn also spoke of anti-Semitism around the world, as he highlighted new Polish laws making it illegal to acknowledge the country's complicity in the Holocaust, along with the rise of the National Front in France and the murder of a Holocaust survivor in Paris. He added: ""It is easy to denounce anti-Semitism when you see it in other countries, in other political movements. ""It is sometimes harder to see it when it is closer to home. ""We in the labour movement will never be complacent about anti-Semitism. We all need to do better. ""I am committed to ensuring the Labour Party is a welcoming and secure place for Jewish people. ""And I hope this Passover will mark a move to stronger and closer relations between us and everyone in the Jewish community. ""In the fight against anti-Semitism, I am your ally and I always will be."" In his two previous Passover messages as Labour leader, in 2016 and 2017, Mr Corbyn did not explicitly mention anti-Semitism. Meanwhile, amid recent allegations that have put fresh pressure on Mr Corbyn this week, the Labour leader's office has declined interviews with Sky News. Mr Corbyn also failed to make an appearance at a scheduled event at a housing development on Thursday, where broadcasters had sent cameras. On Monday, the Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) and the Board of Deputies for British Jews organised a demonstration outside Parliament against Mr Corbyn's handling of anti-Semitism within Labour. It came after Mr Corbyn apologised when it emerged he had questioned the removal of an anti-Semitic mural from east London in a Facebook post. On Thursday, Labour peer and TV scientist Lord Winston claimed Mr Corbyn has ""encouraged anti-Semites and he's endorsed them"". The Labour leader has offered an urgent meeting with the two groups and told Jewish leaders he is ""sincerely sorry"". They have demanded Mr Corbyn publicly condemn people vilifying those who protested outside Parliament, telling him they ""are largely doing so in your name"". They have also told the Labour leader it is essential any meeting leads to ""concrete practical outcomes"". In his own Passover message, JLC chairman Jonathan Goldstein said he hoped the holiday ""will be the point at which it once again becomes unacceptable to peddle and hold anti-Semitic views"". He added: ""The writing has been on the mural for some time. ""Jeremy Corbyn described himself as a 'militant opponent of anti-Semitism', and as an 'ally' in our fight. ""If he truly means what he says, he will have no problem in agreeing to the entirely reasonable requests of what we want a meeting with him to achieve. ""Our fight needs to become his too."""

The Trust said that the 33-year-old had responded well to treatment but her father Sergei, 66, remains in a critical but stable condition. As Ms Skripal continues her recovery, the authorities will be hopeful that she might be able to give a vital insight into the moments leading up to the attack. :: Russian retaliation marks 'deterioration' in ties The pair were found unresponsive and taken to Salisbury District Hospital after being attacked with nerve agent novichok on 4 March. Hospital medical director Dr Christine Blanshard said that, though Ms Skripal's condition had improved, she ""continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day"". :: 'Strong signal to Kremlin' as NATO and 27 countries expel Russian diplomats It comes as officers investigating the attempted murder of the Skripals cordoned off a play area close to their home in Salisbury. ""I would like to reassure residents that we have placed the cordons around the park, and officers will be searching it, as a precautionary measure,"" Met Police deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon said. ""I would like to reiterate Public Health England's advice that the risk to the public is low. ""Anyone with concerns regarding the ongoing police activity in Salisbury is encouraged to speak to the local officers or PCSOs at the locations, who will be happy to offer reassurance."" :: 'Strong signal to Kremlin' as NATO and 27 countries expel Russian diplomats On Wednesday night, detectives revealed that they believe Sergei and Yulia Skripal first came into contact with the nerve agent from their front door. ""We are therefore focusing much of our efforts in and around their address,"" Mr Haydon said. ""Those living in the Skripals' neighbourhood can expect to see officers carrying out searches as part of this but I want to reassure them that the risk remains low."" Sky News pictures have since shown Mr Skripal's house boarded up. The nerve agent attack has led to increased tensions between the UK and Russia, with Britain accusing Moscow of being behind the attempted murder. Russia denies any involvement in the attack, which also seriously hurt the first police officer to arrive at the scene. Dozens of countries have shown support for the UK by expelling Russian diplomats in response. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that nations were saying ""enough is enough"" after ""years of vexation and provocation"" which had ""worn the collective patience to breaking point"". He said the Kremlin ""underestimated the strength of global feeling"", adding: ""After all these provocations, this week was the moment when the world decided to say enough to the wearying barrage of Russian lies."""
2018-03-30,The Government has drafted in experts from Finland in an effort to help meet their commitment to eliminate rough sleeping within the next decade.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180330234913/https://news.sky.com/story/england-to-copy-finland-in-bid-to-end-homelessness-11309268,"The Scandinavian country is the only EU member state to have seen a decline in homelessness in recent years. Meanwhile, in England, rough sleeping has increased for the seventh consecutive year, with official figures revealing more than 4,700 people slept outside in 2017, up 15% on the previous year. The Government hopes a new taskforce and a ¬£30m fund for those local authorities with high levels of rough sleeping, announced on Friday, will see them fulfil a promise to halve the number of rough sleepers by 2022 and eliminate the problem completely by 2027. Speaking to Sky News, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid claimed rough sleeping was ""completely unacceptable"" in a country as rich as Britain. He said the ""very complex"" causes of rough sleeping included high house prices, mental health issues, drug or alcohol addiction, and family breakdown. The Cabinet minister also admitted there is ""no question"" local authorities have faced ""challenging times"" due to budget squeezes in recent years, as he stressed the importance of the new ¬£30m fund being ""ring-fenced"". The new Rough Sleeping Team, drawn from across Government, will include experts from charities who ""have worked in this area for years, in some cases decades, and other experts, including international experts"", Mr Javid said. He added: ""For example, from Finland, where they have eliminated rough sleeping, I think we can learn lessons there. ""We need action on many fronts. One is to deal and help with those people that are on the streets now, completely unacceptable in a country like ours, as rich as ours today. ""But, also with the causes, because we don't want to see more people going on to the streets."" Mr Javid visited Finland last year in order to learn about the country's Housing First strategy, where rough sleepers are given a stable home. This approach is now being piloted in Liverpool, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. The Government's Homelessness Reduction Act, which comes into effect next week, places new legal duties on English councils to intervene at an earlier stage to prevent homelessness. Mr Javid also stressed of the need for ""joined-up government"" in dealing with rough sleeping, as he spoke of the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS being ""fully engaged"" if rough sleepers are found to have mental health problems. Highlighting how up to 30% of rough sleepers in London are ex-offenders, he added: ""When we release prisoners, many of them will not go on straight into accommodation, and it is actually possible, if you work harder, to identify those that are at risk of rough sleeping and to take action up front so they don't end up on the streets."" Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""You can't help the homeless if you won't provide the homes, and the money announced here is less than 1% of the Conservatives' annual cut to funding for new low-cost housing."" Greg Beales, campaigns director at homelessness charity Shelter, said the new measures would make ""a genuine difference"", but added: ""Most of these people became homeless simply because they couldn't afford anywhere to live, a situation made far worse by welfare cuts. ""We very much hope that the Government's new strategy will go far enough in removing the barriers that deny people a safe, secure and affordable home. ""That means building more social homes to rent, and making sure housing benefit is fit for purpose."""

He was sentenced in the Baiyin Intermediate People's Court for multiple counts of homicide, rape, robbery and mutilation of corpses. His crimes were committed in northwest China's Baiyin city in Gansu Province and Baotou city in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region between 1988 and 2002. The youngest victim was just eight years old. During Gao's two-day trial last year, his lawyer Zhu Aijun told Beijing News that Gao ""bowed towards the victims' families three times while confessing"". He said he could not afford the compensation, but was willing to donate his organs, the newspaper added. Police had linked Gao's crimes in 2004, saying at the time: ""The suspect has a sexual perversion and hates women. ""He's reclusive and unsociable, but patient."" Gao was tracked down and arrested in August 2016, after a relative was arrested on an unrelated crime and his DNA was collected and tested. Police said the DNA suggested the killer was a relation, and after Gao's DNA was taken it matched that collected at the crime scenes. One of his two sons told local media that his father had experienced ""bitter suffering"" in his youth, failing to become a pilot for ""political reasons"". The original Jack the Ripper was a serial killer active in east London in the late Victorian era and, while he is believed to have murdered five women, no one was ever caught."

She suffered a fracture which aggravated her foot fibromyalgia and depressive illness, preventing her from working and resulting in her contract being terminated. The case was brought against the local authority for failing to provide proper work equipment. Another teacher, from the Midlands, also received ¬£250,000 after being subjected to violence and bad pupil behaviour for four years. This led to the teacher's ""steadily worsening health and eventual breakdown"" while the local authority failed to help manage behaviour or carry out a formal risk assessment, according to the National Union of Teachers (NUT). The compensation figures cover accidents and discrimination at schools last year, including: :: Almost ¬£85,000 for a teacher who slipped on untreated black ice at the door to her classroom :: A 53-year-old teacher in Essex was awarded ¬£60,000 after she slipped and fell on a food and liquid spillage as she made her way from a science lab. :: An academy worker in the North East was given nearly ¬£50,000 after a ""prolonged assault"" by a teenage girl who had been told to stop chewing gum. This included blows to the stomach and hand, leaving the teacher with bruises, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. :: A trainee teacher given ¬£35,000 after claims she was fired or discriminated against due to her pregnancy. Chris Keates, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: ""Not only does the union continue to pursue employers who are negligent in terms of the health and welfare of members, but we are also now seeing a significant increase in the number of members with protected characteristics being subjected to discriminatory treatment."" These characteristics include age, disability and race. Ms Keates added: ""The scale of discrimination and prejudice is deeply disturbing and it is likely that this is only the tip of the iceberg."""
2018-03-30,Parents of children with special education needs and disabilities (SEND) across the country are waiting for local councils to make crucial budget decisions which could affect their futures.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180330234913/https://news.sky.com/story/time-to-stand-up-for-special-needs-funding-11308961,"Many councils will be left facing funding gaps for SEND provision under the Government's new school funding formula. For example, Bradford Council has formulated a model on the expectation that it would receive ¬£15m of funding, but it will actually only receive around half of that. Shain Wells' son Mitchell has autism and is educated in a mainstream school, but he has additional care from specially trained key workers. Shain is frustrated by the lack of funding which she says will not just affect children with special education needs. ""This isn't just about our kids, this is about the kids in their classroom with them,"" she said. ""It's great that children with additional needs are educated in mainstream schools, and that they're not shut away in ghettoes. ""It's an incredibly positive thing, but that only works if the mainstream school they're in is properly supported."" :: 'My legal battle to protect autistic son's education' Bradford Council will discuss its revised model for SEND provision next week, and it will warn that changes to funding arrangements at a national level mean that resources for the Bradford district will be lower than anticipated in the future. Councillor Imran Khan, deputy leader and portfolio holder for education, employment and skills, said: ""Central government has changed the way it provides funding for these services. ""From April 2018 a new national funding formula for children and young people with SEND will come into effect. ""Under this new formula Bradford should be receiving an additional ¬£15m to meet current levels of pupil-need but the Government is only making half that available - ¬£7.5m. ""We need to make the best use of the resources we have so the model for delivering specialist teaching support is sustainable and affordable in the future."" It is a picture familiar to parents of children needing additional support across the country. Alicia McColl's son Kian also has autism. Their council in Surrey is also facing a funding shortfall, and services are to be reduced. Alicia has resorted to crowd funding to challenge the council's budget decisions. ""I do believe the local authority are underfunded by central government, absolutely,"" she says. ""There are lots of laws to protect children with special needs and those laws dictate that whatever is in the document that states the support they are going to get, they have to get that support. ""Cutting funding for something that they legally have to provide is going to leave the children of parents who don't understand the law without the support they need - it will fail the weakest in society."" In reply, a Surrey County Council spokesman said: ""We are currently considering our response, but as ever our main focus is making sure children get the support they need."" It is not just a problem in Bradford and Surrey. Special education provision is being squeezed across the country - from a reduction of transport for children with special needs in Leicester, to huge cuts in SEND funding in Hackney, to Lancashire Council's scathing OFSTED report for its special needs provision. Educators say the answer is painfully simple: more funding. Anne Heavey, education policy adviser for the National Education Union, says: ""We have never seen a situation when we can look at a child's need and deliver the support they need in a timely and efficient fashion for them to thrive. ""For too long, children with SEND have been less likely to succeed in exams, to access good quality college or university places, and to access the workplace. ""They are at high risk of exclusion, high risk of loneliness and mental health problems. ""We have never got this right - it's time we stood up and got the money we need to do it well."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Core schools and high needs funding has been protected in real terms per pupil and will rise to its highest ever level - over ¬£43bn in 2020, 50% more per pupil spending in real terms than in 2000. ""Local authorities now have more money for every pupil in every school.‚Äé ""In 2017-18, we added an additional ¬£130m to the high needs budget for pupils with special educational needs and in 2018-19, this will rise by ¬£142m to a total of ¬£6bn across England."" The Government says it is committed to spending more. But for thousands of parents, and their children, it is still not enough. Back in Yorkshire, Shain Wells says the funding cuts are short-sighted, and will lead to a greater burden on the country's finances in years to come. ""It's not a gift, it's not charity, it's an investment in children,"" she said. ""You get more independent adults who are more likely to go into work, more likely to live independently. ""You will not have to support them in adult social care for 60 years."""

The biblical text ended with the lines: ""I have seen the business that God has given to the sons of men to be busy with. ""He has made everything beautiful in its time; also he has put eternity into man's mind."" Professor Hawking's children, Tim, Robert and Lucy, were among those at the service, along with celebrities including model Lily Cole, Queen guitarist Brian May and comedian Dara O Briain, who made a documentary about the physicist. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett were on the guest list, while Astronomer Royal Martin Rees also spoke during the service. Professor Hawking died peacefully in his sleep earlier this month aged 76. Prior to the funeral, hundreds of people lined the streets around the University Church of St Mary the Great, near to Gonville and Caius College where Prof Hawking was a fellow for 52 years. The watching crowd broke into spontaneous applause as Professor Hawking's coffin, topped with white ""Universe"" lilies and white ""Polar Star"" roses and carried by porters from the University of Cambridge, was taken into the church. The church bell had tolled 76 times, once for each year of the physicist's life, as the hearse arrived outside the church, while the colleges' flags flew at half mast in his honour. The Gonville and Caius College choir sang Beyond The Night Sky, a song the college commissioned as a gift for Professor Hawking for his 75th birthday last year. Its lyrics include quotes from A Brief History of Time, which especially pleased Professor Hawking, who said of the song: ""It takes us all on a mental journey around the universe."" The physicist, born in Oxford in 1942, was 21 years old when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 1963 and given just two years to live. He was forced into a wheelchair by the debilitating disease, and, as his condition worsened, had to resort to speaking through a voice synthesizer and communicating by moving his eyebrows. Undaunted, he went on to study cosmology at Cambridge and became one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Albert Einstein. His 1988 book A Brief History Of Time sold 10m copies and was translated into 35 languages. Prof Hawking's ashes will be interred close to the remains of Sir Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey in June."

The pair hit out at the ""audacity"" of the UK Government for its ""illegal"" decision to strip them of their British citizenship in February. Although it was widely reported, officials have not confirmed or denied it was the case. The men are accused of being two of four members of the ""Beatles"" group, which is believed to have captured, tortured and killed hostages, including aid workers and journalists. They were allegedly in the same group as Mohammed Emwazi - dubbed ""Jihadi John"" - who died in a 2015 drone strike in Raqqa. The pair have not admitted to being involved in any hostage-takings or beheadings and said the allegations against them were media ""propaganda"". However they did speak of their membership of Islamic State. Kotey, from west London, said the killing of western hostages in Syria was ""regrettable"" and could have been avoided, adding that many people within IS would have disagreed with the killings. He said there was ""probably more benefit"" in those captured being used as political prisoners. ""I didn't see the benefit in executing them,"" he said, before blaming Western governments for failing to negotiate and noting that some hostages were released for ransoms. The ""Beatles"" cell is believed to have kept more than 20 Westerners hostage, and tortured and killed American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers in 2014 and 2015. The victims included US photojournalist James Foley, American journalist Steven Sotloff, US humanitarian worker Peter Kassig, and UK aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. Elsheikh, from west London, travelled to Syria in 2012, initially to join an al Qaeda branch before moving to IS, according to US State Department documents, which said he ""earned a reputation for waterboarding"". They also claim Kotey served as a guard for the IS cell and was ""likely engaged in the group's executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods"". The men criticised the media over the ""Beatles"" allegations and said the claims were concocted as a pretext to kill them with drone strikes. ""No fair trial, when I am 'the Beatle' in the media. No fair trial,"" Elsheikh said, who added the loss of their citizenship meant they were now open to ""rendition and torture"". He said: ""Being taken to any foreign land and treated in anyway and having nobody to vouch for you. ""When you have these two guys who don't even have any citizenship... if we just disappear one day, where is my mum going to go and say where is my son?"" The capture of Kotey and Elsheikh has since sparked a debate about where they should be tried. The US has called for the home countries of foreign jihadis to take their nationals back for trial. However, the UK Government has signalled the pair should not be allowed back into the country. Associated Press reporter Andrea Rosa, who interviewed the pair, told Sky News: ""It was a bit confrontational I would say at the beginning, they would not speak or even answer our questions at the beginning."" He added: ""Because I felt that they were like afraid of something, of an interrogation, they looked at us more as if we were like interrogators rather than journalists."" Mr Rosa continued: ""But eventually it was all good and I think they were kind of also probably happy to be out of the prison for a while."" When asked if he questioned the pair about the horrific crimes are they accused of, Mr Rosa replied: ""We asked those sorts of questions of course but they would not comment on anything like that. ""They wouldn't comment on anything related to their role or job in Islamic State. ""They didn't deny being part of Islamic State. ""But they labelled most of these allegations as media propaganda."" Speaking to Sky News, Lt Col Chris Parker, who is a former chief of staff for the Desert Rats, said of the two militants: ""They look rather unfrightening and pathetic. The interesting thing I found as a former military man is that they didn't seem in anyway committed and they weren't coming out with their ideology. ""These people seemed more concerned about what their mum was going to do. It was quite ridiculous."" He added: ""I would welcome a trial in Britain to allow the British public to hear what utter nonsense this whole ideology is all about. Let's get it all out in the open and I think that would help prevent people...taking up this ideology which is clearly poisonous."""
2018-03-31,"Snow is expected to hit most of the UK on Easter Monday, causing problems on what is expected to be an unusually busy bank holiday on the roads.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/white-easter-snow-forecast-for-much-of-uk-11309260,"The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for snow for Bank Holiday Monday across most of England, Wales and southern Scotland. Rural communities risk becoming cut off and there is a chance power cuts will occur, affecting mobile phone service, the UK's national weather forecaster said. Outbreaks of rain and sleet are forecast for Saturday in the Midlands, Wales and southern England, with localised flooding and tricky driving conditions. There will be some respite from the bad weather on Sunday, which is expected to be mainly dry for the UK. The AA said because Easter falls early this year it is likely to be one of the busiest bank holiday weekends in recent years. An AA poll of more than 20,000 people found more than four out of five UK motorists were planning a leisure trip by car over the weekend, which equates to nearly 26 million drivers on the road. The group believes the longer gap between Easter and summer is encouraging more people to take advantage of the four-day weekend. A spokesman for the Met Office said: ""Obviously things are improving - the worst conditions are out of the way in terms of snow although we're looking at some chilly nights ahead. ""There will be some widespread frosts and temperatures could get down as low as -8C (17.6F) in northwestern parts of the UK overnight. ""The winds are turning around into a northerly, cutting off that very cold air so things are becoming less cold and less windy. ""In the next couple of days most places are going to be quieter and it could become fairly mild by Wednesday."" Highways England is removing 300 miles of roadworks from motorways and major A-roads to help those travelling by road. However, more than 400 projects will be carried out on the country's railways as part of a ¬£118m investment by Network Rail. Rail replacement buses will feature heavily across the country so passengers are advised to check online before they travel to stations. Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said the rain on Sunday will move north through the night and into Monday, and, as it hits, the cold air over the UK it is likely to turn to snow. She added: ""At the moment the exact locations and amounts of snow expected are still uncertain, but areas most at risk are Wales, most of England and southern Scotland, where the Met Office has issued a yellow warning for snow. ""Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic and northern England will enjoy drier and brighter conditions through Good Friday and Saturday, although some showers are likely, especially to the northeast where they may be wintry over the high ground. ""The snow could potentially cause some travel disruption as some people return home from their Easter break. ""Some may be fed up with the wintry weather returning again, especially as snow is something most of us would expect to see in winter rather than spring. ""But we are actually more likely to experience snow in the UK at this time of the year. ""Statistics from the Met Office show on average snow or sleet falls for 3.9 days in December, but 4.2 days in March."""

He also starred in five Carry On films and 1980s TV shows The Gaffer, Worzel Gummidge and Minder. Maynard initially retired from acting in 2000 after suffering a number of strokes, but returned to his role in Heartbeat spin-off The Royal in 2003. He chose his stage name as a reference to the makers of wine gum sweets. His daughter-in-law, actress Jacqueline Reddin, said: ""He was larger than life and he just loved showbiz. ""He was so proud of the fact that he had been working for 81 years."" Maynard, who was born in Surrey but lived most of his life in Leicestershire, leaves a son and daughter, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His first wife, Muriel Linnett, died from cancer to leave Maynard widowed. He went on to marry Tonia Bern, the widow of Donald Campbell, who died attempting a land speed record. Maynard first appeared on TV in 1953 in the BBC's Face The Music, while his varied career saw him placed fourth in the UK heat of the 1957 Eurovision Song Contest. In 1984, Maynard stood for election to Parliament as an independent Labour candidate in the Chesterfield by-election. He was beaten by former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn, whose candidacy Maynard stood to oppose. In 2015, having released an album of songs, Maynard told the Daily Express: ""I've done everything in this business from acting and singing to tap dancing, opera and one-man shows. ""People can't understand why I still want to work at my age and I tell them it's not work. I love it."" Ms Reddin told the Press Association her father-in-law had recently visited her and her husband in France, while he had been looking forward to the airing of an episode of BBC game show Pointless he filmed."

Teasing that he had ""twice as much work to do"", Donnelly introduced actor Stephen Merchant as the show's announcer following a performance by Paloma Faith. Later in the show he quipped he'd have to look conclude the programme himself, saying: ""I'll have to do it myself, like everything else this week."" Just a little photo to prove that we don‚Äôt just wing it, there is actually a script! #SaturdayNightTakeaway pic.twitter.com/1pTOJsEUtP Before kicking off a game that required knowledge of current affairs, Donnelly asked the contestant if she had watched the news this week. She said no, to which Donnelly replied: ""For some of us it's been unavoidable."" Early on in the show, Donnelly showed audiences the soon-to-be closed studio he, McPartlin and Cat Deeley presented a children's TV programme in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Before the programme, Saturday Night Takeaway's Twitter account posted a picture of the evening's script that only featured Donnelly's name.

The crash involved two other cars and resulted in a child in one of the vehicles being taken to hospital as a precaution. The child is believed to be a three-year-old girl. Others involved were treated at the scene for minor injuries. ITV suspended Saturday Night Takeaway for a week as result of the police investigation. McPartlin's publicist said the star would be taking time out from his TV commitments. Donnelly said in a statement that part of the motivation to air the last two episodes was to ""honour"" a promise made to take ""hundreds of deserving winners to Florida"" for the series finale."

His is the first death of a serving member of the British armed forces in the fight against Islamic State. The roadside bomb in northern Syria also killed an American serviceman, and wounded five others. The US military did not confirm the location of the blast, but it came soon after one was reported in Manbij by a Syrian official. Manbij, an Arab-Kurdish mixed town close to the border with Turkey, is at risk of a Turkish military offensive. In a statement, the MoD confirmed ""with great sadness"" that Sgt Tonroe ""was tragically killed in action whilst on duty in the Middle East on the 29th March 2018"". After initial training he joined the parachute regiment as part of the sniper platoon and ""rapidly developed an array of competencies and combat experiences that were to lay the foundations of an outstanding career"". Sgt Tonroe's officer commanding (the commander of his sub-unit) said: ""If you had met Matt Tonroe, then you would have liked him. He bristled with the contentment of a life lived to its full. ""His bravery and talent as a solider, was matched by his compassion as a human being. He was an individual, with the courage to set his own course, and the perspective to see new possibilities at every turn. ""He was destined for great things in our unit; his leadership was both natural and apparently effortless. He is already missed. ""Without Matt, our company has lost some of its humour; some of its warmth; and some of its sheer opportunism. We will always remember him."" His commanding officer described Sgt Tonroe as ""a deeply intelligent man and one of life's characters"" The unnamed officer added: ""[Sgt Tonroe] had a steel core, served his country with pride and was a first class soldier, proven in combat, faced risk willingly and was ever ready for more. ""He thus died as he lived: daring and fearless in duty. We mourn his loss dearly, are proud to have known him and will honour him by continuing this fight."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Sergeant Matt Tonroe at this dreadful time. ""Sergeant Tonroe served his country with great distinction and it is clear from the tributes made by his colleagues that he was not only exceptionally dedicated and courageous but also a gifted and intelligent instructor who was respected by everyone he served with."" The MoD statement said that Sgt Tonroe was ""very much a family man, making every effort to see him beloved mum around numerous overseas deployments. ""He is survived by his mother Michelle, his brother Alex and girlfriend Olivia."" It is standard policy for the Ministry of Defence to neither confirm nor deny membership of the special forces"
2018-03-31,For the PM it was a chance to wish all four nations a very Happy Brexit Day.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/uncertainty-persists-as-may-faces-clear-hurdles-despite-brexit-day-joy-11308787,"A message of both unity of the nations of the Union, and an attempt to signal certainty on the day of the Britain's formal exit from the European Union at 11pm on the 29 March 2019. But both these Brexit Day messages, though understandable messaging from Number 10, are not yet the racing certainties that the PM tried to project today. And that is because of a decision that flowed from exactly this day one year ago. Brexit Day is also the anniversary of her signing of the Article 50 letter last year. That kickstarted a process that led to a walk in the Welsh hills and then a snap election and finally the loss of her majority that still makes both UK unity through Brexit and the one-year countdown a political promise rather than unavoidable destiny. That fragility evident in the PM's route map through the nations of the UK today. In Ayr in the morning, the PM met the high-value cashmere weavers seeking market share beyond Europe, but not the fisherman still angry at the transition within the Common Fisheries Policy with no say. In Northern Ireland, it was a visit to Bangor, over 50 miles away from the open border that may well define her next 12 months. In Wales, it was Aston Martin not the Welsh hill farmers concerned about what happened to almost every aspect of their business model post-Brexit. The newly-born lambs skipping through the hills right now will be sold into as yet uncertain post-Brexit trading arrangements, having been mainly exported entirely through frictionless borders to the rest of the European Union, up until now. There was a specific message to the devolved administration that has been somewhat lost in the negotiation with Brussels and within Cabinet in recent months. EU membership was hardwired into the devolution settlements for Holyrood, Cardiff and Stormont. It is possible to unpick that over time, but essentially the United Kingdom now needs to actually create a new, smaller UK single market with coherent standards and trading rules, to replace the systems that existed under shared EU membership. It requires new legislation and at times it will necessarily test those sensitive settlements and inevitably be described as a ""power grab"". The PM's trip seemed primarily aimed at assuaging such fears. But the call for unity may also fall on other types of deaf ear. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, for instance, told Sky News that the Government's Brexit strategy tactics and negotiations have been ""appallingly chaotic"" and ""wilfully negligent"" as he called on EU citizens to use the local elections to send a Brexit message to Theresa May. He said: ""EU citizens didn't get a chance to vote in the EU referendum, EU citizens didn't get a chance to vote in the General Election - this is their first chance to get a say, in what happens in the Brexit deal - this is your last chance to send a message to the Government - we do not want an extreme hard Brexit. ""And it's really important we send a message loud and clear to the Government - the course you are taking is bad for jobs, it's bad for London and the country."" Under EU law, EU citizens have the right to vote in local elections, including this year's bumper series in May across metropolitan areas including Greater London. No surprise then that the PM's last stop was to west London and an attempt to reassure Polish citizens settled in the capital. Then again, in Preston today, Trade Secretary Liam Fox was also celebrating the reincarnation of the ancient Board of Trade, ahead of the time in a year when he wins the power to start to negotiate trade deals with the US and China. His aim is to see the ""trade benefits spread across the UK with a year to go before Brexit"". ""Our job is to get Britain battle ready... for the opportunities that lie ahead,"" he told me. I suggested that not a great deal would actually be changing in a year's time because of the transition period. Mr Fox, never the biggest fan of transition, said: ""Of course, we will be an independent sovereign nation - business is now gearing up... for some of those opportunities out there."" Does all this mean that the transition period will definitely end by 2021? What happens if Parliament votes down the deal? ""If Parliament decides not to go with an agreement, we will simply leave without an agreement because we will still be leaving,"" he said. And therein lies the most crucial question of the next 12 months. What does happen if Parliament votes down the deal in a ""meaningful vote""? Mr Fox says we are still out in a year's time and needs to press that argument hard to ensure single market-friendly MPs do not rebel. The honest answer though - is that it is not entirely clear. Indeed the Government's Withdrawal Bill gives it latitude to change the exit date somewhat if negotiations are not concluded. So while Brexit Day may well have been joyous for some, and less so for others, there are still some surmountable but clear hurdles over the next 12 months."
2018-03-31,"While Labour has already selected over 50 candidates in key target seats for the next general election, the Conservatives have selected none in their targets.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-stealing-a-march-on-tories-in-target-seats-11310654,"A senior Conservative source inside Conservative Central Office has also told Sky News that the process for starting those selections has barely even begun. It's something which is causing some consternation internally. One Conservative source said that ""Labour are really stealing a march on us here"". ""This bank holiday weekend you've got scores of prospective Labour candidates knocking on doors, introducing themselves as their next MP. Where are ours?"" And as campaigning for local elections gets under way across England, many Tories feel they are missing a trick. Judith Wallace, a Tory councillor in North Tyneside, said that the biggest thing Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) could do to help the party win in marginals is to ""select candidates earlier"". She added: ""It's so important that they're there before the general election period. ""People can see them, get to know them and then they don't feel candidates have just been parachuted into the local area."" For many Conservatives, the lack of selections speaks to a wider malaise within the party: a lack of direction at the centre and a decaying network of Conservative associations across the country. One source spoke of many associations effectively existing ""on paper only"". In recent years the Conservatives haven't published their membership numbers but it seems likely that it is at or near an all time low. There had been rumours that the figure was as low as 70,000 but Brandon Lewis, the new Tory Chairman recently said that the figure is closer to 130,000 and the party had enjoyed a modest uptick of late. Nonetheless Labour membership continues to rise, as does that of internal pro-Jeremy Corbyn pressure group Momentum. Labour's numbers hover at around 600,000 and Momentum's at 30,000. Indeed, a senior Momentum source has told me that their membership is increasing at a rate of around 1,500 a month and more when the organisation is the subject of negative headlines in the press. If that rate were sustained, if the next election were to come in 2022, then Momentum wouldn't be far away from drawing level with the whole of the Conservatives, a party which once boasted three million members. A good ground game and decent membership isn't everything - if that were the case Labour would have won the last election. Members don't necessarily translate into activists and activists don't necessarily translate to getting more votes in any given seat. But someone has to deliver the leaflets; someone has to offer lifts to old folks who can't make it to the polling stations; someone has to remind voters with busy lives that an election is even happening. They can make the difference. The lack of Conservative selections is also revealing about the psychology of the parties. Anne-Marie Trevelyan MP, aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, told me that the reason the Tories hadn't put more emphasis on it was simple: ""The Labour Party as the opposition party is, quite rightly, expecting and wanting there to be an election at any time and so are making selections. ""I think it's fair to say we do not expect or want an election until 2022."" The Tories intend to play this parliament long. It would clearly be in their interests to do so: after last year's snap election, once bitten, twice shy. It is in Jeremy Corbyn's interest, meanwhile, to hype up the prospect of an election as much as possible as it helps a) secure his own position, which is looking a touch more precarious than it was, and b) help maintain the energy and sense of progress and excitement which have proved crucial to sustaining leadership. Many on the left of the Labour Party also want to select candidates early, as they feel in a dominant position within the party right now and want to press home their advantage with their own candidates. However, the Tories ought to bear in mind that, as much as they might hope there's no election until 2022, it is not entirely within their gift. With key Brexit votes looming in the autumn, it is conceivable the government might lose some or all of them, which might precipitate its fall. The ensuing chaos might, one way or the other, have to be resolved with another national poll. If that's the case, Labour will have an enormous head start with many key candidates already in place. In the event of another tight election, small things like that could be crucial. But either way, membership and organisation is important. They speak of the wider political health of a political party. These figures remind us that although the Prime Minister and the Conservatives have enjoyed their best couple of weeks since last year's ill-fated election, the Tory Party has some big structural problems with which to grapple. Compared to those problems, a few good weeks' headlines might ultimately seem pretty unimportant."
2018-03-31,Sky News has seen a file of documents given to the Home Office which the local MP claims demonstrates authorities in Telford are still failing to tackle child abuse.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/telford-authorities-still-failing-to-tackle-child-abuse-amid-grooming-investigation-11308688,"MP for Telford Lucy Allan says the evidence she's complied from victims and their families shows ""a failure to understand the nature of grooming"" by the local police and the Crown Prosecution Service. Last Monday, it was announced that the National Independent Inquiry into Child Exploitation will speak to victims in Telford as part of its Truth Project. It follows calls for a fresh examination of police and local authority failures in the town. As part of the bundle given to the Home Office, Sky News has seen a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service from 2016 telling a father in Telford they will not prosecute alleged offences against his daughter when she was aged 13 to 15 because she consented to the sex. It states: ""The defence that was put forward in this case was that she willingly met the suspect and had consensual sexual intercourse with him. ""Also at the time this took place the suspect held a reasonable belief that she was over the age of 16."" It goes on: ""In her statements to the police she was clear that although she may not have wanted sexual intercourse with the suspect, she agreed to do so."" Mrs Allan said: ""This is a grooming case. This is where a gang, a network is involved. There are multiple perpetrators. ""And to use that defence in that type of case suggests to me that people in authority are not fully understanding the nature of grooming and not fully understanding the way in which a young person of 13 or 14 does not have the capacity to consent in a situation like that."" A CPS spokesperson told Sky News: ""This case did not meet the evidential test as set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and hence we decided not to prosecute the suspect."" They say a review of the decision came to the same conclusion Recently, Telford's police chief said that the number and scale of girls sexually abused there had been ""sensationalised"". West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding ""significantly disputed"" claims that 1,000-plus children may have been groomed over four decades in the Shropshire town. In 2013, several men from Telford were jailed for organised child abuse offences, including Mubarak and Ahdel Ali, brothers convicted of sexual exploitation and trafficking children.However, a number of new alleged victims have emerged in Telford who say, even recently, that their cases are not being properly looked into. Sky News has learned of one case where it's claimed a child abuse incident was reported four times over several years before it was investigated. Referring to this case, West Mercia Police said: ""Both parties were spoken to and it was established both believed that each other were over the age of consent. ""Once it was established this was not the case, appropriate measures were put in place to safeguard the girl who was under the age of consenting."" But Mrs Allan told Sky News: ""I think it's really important in Telford that we open our eyes to this. That we don't just say that everything's alright because we're ticking the right boxes. It does a disservice to the victims. ""Until we understand what's happened and what's gone wrong, we won't be able to change the attitudes and the ethos that the young girls are to blame and indulging in promiscuous behaviour. We have to look at them as victims."""
2018-03-31,Bea Wood won the Miss Transgender UK pageant and transgender Top Model for 2017-18. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/trans-day-of-visibility-i-became-the-real-me-when-i-gave-up-the-fight-11307928,"She came out as transgender five years ago, and now lives her life as a woman, working as a model and photographer and running her own support network called BeaYourself. For transgender day of visibility, she discusses being a transgender female trying to make a difference. I came out as the true me almost five years ago after battling and hiding my emotions since being a child. I found it so tough hiding who I was deep inside, living life as the male everyone knew and expected me to be and equally, if not even tougher coming out as the true me. Finally being true to myself and blossoming as the female I am inside has been the most amazing, life-changing thing I have ever done. I finally gave up the fight of hiding who I was inside and embraced the true me. Sure, I'm a transgender female, but I am a female none the less. As a trans female I do not expect special privileges, but nor do I wish to be discriminated against. I just want equal rights to live as the true me free from hate and discrimination, as any other person wishes. Unfortunately, from my experiences, I still face hate and discrimination. Things have improved so much with the Gender Recognition Act, and the Equalities Act but unfortunately, I believe we still have a long way to go. Suicide rates and hate crimes against transgender individuals are still high and, in some areas, rising. Trans day of visibility is an amazing day to highlight that transgender people are still real humans, with real feelings, just trying do what everyone else is doing and live a normal, happy life. When I am in a pageant, modelling, being a photographer, or running BeaYourself, my aim is always the same, to show full equality and acceptance for all, to promote body confidence and most of all to show that everyone should and can be proud of who they are. No matter whether you are a transgender male, transgender female, a CIS (natural born) male or female, in reality, what is the difference? We are all human, we all eat, sleep, and breathe the same. Trans day of visibility is here to show this, no matter who you are, how you choose to live, we are all human and all deserve acceptance. As the title holder Miss Transgender UK, I have the honour and privilege to have been contacted by several Pride events in the UK. I am so excited to be attending and to show my support to these events to promote equality and freedom for all. I have struggled for the last five years feeling alone and isolated. My breakthrough was winning Miss Transgender UK in November 2017, getting signed by Dream Street Models, and now furthering my career to involve photography alongside my modelling and pageantry. I have never been happier, and my life has done a complete u-turn. I also now have a partner after six years of being single who is fully supportive and loves me unconditionally. No matter what stage of someone's transition (I have been there myself) there are huge struggles and at times people can hit a low. I hope my story will show that no matter what the battle, being true to yourself is what matters and you can do it no matter how hard it seems. My story, and my situation, to many people sounds like a dream, but the five years prior to this have been awful. I have come so far but there's still so much to do. I still struggle for sponsors, and an income but I remain positive and believe that things one day will fall into place. I am Bea, I am your Miss Transgender UK 2017/18, and for 2018 transgender day of visibility I wish everyone about to come out, who has come out, or is struggling with their transition all the best of luck, and most importantly, NEVER give up, never stop being true to yourself. Being transgender is OK, being different is OK. Let's bring equality for all!"
2018-03-31,The Australian owner of Homebase has begun approaching potential buyers of the DIY chain just two years after completing a disastrous ¬£340m takeover.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/aussie-owners-in-talks-to-sell-homebase-after-340m-diy-debacle-11310795,"Sky News ‚Äéhas learnt that Wesfarmers is working with investment bankers at Lazard to review options for the future of Homebase, with the most likely outcome an outright sale of the business. Lazard has contacted a range of potential new owners in the last couple of weeks, banking sources said this weekend. Homebase employed nearly 12,000 people in Britain across an estate of almost 250 stores at the end of last year. The move to unwind Wesfarmers takeover of the UK's second-biggest DIY chain comes less than three months before the Sydney-listed company is due to update investors on the results of its strategic review. The approaches to prospective new owners, including private equity firms, have emerged on what is traditionally the busiest weekend of the year for DIY retailers. An outright sale is not the only option on the table for Homebase, which is now part of Wesfarmers' Bunnings UK and Ireland division. Executives have already pledged to axe up to 40 underperforming stores, and a Company Voluntary Arrangement paving the way for ‚Äéclosures and rent reductions at others is also a possibility. CVAs have become the go-to restructuring mechanism for retailers and restaurant chains in recent months, although they have produced mixed results. New Look and Prezzo have had CVAs approved by creditors, while Carpetright is also planning to use one to axe scores of shops. However, Toys R Us UK plunged into administration this month, less than three months after securing approval for its own CVA. Operating under the Bunnings name in its home market, Wesfarmers had grand ambitions to take on B&Q in Britain when it bought Homebase from Home Retail Group, the then owner of Argos. Argos was subsequently snapped up by J Sainsbury, the UK's second-biggest supermarket chain. However, Wesfarmers' strategy has backfired spectacularly in the last 18 months‚Äé, forcing it to write off more than ¬£500m after it ditched some of Homebase's most popular business lines. It ditched the chain's British management team, replacing them with an Australian leadership line-up which presumed the UK market would welcome the radically different Bunnings Warehouse‚Äé retail model. Its sales performance since the deal has produced the opposite result, with the British and Irish division reporting a 15.7%‚Äé slump in revenue and a ¬£97m loss before tax. The recent adverse weather across the country has not helped either, with garden centre specialists reporting sharp declines in sales during the first quarter of 2018. While Homebase's travails are largely self-inflicted, they have compounded the sense of gloom engulfing Britain's retail sector as online competition and rising high street costs squeeze many established chains. ‚ÄéLazard's involvement in the review of options for Homebase is notable because of its role in Wesfarmers' purchase of the chain in 2016. Archie Norman, the Marks & Spencer chairman, chairs Lazard's London operation, and has held separate roles with various Wesfarmers operations for years. In January, the Financial Times reported that Mr Norman had advised Wesfarmers' board not to proceed with the Homebase takeover, although he could not be reached for comment this weekend. The Australian conglomerate recently said it would demerge Coles, its supermarket business, to create one of the country's 30 largest listed companies. A Wesfarmers spokeswoman confirmed that Lazard had ‚Äébeen engaged to assist with the review of Bunnings UK and Ireland but declined to comment further."
2018-03-31,"The UK government is considering allowing Russian officials to visit Yulia Skripal, who is recovering in hospital along with her father Sergei after a nerve agent attack.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-expels-more-uk-diplomats-and-claims-plane-searched-after-nerve-agent-attack-11310461,"Ms Skripal is understood to be conscious and talking after she was poisoned with novichok while visiting her father in Salisbury. It comes as Russia accuses Britain of ""blatant provocation"" after an Aeroflot plane was searched when it landed at Heathrow. And Moscow has told the UK to take home more than 50 of its diplomats in the ongoing row over the nerve agent attack. Police are treating the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal as attempted murder. The attack has provoked a worldwide diplomatic spat and Western nations have joined the UK in expelling Russian officials in response. Mr Skripal, a former Russian spy, has been in a critical condition since 4 March. The Russian Embassy in London tweeted that it insists ""on the right to see"" Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen. A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman has since said: ""We are considering requests for consular access in line with our obligations under international and domestic law, including the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal."" Meanwhile, Russia has told the UK it must send home ""just over 50"" more of its diplomats in the ongoing tit-for-tat row. Russia has already retaliated against Britain for the UK's expulsion of Russian ""intelligence agents"" by ejecting 23 British diplomats over the attack on the Skripals. On Friday, the UK's ambassador to Moscow was told London had one month to cut its diplomatic contingent in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain. Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that meant Britain would have to cut ""a little over 50"" additional diplomats in Russia. ""We asked for parity. The Brits have 50 diplomats more than the Russians,"" she said. And in a statement about the Aeroflot plane search, the Russian Embassy in the UK said: ""Today, we have witnessed another blatant provocation by the British authorities. ""Border Force and Customs officers have searched the aircraft that was conducting the Aeroflot flights 2582 / 2583, Moscow - London - Moscow. ""This kind of event is extraordinary."" The Kremlin has also alleged British officials had tried to search the plane in the absence of the crew and have threatened to board British planes in retaliation. We are aware of a story circulating on social media. Please be advised that Metropolitan Police are not conducting a search of an Airbus inbound from Moscow at Heathrow. The Russian embassy added: ""Of course, we will carefully analyse what has happened. At this moment, we have no other explanation but that the incident at Heathrow is in one way or another connected with the hostile policy that the UK government is conducting with regard to Russia."" The Russian ministry of transport later said: ""If there is no explanation, the Russian side will deem the actions towards our plane as illegal and also reserve the right to take similar action against British airlines."" British security minister Ben Wallace said: ""It is routine for Border Force to search aircraft to protect the UK from organised crime and from those who attempt to bring in harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country. ""Once those checks were carried out the plane was allowed to carry on with its onward journey."" Search of @aeroflot plane at @HeathrowAirport was a blatant provocation. Read why: https://t.co/gIHXmfzghB pic.twitter.com/XrtvxAig6e Tonight marks the deadline for 60 US embassy staff to leave Russia as part of Moscow's policy of expelling foreign diplomats in a tit-for-tat response to countries across the world sending home Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain. In total, 171 people are expected to leave the country, with two Russian planes laid on, one of which will make a brief stopover in New York to collect 14 families. More than 150 Russian diplomats are being kicked out 25 countries and the NATO mission. Sir Tony Brenton, Britain's ambassador to Russia at the time of the Litvinenko murder, told Sky News the UK government had done well to convince so many other nations to join it in expelling Russian diplomats, but it must have had evidence that Russia was responsible. ""I suspect, and there's some evidence for this, the British government had quite compelling evidence of Russian assassination intentions which they shared with our partners and our partners felt this affected them as much as it affected us,"" he said. Ambassadors from a number of other nations, including Germany, Italy, Poland and France, have also been summoned by Moscow's foreign ministry."
2018-03-31,Britain's Anthony Joshua has added the WBO belt to his collection of titles with a win over Joseph Parker.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/anthony-joshua-takes-wbo-title-with-bruising-win-over-joseph-parker-11312283,"Joshua was forced to go the distance for the first time - but was unanimously declared the winner with a wide margin on the judges' scorecards: 118-110 twice and 119-109. After his win, Joshua told Sky Sports: ""My strategy was to stick behind the jab. ""I was switched on and I was focused, Joseph Parker is a world champion and I said this was about boxing finesse. ""What you can't forget is that I am the unified heavyweight champion of the world."" Both fighters had stepped into the ring undefeated at Cardiff's Principality Stadium and the win extends Joshua's perfect pro record to 21 victories from as many bouts. Joshua had won his previous 20 fights with knockouts but struggled to land clean shots on Parker, as a crowd of 78,000 watched on. Parker, a New Zealander, said afterwards that he would ""love to have another go"". He said: ""I lost to the better champion tonight. ""It has been a good experience being here, and I am thankful for the opportunity. ""I want to go back and come back stronger. I have no regrets - we take it on the chin. ""We will be back again and we will work harder to come back. ""He (Joshua) is a good big man and was better on the day."" As for Joshua's future plans, Deontay Wilder holds the other main heavyweight belt, the WBC's, and could meet Joshua before the end of this year. ""I'm not into the hype, let's get the business done,"" Joshua said after the bout. ""Let's see what the future holds, I'm down for whatever, whenever."" Then he screamed: ""Wilder, let's go baby!"""

2018-03-31,Former Labour peer Lord Sugar has taken down a tweet showing Jeremy Corbyn in a car next to Hitler after it sparked a Twitter row.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/sir-alan-sugar-tweets-picture-of-jeremy-corbyn-next-to-hitler-11310726,"Lord Sugar, a businessman who was born into a Jewish family, had posted the picture on Friday night, saying: ""Many a true word spoken in jest Corbyn."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell had called on him to ""delete and disown"" the tweet. The image showed the Labour leader's head superimposed on someone else's body, sitting next to the Nazi dictator. The caption read: ""When you're pictured at Nuremberg and claim you thought you were going to a car rally."" Mr Corbyn has been embroiled in a row over anti-Semitism within the Labour party after a Facebook comment surfaced in which he had appeared to defend a mural depicting a group of Jewish financiers and white businessmen playing a Monopoly-style game on a board balanced on the backs of people. Mr Corbyn said: ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic."" The Labour leader also said in a Passover message on Friday that there is a ""need to do better"", and promised Jewish people he is their ""ally"" in the fight against anti-Semitism. Mr McDonnell responded to Lord Sugar's tweet, saying: ""I just make this appeal to him. Please delete and disown it. We all desperately need to bring people together now. ""We can hold strong views about each other's politics but now is the time to learn from each other and unite people."" People have contacted me about Alan Sugar‚Äôs tweet.

But a few hours later he appeared to have deleted the original post, as he replied to the shadow chancellor, saying: ""Dear Mr McDonnell. I am sorry you are offended by my retweet on the picture. First let me say I am not the originator it has been doing the rounds. ""You need to get Corbyn to make a firm statement about antisemitism. There is no smoke without fire in Labour."" Mr McDonnell then tweeted his thanks to Lord Sugar for deleting the tweet. Lord Sugar responded: ""You should follow me so I can send you direct messages."" Earlier, two Labour MPs had joined Mr McDonnell in calling for the tweet to be deleted. Chris Williamson said the peer has brought his position into disrepute, saying the post ""promotes hatred and that is irresponsible"". ""I hope you will therefore swallow your pride, delete it and make a fulsome apology,"" he added. Your tweet is libellous and you might find it sensible to reword or remove it. I have no hatred of Jeremy and hatred is a dangerous trait. The chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism, John Mann, said the tweet was libellous and Lord Sugar ""might find it sensible to reword or remove it"". He tweeted: ""The use of Hitler/ Nazi comparators is demeaning, unwarranted and dangerous. You damage the fight against anti Semitism with this @Lord--Sugar. Withdraw this and apologise please."" Lord Sugar, host of The Apprentice, resigned from the Labour party in 2015 in protest at its stance on business. It is a joke , but the angry brigade like to moan  . https://t.co/hTXa9fy06R Mr Corbyn has come under increasing pressure in recent days. Some 39 Labour MPs and peers have written to Mr Corbyn urging him to suspend Christine Shawcroft from the National Executive Committee (NEC) after she backed a local council candidate accused of anti-Semitic social media posts. Ms Shawcroft said she had ""not seen the appalling and abhorrent post"" and wouldn't have sent a supportive email if she had."

Mr Matthews had been taken into custody for questioning last Tuesday by investigators from the country's juvenile protection brigade, it is claimed. The source said the alleged rape took place in 1998-99 and Europe 1 reported that a complaint was filed in 2017. A spokesperson for the Matthews family was quoted by the Daily Mail Online as saying: ""David Matthews categorically denies the allegation and unequivocally contests the untrue and scandalous accusation."" Mr Matthews, who is in his early seventies, is the father of James Matthews, the husband of Pippa Middleton. Pippa is the sister of Prince William's wife Kate. David Matthews owns Eden Rock in St Barths, a luxury resort popular with the rich and famous. His other son, Spencer Matthews, is a reality TV star."
2018-03-31,Australian cricketer David Warner has said he realises he may never play for his country again as he tearfully apologised for his role in the recent ball-tampering scandal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180401001903/https://news.sky.com/story/tearful-warner-apologises-for-ball-tampering-11310659,"Speaking at a news conference in Sydney, the former opening batsman said: ""I failed in my responsibility as vice-captain of the Australia cricket team. ""To the fans and the lovers of the game who have supported and inspired me on my journey as a cricketer, I want to sincerely apologise for betraying your trust in me. ""I have let you down badly."" Addressing Australians, Warner said: ""I apologise for my actions and I'm sorry for the impact those actions have had on our country's reputation. ""I can honestly say I have only ever wanted to bring glory to my country through playing cricket. ""In striving to do so, I have made a decision which has had the opposite effect and it's one that I will regret for as long as I live."" He added: ""I just want to move on from this. ""It is going to take a long time to earn respect back from the Australian public."" Warner and former Australia captain Steve Smith were banned from cricket for a year for their part in the ball-tampering controversy on the third day of the test at Cape Town. Opening batsman Cameron Bancroft was suspended for nine months. 1/3 I know there are unanswered questions and lots of them. I completely understand. In time i will do my best to answer them all. But there is a formal CA process to follow. 2/3 I am taking advice to make sure I properly comply with that process and answer all questions in the proper place and at the proper time. 3/3 I should have mentioned that in my press conference I‚Äôm sorry for not making it clearer. With so much at stake for my family and cricket I have to follow this process properly. I think that‚Äôs fair. Warner was accused of developing the plan to use sandpaper to scuff the ball, with investigators from Cricket Australia saying he had advised Bancroft and failed to report his knowledge of the plan after the match. Warner cut short Saturday's news conference after being asked if he was being singled out as the instigator. Before that, he had also apologised to cricket fans and players in South Africa, saying: ""I have brought the game into disrepute on your soil, and I apologise 100%."" He added: ""We let our country down, we made a bad decision. ""I really wish and hope that Steve (Smith) and Cameron (Bancroft) have the same support that I have with me because it's going to be a tough and emotional time these next 12 months."" Warner's apology comes after similarly tearful confessions from Smith and from Australia's coach Darren Lehmann, who resigned from his position but said he had no prior knowledge of the ball-tampering plan. Warner, Smith and Bancroft have seen sponsorship deals fade, and the loss of lucrative overseas contracts as a result of the scandal."
