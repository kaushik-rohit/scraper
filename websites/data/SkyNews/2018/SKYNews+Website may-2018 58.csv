2018-05-08,"Israel has warned that ""Hezbollah equals Lebanon"" following the election success of the Iran-backed Shia Islamist group in the country's election.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180508063220/https://news.sky.com/story/israel-warns-iran-backed-hezbollah-equals-lebanon-after-early-election-results-11362636,"Unofficial early results point to the group winning more than half the seats in the Lebanese parliament. Israeli education minister Naftali Bennett wrote on Twitter: ""The State of Israel will not differentiate between the sovereign State of Lebanon and Hezbollah, and will view Lebanon as responsible for any action from within its territory."" It is the first election in the country for nine years. A low turnout led politicians to appeal via TV and Twitter for people to cast their vote just hours before polls closured on Sunday. Lebanon's politics has been divided by the Syrian war, with some parties supporting the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah's intervention in Syria to aid President Bashar Assad, and other Saudi-aligned parties opposed to it. The state has also often been a battleground for influence between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Despite losing seats, Western-backed Sunni prime minister Saad al-Hariri - who leads the anti-Hezbollah alliance Future Movement - remains the front runner to lead cabinet. Following the conclusion of a 15-year civil war in 1989, the Taif Accord requires that Lebanon's president is a Maronite Christian, its prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and parliament's speaker a Shia Muslim. The anti-Hezbollah Christian party Lebanese Forces also appears to have done well in the election, with indications that they have almost doubled their MPs from eight to 15. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is visiting Washington DC to address Donald Trump's concerns about the Iran nuclear deal. Although he will not be meeting personally with Mr Trump, the foreign minister is expected to appear on Fox and Friends, known to be one of Mr Trump's favourite TV shows. Official results of the Lebanese election are expected on Monday."
2018-05-08,Joy Battley is a greyhound enthusiast but her close involvement with the sport has meant she has seen its darker side. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180508063220/https://news.sky.com/story/greyhound-deaths-reveal-dark-side-to-dog-racing-11362388,"She knows the breed well through racing her own at a track in Harlow, as well as managing Barley Kennels in Waltham Abbey - a rehoming centre for retired greyhounds. It has meant she has seen first-hand how quickly dogs can be discarded with numerous owners often opting to put animals down rather than pay expensive veterinary bills when injuries occur. ""For a nation of dog lovers we don't do very well,"" she says. She is adamant that those profiting the most need to face up to their responsibilities. ""Bookmakers, who benefit greatly from the sport, especially at the moment, are putting more pressure on the trainers to have more dogs but those dogs have got to have somewhere to go when they finish racing."" It is estimated there are 13,500 racing greyhounds in Britain. Data taken from UK race tracks - published for the first time by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain - shows how, in 2017, hundreds of dogs were injured and destroyed after racing. Around 5,000 injuries were recorded and, of those, more than 900 dogs were put down. A total of 257 were destroyed at the trackside; in 333 cases treatment was deemed to be either too expensive or unnecessary because of a poor prognosis and then there were the 348 healthy dogs destroyed because they couldn't be rehomed. ""There are very few injuries that can't be fixed by a vet,"" Ms Battley insists. ""It just comes down to money. ""They won't all get a home, that's probably impossible, but there should be places for them to go, like here. ""They need centres or sanctuaries, somewhere the dogs can go to live out the rest of their lives, it doesn't have to be in a home."" In horse racing, bookmakers pay a statutory levy which partly goes towards ring-fencing money for animal welfare. Part of the problem for greyhound racing is that its levy isn't compulsory. Mark Bird who heads up the Greyhound Board of Great Britain insists the organisation is pushing to get bookies to pay more.""Our ambition is to incentivise trainers not to put those dogs to sleep merely on the fact that it is too expensive to have medical care. ""We're currently in mediation talks with the bookmakers at the moment to try to get some of their offshore revenue which would take us from £7.2m up to £9.9m but... this is a voluntary levy, so we are completely in the hands of the bookmakers paying this."" Chris Pitt from the League Against Cruel Sports says the industry treats greyhounds like commodities. ""Although they might say they want to improve things, it's based on money and gambling, so compassion for the dogs is not going to get in the way."" Mr Pitt believes the sport should be banned. ""We have been working with and hoping that the industry itself, or the Government, could improve the way it is run but we have got to a point where enough is enough.""It doesn't matter what the greyhound racing industry says it is doing, you can't have greyhound racing without serious animal welfare problems. ""So as a country we have to ask ourselves, do we want greyhound racing or do we want to be a country of animal welfare lovers? I think we're the latter."""
2018-05-08,A toddler has been snatched and eaten by a leopard at a national park in Uganda that is popular with tourists.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180508063220/https://news.sky.com/story/toddler-three-eaten-by-leopard-at-queen-elizabeth-national-park-in-uganda-11362931,"The three-year-old boy, named by Ugandan media as Elisha Nabugyere, was the son of female ranger Doreen Ayera, who works at Queen Elizabeth National Park. Ms Ayera had left the child in the care of a nanny at the unfenced staff headquarters of the Mweya Safari Lodge, Ugandan news site the Daily Monitor reports. Wildlife authority spokesman Bashir Hangi said the child had followed the nanny outside the main house and towards a kitchen. He said a leopard was hiding nearby and mauled the toddler before dragging him to a bush at about 9pm on Friday. Mr Hangi said: ""The rangers immediately swung into action (and) searched for the baby but they found only a skull in the morning under a tree."" He says rangers are hunting the leopard because it now has a taste of human blood and may want to kill again. Mr Hangi said: ""The maid was not aware the child followed her. ""She heard the kid scream for help, she intervened but it was too late.""The Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwest Uganda has one of the highest populations of predators such as lions, leopards and hyenas in the country. Rangers are employed to live within the grounds to protect the animals from poachers. The park, which covers an area of 1,229 sqaure miles, is one of Uganada's top tourist hotspots."

The survey was conducted between September and November last year, shortly after a £100m modernisation project began at Glasgow Queen Street. Cameron MacIntosh, 32, a sales adviser from Stirling, said: ""The station is an absolute bomb site at the moment. ""It really looks like a place from the third world. I try and avoid it."" Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ""While Glasgow Queen Street is being redeveloped it's vital that the ScotRail Alliance continues to talk to passengers about the improvements and makes sure staff are on hand to help.""

2018-05-08,Hawaii's Kilauea volcano eruption has destroyed 26 homes and forced thousands to flee as lava spewed more than 200ft into the air.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180508063220/https://news.sky.com/story/lava-spills-into-streets-after-volcano-eruption-11362566,"More than 1,700 people have been forced to leave the area, and could be told to stay away for some time. Officials said the decimated homes were in the Leilani Estates subdivision, where molten rock, toxic gas and steam have been bursting through openings in the ground. Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said the number of destroyed homes could rise. ""This is heartbreaking,"" she said. Amber Makuakane, 37, a teacher and single mother of two, said her three-bedroom house in Leilani Estates was destroyed by lava. ""There was some steam rising from all parts of the yard, but everything looked fine,"" Ms Makuakane said. On Saturday morning, she received alerts from her security system that motion sensors throughout the house had been triggered. Lava eventually covered her property. ""My son keeps asking me, 'Mommy when are we going to go home?""' US Geological Survey volcanologist Wendy Stovall said the eruptions may carry on. ""There's more magma in the system to be erupted. As long as that supply is there, the eruption will continue,"" she said. About 240 people and 90 pets spent Saturday night in shelters, the American Red Cross said. Officials let some residents return briefly Sunday to get their pets, medicine and documents. Kilauea one of the world's most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983. The USGS's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a notice in mid-April that there were signs of pressure building in underground magma, and a new vent could form on the cone or along what is known as the East Rift Zone. Leilani Estates sits along the zone."

Loud bangs were heard in the afternoon but later in the evening one resident said the situation was ""very much ongoing"" after further loud bangs were heard at around 10pm. South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said on Twitter that one patient was being assessed and treated for ""non-life threatening injuries"". Members of the public have been warned to avoid the area, and police have said people should present themselves to officers if they wish to return home to make sure it's safe. Armed response officers were called shortly after 1.15pm on Monday to a report that a man had access to a firearm, Thames Valley Police said. ""People in Oxford will notice an increased police presence in the area while officers are dealing with the incident, which is contained and taking place at a residential property,"" said Superintendent Joe Kidman. ""If you have any concerns or wish to raise anything please approach and speak to an officer or call the non-emergency number 101."" A woman who was sat on her balcony said she heard loud bangs, shouting and dogs barking on Monday afternoon. ""After a second round it became apparent these were gunshots so I rushed inside,"" she said. ""There was a couple more shots, three spurts in total, still a lot of shouting and barking. I heard a man shout 'show me your hands' repeatedly."" Another witness said more loud bangs were heard later on Monday night, which sounded like gunfire, followed by shouting. Police say road closures and cordons remain in place, which which is likely to impact travelling through the area in the morning. Supt Joe Kidman said: ""People in Oxford will notice an increased police presence in the area while officers are dealing with the incident, which is contained and taking place at a residential property."""
2018-05-08,"With two weeks to go until the royal wedding, Sky News has spoken to bridal experts, academics and community workers for a special report exploring whether Meghan Markle can make any difference to racial equality in Britain.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180508063220/https://news.sky.com/story/will-meghan-and-harrys-wedding-change-views-on-racism-and-diversity-in-uk-11362498,"It comes after some have described Harry and Meghan's wedding as a social game-changer for black Britain; a mixed raced American actress, whose ancestors were slaves, marrying a white British Prince. The report uncovers divided opinions on racism and diversity. Nova Reid launched her blog Nubride.com after she got engaged in 2011 to try to tackle the lack of representation in the wedding industry. She's now a diversity adviser and works with top bridal designers like Ian Stewart. Speaking about her own experience when she got engaged, Nova said: ""I launched myself into newsagents the morning after the night before and that's when I first noticed 'where are the British women who are also black? Where are they?' ""At first I thought perhaps I was being over-sensitive or paranoid and then I started buying more magazines and it was the same thing. Sometimes I would flick through them and there would not be one single person of colour in the entire magazine."" But she has high hopes Meghan can help change things: ""She's a bit of a feminist, she's passionate about women's issues, she's intelligent, she's articulate, she's also of mixed heritage, and for young girls to see that possibility and to see a positive role model in that way is more powerful than most people can realise."" Ambrice Miller is from America and is soon to marry her English fiancé Ben Joyce - their civil ceremony just happens to take place on the 19 May. :: The ultimate guide to the royal wedding She said: ""I think what Meghan brings to the table is a little bit different. It's the element of it's going to be an international wedding, it's an interracial wedding, she's quite open about being proud about the fact that she's mixed race. ""I think that is only going to be beneficial because I'm in an interracial relationship and bringing that to the foreground, into the mainstream is only gonna, hopefully, have a positive impact. And I think she's handled it with elegance and grace in regards to some of the nasty attacks she's had based on her race."" But Dr Kehinde Andrews, from Birmingham City University, was so sceptical about claims that Meghan can make a difference he wrote an article saying she will not be allowed to be a black princess. He told Sky News: ""The Royal Family is probably our premiere institution of whiteness if you look at the idea of the Empire, the Commonwealth, the time when Britain was great and Britannia ruled the waves. ""It's not a coincidence that 68% of people think that colonialism was a good thing and about 68% of people believe that the monarchy is a good thing as well. So the monarchy is this kind of symbol of many of the problems with Britain and how it relates to race."" He also recalled how an older white lady knocked on the door of one of his young black PhD students to say that she thought it was terrible that Harry was marrying someone like Meghan. We visited Aba Graham who set up the Ebony and Ivory community group in Stockport nine years ago to raise aspirations for black and mixed heritage children. She said: ""When I started this all them years ago it came from two young girls that said to me 'I have nothing in store before me' and so I wanted to hopefully bring children together and work with them."" She says discrimination, racism and what she describes as ""micro-aggressions"" are still an everyday problem, from the justice system, to education and employment. She added: ""Whether it's because of what the Government call austerity or the issues around international or national issues that are happening like Brexit or whatever I don't know."" A teenager at the group described how white children at her school call black children slaves. In 2015, Meghan wrote an article for Elle magazine talking about her own experiences of having a black mother and white father, and the ""undercurrent of racism that is so prevalent, especially within America"". She added: ""While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman."" Since their engagement Harry and Meghan have travelled across the UK, often visiting ethnically diverse communities such as Brixton in south London and Birmingham. She hasn't confirmed what causes or issues she will focus on through her new royal role, but it will be fascinating to see if, as part of the establishment, she'll feel able to still campaign for racial equality. :: Sky News will broadcast live in Windsor the week before the royal wedding with all the build up to the big day, with exclusive live coverage of the wedding in UHD in a special programme ‪from 9am to 3pm on Sky News and Sky One ‪on Saturday 19 May."

Welcomed back on to the pitch by rapturous chants of ""there's only one Arsene Wenger"", the football manager addressed the crowd. ""Thank you for having me for such a long time. I know that's not easy,"" he said. ""Above all I am like you: I am an Arsenal fan. That means this is more than just watching football, it's a way of life. It is caring about the beautiful game, about the values that we cherish. ""I would like to thank everybody at the club who makes this club so special. I would invite you to really push to support the players and the staff who will remain behind me. ""For me these football players have a special quality, not only on the pitch but off the pitch. Please follow this team and support them next season because they deserve it. ""I would like to finish by saying I will miss you. Thank you all for being such an important part of my life. I hope to see you soon. Well done. Bye bye."" Wenger's departure comes after 22 years at the club, during which he won 10 trophies, including three Premier League titles. Speaking to Sky Sports' Greg Whelan, the 68-year-old said he did not know what his biggest achievement was. ""As a manager, your target is always to get the most out of your team, and when you don't lose a game you can't do much better,"" he said. ""I can think of other seasons where we have done well and I have taken the maximum out of the players - you have to be honest and know if you've taken the most out of your players or not."" When asked about what he was most proud of, he replied: ""First of all, for having maybe been faced with the values that are important to me. The titles are important, but over a long period, integrity, values of the club and team spirit are the most important for me."" He also took time to send his best wishes to former rival Sir Alex Ferguson, who had emergency surgery on Saturday after suffering a brain haemorrhage. ""I'm concerned because last week we were together,"" Wenger said. ""I trust his strength and optimistic character to get over it quickly and well."" Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke was among those in attendance for the Wenger's last home game, with a host of club greats, including Emmanuel Petit, Bob Wilson and Martin Keown, joining him. Following the match, Wenger was given the commemorative gold Premier League trophy awarded to the club after its unbeaten ""Invincible"" title-winning season."

It appeared after heavy rain near the town of Rotorua on the North Island, an area renowned for its geothermal activity. Geologists believe that thousands of years of rain eroded underground limestone, causing the ground to collapse. ""This is pretty spectacular, it's a lot bigger than the ones I'd normally see,"" volcanologist Brad Scott said. Mr Scott told TVNZ the dairy farm was situated above the crater of a dormant volcano. The dirt in the bottom of the sinkhole was ""the original 60,000-year-old volcanic deposit that came out of this crater"", he said. The farmer, Colin Tremain, said it had appeared overnight and was spotted by a worker on a morning run to handle the cows. Similar sinkholes are common on his farm, Mr Tremain added, but this is the largest - and there was nothing he could do to stop his land disappearing. He told Radio NZ he could ""put fence around it and forget about it"" but it would be a ""waste of time filling it in""."

While the record may be set for the bank holiday Monday, Sky weather presenter Jo Edwards said breaking the record for the entire weekend might be a little harder to achieve. She said: ""The figure we'd be chasing here would be 28.6C (83.5F) so we've got about a 30% chance of equalling an old record or setting a new one. ""These temperatures are 8C or 9C above what we'd expect at this time of year so it shouldn't be too disappointing if it cools down a little in the week to come. ""Fortunately there's still a lot of sunshine in the forecast."" The Met Office also warned those out in the sun to apply plenty of high factor sun cream, with high UV levels forecast particularly in the south of England. Over 125,000 tourists are expected to flock to Brighton, and about 50,000 each to Blackpool and Bournemouth. The record highest temperature for May is 32.8C (91F), which was recorded in 1922 and 1944."
2018-05-08,Boris Johnson is to appear on Donald Trump's favourite TV show as he attempts to save the Iran nuclear deal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180508063220/https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-to-appear-on-fox-friends-as-he-tries-to-save-iran-nuclear-deal-11362634,"The foreign secretary is in the US as part of a last-ditch effort to convince the president not to pull out of the accord. During his two-day visit, Mr Johnson is expected to appear on the Fox & Friends morning news show, which Mr Trump is known to avidly watch. The US president has criticised the Iran nuclear agreement and in January issued an ultimatum to ""either fix the deal's disastrous flaws, or the United States will withdraw"". The Iran nuclear deal eased sanctions on Tehran in exchange for commitments to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Mr Johnson wrote in the New York Times that ""only Iran would gain"" from abandoning the agreement. :: The Iran nuclear deal explained The president has threatened to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal signed by the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain with Iran in 2015. He will decide on Friday whether to to reimpose sanctions and effectively scrap the deal. Mr Johnson wrote in article for the New York Times: ""Of all the options we have for ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon, this pact offers the fewest disadvantages. ""It has weaknesses, certainly, but I am convinced they can be remedied. ""Indeed at this moment Britain is working alongside the Trump administration and our French and German allies to ensure that they are."" British, French and German diplomats have been working for weeks behind the scenes with US counterparts in an effort to preserve the deal. Mr Johnson said the deal had put restrictions on Iran's nuclear programme and added that ""now that these handcuffs are in place, I see no possible advantage in casting them aside"". He also warned: ""Only Iran would gain from abandoning the restrictions on its nuclear programme."" The foreign secretary continued: ""At this delicate juncture, it would be a mistake to walk away from the nuclear agreement and remove the restraints that it places on Iran."" Mr Johnson will also hold talks with senior administration officials including vice president Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton. He is also expected to discuss North Korea ahead of Mr Trump's planned meeting with leader Kim Jong Un. The UK's ambassador to the United States, Sir Kim Darroch, said the Iran agreement was ""a good deal"" but efforts were ongoing to ""find some language, produce some action that meets the president's concerns"". The ambassador also insisted that Mr Trump's controversial comments about knife crime in London would not damage relations ahead of his visit to the UK in July. The Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Zarif said on Monday that Tehran's ""fierce reaction"" will ""not be pleasant for the US"" if it abandons the nuclear deal. The country's foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi added that the the US will pay a ""heavy price"". Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has warned the US will suffer ""historic remorse"" if Mr Trump pulls out of the deal. He said in a televised speech: ""We have plans to resist any decision by Trump on the nuclear accord. ""Orders have been issued to our atomic energy organisation and to the economic sector to confront America's plots against our country. ""America is making a mistake if it leaves the nuclear accord."""

International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt says the crisis is ""growing daily"". ""The UK is leading the way to help vaccinate people against a deadly cholera outbreak, strengthen shelters and provide vital food and water to vulnerable Rohingya families who have already been forced to flee their homes because of brutal violence and persecution,"" she said. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh after persecution from the Myanmar military in their native state of Rakhine which began in August. The £70m, part of a £129m contribution the UK has made since August 2017, will try to help 200,000 people with vital materials to strengthen their shelters and 300,000 people with food and safe water. The money also aims to give emergency nutrition for 30,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women plus 120,000 children under five. It also aims to provide access to midwifery care for 50,000 women, including many who may give birth during the rainy season, and give access to bathing cubicles for 52,900 women and girls. It is also hoped that 50,000 people will be helped in getting access to healthcare services. UK aid has been used in work to prepare the Cox's Bazar camps for the monsoon season since in January when the UN estimated that 102,000 Rohingya people were living in areas at risk of flooding and 12,000 people were at risk from landslides. Ms Mordaunt called on the Bangladeshi government to use its expertise to ensure Rohingya families are saved from the dangerous rains. She said: ""Across the globe countries were quick to respond to the plight of the Rohingya people last year, but what is needed is a longer-term commitment to these vulnerable men, women and children who have suffered so much."""

At least two dozen more youngsters have been injured in attacks, authorities say. People in Sitapur believe the attacks have been prompted by the closure of an illegal slaughterhouse nearby, saying the lack of food could have made them more aggressive. School attendance has dropped, education officials have warned, as parents keep their children home if they are unable to accompany them. Activists are killing any dogs they encounter, police say. Dog catching units are shooting and strangling the wild animals and have destroyed 24 in recent days. Senior officer Anand Kulkarni said many of the attacks occurred when children were out gathering mangoes or using outside lavatories. Officials said a total of 12 children have been killed in dog attacks since November. It is not known how many dogs were involved in the attacks, but strays are a widespread problem in India, where millions of the animals roam loose in packs. Injuries from feral dog attacks are common but a large number of fatalities in one area is rare."
2018-05-08,The Met Police has stepped up the amount of officers on patrol over the bank holiday after a spate of shootings and violence in the capital.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180508063220/https://news.sky.com/story/met-police-increase-bank-holiday-patrols-after-spate-of-shootings-in-london-11363006,"Detectives are appealing for witnesses after two boys, aged 15 and 13, were shot in the head on Sunday. A 39-year-old man arrested on Sunday evening has been released under investigation. The teenagers were hit by shotgun pellets in Wealdstone High Street, Harrow, northwest London, at about 1.15pm. The 15-year-old was taken to a central London hospital, where he remains in a non life-threatening condition. Police were informed four minutes later that a 13-year-old, believed to have been an innocent bystander, had been shot on the same street. He was to taken to a west London hospital with non-life threatening injuries and has since been discharged. :: Analysis: Social media is glamorising gang violence Officers have been made aware of a possible third victim who may have been at the scene with the 15-year-old. The victim, whose age and gender have not been confirmed, is thought to have suffered an arm injury but left before emergency services arrived. The teenagers were shot less than 24 hours after Rhyiem Barton, 17, was shot dead on Saturday. His mother Pretana Morgan paid tribute, saying: ""I couldn't have asked for a better son. ""My son was a very handsome boy. He's got so much potential."" Detectives have appealed for witnesses to get in touch following the shooting in Southwark, south London. Mr Barton's death follows a string of violent killings across the capital in 2018, with police investigating more than 60 alleged murders. Official statistics released in April show the number of homicides in London has spiked by more than 44% in the last year. In another incident during the bank holiday weekend, police were flagged down by a member of the public at about 6.30pm on Sunday after a 22-year-old man suffered gunshot wounds in Lewisham, southeast London. And in Perivale, northwest London, a 43-year-old was stabbed after a dispute about driving. Three men aged 22, 27 and 17 were also injured in a ""noxious substance"" assault following an altercation between two groups in Hackney, east London. Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Messinger said officers were using search powers to seize knives and to stop weapons being carried in cars. Extra police officers, supported by armed units, are patrolling the streets in an effort to reduce crime over the bank holiday weekend. Speaking about the two teenagers who were shot in Harrow, Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Rose said: ""It would appear that the first victim was approached by two male suspects, one in possession of a shotgun - and shots were fired, injuring him and an entirely innocent member of the public. ""This was a callous, reckless and brazen act, without any thought by those responsible for the fact that there were families with children and people in the high street enjoying their weekend. This was, quite simply, appalling. ""As a parent myself, I know hearing an incident like this where a child has been shot whilst they have been with there parents will cause alarm. It is senseless and shows an utter disregard for the safety of others. He added: ""As we have already stated, over the bank holiday weekend additional officers are on the streets across the capital, working hard to keep London safe."""

It highlights a growing phenomenon: the use of social media in often glamorising gang violence and fuelling resentment and reprisals from rival groups. Just last month, Scotland Yard Commissioner Cressida Dick spoke out about the exploitation of internet platforms by those bent on violence. She told the Times that websites and mobile apps such as YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram were partially to blame for the bloodshed. ""There's definitely something about the impact of social media in terms of people being able to go from slightly angry with each other to 'fight' very quickly,"" she said. :: Community in shock after boys, 13 and 15, shot:: London's surge of violence: The victims She added that insults or threats online ""makes [violence] faster, it makes it harder for people to cool down. I'm sure it does rev people up"". Last month, the then home secretary Amber Rudd called on social media companies to do more to restrict such content. ""Some might say this is impossible, but when I called on social media to deal with terrorist content on their platforms, they listened and they took action and I am asking them to do so again because it is the right thing to do,"" she said. ""Fighting crime and keeping each other safe isn't just the responsibility of government, it is everybody's responsibility."" The wider fight against violent crime in England and Wales now falls to new Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who will be responsible for implementing the government's serious violence strategy. The Home Office is making £40 million in additional funding available to help combat increasing violence, which is up 22% over the past year. Ministers have been criticised for cuts to police funding in recent years, which have seen 21,000 fewer police officers across England and Wales since 2010. This means many chief constables are having to make tough choices about the areas in which to invest their resources. For many forces it has resulted in a shift away from crime prevention to a more reactive service. But in truth, the factors fuelling the increase in violent crime are far wider than just policing resources, they are numerous and complex. From social deprivation and family breakdowns, to a lack of investment in community activities and outreach programmes, all are playing a part. The void created by those wider societal failures is now being filled by criminal gangs, profiting from the trade in drugs, using violence to enforce their territory and business interests. The young and the impressionable are often sucked into this void, encouraged by the myths these gangs peddle around glamour, status and profit. It is a myth that social media is partially helping perpetuate through its video and online taunts. Trivial disputes are now all too often rapidly escalating into deadly feuds."

Williams became the oldest winner at the Crucible for 40 years and his victory represents a remarkable change in fortune. Last year he did not even qualify for the finals.. ""Cold in here isn't it?"", he said, as he entered the press room. Asked how his success felt, Williams said: ""It feels a little bit uncomfortable at the minute.

The report from the think tank's Intergenerational Commission, backed by business lobby group the CBI and trade union group the TUC, warns that today's thirty-somethings are the first generation to see their incomes dropping compared to when their parents were at that age. It points out that with record numbers of people renting and unable to get onto the housing ladder, and with many trapped in zero-hours jobs, radical action is necessary to reset the balance. :: Third of millennials face renting into retirement The proposed universal Citizen's Inheritance would be restricted to spending on a house deposit, or to fund ""skills, entrepreneurship and pension saving"", the Foundation said. Alongside the Citizen's Inheritance are other proposals, including a £2.3bn NHS levy, to be funded by new national insurance contributions from pensioners. It suggests social care should be bolstered with another £2.3bn raised by replacing council tax with a progressive property tax, which would impose bigger fees on those with bigger homes. The extensive report also recommends a host of other reforms, including strengthening the rights of those renting their homes, halving stamp duty for first-time buyers and providing a tax holiday for second-home owners selling their properties to first-time buyers. David Willetts, Executive Chair of the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Many people no longer believe that Britain is delivering on its obligations to young and old. ""But our Commission shows how Britain can rise to this challenge.

In the video, he is seen shooting a choir of black singers who fall to the ground, before he resumes dancing and smiling. In his television sketch, he appeared as his character Lando Calrissian hosting a ""galactic summit for black humans"". Glover joked that ""this started with one question - where the hell are all the black people in space?"" He said: ""For a while I thought it was me, the only one, but now I see before me all the black humans in the galaxy."" The camera cut away to a large function room with just three people sat in it.

The video sees him dance through a warehouse in between graphically shooting a black guitarist and a 10-strong choir. At points he is joined by a group of dancing black children in school uniforms as they perform in the middle of a riot-like scene, complete with police cars with flashing sirens. This Is America has since become the number one trending video on YouTube with more than five million views."

Currently, a relative must go through the time consuming and often costly process of applying to a court for access rights and then for a Child Arrangement Order (CAO) to be put into place. During a debate into the matter in the House of Commons last week, Conservative MP Nigel Huddleston said he had heard stories of grandparents who have tried to send birthday cards or Christmas gifts to their grandchildren and found themselves being visited by the police and accused of harassment. He said: ""Divorce and family breakdown can take an emotional toll on all involved, but the family dynamic that is all too often overlooked is that between grandparents and their grandchildren. ""When access to grandchildren is blocked, some grandparents call it a kind of living bereavement."" Fellow Conservative Tim Loughton said it was widely believed that parents should both be as involved as possible in their children's upbringing.

Centrica also reported an ""exceptionally high level"" of boiler breakdowns during the wintry weather in February and March, including its busiest ever week for repairs when it fixed 145,000 - as well as an uptick in customer complaints. The higher level of call-outs was likely to result in a fall in half-year profits for the supplier's services division, Centrica said. British Gas, which is the UK's biggest supplier, said last month that it was to hike household tariffs by a typical £60 a year, in line with increases also announced by most of its Big Six rivals, and blamed it on rising wholesale prices as well as the cost of implementing government policies. Centrica chief executive Iain Conn said in the latest update on Monday: ""2018 has begun well and overall financial performance in the year to date has been good, despite high competitive intensity in all our markets."" The company said: ""Colder than normal weather has increased energy demand and the significant commodity price volatility we have experienced has been managed well by our energy supply businesses."" Mr Conn also reported progress in Centrica's cost-cutting programme after earlier this year announcing that it was preparing to axe 4,000 roles by 2020. It said in the latest update that its employee numbers were expected to reduce by 1,000 over this year. Shares rose 1%. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""It's been a case of one step forward, one step back at Centrica so far this year. ""With heating dials turned up to the max to combat the cold, the Beast from the East provided a much-needed boost to the group. ""However, some of the extra volumes were offset by customer unrest following a higher number of boiler breakdowns. ""All the while, intense competition means account numbers continue to fall."" Meanwhile, npower, owned by Germany's Innogy, blamed the fall in its customer numbers on ""intense market competition"" and the fact that some of its fixed term tariffs came to an end in the first quarter. However, it also benefited from the cold weather, with revenues up 10% to £1.89bn compared to the same period last year and underlying earnings up 28% to £37m. Npower chief executive Paul Coffey said plans for npower to form a new company in a merger with Big Six rival SSE's energy supply business were ""progressing"" after it was referred for an in-depth investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last week."
2018-05-14,"Carillion executives used suppliers to ""prop up their failing business model"" according to MPs investigating the collapse of the construction and outsourcing firm.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180514123910/https://news.sky.com/story/carillion-used-suppliers-to-prop-up-failing-business-say-mps-11372066,"They said evidence from lender Santander showed the company had used its early payment facility (EPF) to conceal its true level of borrowing. The facility allowed suppliers to Carillion - described as ""notoriously late payers"" - to receive their money earlier via the bank, but at a discount, documents supplied to two parliamentary committees revealed. This was effectively a line of credit that should have been described as ""borrowing"" in annual accounts but was instead presented as liabilities to ""other creditors"", the MPs said. Credit ratings agency Moody's said that as much as £498m was misclassified as a result, the latest findings from the Work and Pensions and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committees said. Details submitted to the committee by Santander showed that it had written off £91m as bad debt in relation to the EPF. Santander finally withdrew the facility in December 2017, just weeks before the company went into liquidation. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chair of the BEIS committee, said: ""The collapse of Carillion left small businesses and sub-contractors out of pocket with many left unpaid for months and facing ruin."" Carillion was signed up to the Government's prompt payment code for dealing with suppliers but was making them wait for 120 days or more for their money, she added. Ms Reeves said: ""Carillion's early payment facility ripped off their suppliers, forcing them to accept a cut in what they were owed, and was a blatant attempt by Carillion management to prop up their failing business model."" Frank Field, the Labour chair of the Work and Pensions committee, said: ""Carillion displayed utter contempt for its suppliers, many of them the small businesses that are the lifeblood of the UK's economy."" The disclosures on Carillion's use of the EPF comes ahead of conclusions of the MPs' investigation due to be published this week. Sky News has revealed that the committees will say that former bosses at the company should face a formal inquiry into their fitness to serve as company directors. Carillion collapsed earlier this year with total pension liabilities of about £2.6bn and other debts of more than £4bn, making it one of the most costly insolvencies for many years. The company employed more than 19,000 people on Britain when it went bust. Since then, more than 11,000 jobs have been salvaged as contracts have been carved up and rehoused with other businesses, but more than 2,000 have been made redundant. Carillion was one of Britain's leading builders of new schools and hospitals and its collapses has raised urgent questions about the provision of key infrastructure by the private sector."

The victims killed between 1978 and 1981 were murdered at his Cricklewood home and their remains were burned on a bonfire. The final three victims were killed in 1982 and 1983 at his Muswell Hill home and the flesh and small bones were flushed down the toilet. Nilsen was convicted and jailed in 1983 and died in prison on Saturday. The killer usually met the victims in pubs and bars and lured them to their deaths, strangling them and sometimes drowning them. He washed and dressed the bodies, sat with them for days or weeks before dismembering them, and carried out sexual acts with the corpses. After removing their internal organs that were dumped nearby, he got rid of the remains. He was caught by accident when a drain outside his home became blocked by the remains he tried to flush away. Here is a list of his victims, some of whom remain unidentified: :: Stephen Dean Holmes, aged 14. Murdered: 29 December 1978.  Nilsen met the teenager in a pub and invited him home. At the property, he was worried the teenager would try to leave and so he got a tie and tightened it around his neck. Stephen was unconscious but not dead so Nilsen drowned him in a bucket of water. He kept the corpse under floorboards for nearly eight months and then burned the remains on a bonfire. :: Kenneth Ockenden, aged 23. Murdered: 3 December 1979 Nilsen and Canadian Mr Ockenden drank together in a pub and ended up in Nilsen's flat. He strangled him with an electrical cord from headphones as Mr Ockenden listened to music and kept his body under the floorboards. He took the corpse back out several times so they could sit together and watch TV. :: Martyn Duffey, aged 16. Murdered: 17 May 1980 Nilsen strangled homeless man Martyn Duffey in bed. He was still alive so Nilsen took him to the kitchen and drown him in a sink full of water. The body was placed in a cupboard for two days before being put under floorboards. :: William Sutherland, aged 26. Murdered: August 1980 Nilsen barely recalls strangling him and finding a body in his home the next morning. :: Unidentified male. September 1980 The victim was an Irish labourer whom he met in a pub. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim. :: Unidentified male. October 1980 Nilsen described him as a slender male prostitute of either Filipino or Mexican heritage whom he met in a pub. :: Unidentified male. November 1980 The victim was described by Nilsen as being an English homeless man who was sleeping in a doorway when they met. Nilsen strangled him at his home. :: Unidentified male. November-December 1980 The victim an English ""long-haired hippy"" he had met in the West End. His body was kept beneath the floorboards until Nilsen removed the corpse, cut it into three pieces, then replaced the remains beneath the floorboards. He burned the corpse one year later. Nilsen was to later claim to have fabricated this victim. :: Unidentified male. January 1981 He was described as an ""18-year-old, blue-eyed Scot"" who wore a green tracksuit top and trainers and they had met in a pub in Soho. Nilsen dissected his body. :: Unidentified male. February 1981 He was originally from Belfast and was slim. He was strangled with a tie. :: Unidentified male. April 1981 Nilsen met the English skinhead at a food stall in Leceister Square. Nilsen hung this victim's naked torso in his bedroom for 24 hours, before placing the body beneath the floorboards. Nilsen later claimed to have fabricated this victim. :: Malcolm Barlow, aged 23. Murdered: 17 September 1981 Nilsen found Barlow, who had mental problems, loitering outside his home and invited him in where they drank together. Nilsen then strangled him. He stowed the body under the kitchen sink as he had no more room under floorboards. :: John Howlett, aged 23. Murdered: March 1982 The final three victims were killed in Muswell Hill. Howlett went to Nilsen's place to drink. Nilsen tried to get him to leave but he refused to go so Nilsen used an upholstery strap to strangle him. Nilsen did not die so he dragged him into the bathroom and drowned him. :: Graham Allen, aged 27. Murdered: September 1982 Allen was strangled with a ligature as he sat eating an omelette Nilsen had cooked for him His body was kept in a bath for three days before Nilsen dissected his body on the kitchen floor. :: Steve Sinclair, aged 20. Murdered: 26 January, 1983 At his home, Nilsen used a string-and-tie ligature to strangle Sinclair. He was the killer's last victim."

However, they are prevented from doing so because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 says only same-sex couples are eligible to become civil partners. The couple, who have two daughters aged two and eight months, claim the government's position is ""incompatible with equality law"". They suffered a defeat at the Court of Appeal in February last year, but were given the go-ahead in August for a Supreme Court hearing which is being held today. In a statement outside court ahead of the hearing, Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan said: ""Throughout our campaign we have met hundreds of couples like us who love each other and want a civil partnership so they can celebrate their commitment and strengthen the security of their family unit. ""Their reasons for not wanting to marry vary from bad personal experiences to expense to conscience - but that doesn't matter. ""All they want is the choice of marriage or a civil partnership to suit them, which is currently available only to same-sex couples. ""We have a new Equalities Minister and she should take this opportunity to look afresh at the Government's position. ""It's time for the Government to stop making excuses which play with people's lives, and give choice to all now."" Campaigners say it is unfair that same-sex couples can enter into a civil partnership or get married, when mixed-sex couples can only get married. They say this denies mixed-sex couples who do not want to get married the legal protections afforded to those in civil partnerships, such as the ability to inherit property tax-free from their partner. They want the Government to extend the legal arrangement to heterosexual couples."

Collecting the prize from Sherlock star Martin Freeman, she said: ""Three Girls was born out of the courage of the real three girls, and the real Holly, Amber and Ruby who told their story over and over and over and told it again to us. ""I just want to say thank you for recognising how selfless that is and how brave that is."" The drama also won the prize for best mini-series. Writer Nicole Taylor dedicated the prize to health worker Sara Rowbotham and former detective Maggie Oliver, who helped blow the whistle on the scandal, as well as the real three victims and their families. Foy had been nominated for a second consecutive year for her role as the Queen in The Crown, while Newton was nominated for her part in Line Of Duty. Foy, who sported a Time's Up pin on her white dress, spoke about her support for the campaign ahead of the ceremony, saying: ""It's about not thinking this is just a moment. ""It's not a moment, it's a continuing evolving thing and in five or six years' time we'll know how much progress we've made, and I think it's just a really important thing to support."" Sean Bean was named best leading actor for his role as a Roman Catholic priest in Broken. BBC Three's This Country, a mockumentary which depicts life in rural Britain, won two awards. It received the BAFTA for scripted comedy, while writer and star Daisy May Cooper won female performance in a comedy programme. Former footballer Rio Ferdinand won best single documentary for Being Mum And Dad, a film about the loss of his wife Rebecca to cancer. ""It's been quite a crazy whirlwind experience,"" he said on accepting his award. ""I didn't do this for any other reason than my three kids. ""The worst thing to come out of this is I get quite emotional now but it's allowed me to speak and show vulnerability that people aren't used to because as a sportsman you're built up to be indestructible."" He said the documentary had helped him heal and referring to his ""beautiful girlfriend"" Kate Wright, he said: ""We are making steps in the right direction"". Sky News also won an award for its coverage of the Rohingya crisis. Meanwhile, the highest accolade the Academy bestows, the fellowship, was presented to journalist Kate Adie. Speaking about the importance of reporting, she said: ""It's essential in a democracy, we tell truth to power. ""We tell it like it is and in these times that is more important than ever.""

Holden said: ""I think he will be missed but Dec will do a sterling job and Alesha and I are on hand to step in! ""I think Mand and Dec has a nice ring to it!""

He was convicted of the murders in 1983 and was imprisoned at HMP Full Sutton maximum security prison in Yorkshire. Nilsen died in prison on Saturday, 34 years into his life sentence, according to the Ministry of Justice. He was named the Muswell Hill Murderer because a number of his murders were committed at his home in Muswell Hill in north London. He is known to have attempted to kill seven other men and boys. He initially confessed in 1983 to having killed 15 victims. The majority of his victims were vulnerable boys or men, many of whom were homeless or homosexual. After strangling them, he would bathe their lifeless remains and dress them up; placing them around his home and sleeping at their side. When this grotesque illusion of intimacy drew to a close, he would stow the bodies under floorboards, eventually dismembering and burning them. His crimes were only detected by chance - when a drain outside his home became blocked by the human remains he had tried to flush away. A controversial Central TV documentary Murder in Mind featured extracts from an interview Nilsen gave in Albany Prison, Isle of Wight, in 1993. He described how he liked to dress the bodies in pants and vests, then undress them, and enjoyed the feeling of power when he carried their ""limp"" bodies. Nilsen said: ""It was an expression of my power to lift and carry him and have control. ""The dangling elements of his limp limbs was an expression of his passivity. The more passive he could be, the more powerful I was."" In the final section of the interview, he said: ""The bodies all gone. Everything's gone, there's nothing left. But I still feel spiritual communion with these people."" Nilsen was jailed for life with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 25 years, on six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""Dennis Andrew Nilsen, date of birth November 23 1945, died in custody at HMP Full Sutton on Saturday, May 12 2018. ""As with all deaths in custody, there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman."""

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was ""delighted to announce"" their release. ""I pay tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their tireless help during this terrible case,"" he said. A 25-year-old park ranger travelling with them was killed and their driver was also taken captive, a park spokesman said. Mr Johnson added: ""My thoughts are now with the family of Virunga Park ranger Rachel Masika Baraka who was killed during the kidnapping, and with the injured driver and the released British nationals as they recover from this traumatic incident."" Their vehicle was ambushed north of the city of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, on Friday. The park released a statement saying Ms Baraka was trying to protect two passengers and the driver of the vehicle when it was attacked by armed assailants. They said she was taken to hospital for treatment but died from her injuries. The park's director, Emmanuel de Merode, said: ""Ranger Baraka's life was tragically cut short in service to Virunga National Park. ""She was one of the Park's 26 female rangers and was highly committed, showing true bravery in her work. ""We wish to extend our sincerest condolences to her family, and our thoughts are with all those affected by this incident."" The park has experienced an increase in violence in recent months with armed groups staging a series of raids to steal resources, particularly charcoal. Last month, five young rangers and a driver in the park were killed in an ambush. It was the deadliest attack in recent years and took the total number of rangers killed in the park to 175. Virunga is a UNESCO world heritage site covering 3,000 square miles on the country's border with Uganda and Rwanda."

""He climbed into the camera run and reached the main stage via the bridge, pursued by security,"" said a spokesman. ""He was removed off stage after seven seconds and was questioned by police. We take security very seriously and an investigation into what happened is already underway."" The man previously stormed the stage during the final of The Voice in 2017 and the National Television Awards in January this year. He grabbed the microphone from Britain's Eurovision entrant on Saturday night, before shouting about the ""Nazis of the UK media"". SuRie remained on stage and clapped along to the music of her song Storm as the man was dragged away by security. Dr ACactivism refers to himself on his website as an author of seven eBooks, and a post on his Twitter account from 10 May advertises his latest eBook called The Workings Of The UK State Mafia. Hours before his Eurovision stage invasion he posted a video on Twitter that claims to show a journalist grabbing his neck. Words across the video read: ""Watch how journalists and Police of London use force to silence Independent Thinkers."" Dr ACactivism crashed the stage during the final of The Voice in April 2017, whilst holding up a piece of paper that was meant for viewers to read. He was tackled by security before the audience had a chance to read the message. The activist later claimed that the security staff almost broke his neck as they removed him from the stage. One of Dr ACactivism's eBooks is called ""My Struggle for the Freedom of Ideas Against the Corrupted Murdering Nazis of the Big Mainstream Media like the ITV: Murdering Nazis of the Big Mainstream Media."" In the book he touches on his stage invasion on The Voice in a section called ""Whoever dares will be choked to death. This is the lesson that the ITV gave to me, Dr AC"". In January 2018, he tried to make it onto the stage at the National Television Awards while the nominees for the Bruce Forsyth Entertainment award were read out. Presenter Dermot O'Leary was able to remove him from the stage without him making it on television. Dr ACactivism posted a video on Twitter explaining why he tried to make it on stage at the awards ceremony, in which he said: ""The artists and the journalists of the UK media are working with a philosophy that says control and oppress. ""So they control every institution that has to do with ideas, from the big media to social media, movie theatres, cinemas, book companies and so on."" He adds: ""So I, Dr AC disrupted them for social justice, that is the freedom of ideas, the right of participation, and the right of being heard."" Graham Norton, who was the commentator for the BBC coverage of Eurovision 2018, said after SuRie's performance: ""She was doing a brilliant job anyway."" He later added: ""There was a stage invasion, SuRie coped incredibly well, I can't stress enough what a brilliant job she did, she must have been terrified."" The European Broadcasting Union offered SuRie the chance to perform again but she chose not to. SuRie came 24th of the 26 entries in the contest. The 29-year-old tweeted afterwards: ""Well I've always said anything can happen at Eurovision. ""I'm so proud of my performance tonight. I gave it my very best. ""It's been an incredible experience for me. I am so grateful for everyone's love and support. ""The fans make Eurovision what it is; the biggest and the most inclusive and open celebration of music in the world."" The competition was won by Israel's Netta, who sang her quirky dance number Toy. Although acts of activism in the Eurovision Song Contest are rare, the competition does have a long history of political voting."

The bodies of their mother Katrina Miles, 35, and grandparents Peter and Cynda Miles were also discovered there. Mr Cockman, who was estranged from the children's mother, told reporters on Sunday that he thought the shooting was planned and carried out by Peter Miles. Speaking publicly about the incident for the first time, he said: ""Peter didn't snap. I think he's thought this through. I think he's been thinking this through for a long time. ""He was like my best friend and I still love who he was, but his mental attitude... there are some people you just don't get on the wrong side of, and that's Peter and Cynda."" Mr Cockman added that he had felt ""so much anger"" during a custody battle over his children but now just feels ""tremendous sadness for my kids"". ""Angry will destroy you,"" he said. ""I'm tremendously sad but I'll get through this."" Police have confirmed they are treating the deaths as a murder-suicide, and that they are not searching for any suspects, but have not confirmed which family member they believe carried out the shooting. Three firearms belonging to Mr Miles were found by investigators at the property. The deaths mark the worst mass shooting in Australia since a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania in 1996, prompting the nation to introduce tougher gun controls. Western Australia premier Mark McGowan, who travelled to nearby Margaret River on Sunday, said he did not think gun laws could be further tightened but would await recommendations from an inquiry into the shootings."

A spokesman said: ""We remain committed to Club 18-30 for summer 2018. ""However, we are exploring options for the future of the brand, which could include the possibility of a sale."" It is not the first time that Club 18-30's future has looked in doubt. In 2006, Thomas Cook said it was reviewing its UK operations amid reports it could be about to offload the brand."

Detective inspector Andy Eggleton said: ""We would like to speak to anyone who used a footpath giving access to the campsite between midnight and 6.30am on Sunday, and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious."" ""We are also aware of a 50th birthday party having taken place at the campsite this weekend and again would ask anyone who attended to come forward please."" :: Anyone with information can contact Sussex Police online or by phoning 101, quoting Operation Cobblestone, or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111."
2018-05-14,"The Director General of MI5, the UK's domestic intelligence agency, has used a speech to the intelligence community to criticise Russia's aggressive activity .",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180514123910/https://news.sky.com/story/mi5-head-to-criticise-russias-aggressive-activity-11371855,"In his first public comments since the Salisbury nerve agent attack, Andrew Parker said that Moscow is using its spies and military to carry out ""flagrant breaches of international rules"". Speaking in Berlin, to an audience of European intelligence agencies, Mr Parker accused the Kremlin of ""pursuing an agenda through aggressive and pernicious acts by its military and intelligence services"", adding that Russia risks becoming a ""more isolated pariah"" if it continues to act in the way it has. Addressing the campaign of disinformation that followed the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, Mr Parker said there is a need ""to shine a light through the fog of lies, half-truths and obfuscation that pours out of their propaganda machine"". Following considerable work behind the scenes by MI5 and its sister agency MI6, 28 European countries agreed to support the UK by expelling diplomats in solidarity. ""European intelligence co-operation today is simply unrecognisable to what it looked like five years ago,"" Mr Parker said during the speech, the first time a serving Director General of MI5 has spoken publicly outside the UK. And with a nod to Brexit, he described how the Counter Terrorism Group, made up of 30 European domestic intelligence agencies, is the ""largest multinational counter-terrorism enterprise in the world"" where ""real-time intelligence sharing"" involves ""thousands of exchanges on advanced secure networks every week"". Mr Parker addressed the ongoing threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism warning that ""Daesh still aspires to direct devastating and more complex attacks"", despite territorial losses, in the wake of 45 attacks across Europe since 2016. Thanking European security agencies for their support in the investigation following the Manchester bombing nearly a year ago, the intelligence chief disclosed that MI5 has thwarted 12 plots alongside police since the Westminster atrocity in March 2017. This brings the total number of disrupted attacks since 2013 to 25. Mr Parker said that he is ""confident about our ability to tackle these threats, because of the strength and resilience of our democratic systems, the resilience of our societies and the values we share with our European partners"". His words will take on greater resonance after an attack in Paris killed one and wounded four others on Saturday night. A Chechen-born French citizen, named as Khasan Azimov, was shot dead by police. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, posting a martyr video of the man through the group's Amaq news agency."
2018-05-14,"Visits to Britain's shops saw an ""unprecedented"" decline in the last two months - worse even than at the height of the financial crisis - new figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180514123910/https://news.sky.com/story/shopping-visits-see-unprecedented-decline-11372120,"Footfall was down by 3.3% in April compared with last year following a 6% drop in March, resulting in a slump of 4.8% over the two periods combined, says the report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). That was worse than the 3.8% decline seen over March and April 2009, according to data company Springboard, which compiled the figures. Separate figures from Visa also painted a gloomy picture, showing overall consumer spending down 2% in April - failing to recover at all from its performance in March despite an upturn in pay growth and an improvement in the weather. Retailers have been struggling amid a squeeze on household finances as wages have struggled to keep pace with inflation, while the freezing weather earlier in the year has also taken its toll. Toys R Us and Maplin have been among the casualties of the bleak conditions on the high street, while in latest developments, Sky News revealed over the weekend that discounter Poundworld was to be put up for sale. Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said: ""Not since the depths of recession in 2009 has footfall over March and April declined to such a degree, and even then the drop was less severe."" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said the wet start to April had a ""dampening effect"" on footfall. This added to the long-term downward trend in footfall being caused by ""changing consumer behaviour"" which includes the shift towards online shopping. The Visa figures - which include money spent on going out to cinemas and restaurants as well as retail spending - also painted a dismal picture. Visa chief commercial officer Mark Antipof said: ""With inflation beginning to fail and wages growing faster than expected in recent months, it would have been easy to assume we might be over the worst of the consumer squeeze. ""Yet there has been no corresponding improvement in spending, with April's 2% decline a simple repeat of what we witnessed in March. ""Low confidence levels amongst shoppers and the gloomy outlook for the UK economy are likely to have contributed to this continued caution. ""It is clear that consumers remain in belt-tightening mode, with discretionary spending on furniture, electrical appliances and recreational activities worst hit."" Elsewhere, however there was a glimmer of hope for the UK consumer outlook as figures from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development showed employers planned to offer bigger pay rises to staff over the next year than they expected three months ago. That reflected faster pay growth in the public sector as well as more general demand for staff."

Germany doesn't just physically sit at the heart of Europe (and close to Russia) but politically it is hugely influential in the EU. :: MI5 boss accuses Russia of 'criminal thuggery' It is as good a venue as any to speak out about the value of partnerships against shared threats. In 2018, the co-operation between the continent's intelligence agencies is greater and closer than even just a few years ago. The threat and successes of Islamic State have forced that; the increasing aggression from Russia has made it essential. Russia's motive behind the Salisbury poisoning is still unknown, but it is my belief that Vladimir Putin wanted to test the unity of Britain's international partnerships - UK/US, UK/EU, UK/NATO. The blizzard of misinformation and confusion after the events in Salisbury was designed to create doubt and cast aspersions on previously trusted institutions like government, intelligence agencies and the media. It didn't work. Prime Minister Theresa May persuaded allies to get behind the UK and expel Russian diplomats in solidarity - this diplomatic success was in large part down to a considerable amount of work behind the scenes by MI5 and MI6, convincing their partners that Britain's intelligence assessment was accurate. Brexit is a division of Europe though, at least politically if not also economically. The slow departure of the UK from the EU is complicated, messy and at times bad-tempered - it is precisely what Putin wants to see. As the head of MI5 Andrew Parker made clear in his speech, he ""doesn't do politics"" - but he and his counterparts at MI6 and GCHQ are on the offensive to ensure that security cooperation continues unaffected by Brexit. Islamic State has lost much of its territory in Iraq and Syria but it hasn't been defeated. It still poses a threat to the UK and Europe. This point was proven only on Saturday night when a Chechen-born Frenchman killed one and injured four other people in Paris, in the name of Islamic State. IS is ""seeking to regroup"", Mr Parker said, as Europe faces an ""intense, unrelenting and multi-dimensional terrorist threat"". When it comes to security, the continent must become more united, not less."
2018-05-14,A talent agency which manages the careers of some of the media industry's biggest names is in talks about a £140m sale weeks after TV presenter Ant McPartlin – one of its leading clients – was handed a record fine for drink-driving.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180514123910/https://news.sky.com/story/talent-agency-shrugs-off-ant-and-dec-woes-with-140m-sale-11372384,"Sky News has learnt that private equity firms including Bowmark Capital, Inflexion and Trilantic Partners are among a pack of potential buyers of James Grant Group, which represents elite athletes, musicians, writers and broadcasters. Sources close to the auction, which is being run by bankers at Lazard, said that formal bids for James Grant were due to be tabled by the end of the month. The deadline comes after tentative talks were held with Exponent Private Equity, the owner of Loch Lomond whisky group, about a deal. Those discussions are understood to have begun prior to Mr McPartlin - one half of ITV's star entertainment presenting duo Ant and Dec - being charged with drink-driving in March. Exponent is subsequently understood to have indicated that it only would be prepared to pay a lower price for the business, according to one insider. Ant and Dec have become two of British TV's best-paid performers as the presenters of shows such as I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, Saturday Night Takeaway and Britain's Got Talent. James Grant, which was set up in 1984, provides a range of services to its clients, who also include well-known personalities such as Davina McCall, Louis Tomlinson and Tess Daly. It is said to have strong growth prospects on both sides of the Atlantic and would only pursue a sale to a buyer prepared to acknowledge the value of this potential, the insider added. The company is part-owned by Metric Capital Partners, a private equity firm which backed it in 2014. Last year, the talent group announced a merger with Troika, a rival agency whose clients include Graham Norton, the chat-show presenter, Matt Lucas and Michael Fassbender, the Hollywood actor. Insiders said that that combination increased the size and product offering provided by James Grant, which would increase the attractiveness of the business to potential buyers. Neil Rodford, James Grant's chief executive, said at the time of the deal: ""Our combined client roster creates a depth and breadth of clients, which puts us at the forefront of the entertainment industries on both sides of the Atlantic."" Accounts filed at Companies House for the year to August 2016 show that it made a post-tax profit of just over £1m. Neither Lazard nor Exponent could be reached for comment."

Mr Miliband, an ex-Labour cabinet minister, shared a platform with Liberal Democrat former deputy minister Sir Nick Clegg and the Conservative chairwoman of the commons treasury committee, Nicky Morgan. Speaking at a Tilda Rice Mill in Rainham, Essex, the trio repeated their statement from a joint article for the Mail on Sunday that Britain was being ""held to ransom"" by hardline Brexiteers. They say a hard Brexit threatens jobs and living standards in the UK. Mr Miliband, who now heads the New York-based International Rescue Committee aid agency, denied he was seeking to launch a new, centrist political movement when asked by the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. ""This is about calling for MPs of all parties to stand together,"" he said. ""The truth is that Britain is being held to ransom by the demand for hard Brexit, for severing the links with the customs union and the single market that is at the heart of the debate going on at the moment. ""It think that it is significant that people should come together, frankly out of alarm at the prospects for the UK. ""The prospects of a hard Brexit are very high now and, what's worse, the prospect of no deal is rising too. ""It does not need to be like this. It is very, very important that the country is not held to the kind of ransom that at the moment threatens living standards as well as the political influence of the UK in a very fundamental way."" Mr Miliband warned that currently the government does not have a settled position on the kind of future relationship it wants with the EU. He added: ""The negotiation is not with Europe at the moment; the negotiation is in the Cabinet room. This isn't funny. ""We are less than 120 days away from the final negotiation."" Mr Miliband also criticised Jeremy Corbyn over Labour's refusal to support a Lords amendment that would allow Britain to become part of the European Economic Area (EEA) after it leaves the UK. Ms Morgan criticised the language used in the Brexit debate and revealed she had been the subject of an alleged death threat. She said people who voiced concerns about the Brexit process were branded ""a mutineer, a saboteur or a traitor"". The trio's speech came as the European Union warned Britain time was running out to seal a Brexit deal this autumn. ""We are concerned that there is no clear stance, no clear position from the British. The clock is ticking,"" German EU minister Michael Roth said. ""We need now to be making substantial progress, but that is not happening. What is worrying us in particular is the Northern Ireland question where we expect a substantial accommodation from the British side."""

Swans fans were given hope after Andy King slotted away in the 14th minute, although they would still have needed Manchester City to thrash Southampton to secure their Premier League status on goal difference. Their luck ran out as Badou Ndiaye equalised for Stoke, before Peter Crouch added another minutes before the end of the first half. Stoke, whose relegation to the Championship had already been confirmed, held on to end Swansea's seven-year run in the Premier League. Despite the immediate work by Portuguese manager Carlos Carvalhal to reinvigorate the side after he joined the club in December, Swansea faltered at the end of the season and failed to pick up a single win in their last nine games. Speaking after their final day loss, Cavalhal told BBC Sport: ""In my opinion, the few points that the team achieved in the first part of the season sent us down. ""When I arrived we had 13 points. In 18 games, we got 20 points. The beginning of the season was not good. We tried to recover. Me and my players were on the limits, we did the maximum that we could. ""Getting 20 points was very good, not fantastic. Over the whole season it would have been enough to finish around 13th. ""I'm only here for four months, so I can't talk about the structure of the club. I'm not the best person to talk about that."" Elsewhere, Liverpool thrashed Brighton 4-0 to secure fourth place and Champions League qualification at the expense of Chelsea. Mohamed Salah opened the scoring with his 32nd of the campaign - the most by a player in a 38-game Premier League season."

This is compared to 25,140 referrals in 2014-15. More than half of the referrals came from primary schools, where children are under the age of 11, the figures showed. The statistics also revealed that nearly a third of those referred to NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) were declined specialist treatment. The NSPCC warned increased demand for services was placing the system under pressure and jeopardising the well-being of thousands of children. It has called for more funding for its Childline service to help relieve some of the pressure. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the charity, said: ""Our research shows schools are increasingly referring children for specialist mental health treatment, often when the child is at crisis point. ""We have seen a marked increase in counselling about mental health, and fully expect it to continue."" The NSPCC's data, released under the freedom of information act, covers 53 of the 66 health trusts known to provide mental health support to children."

She was a popular figure in Parliament who played a major role in securing the 2012 Olympics for London when she led the culture department. Food blogger Ella Woodward, who is married to the peer's son Matthew, posted on Instagram: ""Matt's extraordinary Mum passed away last night. ""She was lying in Matt, his sister Jess, and their Dad's arms, as they told her that she would live forever in the centre of their souls. ""I've never seen love like I have since becoming part of their family. ""Tessa was the warmest and kindest soul, she welcomed me so generously into their family, and no matter what she has achieved in her life - and she achieved an extraordinary amount, I know her family are the thing that made her most proud.""

""Her husband David and their children Jessie and Matthew were by her side, with Jessie's husband Finn, Matthew's wife Ella, and David's children from his first marriage."" The spokesman added: ""In addition to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in recent months doctors tried innovative new treatments which Tessa gladly embraced, but sadly the tumour recently progressed very quickly."" Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted: ""The dignity and courage with which Dame Tessa Jowell confronted her illness was humbling and it was inspirational. Former PM Tony Blair said: ""Tessa had passion, determination and simple human decency in greater measure than any person I have ever known."" Lord Sebastian Coe, president of the IAAF and former chairman of the London organising committee of the Olympics, said: ""Tessa was not just a close friend, she was a life enhancer. ""Her contribution to the Olympic and Paralympic Games is easily defined - quite simply, without Tessa there would have been no London 2012, and without Tessa they would not have been the success they were."" Baroness Jowell became MP for the south London Dulwich and West Norwood constituency in 1992. After Labour's landslide election victory five years later, she held a succession of ministerial jobs, including employment minister and minister for women, before joining the Cabinet as culture secretary in 2001. She took on the job of convincing unsure colleagues about the merits of hosting the Olympics in 2012. London finally won the vote in July 2005. In 2012 she was made Dame Tessa Jowell in the Queen's Birthday Honours for political and charitable services, which were partly in recognition of her work on the Olympics. Three years later, after stepping down from the Commons at the 2015 general election, she was made Baroness Jowell of Brixton. She later stood to be Labour's candidate for mayor of London in 2016 but lost out to Sadiq Khan."

""Bare-faced lying seems to be the default mode, coupled with ridicule of critics,"" he said. ""The Russian state's now well-practised doctrine of blending media manipulation, social media disinformation and distortion, along with new and old forms of espionage and high-levels of cyber attacks, military force and criminal thuggery is what is meant these days by the term 'hybrid threats'."" Mr Parker said the Russian government was the ""chief protagonist"" in trying to undermine European democracies with ""malign activities"" and their acts risked making it a ""more isolated pariah"". Following the nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, Mr Parker said Russia had launched a ""cynical and distasteful information campaign"", with at least 30 different ""so-called explanations"". ""Whatever nonsense they conjure up, the case is clear,"" he said. He said it was ""not acceptable"" after the Russian state had carried out the nerve agent attack in Salisbury and supported the Syrian government, despite its use of chemical weapons on civilians. He also criticised Russia's invasion of Crimea, its attempt to interfere in elections in the US and France, its attempted coup in Montenegro and the state's cyber attacks on Western institutions. Mr Parker, who is director general of the security service, revealed 12 terror plots have been thwarted in the UK since March last year, taking the total number of disrupted attacks in the UK to 25 since 2013. He said that while Islamic State had lost its ""false caliphate"" in Iraq and Syria, the terrorist group was ""seeking to regroup"". ""Europe faces an intense, unrelenting and multi-dimensional terrorist threat,"" he said. In a nod to Brexit, Mr Parker said co-operation with EU partners was essential to guard against the threats from Islamist militants and Russia. ""We must not risk the loss of mutual capability or weakening of collective effort across Europe,"" Mr Parker said. ""We owe that to all our citizens across Europe."" Meanwhile, a meeting of the Nato-Russia council will discuss for the first time Moscow's increasing use of ""hybrid threats"" such as propaganda and disinformation, a senior NATO official said. ""NATO doesn't want a Cold War,"" said Arndt Freytag von Loringhoven, first assistant secretary general for intelligence and security. ""It wants a constructive relationship with Russia, but it cannot leave unanswered Moscow's diverse hybrid attacks on democracies of other countries."""

However, its results statement showed the airline had become more cautious on the current financial year, with Ryanair cutting its profit guidance to between €1.25bn and €1.35bn as it prepared to book a surge in costs. It warned they included a potential €400m rise in fuel bills as oil prices continue to climb despite it being 90% hedged. Ryanair also pointed to rising staffing costs. It has been forced to offer revised terms since its decision to cancel thousands of flights over the last winter schedule - blamed on a blunder over pilot rotas - that brought to the surface simmering tensions over pay. Ryanair has since started work on union recognition for the first time in its history - agreeing deals with pilots' unions in the UK and Italy - and has agreed new five-year pay deals with pilots and cabin crew. It said of the current financial year: ""We expect staff costs to rise by almost €200m, half of which is higher pay for our front line people and half is additional headcount for growth."" Chief executive Michael O'Leary said of the pressures ahead: ""Our outlook for FY19 (full-year 2019) is on the pessimistic side of cautious. ""We expect to grow traffic by 7% to 139 million, at flat load factors of 95%. ""Unit costs this year will rise 9% due to higher staff and oil prices which will, when adjusted for volume growth, add more than €400m to our fuel bill. ""Ex-fuel unit cost will rise by up to 6% as we annualise pilot and cabin crew pay increases, and invest in our business and our systems to facilitate a six year growth plan to 600 aircraft and 200m guests per annum."" He added: ""Forward bookings are strong but pricing remains soft. Since only half of Easter fell in April, we expect a 5% fare decline in Q1 (quarter one) but a 4% rise in Q2 fares. ""While still too early to accurately forecast close-in summer bookings or H2 fares, we are cautiously guiding broadly flat average fares for FY19."" Mr O'Leary said he expected revenue from passenger surcharges to continue growing but not by enough to offset higher costs."

A source close to the oligarch confirmed to Sky News that Mr Abramovich's visa expired at the end of April. An application for it to be renewed is in process but taking longer than usual, they added. Mr Abramovich's spokesman, John Mann, refused to comment. The oligarch owns property in London but has now returned to Russia, explaining his absence from Saturday's football showpiece, according to website The Bell. Flight records show the businessman's personal Boeing 767 airplane was last in London on 1 April, the publication added. It comes amid heightened diplomatic tensions between Russia and the UK in the wake of the Salisbury spy poisoning, along with recent British military involvement in Syria. The Home Office would not comment on Mr Abramovich's visa status. Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""We do not routinely comment on individual cases."" Mr Abramovich is worth an estimated £9.3bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and has overseen an era of lavish spending at Chelsea since taking charge of the London club in 2003. He has links to Vladimir Putin's government in Moscow and, earlier this year, was included for the first time on a US list of Russian officials and oligarchs close to the Kremlin that could serve as a basis for future sanctions. The UK government has toughened its rhetoric against the Kremlin since the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March. At the time, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny claimed sanctions against Mr Abramovich would be ""very effective and supported by public opinion within Russia"", as part of a UK response to the Skripals' poisoning. He also named Arsenal part-owner Alisher Usmanov and former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov as other possible targets for sanctions. The Russian government is currently planning new laws that would make the promotion of Western sanctions by Russian citizens a criminal offence."

Amy: This time last year we were expecting our second child, who we named Nico. We were excited - a little worried about how we'd handle two kids - but excited. So I went for the scan and the first few seconds were joy, you see the little blob and you hear the heartbeat, you know it's there and then I just knew when the doctor was quiet and said nothing that this wasn't good news. She said ""I'm really sorry your baby has a condition called anencephaly"". It's a neural tube defect and our baby had no top of the head. She explained that the baby was probably going to pass away in the uterus. She explained that some babies do go full-term and if they do go full-term and you give birth, they're likely to die while you're giving birth and that if the baby didn't die when you were giving birth it was going to be a few minutes or an hour or two. At that stage I started thinking about our son Finn and when he was born and you know when you give birth, the head is a really important part of that and I was thinking about this baby, about Nico. I started to think this wasn't a kind way to die and I was thinking about myself having to spend the next six months of people asking me about how far along I was and trying to explain to Finn that I was pregnant but there was never going to be a baby. Before all this happened I would have known that abortion was illegal here in most cases but I thought really in a case that was so severe where a baby was missing most of its brain, where the amniotic fluid was wearing the brain down until she died, I really thought they would be able to help more. They said we could end the pregnancy early and they could fax the paperwork to Liverpool. I just felt abandoned. Conor: I booked the flights and we managed to find a babysitter for our son because we needed to go overnight. We flew out on a Ryanair flight with stag parties and hen parties and other women as well. We wondered if there were any other women on the plane and sure enough when we got to the clinic, yes there were people there. Amy: I had a surgical abortion so I was put under and they gave us Nico's remains in a box when we left. We stayed in an airport hotel and the next day, took our baby's remains to the airport and flew home. Conor: That was probably the lowest point. We had to pass Nico's remains through the X-ray machine and walk through security. And Amy turned to me and said what if they ask us to open the box? And I just said they won't, they know. But I didn't know at the time. Amy: So we got home and I suppose again it was one of those situations where there is no guidance from anyone, no one told us what you do when you get back. We knew enough to ring the hospital here about my mental health and my physical health but we had Nico's remains and so we put Nico's remains in our freezer. Conor: I started looking into what our options were. We looked into funerals and cremations but nothing seemed to suit our situation. We had a tiny cardboard box and we didn't really know what to do and in the end we felt that we didn't really have to follow anyone's rules any more. We didn't really get any support so we could make our own rules. So we got in the car one day and we drove down the country to a place we really liked, somewhere peaceful and we buried Nico's remains and we went to the family, we hugged, we cried a bit and we said goodbye."

The 29 year old, unbeaten in his 25 professional fights, is out to prove he still has what it takes to challenge the likes of Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder at the top of the division. Seferi, 39, is a career cruiserweight, but has been significantly more active than Fury, fighting four times since Fury defeated Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015. The Albanian has only ever won fought once at heavyweight, losing to Manuel Charr in September 2016 - the only defeat of his career. Fury's boxing license was reinstated after he accepted a backdated two-year ban from UK Anti-Doping in December 2017. He was charged with testing positive for a ""prohibited substance"" in June 2016, but said that was as a result of eating wild boar. Fury's promoter, Frank Warren, confirmed the fight will place on 9 June at Manchester Arena."

In contrast, London Heathrow, the UK's busiest airport, was found to have the best performance, with aircraft typically taking off 11 mins late. Leeds Bradford and Belfast both had the second best record on 11.3 mins, followed by London City on 11.6 mins. Passengers leaving the UK face an average delay of 15 mins at all major UK airports. The data from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) analysed by the Press Association takes into account every scheduled and charter flight from 25 of the UK's airports in 2017. Cancelled flights are not included. Responding to the rankings, a Luton spokeswoman said: ""We regret any delay our passengers experience."" She added that punctuality was influenced by ""many factors"" outside its control such as air traffic control strikes, late arriving aircraft, bad weather and congested airspace. Gatwick said it is doing ""everything within its power"" to improve the proportion of its flights that depart on time, including using new technology to predict and recover from late running flights and speeding up the time it takes to turn around inbound aircraft. A CAA spokesman said punctuality data enables passengers to ""make informed choices about which airports they fly from"". ""The aviation industry should constantly strive to improve punctuality to enhance the passenger experience,"" he added. Passengers on delayed flights from UK airports are entitled to assistance and compensation depending on the cause and length of the disruption. When flights are delayed for more than two hours, airlines have to provide free access to phone calls or emails, meals and refreshments, as well as hotel accommodation if an overnight stay is required. Passengers can also claim compensation when flights are delayed by more than three hours unless there are ""extraordinary circumstances"" such as severe weather or a security alert. Alex Neill, from consumer group Which?, said delays are ""one of the most frustrating things about travelling"" and urged passengers to ""claim what they are entitled to""."
2018-05-21,A group of MPs is calling for the government to make buying sex illegal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180521062517/https://news.sky.com/story/surge-in-pop-up-brothels-prompt-mps-to-call-for-ban-on-buying-sex-11379973,"It follows new research into sex trafficking showing an increasing number of ""pop-up"" brothels in the UK. The study - Behind Closed Doors - suggests websites where sex is sold are fuelling a new wave of short-let brothels allowing women to be trafficked around the country for sex by criminal gangs. The report found that in last month there were at least 212 ongoing police operations into sexual slavery and last year there were 1,185 referrals for potential victims. Campaigners suspect these figures represent a fraction of the real problem. The study also found one website alone has posted more than 18,000 escort profiles in the last three months. And one man being investigated for trafficking spent so much money advertising women for sex - a total of £30,000 - that a website gave him his own account manager. The National Crime Agency told MPs that adult services websites ""represent the most significant enabler of sexual exploitation in the UK"". The all-party parliamentary group on prostitution and the global sex trade says websites should be banned from advertising sex and women who work in the industry should be decriminalised. They are also calling on the government to make buying sex illegal. Gavin Shuker MP, chairman of the group, told Sky News: ""The government should take measures to end demand for prostitution, which means shifting the burden of criminality from those that sell sex to those that buy it. ""But there also shouldn't be a light touch on these prostitution websites that make it entirely possible to enable an evil trade of trafficking and exploitation. ""It needs government to take action and it needs government to wake up to the scale of exploitation."" Romanians are the largest group of individuals under investigation, making up 40% of all suspects. In Leicestershire, police visited 156 brothels, encountering 421 women in the last two years. They said 83% were Romanian. But many sex workers say criminalising the purchase of sex will leave them more isolated and make their job more dangerous. Cari Mitchell, from the English Collective of Prostitutes, told Sky News: ""The number of women who are trafficked in the sex industry is about 6%. It's very low. It's not true that most sex workers are dependent on these gangs. ""The whole commotion about these pop-up brothels is not only due to an increase in prostitution in general because of austerity cuts but it's due to the police raiding and closing regular premises and women being forced to move on."" Buying sex became illegal in Northern Ireland last year. The Sex Workers Alliance Ireland, which opposed the legislation, said the job has become more dangerous but demand has not fallen. Those who championed the move say more should be done to enforce it."
2018-05-21,"Major changes to MOT test rules in Britain have come into force making it harder for cars, vans, motorbikes and other light passenger vehicles to be passed as safe to go on the roads.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180521062517/https://news.sky.com/story/tougher-mot-test-rules-come-into-force-in-britain-11379249,"The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) says the shake-up has been designed to improve air quality and make roads safer. Twenty-eight people were killed and 413 were seriously injured in accidents on Britain's roads in 2016 when a vehicle defect was a contributory factor. Defects found during the new MOT are now categorised as either ""dangerous, major or minor"", depending on the type of problem and how serious it is. Both ""dangerous"" and ""major"" defects are fails, whereas a ""minor"" defect is counted as a pass but should be repaired as soon as possible. Diesel drivers will face stricter limits for emissions on vehicles with a diesel particulate filter (DPF), which captures soot. Their vehicles will get a ""major"" fault if the MOT tester can see smoke of any colour coming from the exhaust or finds evidence that the DPF has been tampered with. It is feared the new rules could lead to expensive bills for those who have previously taken their vehicles to unscrupulous garages where DPFs have been removed because they cost around £1,000 to replace when faulty. The testers will carry out a number of new checks, including where tyres are obviously under-inflated, if the brake fluid has been contaminated and whether brake pads or discs are missing. Gareth Llewellyn, chief executive of the DVSA, said: ""DVSA's priority is to help you keep your vehicle safe to drive. ""You can start to look forward to cleaner, safer vehicles, with greater clarity on any defects identified by the tester. ""A properly maintained vehicle should have no problem passing the new MOT."" But motoring groups have expressed concern that many drivers are confused or unaware of the new test. Breakdown cover provider Green Flag found 58% of 1,023 drivers surveyed did not know the changes came into effect on Sunday. Nick Reid, head of automotive technology at Green Flag, said: ""The majority of drivers are going to get caught out and potentially face fines. ""We are urging drivers to read up on the new rules and ensure that they book MOTs in early."" Vehicles must undergo the test on the third anniversary of their registration and every 12 months if they are over three years old. Vehicles will not need an MOT if they are over 40 years old and have not been ""substantially changed"". Drivers can be fined up to £1,000 for driving a vehicle without a valid MOT."

A post-mortem examination will be carried out. London mayor Sadiq Khan said his ""thoughts are with the victim's family"".

Relatives and friends of those who died will have the opportunity to paint a picture of their loved ones in a video recording or personal testimony in front of the retired judge chairing the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick. Each one will be streamed live from the hearing which is taking place at the Millennium Gloucester hotel in South Kensington, London. There will be specialist counselling available during the hearings, a prayer room for those observing Ramadan and NHS staff on hand to ensure those grieving have the support they need. Nabil Choucair lost six members of his family in the west London tower block fire. His mother, Sirria, was 60 years old and lived on the 22 floor of the tower. On the same level lived his sister, Nadia, brother in law, Bassem, and their three daughters, Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11 and Zainab, three. He has decided to make a video tribute to them with the help of a dedicated production company. He said: ""I would always see my mother first. She couldn't wait to empty her fridge and offer you food, even if you had already eaten. She wanted to make sure her son wasn't missing anything. ""Then I would go and see my sister and Bassem and they would also offer me food! They were such an amazing family. So kind and generous. Even to this day I'm getting people come up to me and talk about them."" He added: ""Mierna was the eldest of the girls and would guide the others. She was very bright and you could see her talent developing. Fatima was the sporty one and had a skill which was so strong for her age. ""Zainab was a special child. She was becoming so strong and wouldn't take no for an answer. She loved nursery rhymes and they were so beautiful when they came out of her mouth."" Nabil lives in east London with his wife and three children. He has spent almost every day since the fire travelling to Kensington to meet lawyers, councillors or campaign groups. He is exhausted and his grief is so raw. But he says he is determined to get justice for his family and make sure their memory lives on. He said: ""Time has gone so quick but it's barely moved from our end. It's as if it happened today. They were were such a caring family, and loved everyone around them. I only have memories of them now, nothing more than memories and video footage."" There has been no time limit put on the individual tributes; some are expected to last a few minutes and others up to an hour. The inquiry is believed to have the largest number of core participants to date, with more than 500 survivors, bereaved families and friends, and members of the North Kensington community participating. After the commemoration hearings, the public inquiry will move location to the Holborn Bars in central London and the main evidential sessions will begin. This will focus on the outbreak of the fire on 14 June last year and the sequence of events on the night. There will be a pause in the inquiry on the week of the anniversary."

The row follows a number of bullying allegations against the speaker. Speaking to Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, digital minister Margot James said: ""Andrea is a good friend of mine, she does an excellent job as leader of the House [of Commons] and she is the absolute opposite of what he's alleged to have described her as, and it's completely unacceptable. ""I'm not going to give my view on the speaker in other respects but, in terms of that, completely unacceptable."" Mr Bercow has not denied he used the words attributed to him or that the target was Mrs Leadsom. However, he rejected other allegations that he bullied two former private secretaries. An investigation into those claims has been blocked by senior MPs. Ms James stopped short of calling for the speaker's resignation but said there was a ""pattern of accusations"" against Mr Bercow. She said: ""Individual instances don't necessarily mean someone should lose their job. ""II think we're in danger of being a bit hysterical about this. ""There is a pattern of accusations and allegations and the Commons' committee on standards have investigated to a certain extent, I believe - I'm not close to the situation - and they have found things shouldn't reach a head. ""There are colleagues who disagree with that, we'll have to see what happens."" Culture Secretary Matt Hancock also described Mr Bercow's reported comments to Mrs Leadsom as ""completely unacceptable"", although he did not call for the speaker's resignation. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Part of making politics a better way of doing things is about having more respect; more respect between men and women and more respect between people of different backgrounds."" Mr Hancock added: ""I haven't seen confirmation that that's what he said but, what I think, is that that sort of language is completely unacceptable in our political debate."" Mrs Leadsom's cabinet colleague confirmed he would not accept such language in his department, adding: ""I don't think anybody in my team would talk like that because they're all very professional people."" ""I think he's been an excellent speaker"" says Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald about speaker John Bercow amid bullying allegations #Ridge pic.twitter.com/puHze8S4x1 However, Mr Bercow did win support from Labour shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald. ""He's a good speaker in that he does protect the interests of parliament against the executive and he's not frightened of standing up to the executive when they misbehave. ""He's absolutely excellent at standing up for parliament when the executive wants to ride roughshod over MPs. ""I think John Bercow has been an excellent speaker and I hope he carries on for a little bit longer."" Downing Street has previously said the row should be investigated if an official complaint is made, but Mrs Leadsom is not believed to be planning this. When he was a candidate for the speakership, Mr Bercow promised to serve for no more than nine years, as he did not consider the post to be a ""job for life"". But, although that means he should step down before July this year, Mr Bercow has recently indicated he now wishes to serve beyond that date. Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has been touted as a possible replacement."
2018-05-21,A train operator has apologised for disruption after the largest timetable shake-up for decades was introduced across Britain.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180521062517/https://news.sky.com/story/railway-timetable-changes-more-than-four-million-trains-across-britain-rescheduled-11379832,"More than four million trains have been rescheduled - and day one has not passed without hiccups. Some passengers were left frustrated and confused by cancelled services. Great Northern, which runs trains northeast out of London to places including Cambridge and Peterborough, said on its Twitter feed: ""A reduced Great Northern service is expected until the end of the day. ""A short-term amended timetable is in place across the Great Northern network. This is resulting in a reduced service operating with trains being cancelled or revised. ""Disruption is expected until the end of the day."" Passengers complained to the firm on social media saying they had been told services had been cancelled due to an ""operational incident"". The UK's busiest franchise - Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which consists of Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express - will see changes for every service and the addition of 400 trains every day. The new GTR timetable has been designed to extend stop times at busier stations and increase turnaround times at destination stations. A GTR spokesman said: ""We are introducing the biggest change to rail timetables in a generation and, as we have been informing passengers, we expect some disruption to services in the initial stages. ""This is a significant logistical challenge as we make rolling incremental changes across more than 3,000 daily services. ""We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused during the initial stages of the timetable change. ""The improvements we are making will lead to a significant boost in capacity with a 13 per cent increase in services across the GTR network immediately."" The introduction of new trains and services follows billions of pounds of investment and the number of alterations is seven times larger than normal. The changes are designed to increase overall frequencies and reliability. However, there has been criticism as some passengers will find their regular journeys are no longer possible. It is expected there will be some disruption as trains and crews are redeployed over the coming weeks. Many of the timetable changes are a result of the £7bn invested in the Thameslink programme in the South East. This includes the rebuilding London Bridge Station, new trains and improvements to tracks. Commuter belt areas such as Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Kent, East Sussex and Surrey, where many pay several thousands of pounds for annual season tickets to London, will be affected. Emily Ketchin, founder of campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters, said the operator was ""slashing key Harpenden services by a third"". GTR said it carried out the biggest consultation of its kind and received 28,000 responses to its plans. The operator said it would be able to carry an extra 50,000 passengers travelling to London in the morning peak each day. There will also be 80 more stations that will have direct services to the centre of the capital. GTR chief executive Charles Horton said: ""We are introducing the biggest ever change to rail timetables to significantly boost capacity on the UK's most congested network."" The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union described the new timetable as a ""disgusting insult"" to disabled passengers. It said the latest instruction from GTR tells staff not to attempt to place people of reduced mobility on a train if there is a possibility of delaying the service. A GTR spokesman said ""we place a priority on making our services accessible to all"" but he said it cannot hold trains when people arrive at a station without enough time to board. A shortage of diesel rolling stock and delays to electrification work between Manchester and Bolton will mean many of Northern's planned improvements have been deferred. TransPennine Express (TPE) will now be the sole operator between Manchester and Huddersfield off-peak which will add extra capacity but trains will only stop at every other station to save time. Some passengers from Levenshulme and Heaton Chapel see trains go from four trains an hour into Manchester cut to three off-peak, with a gap between services of up to 49 minutes. Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Having plenty of staff on the ground from the start and during the initial transition, when changes bed down, will be critical."""

Sky News employed a lip-reading expert to capture a few of the moments that could not be heard as millions watched around the world. :: Famous faces celebrate Harry and Meghan's big day On arriving at the church, Tom Parker Bowles revealed more than he would probably like anyone to hear when he told a blonde woman he was walking beside: ""I'm not hungover today so that's really good."" Singer Joss Stone was obviously thinking about how she would cope after the long day and night ahead when she said to a female companion: ""I can sleep on the way home."" Harry's nervousness came through during his conversations with his brother Prince William as they made their way to the church. While Harry and William were walking, Harry said: ""This is as far as we can go."" :: Everything you need to know about Meghan's dress Then there was his concern over where Meghan was at this stage. Realising he was now minutes from the biggest day of his life, he said to William: ""Is she here?"" The Duke of Cambridge: ""No, not yet."" There was clear emotional gratitude towards Prince Charles from Harry as they exchanged glances in the church and Harry said: ""Thanks, Pa."" Once the ceremony was over and the couple were finally together in the carriage, Meghan put her hand to her chest and said to Harry: ""So much fun."" :: First picture of cake and wedding breakfast menu revealed On a day of huge excitement, a body language expert said Meghan ""was the strength"" of her wedding ceremony as she appeared to be constantly reassuring Harry. Although the experience was completely new for Meghan, who became the Duchess of Sussex, she displayed no signs of anxiety or nervousness. That was in contrast to her new husband, the Duke of Sussex, whose body language suggested he ""was so patently nervous"". Body language expert Judi James said Harry performed about 12 self-touching body checks, including pulling at his gloves and wringing his hands, just before getting out his car after arriving at St George's Chapel in Windsor. :: The bishop who dazzled the congregation Meghan, however, maintained complete calm throughout the ceremony to ""help Harry through it"". Ms James said: ""Meghan was amazing. Walking up the aisle by herself, I looked for every smallest sign of suppressed anxiety and nervousness - there was absolutely nothing. ""I think she probably saw it as her role to help Harry through it rather than the other way round. She sat with her hand over his for quite a bit of the service as though she was reassuring him. ""To me, she was the strength when it came to the day and the actual performance."" :: Meghan's father - ""My baby looks beautiful"" Ms James said Meghan's hand was ""like a ballet dancer's"" during the exchanging of their vows, as it was incredibly steady. She said the Duchess's gaze was also a sign of her confidence in leading the day. ""For me, today was something we don't usually get at royal weddings, which is the eye gazing between the couple because she gave Harry a 100% eye gaze. ""When he went to take his vows, the undistilled awe and love for her is what we normally see at royal weddings in very tiny glances - but we got the full force of it with this one, which is what made it unique and very touching."" After entering the chapel with his brother Prince William there were several signs that Harry was becoming increasingly nervous as he began touching his face, blinking more and licking his lips. :: The lowdown on the royal wedding after-party Ms James said: ""It was quite unusual and sweet to see him in that mode because normally at royal events he is the joker in the pack and making everybody else laugh."" ""But this one had knocked him sideways a little, probably more than he was expecting,"" she added. The rest of the Royal Family, especially through the colourful sermon delivered by American minister Michael Curry, were calm. :: Royal couple's young entourage steal the show She said: ""It clearly would have been a first for most the royals, who weren't expecting it. ""Camilla went from smiling and laughing in the right places to thumbing through the programme like she did at the Commonwealth Games. I don't think she was quite sure how to take it. ""Even Harry did a slight finger tap, which could be a suppressed sign of impatience. He and Meghan kept catching one another's eyes through it."" :: Whole world (and its dog) celebrates royal wedding Chelsy Davy, Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend was noticeable by her body language, Ms James said. ""She was the spectre at the banquet. ""When she arrived, everyone else was chatting and laughing, but she sat in the pews just looking to one side - gazing reflectively into space and biting her lips slightly.

However, there was no maid of honour as Meghan did not want to choose just one person out of her close group of friends. Ms Waight Keller said it was confirmed to her in early January that she was the chosen designer. ""It was an extraordinary moment when she told me,"" she said. ""Of course it's an incredible thing to be part of such a historic moment."" She said the process was collaborative, but that Meghan had a ""vision"" for the dress. Ms Waight Keller added: ""I wanted her to feel absolutely incredible in the dress and also I wanted her to feel it was absolutely right for the occasion."" The designer said: ""She's just so genuine and warm and radiant. She's just glowing. ""She's a strong woman. She knows what she wants, and it was really an absolute joy working with her."" Asked about the moment Meghan was able to look at herself dressed and ready in the mirror on Saturday, Ms Waight Keller said: ""She was just glowing. There's so much emotion on a day like that anyway. ""But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think it is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant."" :: Relive the magic!

2018-05-21,"Nicola Sturgeon has vowed to ""restart a debate"" about Scottish independence over the next couple of weeks.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180521062517/https://news.sky.com/story/nicola-sturgeon-vows-to-restart-scottish-independence-debate-11379583,"Scotland's first minister is planning to ""consider"" the timing of a second independence referendum once the UK government has agreed a Brexit deal with the EU later this year. Ahead of the launch this week of a new blueprint for Scottish independence - which will reportedly recommend the creation of a Scottish currency - Ms Sturgeon spoke of ""an important moment"" in the SNP's case for breaking away from the rest of the UK. The SNP leader told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""Once we get some clarity, which hopefully we will in the autumn of this year, about the Brexit outcome and the future relationship between the UK and the EU then I will consider again this question of the timing of an independence referendum. ""I'm not going to say more about that in advance of that moment arising. ""But of course over the next couple of weeks we will, I suppose, restart a debate about why independence for Scotland is an opportunity and what those opportunities are. ""As you know we've had a growth commission looking at the economic opportunities of independence. ""Its report will be published in the coming days and I think that's quite an important moment, because if you think about the last couple of years in the UK it has been very much a debate about how we cope with the damage of Brexit. ""What I think Scotland now has the opportunity to do is look at how we seize the opportunities that lie ahead, so a debate based very much on ambition and hope not a debate that's based on despair, which is how the Brexit debate so often feels."" Chaired by former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson and set up in 2016 following the Brexit vote, the party's growth commission has been looking at how the Scottish economy would work in the event of an independence vote. According to The Scotsman newspaper, the 400-page document will also detail new visa requirements to attract wealthy investors to Scotland and recommend simplifying tax laws, as well as the gradual move to a separate currency. A row over whether Scotland could keep pound sterling after independence dominated debate ahead of the 2014 ""No"" vote. In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, Ms Sturgeon insisted a second Scottish independence vote was ""on the table"" but later shelved her plans after accepting there was no widespread support in Scotland for another referendum. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has warned against believing the ""threat"" of an independent Scotland had disappeared. Writing in the Financial Times, the Remain-supporting Tory said: ""We cannot be complacent. ""As long as our future relationship with the EU is in flux, it would be foolish to assume that the current trends on Scotland remaining in the UK will hold and that the threat of separation has gone away. ""The SNP is in power north of the border and will use that clout to drive a wedge between Scotland and the rest of the country. ""So we unionists must work hard to bolster our case for the union."""

Speaking in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Mrs May will say: ""Late diagnosis of otherwise treatable illnesses is one of the biggest causes of avoidable deaths. ""And the development of smart technologies to analyse great quantities of data quickly and with a higher degree of accuracy than is possible by human beings opens up a whole new field of medical research and gives us a new weapon in our armoury in the fight against disease. ""Achieving this mission will not only save thousands of lives. It will incubate a whole new industry around AI-in-healthcare, creating high-skilled science jobs across the country, drawing on existing centres of excellence in places like Edinburgh, Oxford and Leeds - and helping to grow new ones."" All of the data and technological advances needed to help cut cancer deaths are available but a system has not yet been set up to bring everything together. Medical records, along with information about patients' habits and genetics, will be cross-referenced with national data to spot those at an early stage of cancer. Mrs May will also announce another target to ensure that five more years of people's lives will be healthy, independent and active by 2035. Around £1.4bn has already been invested in research and development for the ""grand challenges"" programme the targets are being set under. Sir Harpal Kumar, chief executive officer of Cancer Research, said: ""The government's mission to revolutionise healthcare using the power of artificial intelligence is pioneering. Advances in detection technologies depend on the intelligent use of data and have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives every year. ""We need to ensure we have the right infrastructure, embedded in our health system, to make this possible."""

They were searching for a missing woman who may have been abducted after being forced into a car in Co Wicklow. Jastine Valdez, 24, from Enniskerry in the county but originally from the Philippines and studying in Ireland, was last seen when she left her home on Saturday afternoon. A Garda statement said: ""Gardai investigating the disappearance of Jastine Valdez interacted with the driver of a vehicle at approximately 8pm this evening, 20 May 2018, in the Cherrywood area of Dublin.

Irish broadcaster RTE said the dead man was armed with a knife and was a father-of-two from the Wicklow area. A Garda statement said Ms Valdez normally regularly contacted her family using social media. ""Contact has stopped so we are very, extremely concerned for her safety. If anybody can help us to locate her we would very much appreciate it."" Gardai told RTE she was on her way home to Enniskerry when the suspected abduction happened.

2018-05-21,Gareth Southgate has been bold and sensible at the same time in naming his 23 men to carry the nation's hopes at this summer's World Cup.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180521062517/https://news.sky.com/story/why-englands-young-world-cup-team-is-the-right-choice-11375178,"The manager himself believes ""this is a squad which we can be excited about"". The excitement might be a couple of fireworks short of a party at this stage, but that is not Southgate's fault. There is no standout 'will he won't he' story along the lines of David Beckham and Wayne Rooney's metatarsals (2002 and 2006 respectively). But England do have potential stars. Just about every club in the world would sign Tottenham goalscorer Harry Kane if he were available and affordable. And pacy attackers like Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling and Jesse Lingard would worry any defence. However, if 52 years of hurt since England's one and only World Cup win have finally dampened the levels of expectation, well hallelujah. It may even help. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, among others, have explained how the suffocating pressures of representing England adversely affected performance. That ought to be less of a problem for this inexperienced squad, who the bookies rate about 16-1 seventh favourites (which feels about right). Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is in, despite the voices suggesting that it is too much too soon for a 19-year-old in his first full season of top level football. The right choice. If he is good enough to help Liverpool to the Champions League Final, then he is old enough for England. Resisting the calls for Fulham's 17-year-old Ryan Sessegnon also makes sense. His time will come, but this did feel a step too far for a boy who has not yet tasted Premier League football. The goalkeepers? Leaving out Joe Hart, with his 75 caps, when the three preferred to him have only nine between them? Bold but correct. On form, Hart did not deserve to go - and picking on form rather than experience is exactly what pundits have longed called for (and which is a bone of contention for England cricket and rugby selectors also). The one choice which does feel slightly odd is that of Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana among the five standby players. A favourite of Southgate's, he would surely have been in the 23, had he not been injured for most of the season. But surely he is now either fit enough (put him in the 23) or he is not (leave him out altogether)? But that is a minor quibble. It would be hard at this stage to be confident of predicting Southgate's starting 11 for the opening match against Tunisia on 18 June. That is no problem in itself. The same has often applied to Germany, which has never done them any harm. And it certainly applied to England in 1966, which also turned out just fine. No one is suggesting that Southgate is on course to emulate Sir Alf Ramsey. But he has proved that like Sir Alf, he is forward thinking, happy to place trust in youth and unafraid to make bold choices."

It called for ministers to show ""stronger political leadership"" and impose further sanctions on ""Kremlin-connected individuals"". The committee said assets stored and laundered in the capital were being used to support Mr Putin's campaign to ""subvert the international-rules based order"" and undermine the West in the process. It said fighting it should be made a ""major UK foreign policy priority"". ""Despite the strong rhetoric, President Putin and his allies have been able to continue 'business as usual' by hiding and laundering their corrupt assets in London,"" the committee said in the report. ""These assets, on which the Kremlin can call at any time, both directly and indirectly support President Putin's campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually-reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy. ""This has clear implications for our national security. Turning a blind eye to London's role in hiding the proceeds of Kremlin-connected corruption risks signalling that the UK is not serious about confronting the full spectrum of President Putin's offensive measures."" The MPs said when they had pressed Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on what needed to be done to stop corrupt money flowing into the UK, he appeared to suggest ""there was no real role for the government in this process"". The committee called on ministers to work with allies in the US and EU to identify and put sanctions of individuals and entities, which Moscow is using to carry out ""acts of aggression"" - including assassinations and disinformation campaigns. ""Gaps"" in the sanctions regime which allowed the Russian government and those linked to Mr Putin to continue making money in London were also highlighted. Russia was able to raise £3bn in eurobond issuances just two days after the UK announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in response to the Salisbury attack.

""There is no excuse for the UK to turn a blind eye as President Putin's kleptocrats and human rights abusers use money laundered through London to corrupt our friends, weaken our alliances, and erode faith in our institutions,"" said committee chairman Tom Tugendhat. ""The UK must be clear that the corruption stemming from the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets and we will act."""
2018-05-21,Terror attack survivors have urged the public to do more to tackle terrorism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180521062517/https://news.sky.com/story/open-letter-calls-for-public-to-do-more-against-terrorism-11379977,"In an open letter, released ahead of the Manchester bombing anniversary this Tuesday, a group of survivors calls for society to join forces to find a ""solution to terror"". The letter, published in The Observer, encourages the public to play an active role in the fight against terrorism and encourages social media companies to take action against individuals who promote hate speech. The Survivors Against Terror signatories included those caught up in the Manchester arena attack and victims of terrorism carried out in London, Paris, Tunisia, Bali and at Brussels airport and metro. Brendan Cox, wife of Jo Cox, the MP who was murdered in 2016, helped co-ordinate the letter. Bethany Haines, daughter of the British aid worker David Haines, who was killed by the Islamic State group, also signed. In the letter, the group asks people to donate to appeals helping victims of attacks. They also demand the government provides high-quality services that survivors need. ""Please keep your focus on honouring the memory of those who have been killed,"" the letter says. ""Terrorists often attack partly to gain notoriety. We should deny them it; their names don't deserve to be remembered."" Social media networks were urged to ""do more"" to shut down inflammatory and hate accounts. Ms Haines said: ""We would welcome any move from these social media platforms to come forward and contact Survivors Against Terror so that we can talk about our concerns and work with them in ways to combat the extremism and the hatred that is sometimes on their platforms."" Monday marks one year since the terror attack at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester where 22 people were killed. The annual Manchester run attracted thousands to the city on Sunday. Freya Lewis, injured in the bombing, sounded the starting horn and also took part in the event. She told Sky News: ""It's been a very difficult year, but as each month passes I feel like I'm moving further away from what happened."""

Paramedics carried out advanced life support but were unable to save the teenager who had suffered a stab wound to the chest. A 21-year-old man from Erdington, Birmingham, is the second suspect to be arrested after he was held by officers on Saturday night. A 17-year-old man from Lozells, Birmingham, was charged on Sunday after handing himself in on Friday. He will appear before magistrates on Monday. West Midlands Police believe another two people were involved in the killing. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money for his funeral and to support his family. The page had raised £1,392 of its £10,000 target by Sunday. A statement on the fundraising page reads: ""We are raising money for our beloved Ozell who tragically lost his life on 17 May 2018. ""Our aim is to fund the funeral and any further support his immediate family may need in the next few months after this devastatingly senseless crime.

2018-05-21,"Ireland is at a crossroads. On 25 May, the Irish people will decide whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment and end a constitutional ban on abortion.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180521062517/https://news.sky.com/story/long-read-a-nation-divided-irelands-abortion-dilemma-11380210,"It will bring to a head one of the most bitterly contested battlegrounds in Irish culture over recent decades. There have been six referendums on the matter of abortion in the past 35 years, but this week's vote will prove the most seminal yet: it will decide whether to allow unrestricted abortion in Ireland up to 12 weeks. For the No side, the rights of the unborn are sacrosanct and must be protected. For the Yes side, Irish women must be treated with compassion and afforded abortion care at home. :: Sky Views - Ireland's abortion vote has reopened old wounds For both sides, the vote is a test about how secular and liberal Ireland is prepared to be. It is more than just a battle over abortion rights - it's a battle over Ireland's identity and values too. As the campaign intensifies, both sides are travelling across the country in an effort to win over a large swathe of undecided voters. A poll out last week put the repeal side 12 points ahead, with 44% of voters now in favour of changing abortion laws and 32% against, according to the latest Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI opinion poll. But 17% of the population are undecided and the No side believes it is in striking distance of delivering a big upset. :: Ireland abortion referendum: 'Unborn babies are human beings':: Why Ireland's abortion laws punish women ""I do think we're going to win,"" says Tim Jackson, a Save the Eight campaigner at the end of a long day on the road, canvassing in rural towns Carlow, Kilkenny and Castlecomer. ""The Yes side are falling in the polls all the time and the No side has all the momentum."" In the repeal stronghold of Dublin campaigners are nervous too. On a canvass in south Dublin, one volunteer told me she's worried: ""I think we will win but I think it will be very tight. It's such an emotive issue people don't want to express their feelings. A lot of people don't want to be known as a No voter."" On the doorsteps and in the streets, both sides are emphasising what they think is their strongest card in the hope of winning over undecided voters. Those in the Save the Eighth team are playing on fears that liberalising the law will lead to a spike in abortion and the death of tens of thousands of unborn children. Posters hammering those messages adorn the lamp posts around Dublin and other towns. ""In England one in five babies are aborted. Don't bring this to Ireland."" There are also pictures of giant foetuses with the caption: ""A licence to kill? Vote No to abortion on demand."" Those in favour of repeal speak of the need to offer women more compassion and care. They highlight the tragic cases of abortion - where a woman is pregnant with a baby that has a fatal foetal abnormality or has been raped - to press home why it is time to overhaul Ireland's draconian abortion laws. Amy and Conor Callaghan are one of those cases. The couple, who have a little boy called Finn, were forced to travel to Liverpool to terminate their unborn baby daughter Nico after the 12-week scan revealed that she had a fatal condition called anencephaly, which had left their baby without the top of her head. ""It's not something we wanted to have tell people but it's something we felt we had to tell people at this point in time,"" explains Conor on the couple's decision to go public with their very personal story of grief and loss. ""It was nearly a year ago now but a few weeks ago with the campaign kicking off we walked out the door one day and found a poster in front of our house with a picture of a foetus on it and 'a license to kill' written on it and we felt that was very cruel. :: 'I had to put my baby's remains in the freezer' ""I understand this a matter for public debate. But I think it's difficult for the other side to see the pain that this campaign is causing for people who have been affected by the Eighth Amendment in a very real way."" ""For me it's everyday thinking we should have a five-month-old now,"" added Amy. ""I don't feel guilty, because I think we made the right decision but I feel maybe there's a sense of judgement there from other people."" To understand Ireland's abortion laws you have to go back to 1983 when the country voted to insert a pro-life amendment into its constitution. Activist Ailbhe Smyth remembers the 1983 vote well. She campaigned vociferously to stop a pro-life amendment being inserted into the Irish constitution - and lost. ""It was really divisive and at times felt really brutal,"" she recalled of the 1983 referendum campaign. ""I got horrible things; posters stuck on my car, calls in the middle of the night. People reciting the rosary down the phone. ""The establishment, an elite group of right wing doctors and lawyers, decided it wasn't enough to prevent abortion becoming more of a reality in Ireland and they decided to lobby government to ensure they would have an amendment put into the constitution to copper fasten the proclamation against abortion."" Thirty-five years on, and the Catholic hierarchy is watching the campaign with studied detachment. This time around, pro-life campaigners are framing their arguments around human rights rather than religious teaching. ""For me, abortion is nothing to do with faith to be honest with you,"" says pro-life campaigner and radio host Wendy Grace. ""I don't think you need to be of any particular faith to say it's wrong to end another human being's life."" Vicky Wall, who discovered her unborn child had the rare genetic disorder Edward's syndrome at 23 weeks, believes passionately that abortion should remain illegal in Ireland. :: Opinion: Mum told to 'pop to England' says 'abortion was not an option' Her daughter Líadán died in the womb at 32 weeks. She is adamant that abortion was never an option for her and believes that the Eighth Amendment protected her rights as a mother to continue her pregnancy. A leading voice in the Save the Eighth campaign, she is unwilling to give other women in a similar situation to her a choice to terminate their pregnancies in Ireland. ""We have to look at what the choice entails,"" she said. ""We are looking a choice to end a unique human life and I don't think that choice is a reasonable choice. ""I don't think a human life should be simply be down to being unwanted or not and yes it's much so difficult for women in those positions but again I talk about support and that but the bottom line is I am extremely pro-life."" :: Narrow support for abortion ahead of Irish referendum The Catholic Church's influence has been in decline in recent decades, yet it still has some influence over voters in a country where 87% of the population identifies as being Catholic. A recent Sky poll found that 47% of 977 respondents backed unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks, with 37% opposing such a change. But faith made a big difference in those responses. When it came to Catholics, 45% were in support and 40% opposed, while those with no religion were strongly in favour of liberalising abortion laws, with 69% in favour of the 12-week rule. Out on the road and in Sunday mass, the church is making its presence felt, with Carlow's local priest Father Ruairí O'Domhnaill - flanked by two nuns - turning up to greet the Save the Eighth campaign bus. ""I'm concerned,"" Father Ruairí explained when I asked him how he was feeling about the vote. ""I think everyone is concerned if the Eighth Amendment is removed because the path will be to give abortion for everyone up to 12 weeks so that means healthy women and healthy children and I just don't think Irish people are ready for that or prepared for that."" I asked him if voting to repeal the Eighth Amendment made you a bad Catholic. ""I would say to anyone who considers themselves Catholic who are considering voting yes that they need to seriously ask themselves what they believe. ""The heart of our Christian faith is that God took flesh in the womb of the Virgin Mary and that he took on the human condition. That he was a living human being in the womb of Mary and it's fairly hard for anyone who would say that if they believed that to then say they didn't believe that he didn't have a right to be born."" No voters' language on the street is laden with faith too. One women on the street in Kilkenny said abortion was ""murder"" and ""against the ten commandments"". Another said abortion was ""against the law of God and nature"". ""I am angry with people when they say 'our bodies are our own'. Of course they are but God brought us into the world and God will take us out of it."" But back in Dublin, there is a more counter-narrative of solidarity amongst women too as those affected by abortion able to speak out and swap their stories. Campaigner Tara Flynn concedes that her decision to end an unwanted pregnancy when she was 37 years old - she's now 49 - is the ""sort of everyday"" experience that may not attract much sympathy, but said she was determined to end the stigma and the shame that engulfs this debate. Ms Flynn said that speaking publicly of her own abortion at a music festival in 2016 had prompted many women to speak out too. ""That's when I realised the warmth out there for people who have already travelled - for people that have travelled with them. People are keeping secrets in this country and have been for a long time."" This referendum has prompted a painful national conversation and an outpouring of personal grief that has divided families, friends and communities. In its journey to become a more secular state, Ireland has voted for divorce and gay marriage - but when it comes to abortion, views are deep-rooted and keenly felt, with both sides deeply invested in their cause. And with the result uncertain, one thing feels very clear: a lasting peace in Ireland's long-fought battle over abortion feels a very long way off."

The site confirms that Meghan will undertake royal duties in support of the Queen both in the UK and overseas. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have left Windsor after their wedding was watched by millions around the world on Saturday. It was not confirmed where they were heading on Sunday evening, but their official residence is Nottingham Cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace in London. Best man William and his wife Kate were pictured leaving Windsor wearing dark glasses on Sunday afternoon following a reception at which the happy couple were said by The Sun to have danced to Whitney Houston's I Wanna Dance With Somebody. Another report suggested Idris Elba was DJing. The destination of the honeymoon has not yet been confirmed but it is expected to be Namibia or Botswana in southern Africa. That will have to wait until after Tuesday, when the couple are attending a Buckingham Palace reception with Charles and Camilla to mark the Prince of Wales's 70th birthday. Meghan has already said she is determined to ""hit the ground running"" as she becomes a full-time royal. Meghan's famous speech to a United Nations conference in 2015, in which she announced she was ""proud to be a woman and a feminist"", features prominently on her page on the Royal Family website. A short biography explains that the Duchess of Sussex ""had a keen awareness of social issues and actively participated in charitable work"" from a young age. It also touches on how an 11-year-old Meghan successfully campaigned for a sexist washing-up liquid advert to be changed. The Duchess of Sussex also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Los Angeles between the ages of 13 and 17. The only nod to Meghan's former acting career comes when it is explained that she volunteered at another soup kitchen ""while filming in Toronto"" between 2012 and 2013. Meghan went on to become the UN Women's Advocate for Women's Political Participation and Leadership in 2015. The biography then details her work with World Vision, revealing that she completed a learning mission with the charity in 2017 to ""bring a greater awareness to girls' lack of access to education"".

2018-05-28,Will Young has been banned from driving for six months after a man had to jump clear of his car which then crashed into a parked vehicle.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180528233028/https://news.sky.com/story/singer-will-young-banned-from-driving-after-crashing-into-car-11388400,"The Evergreen singer was driving at 40mph on the A68 towards Edinburgh when he ""mistook bollards for a central reservation"" and hit a car that was parked in a lay-by, Jedburgh Sheriff Court heard. Young, who was returning from a friend's farm, was driving in ""fairly poor conditions"" about a mile south of Earlston, Scotland, with it being dark and snowy at the time. Graham Fraser, prosecuting, said the owner of the parked Nissan Qashai was walking across the lay-by and had to ""jump clear to avoid being struck"". Young, who didn't realise his mistake until he had nearly hit the man, had to brake to avoid running him over and subsequently lost control of his Mercedes G-Class. He ""wrote off"" the driver's Nissan after smashing into it, while his own 4x4 was damaged in the collision on January 21. The entertainer's lawyer said he ""clearly made a mistake"" by thinking that a row of bollards, which marked entry to the lay-by, were a central reservation. Young, who has released four number one albums, had been ""extremely apologetic"" for his ""momentary loss of control"", the court heard. The singer, 39, is said to have stayed with the man before calling the police. He pleaded guilty at Selkirk Sheriff Court in March to driving without due care, as well as driving at excessive speed in relation to the weather conditions and for entering a lay-by. Young was handed five penalty points and banned from driving for six months at his sentencing on Monday. The artist already had 11 points on his licence as well as a drink-driving conviction from 1998. A disqualification comes if 12 or more penalty points are built up within three years. Sheriff Edment said: ""I understand it's been a momentary lapse in concentration. ""To your credit you pled guilty from the outset. ""You took the man into your car - dealt with in in a very honourable and responsible manner."" Young, who won TV singing contest Pop Idol in 2002, was also fined £600."

The route goes through Pickering, over the North York Moors, which helped it earned the top spot. Coastliner chief executive Alex Hornby said: ""I'm absolutely delighted that our Coastliner service is now officially Britain's Most Scenic Bus Route - especially as the votes have come from the people whose views matter most of all to us, those who travel on our buses. ""We know from the many positive comments we receive from our customers that our Coastliner 840 is the perfect way to see the North York Moors and coast, without the hassle and stress of driving."" He said the new buses even feature WiFi and USB charge points. The 840 service runs four times a day and is entirely commercial. Second to the 840 was the 914/915/916 route which goes from Glasgow to Fort William and Skye via Loch Lomond, Rannoch, Glencoe and Great Glen. Coming third was a south coast route, the 50 Purbeck Breezer, going from Bournemouth to Swanage, via Sandbanks, Shell Bay and Studland. Poll creator Paul Kirby, a bus enthusiast, said: ""(The poll) shows that many people greatly appreciate their bus services and our glorious British countryside, particularly those on our rugged and varied coastline. ""The support of leading bus operators including Transdev has helped enormously in making this first ever survey of its kind such an outstanding success."" Mr Kirby presented the winner's certificate to Coastliner's General Manager Colin Booth at Whitby bus station, the eastern end of the 840 route.

It has been reported that Mr Abramovich would have to explain the source of his wealth to receive a new British visa. The UK government has declined to comment on the case. Mr Abramovich, who is Jewish, flew to Tel Aviv on Monday and obtained documents confirming his status as an Israeli citizen, the Israeli news site Ynet reported. A spokesman for Mr Abramovich declined to comment on the claims. The country's interior ministry has confirmed Mr Abramovich has gained citizenship there, The Times of Israel reports, adding that he is now the country's richest man. An official at Nativ, a government department that deals with Jewish communities in the former Soviet Union, said Mr Abramovich had applied for an immigration visa at Israel's embassy in Moscow. They added: ""His documents were examined under the 'law of return' and he was indeed entitled to immigrant status in Israel, and as a result he was issued an immigration visa."" An Israeli passport will allow Mr Abramovich to enter Britain for up to six months, but he won't be able to work there without first receiving a work visa. Israel's law of return gives every Jew, or child or grandchild of a Jew, the right to Israeli citizenship. Relations between Moscow and London have been strained since the poisoning of former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March. Britain has blamed the attack on Russia but the Kremlin denies any involvement. The UK said this month it would review long-term visas of wealthy Russians after the poisoning. Mr Abramovich has been a regular visitor to Israel and Ynet said he had bought a property that was formerly a hotel. The building is based in an old Tel Aviv neighbourhood close to the Mediterranean shore. The Sunday Times Rich List put Mr Abramovich's wealth at £9.3bn. He has own Chelsea football club since 2003."

Returning from their romantic break in the Dominican Republic earlier this month, Thomas and Rebekah Entwistle pulled up at their home in Blackburn, Lancashire, to find the eyesore surrounding the front of the house. Music teacher Thomas, 27, said the couple had bought the house because of the views - but now all they can see out the front windows are wooden panels. ""This was our dream home and now it's turned into a nightmare - it feels like we are imprisoned in our own house by this fence,"" he said. ""We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us."" Mr Entwistle said it is ""like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home"" and that his wife is often in tears because of the oppressive barrier right outside their front door. The couple are worried that even if they tear it down, the fence could be put up again - or even extended round the back. Developer Persimmon said its development does not reach into any land which it does not own. It added: ""We understand planning enforcement action is being taken against the neighbouring landowner to address the fence, which has been erected illegally and in breach of planning regulations."""

The professional soldier, who doesn't even like the taste of Double Gloucester, tumbled down Cooper's Hill in Brockworth to get his hands on an 8lb wheel of the cheese. He broke the record held by fellow dairy-devil Stephen Gyde, who boasted 20 cheeses before retiring in 2009 to focus on being a father. Mr Anderson won the first and third of three races on Monday, with thousands of spectators turning out to watch the centuries-old tradition. It is unclear how many people took part in 2018's event, but the chase is said to attract at least 40 competitors a year. Heavy rain over the past few days meant the hill was extremely wet on Bank Holiday Monday. Mr Anderson, who only likes cheddar cheese, skipped the second race but won again in the third despite tearing his left calf muscle in the process. He said afterwards: ""The kid next to me was pulling my shirt all the way down. ""I've got nothing to prove now, I'm happy. ""There was a bit more pressure this year as there were a few more locals running and as we saw one of them was a bit dirty."" When asked about the secret to his success, he replied: ""Just run and try and stay on your feet."" Mr Anderson will not be competing next year because he will be on holiday. The chaser has put his body on the line on his long road to success, having suffered a broken ankle in 2005 and bruised kidneys in 2010. He has dedicated his victories to his wife's nephew Arthur Bace, who suffers from the rare genetic disorder Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia. Nathan Anstey, 30, travelled all the way from Melbourne in Australia to take part in the event wearing just a pair of ""budgie smugglers"". He said: ""Last year was the first time I did it and I knew I had to come back. It's a no-brainer. ""It's the most exhilarating thing you can do."" Explaining his risque costume, Mr Anstey said: ""It's an Australian thing, the budgie smugglers, and the crowd absolutely love it."" The women's race was won by Flo Early, 27, who picked up a Double Gloucester for the third time having won in 2008 and 2016. She managed to dislocate her shoulder in the process. Ms Early, from Stroud, Gloucestershire said: ""I think I'm still a little bit... surprised. ""The race was fine. I know I fell over quite a lot."" Rebel cheese rollers have been staging their own unofficial event after health and safety fears caused the official competition to be cancelled in 2010. Competitors chase wheels of cheese 200 yards (180 metres) down an uneven 1:2 gradient. Four cheeses weighing about 3kg each and three smaller ones, weighing about 1.5kg, are used. The unusual event has been celebrated for centuries and is thought to have its roots in a heathen festival to celebrate the return of spring."

He knew 29-year-old Ms Abbotts and was arrested outside the flat on Friday night. In tribute, her family said: ""Christina, our sweet loving daughter and best friend, educated at Cirencester and Oxford, will be sorely missed. This independent lady, a much travelled person was taken from us far too early. ""Her friends in London and parts of the UK will also be grieving. ""The light in our life is now extinguished. Love forever from our family."" The preliminary cause of death from the post-mortem examination is blunt force trauma to the head, a spokesman for Sussex Police said. Neighbours said police ""flooded"" the street on Friday, after a man came looking for his daughter. Deliveroo driver Aaron Harvey, 24, said: ""This man came over, saying he had been looking for his daughter and had I seen her. ""He said she had been house-sitting for a man in a flat here for four months. ""He said no-one had heard from her for about 10 hours and he was worried. ""He said it was her birthday and she had booked a hotel in London to celebrate with friends but never turned up."" Mr Harvey said he saw a different man, in a wheelchair, being pushed out of the flat. He said he was ""covered in blood"". He said: ""He was taken over to the ambulance to be treated. We have never seen him before so we don't think he lives here."" Naseem, of Amersham, was remanded in custody and is due to appear at Lewes Crown Court on Wednesday."

As well as being made a French citizen, the 22-year-old - who recently moved to the country in the hope of a new life - will be offered a place in the fire brigade, Mr Macron said on Monday. Mr Macron hailed the ""exceptional act"", telling Mr Gassama: ""You saved a child. Without you, no one knows what would have become of him. ""You need courage and the capability to do that."" He added Mr Gassama had become an ""example"" because millions have viewed the astonishing act after footage was uploaded to Facebook. The migrant admitted he was ""trembling"" after the rescue, but told the French president: ""When I started to climb, it gave me courage to keep climbing."" Mr Gassama also received a medal and certificate for bravery on his visit to the presidential residence. He scaled an apartment block in northern Paris on Saturday evening after seeing a four-year-old in danger. Avec M. GASSAMA qui a sauvé samedi la vie d’un enfant en escaladant 4 étages à mains nues.

On reaching the fourth floor, Mr Gassama puts one leg over the balcony before reaching out with his right arm and grabbing the child. Firefighters arrived at the scene to find the child had already been rescued. A spokesman said: ""Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child."" The child's mother was not in Paris at the time, while it is understood the father was not at home. He was later held for questioning by police for having left his child unattended and was due in court, it was reported. Mr Gassama has been living illegally in France and working in construction since September last year after making a perilous journey from his homeland via Libya and Italy. He previously told reporters he acted without thinking. ""I saw all these people shouting, and cars sounding their horns. I climbed up like that and, thank God, I saved the child,"" he said. ""I felt afraid when I saved the child... [when] we went into the living room, I started to shake, I could hardly stand up, I had to sit down."" Prior to his visit to the Elysee Palace, Mr Gassama had already been thanked by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo in a telephone call. ""He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago dreaming of building his life here,"" she said.

Here, Tiff shares her journey with Sky News:  I had just had my daughter Maisie in 2013 when I developed an awful cold and cough. It just wouldn't shift so I went to the doctor and had a blood test which showed ""something"" in my bloods. I was sent for a chest x-ray that day and then my doctor called me a little while later to tell me he thought I had blood cancer. Tom was at the club training and I called his PA to try to get into contact with him. I was in a state. Tom rang me straight back and rushed home - which is pretty much unheard of during training. A biopsy confirmed I had Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. I was 28. You never think you're going to get that news. Tom collapsed to the floor with shock. We didn't know what to do. But everyone was telling me that it's treatable and lots of people were saying it's the most curable one you can have. So I thought I'd have six months of treatment and that would be it. I had a donor's stem cell transplant, but I had to wait a while due to three or four donors failing, so I had to go onto another lot of treatment in Manchester. I had four years of treatment in total. I had my head shaved twice throughout treatment over the four years. I didn't see my daughter at one point for four weeks while I was in hospital. ""Unfortunately you're terminal and there is nothing else we can do."" In 2017, they gave me four weeks to a year to live. I had to tell my daughter. Me, Tom and Maisie were sat on my bed, having a giggle and I just had to tell her. I said mummy has been very poorly, and that mummy would be going to heaven. She started crying. It's the worst thing I have ever had to do and I don't wish it on anyone. I then started getting my affairs in order. I wrote down the cleaner's number, the neighbour's number, I gave people our house keys, I had guardians in place and I started looking for a full-time nanny to help Tom. I sold all my clothes, gave everything to charity shops, I had a massive clear out and threw lots of stuff away. I planned my funeral - I chose my picture, my music, told my family how I wanted to die. I felt guilty and a burden to everybody, I didn't want anyone to have anything to do. Tom is very close with his brother Ben, and Ben took the decision to miss the Lions tour when we found out I was terminal. I just felt awful, like I was jeopardising his career and like I was a burden on everybody. But of course nobody saw it that way, it was just me. Tom even banned me from using the word ""burden"". It probably took me about two and a half years after I was diagnosed to actually accept help from people. I did worry a lot about how my illness was affecting everybody else. But in July, I decided ""I'm not going anywhere"". I decided that I hadn't had a child for her to grow up without a mother. I want to bring her up, so I decided to try an alternative treatment. I had nothing to lose - if it gave me an extra week with her it was worth it. So I went to London twice a week to see these two ladies recommended to me by someone. I told Tom we needed to be open-minded. I went on a very, very strict diet plan of juices, no dairy, no red meat, no sugar, no tea or coffee - basically just fish and green juices. I was fasting from 7pm until noon the next day. I did that for three months and I felt amazing on it. Then the other lady treated me with an ENS cosmodic machine treatment which basically tells your brain to tell your body to produce the cells it's not producing. It's like a rollerball deodorant and it has three metal prongs and you just go up and down your back. My dad bought me the same machine and I started to do it. I also started taking THC cannabis oil after reading so much about it in the news. I just started to feel better and I even woke up on a few mornings feeling like ""I don't think I've got it anymore"". But obviously I was very cautious about thinking that way. In February this year, I came down with a cold and went into hospital because I didn't feel well. I had a scan and the consultant came in and told me it was clear. I was in remission. I was on my own - my mum, Tom and my daughter had gone out to get some food - so I called Tom and I told him to put me on loudspeaker. I shouted: ""It's gone!"" I rang my dad, he was very emotional, he dropped the phone I think. I told my brother and sister. It was just unbelievable. From being told you are going to die, to then finding out you're not, it's incredibly hard and it's such an adjustment. I had told my parents and Tom where I wanted to be, where I wanted to end my life, I'd written my will. I'd given my godchildren money, one of my friends had a tattoo to remember me. I had prepared to die. But Maisie kept me going. I wanted to see her start school. I wanted to see her birthday. I would set goals and I would achieve them and that pushed me through. I have so many people to thank as well as my family. The rugby fans, everybody at every club have sent messages; coaches, players, and Leicester Tigers have been absolutely amazing. I really can't thank them enough. Especially my husband, who did everything to help and support me through this long journey. :: You can listen to Tiff's story in the podcast Learning to Live Again."
2018-05-28,"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has launched a review into why male doctors are paid on average £10,000 per year more than their female counterparts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180528233028/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-launches-review-to-tackle-gender-pay-gap-in-medicine-11387844,"Male doctors receive an average £67,788 in basic pay, compared with £57,569 for female doctors - a difference of £10,219 or 15%. Women are paid 23% less than men despite the fact that the NHS employs far more women. This is because the number of highly paid male doctors is a much bigger proportion of the male NHS workforce than female doctors are of the female workforce. Mr Hunt has asked top doctor Professor Jane Dacre to lead the independent review to eliminate the gender pay gap in medicine. Mr Hunt said: ""The NHS holds a unique position in both British and global society as a shining beacon of equality among all, and so it is unacceptable that 70 years from its creation its own staff still face gender inequality. ""Even today, there remains a 15% gap between the pay of our male and female doctors - this has no place in a modern employer or the NHS and I'm determined to eliminate this gap. ""I'm delighted Jane Dacre - one of the most highly respected female medics in the NHS - has agreed to lead this important review and is perfectly placed to examine the barriers that stop our talented female doctors climbing to the top rung in the NHS career ladder."" The review will consider the obstacles that stop female doctors progressing their NHS career in the same way as their male counterparts and look at issues such as the impact of motherhood on careers and progression. Prof Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ""I am grateful for the Government's commitment to act on the recommendations of the review, not just for women doctors now, but for our future workforce. ""Over 50% of medical school entrants are women, and we owe it to them and their future commitment to the NHS to ensure they are treated fairly."" While the review will focus on the medical profession, it is expected to have wider implications for the rest of the NHS and key recommendations could be rolled out across all staff groups. It is expected to conclude at the end of the year, with recommendations published in due course."

One person was in a critical condition and 12 others were treated in hospital after the first night of event. A spokeswoman for the hospital said not all the admissions were ""necessarily drugs-related"". Georgia Jones' mother, Janine Milburn, posted a message on Facebook to stop others from ""ending up the same"". Ms Milburn wrote on Facebook: ""Georgia died yesterday due to complications after taking two pills at Mutiny. ""If nothing else I hope what has happened to her will deter you from taking anything ever. ""The pills had caused her temperature to rise so high it made her fit for 45 minutes."" Mr Cowan's father said he had held his son's hand in the hospital before he died, and that he was not alone. ""Young boy, comes to a concert, makes one wrong decision and has died,"" said Damian Cowan, 43. He described his son as ""brilliant, loved football, full of life, energetic, sarcastic, a brilliant dad"". Tommy has a son of his own who will be two this year. ""It's no good saying don't do drugs,"" said Mr Cowan. ""All I can say is take this on board, look what's happened..."" He said he had heard security at the festival this year was ""really bad and lax"" and called for far tougher checks on people entering the event. Mutiny Festival organisers warned at around 9.30pm on Saturday, after the pair were taken ill, that it was ""aware of a dangerous high-strength or bad batch substance on site"" and that no drugs should be taken. They also urged customers to ""responsibly dispose"" of any substances. Craig David and Sean Paul were due to headline on Sunday before the rest of the event was cancelled. The organisers said in a statement on Facebook: ""The safety of our amazing customers has always been paramount to us and so to keep everyone safe and in respect to those who have passed, we have taken the decision not to open today. ""As you can imagine, this decision was not taken lightly and was taken with the support of the local statutory authorities who we continue to work with. ""Enquiries are being made into the circumstances of what has happened, but we must reiterate our advice to all our customers to responsibly dispose of any substances."""

The organisers of a change.org petition have argued the Spaniard deliberately held the Egyptian winger's arm ""under his armpit, causing dislocation of his shoulder"". Hundreds of thousands of people had signed in support of the claims on Monday evening, with the petition calling on UEFA and FIFA to punish Ramos. It was a very tough night, but I'm a fighter. Despite the odds, I'm confident that I'll be in Russia to make you all proud. Your love and support will give me the strength I need. pic.twitter.com/HTfKF4S70e It comes as Egyptian lawyer Bassem Wahba launched a €1bn (£873m) lawsuit against Ramos, amid fears Salah may be unable to represent his national side in the 2018 World Cup. Mr Wahba said he had filed a complaint to FIFA claiming Ramos had inflicted ""physical and psychological harm"" upon Salah. He told the Egyptian television channel Sada El-Balad: ""Ramos intentionally injured Mo Salah and should be punished about his actions."" Mr Wahab continued: ""I've filed a lawsuit and a complaint to FIFA. El fútbol te enseña la cara más dulce a veces y la más amarga otras. Ante todo somos compañeros. Pronta recuperación, Salah. El futuro te espera.||Sometimes football shows you it's good side and other times the bad.

The Premier League's 2017/2018 top scorer has said he is ""confident"" he will be fit for the summer tournament in Russia despite injury fears. The 25-year-old left the field in tears before Real Madrid's 3-1 victory in Kiev on Saturday night. Liverpool had nine shots while he was on the pitch but none for the remaining of the half. Ramos, who was not given a yellow card for his controversial challenge, wished Salah an ""early recovery"" on Sunday. In a tweet translated from Spanish, he wrote: ""Football teaches you the sweetest face at times and the bitterest of others (sic). ""First of all we are partners. ""Early recovery, Salah. The future awaits you."" Those who created the petition to punish Ramos also criticised his performance in the rest of the match. Haven’t really slept until now... the scenes are still running through my head again and again... I'm infinitely sorry to my teammates, for you fans, and for all the staff. I know that I messed it up with the two mistakes and let you all down... pic.twitter.com/w9GixPiQDC They wrote: ""He kept acting that (sic) Liverpool players fouled him falsely, causing the referee to give Mane a yellow card he did not deserve. ""Sergio Ramos represents an awful example to future generations of football players. ""Instead of winning matches fairly, he uses tricks that defy the spirit of the game and fair play. ""UEFA and FIFA should take measures against Ramos and similar players, using the video recordings of matches to keep the spirit of the game."" Real Madrid secured their third Champions League title in a row with help from two goalkeeping blunders from Loris Karius. The Liverpool goalkeeper has since received death threats after his performance in the final, which the Reds lost 3-1."
2018-05-28,"The government is poised to sell a multibillion pound stake in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), resuming a huge privatisation programme that has been stalled for three years.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180528233028/https://news.sky.com/story/government-to-pursue-plan-for-multibillion-pound-rbs-stake-sale-11388204,"Sky News has learnt that City bankers and investors have been ‎primed to expect a disposal of part of taxpayers' 70.5% shareholders, potentially as soon as this week. Full details of a prospective deal were unclear on Monday, and bankers cautioned that it would be subject to considerations relating to wider stock market conditions and ministers' ability to demonstrate that the taxpayer was getting value for money. Those factors could cause any share sale to be delayed, they added. One City analyst suggested that a disposal could target proceeds of more than £3bn, equating to a roughly 10% stake in RBS. If such a transaction was to take place, it would reduce taxpayers' interest in the Edinburgh-based lender to roughly 60%, putting RBS within sight of the milestone of the Government finally relinquishing the majority ownership of the bank it has held since 2008. A fund manager at a major institutional investor said the City had been ""awash with speculation"" in recent days that an announcement from the Treasury was imminent. RBS is due to hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday, and it is unclear whether a sale would take place prior to that or shortly after it. Any sale would ‎require the approval of Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, and would follow advice from UK Government Investments‎ (UKGI) that it was an appropriate time to dispose of the shares. A decision to resume RBS's privatisation would in itself be unsurprising after it reached a long-awaited $4.9bn (£3.6bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) this month relating to the mis-selling of mortgage bonds before the financial crisis. UKGI has already described it as ""an entirely fair assumption"" that it would be able to sell a £3bn stake in RBS during this financial year - with projections for a further £12bn of disposals during the next four fiscal years. One headache for Mr Hammond will be that a share sale at this juncture would be at well below the 330p price at which his predecessor, George Osborne, offloaded a 5.4% stake in RBS in August 2015. Shares in the bank closed at 289.7p on Friday, giving RBS a market capitalisation of £34.8bn and making the taxpayer's stake worth just under £24.5bn. RBS was rescued from collapse with capital injections from the Treasury totalling £45.5bn at an average share price of 502p. A substantial sale, which would probably be assembled through an overnight book-building process, will benefit RBS by reducing the so-called 'Government overhang' which has been a factor in holding back a recovery in its share price. Mr Osborne was criticised for crystallising a £1.1bn loss for taxpayers with the previous share sale, leaving Mr Hammond exposed to similar attacks because of the even larger prospective losses that a deal will incur. However, the longevity of taxpayers' ownership of a majority stake in RBS - now just months short of a decade - will allow the Chancellor to emphasise the importance of restarting the bank's return to full private ownership. City analysts have long abandoned any notion that taxpayers would be able to recoup their £45.5bn bailout funds following the series of radical restructurings that RBS has undergone since 2008. Its global investment banking ambitions have been curtailed, dozens of businesses have been sold, and tens of thousands of jobs have been axed - initially under the leadership of Stephen Hester, and more recently of Ross McEwan. The recovery of RBS, which before the crisis was run by Fred Goodwin, has gained fresh momentum in recent months, culminating in its first annual profit for a decade and the lower-than-expected DoJ fine. That has paved the way for Mr McEwan to set out a dividend policy as soon as RBS's half-year results, with shareholders expected initially to receive a tokenistic payout before rising over time. Several investment banks and law firms have already been lined up to work on the reprivatisation of RBS, with Rothschild ‎holding a role as the Treasury's capital markets adviser on the process. Goldman Sachs is also on board as the Government's wider privatisation adviser, while Credit Suisse is also understood to have been asked to play a role in a deal. Other banks which worked on the last share sale, including Citi, Morgan Stanley and UBS, are likely to be in the frame this time around, according to bankers. They are expected to waive the usual fees for such a transaction, however, as they did in 2015. The resumption of RBS's privatisation will come just as Oliver Holbourn, who ran what has become the financial institutions arm of UKGI, joins the bank as its new strategy chief. An announcement about his appointment is expected soon after RBS's AGM as the Treasury seeks to avoid any conflict of interest row because of his former role influencing voting decisions on the bank's boardroom pay and governance. A Treasury spokesman said on Monday that it did not comment on market speculation, while RBS also declined to comment."

Officers were called to the bar and venue, on Truro Avenue in Brinnington, around 10.45pm after reports of several injuries. The car was later found abandoned in a middle lane of the M60, near to Redrock, with police suspecting the driver scaled a fence next to the motorway before running away. The clockwise stretch of the motorway between junction 25 and junction one was shut in the early hours of Monday. A man, believed to be in his 30s, was taken to hospital where he died. Police are continuing enquiries into the incident and their hunt for the driver. Forensic officers were seen working behind a police cordon at the club on Monday. Witness Sharon Mills, 44, told the Manchester Evening News she saw a fight outside the club before the collision. ""They came out of the club fighting and a man got into his car and ran over a few people,"" she added. ""A man was on the floor with ambulance staff working on him, it was horrible."" Local councillor Chris Murphy said: ""I am horrified this has happened. Brinnington is a decent place where the vast, vast majority of people are decent. ""But this gives it a bad name.

2018-05-28,"Susie Goodall, 28, is to become the youngest and the first female to take part in one of the world's toughest sailing events, which has only ever been completed once before.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180528233028/https://news.sky.com/story/susie-goodall-28-set-to-make-sailing-history-in-golden-globe-race-11388249,"The Golden Globe Race is a solo, non-stop, 30,000 mile journey around the world, via the five Great Capes. The race last took place in 1968 and Sir Robin Knox-Johnston was the only man to finish. The others either sank, retired and one man even killed himself. That man was Donald Crowhurst, who was portrayed by Colin Firth in the recent film, The Mercy. Crowhurst got into difficulty early on and reported fake coordinates, which led people to think he was making tremendous progress. But he soon became concerned that people would find out, that he would disgrace himself and his family and so he decided to take his own life. This time around, those taking part are limited to sailing similar yachts to those that were available in 1968. Modern technology, including satellite based navigation equipment and mobile phones, is banned. Any music has to be transferred onto cassette tapes, the idea being that the race travels back in time to the ""golden age"" of solo sailing. Susie Goodall started sailing with her family when she was just three years old. Since then she has taken part in expeditions in Iceland, Greenland and Svalbard and she now works as an instructor. She told Sky News: ""I figured if I could persuade my parents and brothers that this was a fantastic idea then I was well on my way to getting to the start line. I drip fed the information and eventually they were well onboard. ""The scariest thing is it is such a long time to be alone. And I haven't been alone for nine months before. ""There is no rule book so the biggest unknown is how I will react when I am in a really low place and want to go home. ""I like the celestial navigation side of it, that is fun. But it's the music. You have to take cassette tapes and I love music so I am going to miss that and audio books. I am going to put some of my modern music on cassette tapes. I will be an expert in sixties music by the time I get back."" The rules mean that the nineteen competitors have to sail yachts that are between 32ft and 36ft long and they have to have been designed before 1988, meaning they're strong and sturdy. This makes them very similar to Suhaili, which Sir Robin sailed back in 1968, when he became the first person to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the globe. His advice to Susie has been to take plenty of whisky on board. Her boat, Ariadne, is a yellow and red painted Rustler. She has spent many months living and working on the boat, in preparation for the adventure. On board, she's already got around two hundred tin cans of food that she's experimenting with for the journey. She has to carry enough food and fuel on board to last for nine months. Along the route Goodall will help research the impact that plastic is having on our oceans. She will collect samples using test tubes and a trawler net. She told Sky News: ""What it does is collect micro plastics in the water. I will do it at certain points once or twice a month. I'll come back with samples so that we can see the density of micro plastics around the world."" The Golden Globe race is without doubt an incredible feat. It starts on 1 July 2018 in Les Sables-d'Olonne in France. :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

The Al-Jazeera programme shows a Mumbai-based fixer claiming to have England players who agreed to score below a certain run total for the session in Chennai. Tom Harrison, ECB chief executive, said in a statement: “There is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever. ""The limited information we have been given has been discussed with all the England players. ""They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false and they have our full support.""

He added that the programme makers had not been given the ICC ""any evidence"" or unedited footage beforehand so that they could fully investigate. ""ECB has a regular dialogue with the ICC and its anti-corruption unit, fully supports its work and will continue to cooperate with their review,"" he said.

2018-05-28,At least 13 people have died in India after an outbreak of a rare disease that health officials warn could cause a global epidemic.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180528233028/https://news.sky.com/story/more-than-a-dozen-killed-by-outbreak-of-rare-nipah-virus-in-india-11387464,"Emergency measures have been imposed across the southwestern state of Kerala following the emergence of the nipah virus, which causes flu-like symptoms leading to an agonising brain-swelling condition known as encephalitis. Those afflicted by the disease, which has a mortality rate of 70% and has no vaccine, can also be sent in to a coma. Health experts have been flown over to help contain the virus, which is listed alongside ebola and zika as one of eight priority diseases the World Health Organisation believes could cause a global epidemic. Nipah has killed 260 people in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India since 1998, and has previously spread to Singapore. Pigs were the host on that occasion, but this time it has been spread by fruit bats, with a number of the winged animals found dead in a well at the home of a family which has lost four people to the disease. A nurse in Kozhikode district, the epicentre of the outbreak, is also among the victims. Local media reports that close to 200 patients in Kozhikode and Malappuram are receiving hospital treatment, with 26 under observation and three under intensive treatment. During previous outbreaks in India, first in 2001 and then in 2007, more than 50 people have died. On both occasions it was reported in the state of West Bengal, bordering Bangladesh, with the neighbouring country having borne the brunt of the disease in recent years. The union health ministry has said the latest outbreak should remain localised, although the government has urged people to take precautions and issued advise on preventative measures. People should not eat fruits that have fallen to the ground or appear to feature tooth or claw marks, and travel to the affected states should be avoided, the government has said. But panic has already set in, with tests having been ordered after several bats were found dead at a secondary school in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The examinations found the bats were not carrying nipah, but fear continues to run high across the country."

Jayne Senior was the social worker who in 2011 helped uncover industrial scale child sexual grooming in Rotherham by gangs of mostly Asian men. She says promises the government made to resource the police and provide care for victims have not been kept. Mrs Senior told Sky News: ""I think Rotherham has been forgotten. ""When I went to see David Cameron in 2015, I naively believed that this issue would be resourced. That the victims would be given an opportunity to not only come forward but also to receive support around therapy and counselling. ""But that hasn't happened."" A cross-party group of MPs has written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid calling for more action. Signed by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs from areas where there has been organised child abuse, the letter states: ""Cases of gang related child sexual exploitation, such as those in Rotherham, Telford and in Newcastle conform to a precise model of recruitment, manipulation and exploitation. ""Despite these commonalities, we are not aware of any research being undertaken to understand the drivers for this kind of crime. ""We believe the Government should commission research covering the specifics of gang grooming including the national networks in which this crime exists."" The MPs also want the Home Secretary to confirm that child grooming is still being treated as a national threat, as promised by David Cameron. The top two signatories are Sarah Champion Labour MP for Rotherham and Lucy Allen, Conservative MP for Telford. Ms Champion told Sky News: ""The government are failing on their promises, they've been telling me personally for over three years now that they're going to prevent this crime, that they're going to properly resource the police, that they're going to resource social services but that just hasn't translated into action."" Responding to the letter, a Home Office spokesperson said: ""This Government is working to tackle child sexual exploitation, declaring it a national threat and making significant investment to protect children, support victims, and bring perpetrators to justice. ""All victims and survivors of child sexual abuse should be confident that they will get the support that they need."" Mrs Senior clearly thinks this isn't happening. She said: ""I thought we'd have a blank piece of paper and we'd be able to look at education, policing, law and social services, but that's not happened. ""Here we are four years on still reliant on small charities to offer what I believe should be a mandatory service. This is not just a six month quick fix."" Sky News also spoke to ""Elizabeth"" who was groomed, trafficked and abused in Rotherham from the age of 14. She went to court, the perpetrators were convicted, but she says there's been little support for her and other victims. She told Sky News: ""We've organised car boot sales and sponsored walks to raise money so we can get counselling. I'm on an 18 month waiting list to get help.

2018-05-28,Liam Gallagher has said he wants to maintain a relationship with his estranged daughter Molly Moorish following a recent meeting.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180528233028/https://news.sky.com/story/liam-gallagher-wants-relationship-with-estranged-daughter-molly-moorish-11388187,"The former lead singer for rock band Oasis posted a picture of himself and his 21-year-old daughter on Instagram last week. It was the first time he had seen her in 19 years and reportedly only the second time that he had met her. Talking to the BBC's Jo Whiley backstage at a Rolling Stones concert in London, Gallagher said: ""It was amazing, and they all looked beautiful and it was cool."" ""Molly was there... first time... I met her before,"" he added. ""It was nice to have them all there... she's a top girl and she's all good. ""We're getting on good, it's early days and they're getting on great, the kids and that."" Asked if their meeting marked a new chapter for him as a father, he said: ""I hope so, I hope she doesn't get sick of me, you know what I mean."" Earlier this year, Gallagher said Ms Moorish was ""welcome in my world"" but that she had never tried to contact him. He told GQ: ""The girl's been looked after and clothed and fed and sent to lovely schools. I bought them a house and all that tack. I just think she's best off with her mum."" Molly Moorish, who works as a model, was born in 1998 after Gallagher had an affair with singer Lisa Moorish while still married to Patsy Kensit. Molly Moorish posted the same black and white picture on Instagram, which shows her smiling alongside her father and two half-brothers. Gallagher's sons, Lennon and Gene - who both have different mothers - appear on either side of the photo. Lennon is his son from his marriage to Patsy Kensit, while Gene was born two years later during his relationship with former All Saints singer Nicole Appleton. Gallagher also has a fourth child - a daughter named Gemma - from his relationship with US journalist Liza Ghorbani. In February, Gallagher told the Daily Mirror he had ""not met the one in New York either"", adding: ""But I wish them well. If they ever need anything, give us a shout."""
