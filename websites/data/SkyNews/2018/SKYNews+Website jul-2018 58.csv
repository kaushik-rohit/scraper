2018-07-01,"Cosmetic surgery ads shown during Love Island are facing a backlash, with the boss of NHS England saying they increase body image pressures on young women.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180702011544/https://news.sky.com/story/backlash-over-explicit-predatory-love-island-cosmetic-surgery-ads-11422664,"Discussing the need for the NHS to treat physical and mental health issues with the same gravity, Simon Stevens said: ""It's not just the NHS. ""If you look at the increasing pressures on young women around eating disorder services, we have to look at the whole environment children are being exposed to. ""Some of that is social media, but even if you take a show like Love Island, look at the adverts that are being shown alongside it. ""You've got explicit ads aiming at young women around breast cosmetic surgery. That is all playing into a set of pressures around body image."" Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, he went on: ""The time has come to think long and hard about whether we should be exposing young people to those kind of pressures."" There will be a version of Love Island on somewhere in the world every day between now and Christmas - even Paris Hilton's a fan. Psychologist Dr Becky Spelman has also hit out at the ads, telling The Mirror they ""destroy body confidence"". Calling the targeted adverts ""predatory and exploitative"", Dr Spelman said: ""Extreme surgeries never fix a person's insecurities. In the best case this is only a short-term solution, in the worst case it can lead to Â­irreversible damage."" During this week's episodes of Love Island, which is shown on ITV six nights a week with a highlights show on Saturday, ads have been aired by cosmetic surgery firm MYA. Established in 2007, the company, which has surgeries across the UK, offers procedures such as breast enlargement, tummy tucks and liposuction. MYA's website, which features a banner with tanned girls in swimwear standing in front of a swimming pool, gives the mission statement: ""We believe that when you love the way you look, you stand a bit taller, you speak a bit louder and the confident you emerges from within."" As well as TV ads, Mr Stevens also gave a stark warning to social media giants Twitter, Facebook and Instagram over their use of advertising, saying: ""They are beginning to recognise that they are in danger of being on the wrong side of history."" Sky News has contacted MYA for comment."
2018-07-01,At least 30 people have died after a bus crashed into a gorge in northern India.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180702011544/https://news.sky.com/story/at-least-44-dead-in-bus-crash-in-northern-india-11422467,"Police say a rescue operation is ongoing to reach other casualties and at least three other people are injured after the accident in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. Reports say about 45 passengers were on the bus which was travelling from Bhoan to Ramnagar. Deepesh Chandra Kala, a disaster management officer from Pauri Garhwal, said: """"Forty-four people have died in the accident. At least three others are injured. The rescue work is still ongoing."" Chief Minister of Uttarakhand state Trivendra Rawat said the bus skidded and fell into a 700-foot (213-metre) deep gorge. Mr Rawat said about 12 other people have been injured. Senior police official Sanjay Gunjiyal said rescue work is being hampered by bad weather, although 20 people had so far been pulled out of the wreckage. The cause of the crash is not known but Mr Gunjiyal said bad weather could have led the bus to skid off the road. He said: ""It is raining (in the area) since morning. Two days back there was a landslide in that area."" He added that residents were the first on the scene to help the victims. More than 110,000 people are killed every year on India's deadly roads. Most crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poorly maintained roads and aging vehicles.More follows..."
2018-07-01,Work is under way to root out the cause of a worrying decline in the global population of puffins.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180702011544/https://news.sky.com/story/research-project-bids-to-uncover-why-puffin-population-is-on-the-wane-11422427,"While the beloved birds are thriving in parts of the UK, including the remote Skomer Island off the coast of Pembrokeshire, elsewhere their numbers are on the wane. In Iceland, for example, there are 25% fewer puffins than there were in 2002. Conservationists are keen to find out why that is and research partly funded by Sky Ocean Rescue is hoping to get to the bottom of it. Tiny GPS tracking devices and state-of-the-art cameras are being put to use on Skomer, where the technology is being attached to a handful of the auks so that scientists can discover where they go in search of food, how they catch it, and what exactly they are feeding on. Managed by The Wildlife Trust Of South and West Wales, the study will also include analysis of puffin droppings to determine what their favourite fish is. Seabird scientist Annette Fayet told Sky News: ""Skomer is quite unusual because it's one of the few colonies where puffins are doing quite well. ""The numbers are even increasing and the breeding success is very high, so most puffins that try to have a chick actually are successful at raising it. ""We're not sure why they are doing so well compared to other colonies. The main thing we want to do is understand the feeding ecology of puffins because we don't know much about that at the moment."" Once the research has been carried out on Skomer, Ms Fayet will travel to Iceland and Norway. Both have far bigger populations of puffins than the UK, with 1.7m breeding pairs in Norway and up to 4m in Iceland, but both populations are significantly down. The Norway leg of the research project is what is being funded by Sky Ocean Rescue - and it could prove vital. Ms Fayet said: ""The numbers have crashed so much in Norway and my collaborators there have reported zero breeding success in the last few decades. This is probably the worst colony for puffin breeding success in the world. ""The Sky Ocean Rescue funding means a lot for me because it's really going to help make my research better. By adding an extra colony in the study, I will have a bigger picture of the problem."" Plastic pollution is not thought to be as great of a concern for puffins as it is for other marine life, but there are still worries about its potential impact. The birds were designated an endangered species in 2015 and researchers have encountered instances of them struggling to coexist with human waste. Birgitta Bueche, a warden on Skomer, told Sky News: ""We have to change, we really do, because all the calculations of the scientists show that our seabirds are in real trouble. ""We're expecting puffins to go extinct within the next hundred years if we can't stop the trend, so we really need to make a big change to keep our seabirds safe."" :: Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign encourages people to reduce their single-use plastics.

A 17-year-old girl who was also in the car is in a critical condition and another girl, also 17, sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Police were called after a collision between a Seat Leon car and an Uber Seat Alhambra people carrier at 2.41am on Saturday. The driver of the Alhambra, a 42-year-old man from Bradford, was taken to hospital with injuries that are serious but not life-threatening. Sergeant Fiona Hoodless said: ""This is a very tragic incident where four young men have lost their lives and three other people are in hospital with serious injuries. ""The families of those involved are devastated by what has happened and we are doing everything we can to support them at this very difficult time. ""We are carrying out extensive enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident and that investigation is still at a very early stage. ""Early indications are that the Leon was travelling at speed at the time of the collision. ""We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision itself or saw the circumstances leading up to it. ""We are also keen to speak to anyone who saw the silver Seat Leon being driven in the area at any point prior to the collision, particularly anyone with dashcam footage that could assist the investigation."" Anyone with information is asked contact West Yorkshire Police's major collision enquiry team via 101 quoting log number 266 of Saturday 30 June."
2018-07-01,A woman was pulled into crocodile-infested waters in northwest Australia by a shark which bit her finger as she tried to feed it.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180702011544/https://news.sky.com/story/shark-pulls-woman-into-crocodile-infested-waters-in-australia-11422571,"Melissa Brunning, 34, was on a yacht in the remote Kimberley region, some 1,553 miles north of Perth, when she tried to hand-feed up to four tawny nurse sharks swimming around her boat. But one shark, which measured 6.6ft (just over 2m), sucked at her right index finger ""like a Hoover"" and pulled her into the water in Dugong Bay. As well as the sharks, the bay is inhabited by saltwater crocodiles, which can grow up to 23ft (7m) long and weigh more than a ton. Ms Brunning said she feared she would lose her finger. ""I think the shark was in shock as much as I was... the only way I can describe it is this immense pressure and it felt like it was shredding it off the bone,"" she told The West Australian. ""I came up and I was like, 'I've lost my finger, my finger's gone'."" Mobile phone footage of the incident, which happened last month, shows Ms Brunning screaming as she is dragged into the water, before the boat's crew and friends pull her out. She sustained cuts, a fracture, a torn ligament and a bad infection, but miraculously did not lose the digit. She said: ""It's not the shark's fault at all, but it could have been a lot worse."" Ms Brunning said the incident had taught her to ""respect marine life, and look at it in awe, but just leave them alone"". She said she did not realise she should have left the piece of fish she was using to feed the sharks in front of her, rather than trying to hand-feed them. ""When you're in the water, they're top of the food chain, it's their domain,"" she said. ""We're not meant to be in the water, if we were we'd have gills."""

""My wife and Henry's older brothers and I are devastated of course. Henry was a joy."" Describing him as ""smart, funny, and mischievous"" he told of how Henry had learned sign language and found a way of moving around on his bottom after the tumour and surgery had left him with physical disabilities. He wrote: ""His drive to live and to love and to connect was profound. I am astonished by the love-in-action displayed by Henry's mom and his brothers.

Here she tells Sky News why she is so privileged to be trusted to help grieving parents. My role is not one many have heard of, although pregnancy loss is more common than anyone thinks. I work across many departments within the hospital and offer support to women and families who have a pregnancy loss or a baby die at any point during pregnancy and in the early weeks after birth. I am there to help, guide and support families at the hospital and at home. I also run support groups out in the community. I help in as many ways I can during a heart-breaking time in the hope that I can help make their journey a little smoother. I don't formally discharge any of the families I support; they can always get in touch with me when they need that extra help. Sky News highlights 70 major moments as the NHS prepares to celebrate its 70th birthday. Sometimes they call me at anniversaries and significant days in the calendar like mother's day and father's day. I'm often one of the first to hear of a new pregnancy. We call these babies ""rainbow babies"", because they come after the worst of storms. It's an anxious time for parents and they often need extra support during the pregnancy. It is a privilege to be trusted to be with these people in such moments, to guide them and help them to make every precious second with their baby count."

Addressing the rally, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the health service was being ""slowly privatised"" by the Conservative government and called on supporters to ""go to the ends of the earth and beyond"" to defend it. ""I want to live in a society where we have a health service worthy of the name paid for by all of us, for all of us. It's called socialism,"" he said. ""I want to see the same principles applied in education and in housing."" Looking back on the life of our health service.

Breast reductions, tonsil removals and operations to stop people snoring are listed among the 17 procedures that could no longer be offered by the NHS. Many demonstrators marching shared stories of how the NHS has impacted their own lives. Labour activist Valerie Bossman-Quarshie, who carried a 70th birthday card for the health service, said one of her babies was delivered at St Thomas' Hospital in London and she received counselling after losing twins. Sharon Jennings tweeted: ""My 95 yr mother-in-law saved up Â£14 in 1948 to pay for the birth of her son due on 24 June 1948. NHS started 5 Jul and he arrived 3 days later, 2 weeks late.

He was scheduled to play Benoit Paire in the first round of the tournament on Tuesday, and said he was pulling out ""with regret"". ""We did everything we could to try to be ready in time,"" he said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""I've made significant progress in practice and matches over the last 10 days but, after lengthy discussions with my team and with a heavy heart, we've decided that playing best-of-five-set matches might be a bit too soon in the recovery process.""

Murray had spoken confidently about his planned return to Wimbledon, and his withdrawal on the eve of the competition will come as a surprise to many fans. On Saturday, he said that unless he woke up and did not ""feel good"" he would play, saying he viewed his recovery ""very much day by day, just as a process"". His hip problems first surfaced at the Wimbledon tournament last summer, and he has since withdrawn from three consecutive grand slams - this being his fourth. In 2013 he became the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles tournament in 77 years, claiming the title again in 2016 as well as winning the 2012 US Open and two Olympic singles gold medals. Stepping out of the competition will mean Murray's ranking will plummet to outside the top 800. In his statement he said he will begin practising on hard courts from Monday, and hopes to return to play in the upcoming US season. ""Thanks for all the messages of support and I'm excited to finally be back playing after so long out,"" he said."

The men became stranded on Friday when an avalanche hit their tent 19,300ft above sea level. Their climbing companion, Christian Huber, from Austria, did not survive. The three-member expedition started in May and was being managed by Higher Ground Expeditions, a tour operating company in Hunza. Pakistan army spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor tweeted: ""Bruce Normand and Miller Timothy from UK successfully rescued alive while Christian Huber from Austria had succumbed to avalanche."" The British high commissioner to Pakistan, Thomas Drew, thanked the Pakistan army for the rescue operation. Mr Drew said: ""A remarkable and dangerous rescue. Our gratitude to the Pakistan army pilots who rescued two British climbers trapped by avalanche on Ultar Sar Peak near Hunza. ""Our thoughts with the Austrian fellow climber who did not survive the avalanche."" The rescue mission began on Saturday but pilots could not complete the mission because of appalling weather conditions. Ultar Sar has been described as a difficult and dangerous mountain to climb, with a significant risk of avalanches. Northern Pakistan is a favoured destination for climbers. It rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 24,000ft and has five of the world's 14 summits taller than 8,000 meters. It is situated between the western end of the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush mountains and the Karakoram range."

Ahead of the NHS marking its 70th anniversary on Thursday, Mr Hunt has admitted staff are under ""huge pressure"" and have ""never worked harder"". Figures show that more than 15% of NHS workers have suffered physical violence from patients or their families in the past year. There have been 354 prosecutions in cases involving attacks on ambulance staff - but that number is believed to be a fraction of the actual number of incidents. Mr Hunt said: ""Nobody should feel unsafe at work - abuse against healthcare workers goes against everything the NHS stands for. As the NHS approaches its 70th birthday, Sky News highlights 70 defining moments from its history. ""Whilst the buck must stop with abusers, we want to do everything we can to prevent physical and verbal abuse. Issuing paramedics with body cameras will help protect them and increase prosecutions."" As well as body-worn cameras, NHS staff will also be given quicker access to mental health support and physio treatment, in part to help reduce staff absence. Ruth May, executive director of nursing at NHS Improvement, said: ""The NHS' greatest asset is its people: front-line staff and managers who often work in highly stressful and challenging circumstances so that people get the safe and high quality care they deserve. ""In order to secure the future of the NHS and what it stands for, we must strive to be the very best employer. This means looking after our staff and supporting their health and well-being. ""This will also enable them to deliver the best care possible, both now and in future."" But not all paramedics have welcomed the introduction of the cameras. Debbie Wilkinson, who has been a paramedic in Leeds for 27 years, told Sky News: ""Yes, we are getting increasingly assaulted which is obviously not a good thing - but would body cameras solve that? ""It's the same for the case for stab vests. We do a very, very personal job and people get close and personal with us and if they see us in a stab vest or with a body camera I think it will put people off divulging things to us like they do normally.""

The account comes amid rising tensions over the future of trade after Brexit. Cabinet ministers are set to thrash out the details of a white paper in a Friday ""sleepover"" at Chequers, with instructions that they are unable to leave until a final agreement has been made. To allow more time to be spent on analysing each of the options, Theresa May has split an inner cabinet committee into two. But deep divisions over how to proceed have caused tensions among Conservatives that are threatening to boil over. Brexiteers oppose a customs partnership - which would see the UK collect tariffs on goods entering the UK on behalf of the EU - and advocate using technology to minimise the need for customs checks. The document, which was drawn up by civil servants after six weeks of meetings, summarised those discussions about a potential future customs partnership that had been preferred by Theresa May. Mr Gove complained that this downplayed his concerns ""to almost nothing"", however, and stunned those present by tearing up the document. The account, detailed in a column in The Sun, has not been disputed. The EU has dismissed both options for post-Brexit customs systems considered by the cabinet. Reports over another round of Tory infighting came as senior Conservative Sir Graham Brady warned the party must pull together over Brexit or risk opening the door of 10 Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn. In an article for The Observer, he said: ""The danger of disunity at the top of the party is not just that it makes the prime minister's job more difficult in negotiations with Brussels, and therefore puts at risk the good Brexit deal that is in reach, it also gives an impression of division to the country.

And it has viewing figures to match. Wednesday night's episode was the most-watched programme ever on ITV2, attracting three million viewers. This beat the show's launch at the start of the month which previously claimed ITV2's highest ever audience with an average of 2.9 million viewers. So why is it so successful? WOW! @LoveIsland @itv2 ð´âï¸â¤ï¸ pic.twitter.com/VY6J47BGyR BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling's quippy voiceover certainly helps to lubricate the on-screen action. Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University, before going on to present children's TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore. She apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis. And she's not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance on series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show. American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: ""@LoveIsland Jack & Dani are goals! ð #LoveIsland"". @LoveIsland Jack & Dani are goals! ð #LoveIsland There's even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give it a little star dust, with Danny Dyer's daughter Dani (yes, really) one of the favourites to win. The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it's not just the Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries. Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, it even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show, paving the way for this series' success. Thorpe Park is opening its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer. And more than one university student has even written their dissertation on the reality show. Adam's ""gaslighting"" of Rosie led to accusations of emotional abuse from domestic abuse charity Women's Aid. When Niall, a construction worker from Coventry, made an unexpected exit due to ""personal reasons"", concern was palpable across the country. Wait -what Niall has quit #LoveIsland?! Totally focused on Brexit votes obviously but do hope the shows Neville longbottom alrightâ¦.  Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right. The show even has its own underdog. Unlucky in love Alex, an A&E doctor from Wales, has won the hearts of the nation. When Megan - an ex-erotic dancer from Essex - chose former popstar Eyal (who has since been evicted) over the NHS medic there was outrage across the country. Dr Alex finding a girlfriend has become a talking point in tabloids and office kitchens across the UK. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: ""It's the first series I've ever watched, but I'm addicted. It's the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people's lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they're not real, but it doesn't matter. ""Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl's mates. ""It's on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day."" The world, it seems, cannot get enough. With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas. A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night's antics - presented by one half of last year's winning couple Kem Cetinay and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who once appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year. A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: ""It's a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to, the uncertainty, the lust, the love. ""Last year's show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that's why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you're always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn't work out for some of them."" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: ""It's really important that it's not a salacious show - that it isn't grubby."" Stavri also puts its success down to ""not being full of conflict"" and the fact ""it doesn't feel exploitative"". When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don't cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension. Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show ""aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love"". However, Cowles goes on: ""If people don't like it they don't have to watch. We're not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that's a distraction from real life."" Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island's launch night viewers were aged 16-34. Only Britain's Got Talent - shown on ITV's main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Like Britain's Got Talent, Love Island can boast critical acclaim within the industry as well as popularity with the public, thanks to its BAFTA win earlier this year. The TV celebrity from Newcastle took part in the second series of the dating show and was one half of its first same-sex couple. Arielle Free says that success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: ""I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It's such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible."" It's also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen. If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble. As Free puts it: ""Sometimes we act so differently when we meet someone we like and to see others be exactly the same gives you a reassurance or a lightbulb moment that it's a natural human reaction. It shines a spotlight on how weird and wonderful we all are when it comes to finding love."" One thing's for sure, with around 30 episodes still to go, there's plenty of time to fall in love with the show everyone's talking about this summer."

""The connection between our two countries has always been special,"" she said. ""What better way to cement that relationship than through a bridge?"" Ms Foster was speaking on the invitation of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland at an Orange Order parade on Saturday. The DUP included proposals for a bridge or tunnel spanning the 22-mile distance between Scotland and Northern Ireland in its 2015 manifesto. As the idea of a UK-France bridge is floated, we gather together some of the world's most spectacular structures for inspiration. The Scottish government suggested in March that it would be willing to initiate discussions about the feasibility of a bridge, which supporters say would improve business links and boost life in communities in both islands. The crossing between Northern Ireland and Scotland can be expensive and unreliable by boat, but some business leaders say money would be better spent improving transport infrastructure in Northern Ireland. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said it was ""keen to explore all potential opportunities for improving Scotland's transport links"" but that decisions, as with all proposed infrastructure development, would have to be ""founded on a robust business case"". An official estimate has not yet been made for the cost of a bridge, though it is believed one stretching from the Mull of Kintyre to County Antrim could cost tens of billions of pounds. Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians in Scotland had criticised Ms Foster for attending the Orange parade, arguing her time would be better spent in Northern Ireland, where there is no devolved government in place. The leader described herself as ""the last in a long line of unionist leaders coming along here"" and said: ""This is my culture actually, this is who I am."""

She died of her injuries in hospital. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, Essex - where seven-year-old Summer Grant was killed when a bouncy castle blew free from its moorings in 2016 - wants politicians to consider a temporary ban. He said on Twitter: ""After two horrific tragedies, government need to look at update of regulations and inspection regime and consider a temporary ban on bouncy castles in public areas until we can be sure that they are safe."" Mr Halfon has written to the speaker of the House of Commons requesting an urgent question on the matter on Monday. Sarah Allard, who was at the scene, said she heard a loud bang as the bouncy castle ""exploded"" and propelled a girl 20ft into the air. She said a lifeguard did CPR for around 15 minutes at the scene before paramedics arrived. Two inflatables had been set up and the beach was particularly busy, with weekend temperatures more than 21C. ""A lot of people hadn't known what had happened,"" Ms Allard said. ""It was desperately horrible and sad."" A windbreaker was placed around the girl as medics fought to save her, according to Sky News correspondent Joe Tidy who was at the scene this afternoon. The East of England Ambulance Service said it received more than a dozen calls about the incident. ""Several of our teams were dispatched, with the first on scene in four minutes,"" they said in a statement.

Mr Trump and Mr Khan have clashed repeatedly since the pair were elected around two years ago. :: Trump supporters demand arrest of Khan Their first public sabre rattling was after the London Bridge terror attack last summer. Mr Trump tweeted at the time: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'""

Asked about Mr Khan's continued criticism of the president, Mr Giuliani said: ""Many of the people who go to London are American citizens. Half of us at least - or more, this president is more popular than ever - support the president. Even more people support (the office of) 'the president'."" ""I think it's highly inappropriate and he is probably suffering from some of the criticisms that Trump has made of him, which are valid.

Mr Trump is expected to make his first visit to the UK as president in July. It will be be a low-key working trip, rather than a state visit. Mr Khan recently has said he would ""be more than happy to meet with President Trump"", despite what he has said about ""diversity, about those who follow my faith, [and] about London"", in order to show him London's spirit. Mr Trump was due to open the new US embassy in London in February, but cancelled the trip, saying the building was too expensive and tweeting that he was not a ""big fan"" of the decision to move its location.

In March, the UK and EU reached an agreement on the terms of the transition period, which is due to last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 until 31 December 2020. However, Mr Clark left the door open to extending that period. Speaking to Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show on a visit to the Port of Dover, Mr Clark said: ""At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. ""Speaking to the people that run this very successful port... in order to make sure that we can continue the success, and that we don't have frictions, there are things that would need to put in place. ""Computer systems, for example, posts at the border, even if they checked number plates. ""What we need to assess is how long it would reasonablly take to put in practice and then it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence."" Mr Clark, who backed Remain at the EU referendum, pointed to how Brexiteer cabinet minister Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, had also recently said he would be prepared to accept an extension to the transition period. However, Theresa May has come under pressure from other Brexiteers within her party, with more than 30 Tory MPs signing a letter calling on the prime minister to ""stand firm"" and ""demonstrate courage and leadership"" in the face of those seeking to reverse Brexit. The letter said that in order to ""uphold our promise to the British people, after our formal departure on the 29 March 2019, we will not accept an extension of the transition period beyond 31 December 2020"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show he believed the transition period would be extended, adding he would be happy with such a move. ""At the moment it's not set in stone, [the talk has been that it will be] around two years,"" he said. ""I've got a feeling it might go beyond that."" Mrs May had originally outlined plans for a two-year Brexit transition period after the UK formally leaves the bloc in 2019, but that was cut to 21 months to coincide with the last day of the current EU budget. The emergence of a fresh split in Conservative ranks over the issue of extending the transition period came as senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady made a plea for unity. Sir Graham, who chairs the party's influential 1922 Committee, warned continued infighting within the cabinet could put at risk the UK agreeing a good Brexit deal. Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary James Brokenshire insisted on the BBC he was ""confident"" ministers could reach an agreement on Friday, when Mrs May will gather her cabinet at her Chequers country retreat in order to thrash out their plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU. Sir Graham's plea came amid reports up to 20 Tory MPs are preparing to run for the Conservative leadership if Mrs May falls from power, with some said to be actively recruiting supporters. A survey of Conservative members on who should be the party's next leader, conducted by the ConservativeHome website, revealed new Home Secretary Sajid Javid had this month topped the standings for the first time. He displaced Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. Tory members have the final say in a leadership contest, once candidates are whittled down to a final two."
2018-07-01,"The NHS needs to recruit thousands of nurses and doctors to help improve outcomes in cancer care and mental health provision, NHS England's chief executive has told Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180702011544/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-staffing-crisis-could-damage-cancer-care-chief-executive-warns-11423284,"There are vacancies for up to 100,000 doctors and nurses across the NHS, undermining attempts to hit waiting time targets. The staff shortages raise questions about whether it is possible to deliver genuine improvements in outcomes as well as recover waiting times, even with a funding deal worth up to Â£20bn a year announced last month by the prime minister. The NHS has grown from a budget of less than Â£500m to Â£145bn in its 70 years. Sky News breaks down the numbers and some of the stories behind them. Simon Stevens said the NHS could deliver improvements in both access and outcomes, but that staffing was central to its prospects of success. The 3.4% annual increase comes after eight years of austerity funding that has left more than four million people waiting for operations and seen the worst ever A&E performance against modern targets. The prime minister has demanded that the NHS recover those targets, as well as delivering improvements in cancer outcomes, which are below the European average for some common cancers, and increasing mental health provision. Mr Stevens said it will be possible to address both access and quality of care, despite scepticism from hospital chiefs, economists and health think tanks. ""We want to make sure that as we put extra money in it is used wisely. ""But looking out at cancer care for the next decade, if we can focus particularly on early diagnosis, getting checked out soon, we are going to have an impact on cancer survival. The main events that have punctuated the NHS's development since it was founded in 1948.  ""We want to keep short waits for A&E care and planned surgery, but we want to make big improvements in cancer care and unaddressed areas such as in mental health services, and to do that we are going to need more staff. ""We have got five new medical schools coming on line but it takes 10 to 12 years to train a doctor, and we need to look after the ones we have, because we have a million and a half of the best people in the country."" :: Meet the midwife who comforts bereaved parents Mr Stevens also wants greater protection for existing staff, calling for automatic prosecutions and stiffer sentences for anyone who attacks NHS workers. Sky News examines the National Health Service on its 70th anniversary and asks whether it can cope with the demands of tomorrow. ""Too many of our paramedics, nurses, A&E doctors, say they are on the receiving end of assaults and violence from the people they are trying to look after,"" he said. ""I think it is time to say that if you beat up an ambulance crew you should expect to be prosecuted, and if there needs to be changes in the law to make that clearer to everybody, we should fully support them."" Mr Stevens insisted that despite continued debate about the sustainability of the NHS's funding model and the principle of universal access, the government's position means the fundamental contract between the health service and the citizens it serves would continue. ""The range of health services offered will continue to expand, the way we interact will change, but fundamentally the deal is that we as citizens and taxpayers of this country fund a service that will be available for us when we need it and that is going to endure,"" he said. The 70th anniversary of the foundation of the NHS on Thursday will be marked by services at Westminster Abbey and York Minster attended by staff, patients, members of the Royal Family and government.

However, this still falls short of the 3.7% increases the NHS has previously received. Sky News wants to hear your stories as the NHS turns 70 - get involved using #myNHSstory. In a wide-ranging interview with Sky News presenter Sophy Ridge, Mr Corbyn insisted that Labour would put ""far more money in straight away"" to deal with the NHS funding problems. ""Nothing she (Theresa May) has promised means any money this year... and it's only 0.1% above what the IFS (Institute for Fiscal Studies) says is necessary for the NHS to stand still. ""We said we would put in 5% more in the first year to deal with the immediate crisis, particularly in hospital waiting lists and social care. ""What Theresa May has promised doesn't actually make any difference whatsoever... now, this winter, this financial year. ""What she is promising over five years is 0.1% above the standstill budget.

As the NHS is poised to celebrate its 70th birthday, the Labour leader claimed Conservative cost-cutting is killing people. ""Austerity costs lives,"" he told Ridge. ""The health inequalities in Britain are massive. Take Scotland for example, the richest and best off and healthiest in Scotland live 26 years longer than the poorest of those in worse health. That cannot be acceptable."" Mr Corbyn paid tribute to the NHS as it turns 70 on Thursday. ""Seventieth birthday NHS - absolutely brilliant, and I think we should thank all those that founded it and the inspiration that came from working-class communities in South Wales and other places. ""Health is about mental health, social care, stress, and environmental and public health...

Here she tells Sky News why she is so privileged to be trusted to help grieving parents: My role is not one many have heard of, although pregnancy loss is more common than anyone thinks. I work across many departments within the hospital and offer support to women and families who have a pregnancy loss or a baby die at any point during pregnancy and in the early weeks after birth. I am there to help, guide and support families at the hospital and at home. I also run support groups out in the community. I help in as many ways I can during a heart-breaking time in the hope that I can help make their journey a little smoother. I don't formally discharge any of the families I support; they can always get in touch with me when they need that extra help. Sky News highlights 70 major moments as the NHS prepares to celebrate its 70th birthday. Sometimes they call me at anniversaries and significant days in the calendar like mother's day and father's day. I'm often one of the first to hear of a new pregnancy. We call these babies ""rainbow babies"", because they come after the worst of storms. It's an anxious time for parents and they often need extra support during the pregnancy. It is a privilege to be trusted to be with these people in such moments, to guide them and help them to make every precious second with their baby count."

Ahead of the NHS marking its 70th anniversary on Thursday, Mr Hunt has admitted staff are under ""huge pressure"" and have ""never worked harder"". Figures show that more than 15% of NHS workers have suffered physical violence from patients or their families in the past year. There have been 354 prosecutions in cases involving attacks on ambulance staff - but that number is believed to be a fraction of the actual number of incidents. Mr Hunt said: ""Nobody should feel unsafe at work - abuse against healthcare workers goes against everything the NHS stands for. As the NHS approaches its 70th birthday, Sky News highlights 70 defining moments from its history. ""Whilst the buck must stop with abusers, we want to do everything we can to prevent physical and verbal abuse. Issuing paramedics with body cameras will help protect them and increase prosecutions."" As well as body-worn cameras, NHS staff will also be given quicker access to mental health support and physio treatment, in part to help reduce staff absence. Ruth May, executive director of nursing at NHS Improvement, said: ""The NHS' greatest asset is its people: front-line staff and managers who often work in highly stressful and challenging circumstances so that people get the safe and high quality care they deserve. ""In order to secure the future of the NHS and what it stands for, we must strive to be the very best employer. This means looking after our staff and supporting their health and well-being. ""This will also enable them to deliver the best care possible, both now and in future."" But not all paramedics have welcomed the introduction of the cameras. Debbie Wilkinson, who has been a paramedic in Leeds for 27 years, told Sky News: ""Yes, we are getting increasingly assaulted which is obviously not a good thing - but would body cameras solve that? ""It's the same for the case for stab vests. We do a very, very personal job and people get close and personal with us and if they see us in a stab vest or with a body camera I think it will put people off divulging things to us like they do normally.""

Mr Trump and Mr Khan have clashed repeatedly since the pair were elected around two years ago. :: Trump supporters demand arrest of Khan Their first public sabre rattling was after the London Bridge terror attack last summer. Mr Trump tweeted at the time: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'""

Half of us at least - or more, this president is more popular than ever - support the president. Even more people support (the office of) 'the president'."" ""I think it's highly inappropriate and he is probably suffering from some of the criticisms that Trump has made of him, which are valid.

""Some of that is social media, but even if you take a show like Love Island, look at the adverts that are being shown alongside it. ""You've got explicit ads aiming at young women around breast cosmetic surgery. That is all playing into a set of pressures around body image.""

The staff shortages raise questions about whether it is possible to deliver genuine improvements in outcomes as well as recover waiting times, even with a funding deal worth up to Â£20bn a year announced last month by the prime minister. The NHS has grown from a budget of less than Â£500m to Â£145bn in its 70 years. Sky News breaks down the numbers and some of the stories behind them. Simon Stevens said the NHS could deliver improvements in both access and outcomes, but that staffing was central to its prospects of success. The 3.4% annual increase comes after eight years of austerity funding that has left more than four million people waiting for operations and seen the worst ever A&E performance against modern targets. The prime minister has demanded that the NHS recover those targets, as well as delivering improvements in cancer outcomes, which are below the European average for some common cancers, and increasing mental health provision. Mr Stevens said it will be possible to address both access and quality of care, despite scepticism from hospital chiefs, economists and health think tanks. ""We want to make sure that as we put extra money in it is used wisely. ""But looking out at cancer care for the next decade, if we can focus particularly on early diagnosis, getting checked out soon, we are going to have an impact on cancer survival. The main events that have punctuated the NHS's development since it was founded in 1948.  ""We want to keep short waits for A&E care and planned surgery, but we want to make big improvements in cancer care and unaddressed areas such as in mental health services, and to do that we are going to need more staff. ""We have got five new medical schools coming on line but it takes 10 to 12 years to train a doctor, and we need to look after the ones we have, because we have a million and a half of the best people in the country."" :: Meet the midwife who comforts bereaved parents Mr Stevens also wants greater protection for existing staff, calling for automatic prosecutions and stiffer sentences for anyone who attacks NHS workers. Sky News examines the National Health Service on its 70th anniversary and asks whether it can cope with the demands of tomorrow. ""Too many of our paramedics, nurses, A&E doctors, say they are on the receiving end of assaults and violence from the people they are trying to look after,"" he said. ""I think it is time to say that if you beat up an ambulance crew you should expect to be prosecuted, and if there needs to be changes in the law to make that clearer to everybody, we should fully support them."" Mr Stevens insisted that despite continued debate about the sustainability of the NHS's funding model and the principle of universal access, the government's position means the fundamental contract between the health service and the citizens it serves would continue. ""The range of health services offered will continue to expand, the way we interact will change, but fundamentally the deal is that we as citizens and taxpayers of this country fund a service that will be available for us when we need it and that is going to endure,"" he said. The 70th anniversary of the foundation of the NHS on Thursday will be marked by services at Westminster Abbey and York Minster attended by staff, patients, members of the Royal Family and government.

""We did everything we could to try to be ready in time,"" he said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""I've made significant progress in practice and matches over the last 10 days but, after lengthy discussions with my team and with a heavy heart, we've decided that playing best-of-five-set matches might be a bit too soon in the recovery process.""

On Saturday, he said that unless he woke up and did not ""feel good"" he would play, saying he viewed his recovery ""very much day by day, just as a process"". His hip problems first surfaced at the Wimbledon tournament last summer, and he has since withdrawn from three consecutive grand slams - this being his fourth. In 2013 he became the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles tournament in 77 years, claiming the title again in 2016 as well as winning the 2012 US Open and two Olympic singles gold medals. Stepping out of the competition will mean Murray's ranking will plummet to outside the top 800.

The men became stranded on Friday when an avalanche hit their tent 19,300ft above sea level. Their climbing companion, Christian Huber, from Austria, did not survive. The three-member expedition started in May and was being managed by Higher Ground Expeditions, a tour operating company in Hunza. Pakistan army spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor tweeted: ""Bruce Normand and Miller Timothy from UK successfully rescued alive while Christian Huber from Austria had succumbed to avalanche.""

""Our thoughts with the Austrian fellow climber who did not survive the avalanche."" The rescue mission began on Saturday but pilots could not complete the mission because of appalling weather conditions. Ultar Sar has been described as a difficult and dangerous mountain to climb, with a significant risk of avalanches. Northern Pakistan is a favoured destination for climbers.

In March, the UK and EU reached an agreement on the terms of the transition period, which is due to last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 until 31 December 2020. However, Mr Clark left the door open to extending that period. Speaking to Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show on a visit to the Port of Dover, Mr Clark said: ""At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. ""Speaking to the people that run this very successful port... in order to make sure that we can continue the success, and that we don't have frictions, there are things that would need to put in place. ""Computer systems, for example, posts at the border, even if they checked number plates. ""What we need to assess is how long it would reasonablly take to put in practice and then it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence."" Mr Clark, who backed Remain at the EU referendum, pointed to how Brexiteer cabinet minister Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, had also recently said he would be prepared to accept an extension to the transition period. However, Theresa May has come under pressure from other Brexiteers within her party, with more than 30 Tory MPs signing a letter calling on the prime minister to ""stand firm"" and ""demonstrate courage and leadership"" in the face of those seeking to reverse Brexit. The letter said that in order to ""uphold our promise to the British people, after our formal departure on the 29 March 2019, we will not accept an extension of the transition period beyond 31 December 2020"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show he believed the transition period would be extended, adding he would be happy with such a move. ""At the moment it's not set in stone, [the talk has been that it will be] around two years,"" he said. ""I've got a feeling it might go beyond that."" Mrs May had originally outlined plans for a two-year Brexit transition period after the UK formally leaves the bloc in 2019, but that was cut to 21 months to coincide with the last day of the current EU budget. The emergence of a fresh split in Conservative ranks over the issue of extending the transition period came as senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady made a plea for unity. Sir Graham, who chairs the party's influential 1922 Committee, warned continued infighting within the cabinet could put at risk the UK agreeing a good Brexit deal. Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary James Brokenshire insisted on the BBC he was ""confident"" ministers could reach an agreement on Friday, when Mrs May will gather her cabinet at her Chequers country retreat in order to thrash out their plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU. Sir Graham's plea came amid reports up to 20 Tory MPs are preparing to run for the Conservative leadership if Mrs May falls from power, with some said to be actively recruiting supporters. A survey of Conservative members on who should be the party's next leader, conducted by the ConservativeHome website, revealed new Home Secretary Sajid Javid had this month topped the standings for the first time.

Competition is fierce - with the ""big four"" chains, including Morrisons, battling to fend off the huge growth of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl at a time when the wider retail sector has been suffering the effects of higher costs and tighter shopping budgets. Tesco said: ""The alliance will cover the strategic relationship with global suppliers, the joint purchasing of own brand products and goods not for resale. It will be governed by a three-year operational framework. ""The alliance will enable both companies to improve the quality and choice of products available to their customers, at even lower prices thereby enhancing their competitiveness."" Fresh food products are not covered by the potential deal. The firms, no strangers to price backlashes from suppliers over the years, moved to distance themselves from any suggestion the alliance would leave them disadvantaged. The statement continued: ""This agreement will also allow both companies to strengthen their relationships with their suppliers and create significant opportunities for those suppliers. ""Each company will continue to work with supplier partners at a local and national level."" Tesco boss Dave Lewis said: ""I'm delighted to be entering into a strategic alliance with Carrefour. ""By working together and making the most of our collective product expertise and sourcing capability, we will be able to serve our customers even better, further improving choice, quality and value."" Carrefour shares rose 0.8% in early trading in Paris as investors gave their reaction while Tesco's were down 0.1% on the FTSE 100."

The 33-year-old is currently at the centre of an investigation following an adverse analytical finding for excessive levels of the asthma drug Salbutamol at last September's Vuelta a Espana. Froome, who denies the doping claims, says he has every right to defend his title and is confident of being cleared. World Anti-Doping Agency rules have allowed him to continue racing until the investigation is over. However, French media reports that the Tour de France owners Amaury Sport Organisation have written to Team Sky telling them that Froome should not take part in the race. The four-time Tour de France winner claims it will be proved he has ""done nothing wrong"" when ""all the information"" is available. Team Sky has responded, saying: ""We are confident that Chris will be riding the Tour as we know he has done nothing wrong."" The four-time winner of cycling's biggest race was criticised in June by five-time winner Bernard Hinault, who called on riders to go on strike should Froome compete."

Firmin once revealed that Bagpuss - ""an old, saggy cloth cat, who was lose at the seams"" - was meant to be marmalade-coloured, but due to a fur-dying error, became the pink cat we all know and love.

In 1999, Bagpuss was voted the most popular BBC children's programme ever made. In 2015, a new version of The Clangers, voiced by Monty Python actor Michael Palin, was produced by CBeebies, winning a BAFTA the same year. Highlighting the ""marvellous and diverse worlds"" which Firmin ""devised, created, painted, drew and built"", his spokesman said it was thanks to ""such magical and enduring appeal that they remain hugely popular to this day"".

2018-07-02,Love Island - the reality gameshow where contestants compete to find love - has charmed the nation.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180702091330/https://news.sky.com/story/whats-behind-our-love-affair-with-love-island-11421856,"The show boasts some impressive credentials: an idyllic location (Majorca); beautiful contestants (10 to kick off, plus weekly additions and evictions) and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week). And it has viewing figures to match. Wednesday night's episode was the most-watched programme ever on ITV2, attracting three million viewers. This beat the show's launch at the start of the month which previously claimed ITV2's highest ever audience with an average of 2.9 million viewers. So why is it so successful? WOW! @LoveIsland @itv2 ð´âï¸â¤ï¸ pic.twitter.com/VY6J47BGyR BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling's quippy voiceover certainly helps to lubricate the on-screen action. Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University, before going on to present children's TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore. She apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis. And she's not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance on series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show. American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: ""@LoveIsland Jack & Dani are goals! ð #LoveIsland"". @LoveIsland Jack & Dani are goals! ð #LoveIsland There's even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give it a little star dust, with Danny Dyer's daughter Dani (yes, really) one of the favourites to win. The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it's not just the Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries. Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, it even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show, paving the way for this series' success. Thorpe Park is opening its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer. And more than one university student has even written their dissertation on the reality show. Adam's ""gaslighting"" of Rosie led to accusations of emotional abuse from domestic abuse charity Women's Aid. When Niall, a construction worker from Coventry, made an unexpected exit due to ""personal reasons"", concern was palpable across the country. Wait -what Niall has quit #LoveIsland?! Totally focused on Brexit votes obviously but do hope the shows Neville longbottom alrightâ¦.  Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right. The show even has its own underdog. Unlucky in love Alex, an A&E doctor from Wales, has won the hearts of the nation. When Megan - an ex-erotic dancer from Essex - chose former popstar Eyal (who has since been evicted) over the NHS medic there was outrage across the country. Dr Alex finding a girlfriend has become a talking point in tabloids and office kitchens across the UK. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: ""It's the first series I've ever watched, but I'm addicted. It's the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people's lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they're not real, but it doesn't matter. ""Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl's mates. ""It's on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day."" The world, it seems, cannot get enough. With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas. A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night's antics - presented by one half of last year's winning couple Kem Cetinay and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who once appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year. A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: ""It's a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to, the uncertainty, the lust, the love. ""Last year's show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that's why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you're always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn't work out for some of them."" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: ""It's really important that it's not a salacious show - that it isn't grubby."" Stavri also puts its success down to ""not being full of conflict"" and the fact ""it doesn't feel exploitative"". When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don't cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension. Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show ""aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love"". However, Cowles goes on: ""If people don't like it they don't have to watch. We're not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that's a distraction from real life."" Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island's launch night viewers were aged 16-34. Only Britain's Got Talent - shown on ITV's main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Like Britain's Got Talent, Love Island can boast critical acclaim within the industry as well as popularity with the public, thanks to its BAFTA win earlier this year. The TV celebrity from Newcastle took part in the second series of the dating show and was one half of its first same-sex couple. Arielle Free says that success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: ""I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It's such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible."" It's also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen. If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble. As Free puts it: ""Sometimes we act so differently when we meet someone we like and to see others be exactly the same gives you a reassurance or a lightbulb moment that it's a natural human reaction. It shines a spotlight on how weird and wonderful we all are when it comes to finding love."" One thing's for sure, with around 30 episodes still to go, there's plenty of time to fall in love with the show everyone's talking about this summer."

She died of her injuries in hospital. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, Essex - where seven-year-old Summer Grant was killed when a bouncy castle blew free from its moorings in 2016 - wants politicians to consider a temporary ban. He said on Twitter: ""After two horrific tragedies, government need to look at update of regulations and inspection regime and consider a temporary ban on bouncy castles in public areas until we can be sure that they are safe."" Mr Halfon has written to the speaker of the House of Commons requesting an urgent question on the matter on Monday. Sarah Allard, who was at the scene, said she heard a loud bang as the bouncy castle ""exploded"" and propelled a girl 20ft into the air. She said a lifeguard did CPR for around 15 minutes at the scene before paramedics arrived. Two inflatables had been set up and the beach was particularly busy, with weekend temperatures more than 21C. ""A lot of people hadn't known what had happened,"" Ms Allard said. ""It was desperately horrible and sad."" A windbreaker was placed around the girl as medics fought to save her, according to Sky News correspondent Joe Tidy who was at the scene this afternoon. The East of England Ambulance Service said it received more than a dozen calls about the incident. ""Several of our teams were dispatched, with the first on scene in four minutes,"" they said in a statement. ""The young female was seriously injured and in cardiac arrest on our arrival, and was conveyed to James Paget Hospital. Sadly, despite all the of the efforts and interventions, she was pronounced deceased."" Witnesses say this windbreaker was put up around the little girl as medics tried to save her.

Retailers have struggled through the first six months of the year, with falling consumer confidence, soaring business rates and Brexit's effect on inflation. In June alone, more than 6,000 jobs were put at risk at House of Fraser and 5,100 threatened when Poundworld went into administration. Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed earlier in the year and hundreds of jobs have been axed from Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian. The Trades Union Congress said the government needed to ""up its game"". General secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Retail depends on customers having money in their pockets. One reason why some shops are struggling is because wage growth has been very weak. ""Government needs to up its game, boost the economy and invest in great jobs that people can live on."" Also, the average business rates bill for a department store in England and Wales this year were up 26.6% to Â£717,952 following last year's government revaluation, according to Altus Group. Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at Altus, said: ""Business rates are rarely the sole driver for insolvencies but certainly a contributory factor, with bills having risen by more than a fifth through inflation during the seven years before last year's revaluation. ""Add that to the lethal cocktail of other increased operating costs for the national living wage and apprenticeship levy and it creates the perfect storm for 2018 being the year of the CVA."" Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shop workers' union USDAW, said: ""We are very concerned about the impact of Brexit increasing prices at the same time as incomes being squeezed, customers changing their shopping habits and new technology being introduced."" Job losses have also hit other industries - BT is axing 13,000 jobs to cut costs, with two thirds of jobs going from the UK. Carillion collapsed, affecting more than 2,375 jobs, with more losses expected; and British Gas owner Centrica will cut 4,000 jobs over the next three years."

The boy was taken to hospital by helicopter after the incident in Islington, which saw two men and what appeared to be two teenagers fighting. A few minutes into the fight, witnesses said a third teenager ran in carrying the weapon. Resident Amina Taylor said she saw the stabbing from her flat. ""We could all see the knife in his hand. It was that big,"" she said. ""You could hear the screams of 'No, stop it, don't do anything, don't be stupid' and he went for (one of the adults) first but then he was kind of swinging wildly and then he just thrust the knife into the stomach of the teenager."" She said she was shocked to see ""somebody who is clearly barely taller than my nine-year-old son coming down with a weapon in his hand"". She described the ""big"" and ""cumbersome"" weapon as gleaming. Two boys, 14 and 15, have been arrested in the early hours of Monday on suspicion of attempted murder. An 11-year-old boy who was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has since been released and police say he is no longer a suspect. The Met Police said that officers ""retain an open mind as to motive"". They appealed for anyone who saw the stabbing to contact them. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""Incidents like this have a devastating impact on families and our communities and we need to send the message that they will not be tolerated.

But one shark, which measured 6.6ft (just over 2m), sucked at her right index finger ""like a Hoover"" and pulled her into the water in Dugong Bay. As well as the sharks, the bay is inhabited by saltwater crocodiles, which can grow up to 23ft (7m) long and weigh more than a ton. Ms Brunning said she feared she would lose her finger. ""I think the shark was in shock as much as I was... the only way I can describe it is this immense pressure and it felt like it was shredding it off the bone,"" she told The West Australian. ""I came up and I was like, 'I've lost my finger, my finger's gone'."" Mobile phone footage of the incident, which happened last month, shows Ms Brunning screaming as she is dragged into the water, before the boat's crew and friends pull her out. She sustained cuts, a fracture, a torn ligament and a bad infection, but miraculously did not lose the digit. She said: ""It's not the shark's fault at all, but it could have been a lot worse."" Ms Brunning said the incident had taught her to ""respect marine life, and look at it in awe, but just leave them alone"".

2018-07-02,Jacob Rees-Mogg is threatening Theresa May with a Brexit rebellion by Euro-sceptic Tory MPs that could bring down her government and force her from office.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180702091330/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-must-deliver-hard-brexit-or-face-revolt-says-rees-mogg-11423428,"In his most provocative challenge to the prime minister yet, the leader of Tory backbench Brexiteers says they will vote against her deal unless she delivers a hard Brexit. His ultimatum, in a hard-hitting article in The Daily Telegraph, comes at the start of a week in which the PM will attempt to reach a Brexit deal with her cabinet at a special meeting at Chequers. But in a chilling warning to the PM, Mr Rees-Mogg compares her plight to that of Sir Robert Peel, the Conservative prime minister forced to quit after his party revolted over the repeal of the corn laws in the 19th century. And he serves notice that he and Brexiteer Tory MPs are prepared to rebel against the PM in commons votes on trade and customs, the Brexit ""divorce bill"", migration, judicial powers and fishing. :: Business Secretary hints Brexit transition could be extended  He also bitterly attacks pro-Remain cabinet ministers such as Business Secretary Greg Clark, the Irish government over the border row and the ""metropolitan establishment"" he claims is opposed to Brexit. ""At Chequers, the prime minister must stick to her 'no deal is better than a bad deal' mantra, or risk splitting the Conservative Party like Sir Robert Peel,"" Mr Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, writes. ""The prime minister said, as soon as she took office, that 'Brexit means Brexit' and in the last election, in her personal contract with the British people, she declared that we would leave the single market and the customs union."" Threatening a backbench mutiny, he warns the PM: ""Any EU agreement that restricts the country's ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy, makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. ""The cabinet should agree that if there is to be a deal it has to be agreed in detail prior to our departure. ""There is no legal reason to pay Â£39bn to the EU on our departure and if there were no guarantee of a trade agreement it is something I would strongly oppose in any vote in the House of Commons. ""Likewise leaving the EU into the purgatory of a perpetual transition would be foolish."" It comes as the PM's chief Brexit official reportedly told ministers they have no chance of striking a bespoke trade deal with Brussels. Briefing Cabinet ministers ahead of the Chequers talks on Friday, Oliver Robbins is said to have painted a bleak picture of the situation, with a source telling The Times they came out of the meeting thinking ""we were even more screwed than we were before"". Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said there was ""no doubt that there is strong views on either side"" over Brexit in cabinet but insisted he was ""confident"" Mrs May's top team could reach an agreement at the meeting."
2018-07-03,Gay conversion therapies which try to 'cure' people's sexuality will be banned as part of the Government's LGBT Action Plan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/plans-to-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-11424512,"The plan is an attempt to tackle the inequalities faced by members of the LGBT community. It comes after a large Government survey assessed some of the difficulties facing LGBT people living in the UK. Over 108,000 people responded making it the biggest study of its kind in the world. It highlighted how 2% of those who replied had undergone conversion therapy with a further 5% having been offered it. The survey also found 68% of same sex couples said they didn't hold hands in public for fear of facing abuse. While 51% who had wanted mental healthcare services said they had to wait too long. Prime Minister Theresa May described the responses as ""overwhelming"" and ""shone a light on the many areas we can improve the lives of LGBT people"". ""No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love,"" she said. Penny Mordaunt, Women and Equalities minister, whose department was behind the action plan said: ""This Government has done much to promote a diverse, tolerant society and supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, but it is clear we have more to do. ""Our action plan is a step towards everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics being able to live safe, happy and healthy lives where they can be themselves without fear of discrimination. ""It will mark a culture change to allow LGBT people to feel respected at every level of society."" The Action Plan sets out 75 steps to help improve the lives of LGBT people. They include :: Measures to end controversial conversion therapies, by looking at legislative and non-legislative changes :: A new national LGBT health adviser role will be created to help improve access to healthcare services :: Extra work with the police to improve how hate crime incidents are responded to :: More support for teachers and pupils at schools and other education bodies :: A consultation on whether gender laws should be changed to make it easier for trans people to change their birth certificatesBut Labour feels the government could have gone further. Dawn Butler MP Labour's Shadow Women and Equalities Minister, said: ""Much of this plan is yet more reviews and consultations. After years of empty rhetoric and broken promises, we need to see concrete actions to show the Government is serious about tackling the inequalities faced by LGBT+ communities."" Labour says it would introduce a full legal ban on conversion therapy, and toughen the penalties for those guilty of hate crimes. Campaigners say the survey results show how action is needed.Stonewall's Director of Policy, Paul Twocock, told Sky News: ""One of the things we often hear is complacency, we achieved same sex marriage and so much legislative change people feel things are OK, but this survey shows it's not the case. We need to do a lot to achieve equality."" Paul Martin OBE, Chief Executive at LGBT Foundation said: ""LGBT people continue to face significant health inequalities and we welcome the government's commitment to tackling these through the appointment of an LGBT Health Adviser. ""We hope that today's plan is a clear statement of the Government's commitment to work in partnership with the LGBT charity sector to achieve a fair and equal society where all lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people can achieve their full potential."
2018-07-03,"The UK is set to swelter during a four-week heatwave, as people dust off their barbecues and lay down their picnic blankets for a long summer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-heatwave-vegetable-crops-and-insects-under-threat-during-long-british-summer-11424278,"But as forecasters warn of weeks of little rain following a dry June, we take a look at the impact the conditions will have on other areas of British life. Celebrity vet Marc Abraham told Sky News people really need to think about how the hot weather affects their pets. Fleas, ticks and flystrike, when flies lay eggs in an animal's fur, are big problems in the heat, so keep an eye out and check your pet every day. Water is essential - so always make sure your pet has enough. When it comes to dogs he said the biggest issues are leaving them in a car - even for a few minutes - adder bites, dehydration and walking on hot pavements. Dogs cannot sweat so they need lots of water to drink and Dr Abraham said it is a good idea to get them a paddling pool and a cooling coat - just make sure you re-drench it when it dries out. He added that walking on hot pavements is something people often don't think about. Dr Abraham added: ""I see people trotting along with trainers on and their dogs are in pain, they don't realise their pads are not that protective. ""So walk them on the grass or in the early morning or in the evening when the concrete is cool. ""Swimming is great but watch out for undercurrents and algae bloom, as you would for humans. ""Adders in the countryside are a problem, your dog will yelp and will normally have two puncture wounds on their nose - take them to the vet immediately and make sure you always have your vet's emergency number on your phone."" With cats, Dr Abraham said those with white ears and noses need to have suncream applied as the sun can cause cancer there within minutes. He warned that because they are outside for longer they become more territorial. For rabbits, they are prone to overheating so need to be kept in the shade with lots of bedding to burrow into. ""Flystrike is the biggest worry for rabbits,"" he said. ""They lay eggs in their bottom then maggots eat them from the inside so check under your rabbit's tail twice a day throughout summer."" With horses, flies are a big problem and if they are lacking hair cover or pigment they can get sunburnt easily. Smaller animals such as guinea pigs and hamsters are pretty good in the heat as they are from the tropics, but still need lots of water. Gloucestershire farmer Luke Wilson told Sky News that after his 250 sheep were sheared in June they have been ""relatively happy"", but a lack of grass is the biggest problem. He said: ""Sheep are probably one of the hardiest animals in hot weather, we just have to make sure they have enough water in the troughs. ""It's their food which is a concern, I only feed my sheep on grass and we're about to run out due to a lack of rain. ""The lambs have grown really well so far as we had some very good spring grass growth while it was warm and wet. ""The ewes came through the winter in pretty good condition so are producing good milk and the lambs are growing well. ""I fear the problems may occur when I wean them in a couple of weeks as there really isn't any grass any more so their growth will slow up a lot. ""But maybe in a couple of weeks we will get some rain."" Mr Wilson added that the lack of grass will also affect the milk yield of dairy cows as they are sensitive to whatever they eat. He added: ""Beef cattle actually really enjoy the dry weather but are running out of grass to feed them, which is a bit of pain, but they should be OK. ""You can't do much about it other than pray for rain."" Sweltering temperatures mean the demand for leafy vegetables has gone up, with more people thought to be opting for salads during the summer heat. But the British Leafy Salads Growers Association has said that the drier weather has created adverse conditions for growing some crops. The association added that a record of 18 million lettuces have been sold in the UK in the last seven days, but high temperatures have stopped the crop growing. UK retailers were said to be selling around 13 million heads of lettuce during its peak demand period in 2017. Dieter Lloyd, a spokesperson for the British Leafy Salad Growers, said: ""While it is great news that leafy salad sales are up around 40% across all retailers, that's just half the story. ""The record temperatures have stopped the UK lettuce crop growing. ""When the mercury hits 27 - 30Â° degrees Celsius lettuces can't grow. ""In all of the major growing areas, from Cupar in Fife, through Preston, Lancs, to Ely in East Anglia and Chichester, Sussex, the hot weather has affected all our growers and we may be seeing some gaps on retailers' shelves in the next two weeks as the heatwave continues."" Broccoli also stops growing when it gets too hot, prompting fears of a shortage during the heatwave. The pressure of increased demand and hot weather limiting supply means that growers may be turning to other sources of leafy salads to meet demand, with spinach and rocket said to be unaffected by the higher temperatures. In the summer it is too hot to grow large quantities of lettuce in southern Europe, where UK salads are grown in the winter, which means shoppers may start seeing lettuces from the US on the shelves. Buglife, a British charity that works to protect insects, has said freshwater invertebrates such as dragonflies could be in for a tough time as water sources dry up. Mosquitoes and midges also require water sources, so this could lead to a reduction in their numbers. A Buglife spokesman added that bees will benefit from the heatwave because when dry conditions follow a cold snap there is an abundance of flowers. He added that the downside is the absence of rain means bees will find it difficult to find food later in the year. Bumblebees do not like warm temperatures but have altered their behaviour to forage in the early morning and evening. The dry conditions will have a negative affect on slugs and snails, who are said to have gone into a torpid state, meaning little physical activity. This means they will be breeding and eating less. Network Rail has warned that tracks ""buckle"" in high temperatures, meaning they expand and start to curve. Remote monitoring systems warn Network Rail when a section of track might be expanding too much, which prompts them to introduce local speed restrictions. Slower trains exert lower forces on the track and reduce the chance of buckling, but could also lead to delays and long journeys for commuters."
2018-07-03,"Britain's most wanted fraud suspect Mark Acklom has been arrested in a dramatic raid on his hideout, two years after he went on the run in Europe.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/uks-most-wanted-fraud-suspect-mark-acklom-in-swiss-arrest-11423574,"Acklom, 45, was held by police at an apartment he was sharing with his wife and their two young children in Switzerland. He is wanted in the UK for allegedly fleecing a woman of her Â£850,000 life savings after posing as a wealthy banker and MI6 agent and promising to marry her. It's understood that as officers entered his rented home, conman Acklom tried to jump from a balcony before being wrestled to the ground. He was held at an apartment in the lakeside town of Wadenswil, a 20-minute drive south from Zurich, after a police surveillance operation lasting several days. He was arrested by Swiss police in an investigation involving the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and Avon and Somerset Police. A police mugshot taken after his arrest on Saturday night shows Acklom, normally well-groomed, with long hair and a beard. His alleged victim Carolyn Woods, 58, said at her Cotswolds home: ""I am delighted that after all this time Mark Acklom is in custody and I look forward to him being brought back to face justice."" Ms Woods claimed Acklom left her broke and suicidal in 2013, a year after he walked into her boutique in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and charmed her into a romance. Last summer, long after his name was added to the UK's Most Wanted list, Sky News broadcast a photograph of Acklom sitting with another man at a pavement cafe in Geneva, 270km (170m) from Zurich. He was snapped by someone who claimed to have been a victim of his. Police kept watch on the tiny, back-street cafe, a five-minute walk from Lake Geneva, but Acklom did not show up again. Up until then, British detectives believed Acklom was hiding in Spain, where he had spent many years and learned to speak the language fluently. His wife Maria is Spanish. In January we revealed that Acklom still had a current passport and Swiss residency permit in the name of Marc Long, one of several aliases he has used.The legitimate documents were obtained in 2014, shortly after Acklom fled Britain and after he had changed his name by deed poll. Recently, the hunt for Acklom has focused on the Zurich area from where it's believed he has been setting up various companies in a bid to attract investors. One business claimed to be manufacturing computer chips for black-box data recorders for cars. The company's website suggested it had customers from the luxury car industry. At one point undercover police mounted a surveillance operation on a bank after a tip-off that Acklom was planning to meet staff and business associates there, but he did not appear. Avon and Somerset Police appealed to Sky News viewers across Europe last year to help in identifying Acklom's wife and two young daughters with whom he was thought to be travelling. For two years Acklom has been the subject of a European arrest warrant, which originally detailed allegations from his connection with Ms Woods, but a new warrant was issued this year with more allegations. Detectives have been investigating his life and activities around the Bath and Bristol areas in 2012 and 2013. Senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Adam Bunting, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""The arrest of Mark Acklom is the direct result of the co-ordinated efforts of our officers, the NCA and the Swiss authorities and we're grateful for the professionalism and expertise of all those involved in this international search. ""Acklom thought he could continue to evade capture by moving around Europe but we were determined to locate him and bring him back to this country. ""We've updated the victim of the fraud offences on the latest developments and will continue to work with the relevant authorities to ensure he is extradited as soon as possible."" Ian Cruxton, head of international operations for the NCA, said: ""The hunt for conman Mark Acklom started in Spain but as soon as intelligence indicated he had moved to Switzerland, we utilised our assets there and worked closely with the Swiss authorities and Avon & Somerset Police to track him down. ""We are committed to protecting UK citizens from criminals who seek to exploit them and, likewise, we are equally committed to protecting citizens in other countries."" The European arrest warrant is not recognised in non-EU Switzerland and so Acklom will be dealt with under an existing extradition treaty. He is expected to appear in court sometime this week and indicate if he is to fight a return to the UK."
2018-07-03,"Is there an answer to what Danny Dyer has dubbed the ""mad Brexit riddle?""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/is-the-pms-third-way-an-answer-to-the-mad-brexit-riddle-11424438,"Theresa May believes she may have found it - ""a third way"" - but the soundings on this from No 10 have thus far only added another layer of complexity to the mystery that has been confounding the EastEnders star. Dyer surprised viewers of an ITV show last week by expressing what some commentators said summed up the national mood, by saying no one had a ""clue what Brexit is"". It appears even the Brexit Secretary is unclear what Theresa May's ""third way"" is. David Davis visited No 10 at lunchtime, but according to Sky News' Beth Rigby, he was not given sight of the third way plan. What's more, the meeting was held after No 10 had already announced that there was ""a third way"" to the BBC, without saying what it was. So what could it be? How do we leave the customs union and single market without damaging business and creating a hard border in Northern Ireland? The first two ways have met road blocks. The ""customs partnership"" was an arrangement that would see UK officials collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for any other EU member state. It was complicated, untried and, some argued, unworkable. ""Max Fac"", favoured by Brexiteers, would employ new technologies and ""trusted trader"" schemes to remove the need for cumbersome customs checks. Detractors say this would be very expensive and take time to set up. So you would expect the ""third way"" must be some form of compromise. It could, for example, take aspects of Max Fac, but offer alignment with the EU's custom's union over goods, while having a looser arrangement over services. This idea would alleviate some of the concerns expressed by BMW and Airbus, but purist Brexiteers fear it would make international trade deals harder if not impossible. Plus, the EU would probably shelve it in the bin-shaped file marked ""cherry picking"". During her statement to the House of Commons on the European Council meeting the PM seemed to rule this idea out anyway. She said that she would ""ensure we can get trade around the rest of the world"". This requires a full extraction from the customs union. She confirmed that leaving the customs union and the single market remained her intention. During questions after the PM's statement, the Brexit camp tried to eek-out clues as her thinking on this mystical ""third way"". Sir Bill Cash asked Mrs May to rule out ""disturbing"" reports that the government planned to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA). This a Norway-style option would see the continuation of free movement and big budget payments. Cash described these rumours as ""preposterousâ¦ and would undermine trust in our democracy if they were true."" Mrs May did as she was asked and ruled it out saying it ""would not deliver on the vote of the referendum and the vote of the British people"". So no to EEA; no to the customs union and no to the single market. All the red lines look firmly in place. You would think that the Brexiteers have wind of a compromise. Why else would Jacob Rees-Mogg warn his Prime Minister in an article in the Daily Telegraph that his prime minister risked collapsing her government. Why would Boris Johnson lend his backing to Mr Rees-Mogg as a ""principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country""? My advice is don't read too much into it. Mogg's article is the kind that seems to get written at even the slightest twitch from the PM and without any tangible cause. It was a posturing pre-threat. The PM said in the Commons today: ""We will be setting out, in greater detail than we have done so far, our proposals for that trade agreement with the European Union, making very clear to it the options that now lie on the table."" That makes me think that Mrs May still believes the ""third way"" answer is wrapped up in the future trade agreement; giving the EU ""options"" which the PM will argue are mutually beneficial. When asked directly about Airbus and BMW wanting the UK to remain in the customs union, the PM said: ""We will of course be putting in place customs arrangements with the European Union that will match the ambition of our trading relationship in the future."" My bet is that the ""third way"" is packaged as such. In other words, rather than asking for a Norway relationship with opt-outs (which the EU won't allow) she will go for a Canada-style trade relationship with bespoke opt-ins such as an EU financial services passport (which the EU may well also reject). But if, like Mr Dyer you are still looking for greater clarity on this, I refer you to the PM's own words. She told the Commons: ""There has been much jocularity around the term 'Brexit means Brexit', but it does mean Brexit."" It's like a dictionary where next to every word is simply the word itself. What is Danny Dyer's problem exactly?"
2018-07-03,A man who sparked an investigation into an alleged Westminster paedophile ring is to be charged with perverting the course of justice.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/man-who-sparked-westminster-paedophile-ring-investigation-charged-with-perverting-course-of-justice-11425021,"The 50-year-old man, known only as Nick due to legal reasons, will be charged with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud, the Crown Prosecution Service said. He made a series of bombshell allegations in 2014 as he claimed he had been abused for nine years as a child by a VIP gang during the 1970s and '80s based in Dolphin Square, a development in Pimlico, west London and elsewhere. His claims sparked a Â£2.5m Metropolitan Police investigation, Operation Midland. Officers raided the homes of prominent figures including Lord Bramall, the late former home secretary Lord Brittan, the late former prime minister Ted Heath and ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor. It was closed without a single arrest. Frank Ferguson, CPS head of special crime, said: ""The CPS has considered a file of evidence from Northumbria Police relating to allegations of perverting the course of justice and fraud by a 50-year-old man. ""The police investigation provided evidence that the man had made a number of false allegations alleging multiple homicides and sexual abuse said to have been carried out in the 1970s and 1980s. ""Following careful consideration, we have concluded there is sufficient evidence to bring a number of criminal charges. ""He has today been charged with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud and will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court in due course."" The charges follow claims including allegations of child murder, rape and torture by senior figures in politics, the army and security services. He is also charged with falsely claiming Â£22,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority for saying ""he was subjected to abuse by a paedophile ring, knowing this to be untrue and intending thereby to make a gain for himself"", the CPS said. Labour peer and former MP Lord Janner died in 2015 before his name was cleared. His son, Daniel Janner QC, had vowed to bring a private prosecution if the CPS did not pursue the charges. After hearing the CPS was charging Nick, he said he would now ""happily"" drop those plans. Lord Bramall received an apology from former Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe in 2016, a year after a dawn raid on his Hampshire home, four months before his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died. Mr Procter, 71, called for an independent inquiry into Operation Midland in 2016 and later that year Mr Hogan-Howe apologised for their mistakes, but Mr Procter sued the Met Police last year."
2018-07-03,"The Home Office needs ""root and branch reform"" of its approach to immigration following the Windrush scandal, MPs have demanded.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-call-for-major-reform-of-home-office-after-windrush-scandal-11424588,"Theresa May's ""hostile environment"" approach should also not be allowed to continue in its current form, a report by the House of Commons home affairs select committee said. It blamed the ""appalling"" treatment of the Windrush generation of Caribbean heritage UK residents on political decisions which created an environment where they were treated with scepticism and suspicion. And it warned the Home Office may repeat the same mistakes with the three million EU nationals living in the UK who will have to take on a new migrant status after Brexit. The Windrush task force set up by the Home Office has been contacted by about 8,000 people who arrived in the UK after the Second World War. More than 2,000 have received documents confirming their right to remain in the UK after it was revealed many had been placed in detention centres and had their citizenship questioned. However, the committee said it was ""unacceptable"" the government still cannot say how many people were unlawfully detained, ordered to report to Home Office centres, were denied healthcare or other services, or lost their jobs. It found that immigration officers having enforcement targets may have led to a focus on people like the Windrush generation because they were ""easier to detain and remove"". The report called for an immediate re-evaluation of the ""hostile environment"" policy which tries to deter illegal migrants by making them prove their right to be in the UK. It also recommended overhauling the casework culture at UK Visas and Immigration, the restoration of legal aid and immigration appeals, and dropping the government's goal to cut net migration below 100,000 a year. Home Secretary Sajid Javid rejected a call by the committee to hand funding to Windrush generation members as they wait for compensation. He said: ""Making interim compensation payments now would undermine that process.""   Committee chair Yvette Cooper said the decision is ""very troubling"" and victims of the scandal ""should not have to struggle with debts while they are waiting for the compensation scheme being up and running"". She added: ""Policy choices and political decisions in the Home Office led to a hostile culture and callous system so alarm bells didn't even ring in the department about locking up a grandmother who has lived here for decades, or when long-standing lawful residents lost their NHS treatment and were met with a wall of bureaucracy in response. ""Oversight in the Home Office that should have caught these problems completely failed. ""The Windrush generation, who have contributed so much to Britain, have been badly let down. ""The Home Office has a responsibility to make sure nothing like this can ever happen again."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""The experiences faced by some members of the Windrush generation are inexcusable and it is clear that we must do what is needed to ensure that nothing like this happens again. ""The Home Secretary has said that it is his top priority to right the wrongs that have occurred."""
2018-07-03,"A migrants' rights charity has condemned the UK government for ""routinely"" separating families by placing parents in immigration detention.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/children-and-parents-are-separated-by-immigration-in-the-uk-11418129,"Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID) says it deals with around 170 cases of families who are split up because of immigration enforcement each year. Because the Home Office does not release statistics on the number of parents in immigration detention, however, the actual number is unknown. In the UK, children generally remain with another parent when a guardian is taken into detention, BID legal manager Nicholas Beales said. But parents are still taken away suddenly, for unknown periods, and with the added threat of permanent removal to a country thousands of miles away - with an often ""devastating"" effect on children involved. If removed from the country, they may be told to relocate families of British citizens or keep in touch with their loved ones via Skype. Parents are routinely separated from their children through immigration detention in the UK. The Home Office doesnât release stats about the numbers of parents detained. BIDâs Separated Families project provides legal advice to about 170 parents per year on how to get released. ""You can't overstate what kind of damage it does,"" Mr Beales said. Children are frequently reported to experience panic attacks, bed wetting and altered behaviour when a parent is detained. The criticism comes in the wake of family separations in the United States, where images of imprisoned children screaming for the parents has prompted widespread condemnation. In the UK, Home Office regulations state that children are neither split from both their parents nor placed in detention for immigration purposes. But in less than two years Mr Beales says BID has dealt with several cases in which Home Office enforcement has meant children being taken into care. Among them are the four children of Kenneth Oranyendu, who was detained when he reported to the Home Office after dropping them off from school in March. His wife was in Nigeria for her father's funeral at the time, and the 45-year-old begged immigration authorities to allow him to pick his children up from school. But he was referred to an immigration detention centre 200 miles away, and his children placed in care. ""I said I have nobody, it's only me,"" he told Sky News. ""They still detained me."" Within a few days of his arrest Mr Oranyendu's wife was able to return to the UK to collect the children, and the family are now together after he was released on bail. But he still has to report to the Home Office every two weeks, and fears he could be detained again. His children, aged between six and 17 and all British citizens, have been ""shattered"" by the separation. ""Every time I go out of the house they are afraid I'm not going to come back,"" he said. ""They are terrified we will abandon them, and suffer from panic attacks. They wake in the middle of the night to check if their mum and dad are still there."" Mr Oranyedu has a conviction for drugs smuggling - a crime he denies - and was detained by immigration detention after he served his sentence. His supporters say he is being punished twice because he is not a British citizen. The Home Office told Sky News human rights were ""fully considered"" Mr Oranyendu's case, and that his status as a ""foreign national offender"" meant protecting the public and preventing crime were taken into account. Government guidance says children must not be separated from both parents for immigration purposes, and set out that the decision to detain any parent should be ""necessary and proportionate"" with regard to the children concerned. A spokesperson said immigration procedures would not result in children being taken into care unless in exceptional circumstances, and said children's welfare and safeguarding was at the heart of family returns. BID argues, however, that following this guidance amounts to ""little more than a tick box exercise"" and says the government is putting individuals in detention with little consideration for the impact on the child. ""It's just the casual cruelty - the uncertainty of what's going to happen,"" Mr Beales said. ""The system is not working."""
2018-07-03,"Wolves from the Chernobyl site have been roaming freely beyond the nuclear disaster zone's border, increasing fears that they will spread mutant genes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/are-chernobyl-wolves-spreading-mutant-genes-11424488,"The site became off limits to humans after the nuclear power plant disaster on 26 April 1986, due to concerns about the level of radiation, although it has opened to tourism in recent years. But it is thought that the lack of human interference has allowed animals to thrive in the 18.6-mile-wide exclusion zone. Wolves began to take over the site in 2016, when their population was thought to be around 300. Scientists have followed the wolves as the population has grown to a number now estimated to be up to seven times greater than that of surrounding reserves. Fourteen grey wolves (13 adults and one male juvenile) were tracked using GPS collars to see how far they strayed from the exclusion zone. Study lead author and wildlife ecologist Michael Byrne told Live Science: ""No wolves there were glowing - they all have four legs, two eyes and one tail."" In their article for the European Journal of Wildlife Research, the researchers said that the adult wolves had stayed in the zone but within three weeks, the young wolf had been tracked roaming around 186 miles away. This raised questions as to the effect of wolves potentially affected by damaging radiation carrying mutant genes to pass onto other wolf communities. Mr Byrne said: ""We have no evidence to support that this is happening. ""It is an interesting area of future research, but it is not something I would worry about."" The Chernobyl nuclear disaster saw the power plant release about 400 times more radioactive fallout than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima near the end of World War Two. Particles were spread thousands of miles across Europe, dozens of residents were killed and many others exposed to the radiation. Mr Byrne told Live Science: ""Instead of being an ecological black hole, the Chernobyl exclusion zone might actually act as a source of wildlife to help other populations in the region. ""And these findings might not just apply to wolves - it's reasonable to assume similar things are happening with other animals as well."""

Frighteningly, the app doesn't even show users that the files have been sent - they're only finding out when they get a response from the recipient of the random photos. ""Last night around 2.30am, my phone sent [my girlfriend] my entire photo gallery over text but there was no record of it on my messages app,"" one Reddit user complained. They added that they had enabled a setting allowing pictures to be automatically backed-up to Google, and suspected that the leak occurred because of an update to the Samsung Messages app. Additional owners of the Galaxy S9, S9+ and Note 8 devices have complained about picture dumps, prompting one Reddit user to quip: ""Do S9's come with divorce lawyers?"" Another referenced the self-immolation of Note 7s debacle by stating: ""Give me a spontaneously exploding phone any day of the week, Samsung, instead of this nightmare scenario."" Concerned users should ensure that Samsung Message does not have permission to access their phone's storage, which will prevent it from being able to send anything on the phone.

Concerned customers are encouraged to contact us directly at 1-800-SAMSUNG."""
2018-07-03,"The evacuation of the trapped boys in a Thailand cave ""must speed up"", the country's interior minister has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/thailand-cave-rescue-trapped-boys-must-be-rescued-before-waters-rise-11424755,"Anupong Paojinda says a rescue attempt is to be made as soon as possible before more rain falls and exacerbates the flooding in the cave. ""As rain is forecast in the next few days, the evacuation must speed up. Diving gear will be used. If the water rises, the task will be difficult. We must bring the kids out before then,"" he is quoted as saying in The Bangkok Post. Mr Paojinda acknowledged the difficulty of getting the boys and their coach to dive out of the cave. He said: ""Diving is not easy. Those who have never done it will find it difficult, because there are narrow passages in the cave. They must be able to use diving gear. If the gear is lost at any moment, it can be dangerous to life."" The paper also reported that Mr Paojinda said the boys did not know how to swim, which further complicates efforts to extract them from the cave. Rescuers have appealed for a donation of 15 small-sized full face masks for the boys in the cave. :: Thailand cave rescue: How the boys were found The comments come as it is announced that police will look into whether the 25-year-old coach of the football team could face legal action for leading them into the cave, according to Khaosoenglish.com. The 12 boys and their coach were trapped in the cave for 10 days before rescuers reached them. The team are in a good condition but in need of nutrition. Their eyes, not used to light after being in the dark cave for days, would need to be protected as the trapped people emerge. The divers that reached the trapped group were British and captured the moment on video. Bill Whitehouse, the vice-chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council, told the Today programme that the British drivers who reached the trapped children and coach had to dive against the current, at times having to drag themselves along the walls. The round trip to reach those trapped was around three hours, he said. Attempts to get the children and coach to become proficient enough in scuba diving to escape the cave will ""certainly not (be) easy"". Another option, Mr Whitehouse said, would be to ""package"" the children and coach. This would see the 13 people be kitted up with weights and other equipment which would allow the divers to drag them out of the cave. Mr Whitehouse described the team that reached the boys as ""the A team"". If efforts to get the group out quickly cannot be achieved, there has been discussion of delivering the trapped children and their coach food to last them for four months. The boys are around 2.5 miles (4km) from the entrance, although the British Cave Rescue Council say they are 1.2 miles (2km) in."

She died from her injuries in hospital. Her family said: ""She was not your ordinary little girl, as anyone she met, she would leave a lasting impression on. ""Anyone that met her would not want to forget her. ""Her infectious laugh and smile could light up even the darkest of rooms."" Superintendent Roger Wiltshire said on Monday: ""The witnesses report a loud bang before the incident but we don't know at this stage what caused the trampoline to apparently burst and that's the purpose of the investigation that we will be undertaking over the next day or so."" The death has prompted some to call for tighter restrictions on the toys. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, Essex - where seven-year-old Summer Grant was killed when a bouncy castle blew free from its moorings in 2016 - wants politicians to consider a temporary ban. He said on Twitter: ""After two horrific tragedies, government need to look at update of regulations and inspection regime and consider a temporary ban on bouncy castles in public areas until we can be sure that they are safe."""
2018-07-03,The UK is set to bask in sun for a further four weeks as concern grows over water shortages.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-weather-forecast-shows-hot-temperatures-throughout-july-11423537,"Weather forecasters are expecting very little rain and high temperatures throughout the month, following a dry June. A high-pressure system over the UK will maintain temperatures in the high 20s, with computer models suggesting there will be no widespread rain through the first half of July. The warm period may, however, struggle to beat the drought of 1976 where there was a record 45 days without rain, Sky weather presenter Isobel Lang said. With higher-than-average temperatures there is concern over water levels in rivers and reservoirs. Hosepipe bans have already been in place in some areas during June and these are likely to spread to other parts of the UK. Northern Ireland issued its first hosepipe ban in 23 years on Friday as NI Water said it could not treat water quickly enough to satisfy increased demand. Southern Water asked customers on Thursday to spend no longer than four minutes in the shower and to use rainwater to water plants. Severn Trent Water in the Midlands and United Utilities in the North West asked people to not use hosepipes and sprinklers. Crisp, broccoli and lettuce producers are warning of a shortage due to the prolonged period of cold weather at the start of the year followed by high temperatures and a lack of rain. The South West experienced some relief on Sunday with heavy downpours after the Met Office issued its first thunderstorm warning. However, those regional showers are expected to be followed by more dry, sunny weather and temperatures in the mid-20Cs. Tennis lovers will be in for a warm Wimbledon. The tournament starts today, with centre court's retractable roof unlikely to be used due to rain - though it could be closed for sun protection. The All England Club has assured players concerned about the state of the grass courts they will be able to irrigate them every evening because of the nice weather. Wimbledon Park, where fans began camping for tickets over the weekend, reached 30.4C on Sunday afternoon. The glorious weather has also meant the UK's most endangered butterfly has made a bumper early appearance. Early counts at Heddon Valley in North Devon have revealed there are more than 200 high brown fritillary butterflies. However, the dry conditions mean firefighters battling moorland fires in Lancashire and Greater Manchester face further difficulties. A major incident was declared on Saturday at Winter Hill near Bolton in Lancashire after two large fires merged due to increasing wind speed. Fire brigades from across the country are helping battle the fire and another near Stalybridge in Tameside, Greater Manchester, which started on 24 June. Forecasters say there is potential for showers in the North West ""but it could be a one-off, isolated and unlikely to hit the area"", Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said. On Sunday night Tony Crook, group manager at Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, told Sky News arsonists have been spotted from a police helicopter lighting new fires near Winter Hill. Lancashire Police said it has had to deal with ""reckless and dangerous"" behaviour by people determined to get photos of the fire on their phones blocking access roads for emergency vehicles. Others have been flying drones over the moorland, hampering efforts to douse the fires by helicopter."

Mr Crozier's appointment at Asos underlines the growing maturity of the 18-year-old company, which achieved a significant milestone last November when it overtook Marks & Spencer in terms of its stock market value for the first time. Since then, Asos's shares have continued to trade higher, with the company now valued at Â£5.1bn, against M&S's Â£4.79bn. Asos said Mr Crozier would be appointed as chair and non-executive director on 29 November, following its AGM. Ian Dyson, senior independent non-executive director, said: ""On behalf of the board, I'd like to thank Brian for his contribution during a period of high growth for our company and I'd like to welcome Adam, who joins us at an equally exciting stage in our journey."" Mr Crozier added: ""The ASOS story is truly impressive and I am tremendously excited to become part of it. I'm greatly looking forward to working with the team that is building a global powerhouse in online fashion."" The Asos job adds to a growing portfolio of directorship roles for Mr Crozier, who stepped down as chief executive of ITV last year. Since then, he has become chairman of Whitbread, the FTSE-100 hospitality group which is preparing to demerge its Costa Coffee division; Vue Entertainments, the cinema operator; and Stage Entertainment, the Dutch theatre producer behind the Lion King and Les Miserables"
2018-07-03,Former Conservative Party leader William Hague has warned cabinet Brexiteers not to push their demands with the European Union too far.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/lord-hague-has-a-warning-for-rebel-cabinet-brexiteers-11424614,"In a blunt cautioning to his colleagues ahead of crunch cabinet talks at Chequers on Friday, he said parliament could force a ""watered-down"" Brexit on the government if ministers fail to agree a compromise on the UK's future customs relationship with the EU. He said any minister who chose the Chequers talks to quit would show they were not fit to hold high office in the first place. His warning comes amid reports of possible leadership challenges from ministers unhappy with Theresa May's position on Brexit. Mrs May herself warned on Monday night at the Conservatives annual summer fundraiser that the complexity of Brexit cannot be allowed to ""overwhelm"" her government as she urged them to ""stand together in the national interest"". Lord Hague added that the ""vast sensible middle"" of the Tory party ""deeply dislike naked manoeuvring to become the next leader"". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, he said: ""Flouncing out, just when the going gets tough but when the EU Withdrawal Act has been successfully enacted, will look like evading responsibility for choices that were inevitable just when important progress has been made."" His warning is a thinly veiled shot at senior ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who have reportedly been considering resigning if the prime minister gives Remainers too much leeway. On Monday Mr Johnson publicly defended backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who warned Mrs May she faced her government collapsing if she failed to deliver on her Brexit promises. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan accused him of ""insolence"" but Mr Johnson said Mr Rees-Mogg was ""a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country"". Lord Hague warned Brexiteers did not have the numbers in parliament to force through a ""hard Brexit"", urging them to think of the consequences of creating a leadership crisis. ""Everyone threatening Theresa May with chaos, revolt, resignations, and a leadership election if she doesn't do as they wish needs to think carefully about what might be the consequences of their actions,"" he said ""A vote of no confidence in the leadership called on this issue would in all probability rally the sensible middle to the Prime Minister. ""If ardent Brexiteers push too hard, they will end up without their main objective. If there is no agreement this week on a plan for customs arrangements, the Commons will be much more likely to vote in the near future to stay in the customs union in its entirety. ""The choice is either to back a compromise plan now or to end up with a more watered-down version of Brexit that would be forced on ministers anyway."" Lord Hague also said the concerns of businesses such as Airbus and BMW ""cannot be dismissed"", in reference to Mr Johnson reportedly saying ""f*** business"". He said the infighting was allowing the EU the upper hand, to make ""zero concessions and prepare to impose its own terms on the UK in the absence of any alternative proposals"". ""This is meant to be a government negotiating a momentous international agreement not a debating society that has forgotten to impose a time limit on speeches,"" he added."
2018-07-03,"The planet Uranus was given its tilt after being hit in a ""cataclysmic collision"" by a massive object roughly twice the size of Earth, new research has suggested.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/uranus-was-tilted-by-a-cataclysmic-collision-11424628,"A study by researchers at Durham University believe that a collision in the planet's history left it rotating on a tilt - potentially explaining its freezing temperatures. Uranus is unique among the solar system's planets for rotating on an axis set almost 90 degrees off of the sun's orbital plane, meaning its poles experience 42 years of continuous sunlight and darkness over the course of its orbit. Running high-resolution computer simulations of different collisions with the ice giant, the team attempted to establish how the planet evolved. Their work, published in The Astrophysical Journal, confirms a previous study which stated that its tilted position was most likley caused by a collision with a massive proto-planet made of rock and ice. The collision is believed to have taken place during the formation of the solar system about four billion years ago. According to the simulation, debris from the proto-planet probably forms a thin shell near the edge of the ice layer on the outside of Uranus - trapping the heat at its core. The trapping of this internal heat might explain the extremely cold temperature of Uranus's outer atmosphere of -216 C (-357 F), according to the researchers. The paper's lead author, Mr Jacob Kegerreis, a PhD researcher, said: ""Uranus spins on its side, with its axis pointing almost at right angles to those of all the other planets in the solar system. ""This was almost certainly caused by a giant impact, but we know very little about how this actually happened and how else such a violent event affected the planet. ""We ran more than 50 different impact scenarios using a high-powered super computer to see if we could recreate the conditions that shaped the planet's evolution. ""Our findings confirm that the most likely outcome was that the young Uranus was involved in a cataclysmic collision with an object twice the mass of Earth, if not larger, knocking it on to its side and setting in process the events that helped create the planet we see today."" Scientists have been puzzled as to how Uranus managed to retain any atmosphere at all after the violent collision, but the simulations have suggested an anwer. A glancing glow, rather than a direct hit, would have been strong enough to create the planet's tilt, but Uranus would have retained the majority of its atmosphere."

Mean temperatures made last month the warmest June on record in Northern Ireland and Wales, and the fourth warmest in Scotland and England. Daytime temperatures were 19.9C on average - the same as the famed summer of 1976 and a joint second behind the average of 20.6C in June 1940. Here are some pointers on how to get a good night's sleep, stay cool and enjoy the heatwave. June was also a very dry month for England, with Middlesex seeing just 0.7mm of rainfall, Essex 1.7mm and Dorset 2mm. ""The record set in 1920 was broken in south east and central southern England, where 3.0mm of rainfall was recorded - only 6% of what you would expect there for the month,"" Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said. She said some were concerned about a repeat of the country's memorably hot summer of 1976. ""During that hot spell from mid-June to the end of August there was a maximum temperature of 32C or more recorded somewhere in the UK for 15 consecutive days,"" she said. ""Some parts of the South West went 45 days without any rain in July and August which affected domestic water supplies leading to widespread water rationing."" In the North West, the unusual conditions led to ""aggressive"" wildfires, as two blazes on neighbouring moors met, filling the sky with thick smoke and leaving a trail of blackened land. A Manchester fire spokesman said high temperatures were the toughest part of combating the fire, explaining it would ""take many more days of intense sweat and effort"" for ""tired but optimistic"" firefighters to extinguish it. Photographs showed firefighters beating down hot spots on Winter Hill near Bolton at dawn on Monday as services appealed for sun cream, insect repellent and hats as they battled the ""unprecedented"" blaze.

One teenage boy told Childline: ""I see all my friends having a good time on social media and it gets me down, I feel like no one cares enough to invite me. ""My mood is getting worse and now I'm just upset all the time and can't stop crying."" Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: ""Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children's physical and mental health. ""The crucial question is: what is causing this rise among the young? ""Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children? Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together? ""Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life so they feel lonelier than ever?

Officers were initially looking at the deaths of 15 infants between June 2015 and June 2016 when the investigation was launched in May last year. On Tuesday, there was a heavy police presence in Westbourne Road, Chester, including a forensics tent. Detective inspector Paul Hughes, leading the operation, said: ""The investigation into the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital is continuing. Since it was first launched in May 2017, a dedicated team of detectives have been working tirelessly on this case. ""This is a highly complex and very sensitive investigation and, as you can appreciate, we need to ensure we do everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses. ""When the investigation was first launched it was focusing on the deaths of 15 babies that occurred between the period of June 2015 and June 2016. ""In addition the investigation was also conducting a review of six non-fatal collapses during the same period."" The officer said the scope of the investigation had now ""widened"" since it started and that police were currently looking into the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016. ""As a result of our ongoing enquiries we have today arrested a healthcare professional in connection with the investigation,"" said detective inspector Hughes. ""She was arrested earlier this morning on suspicion of murder in relation to eight of the babies and attempted murder in relation to six of the babies and is currently in custody. ""Whilst this is a significant step forward in our inquiries it is important to remember that the investigation is very much active and ongoing at this stage. ""There are no set timescales for this coming to a conclusion but we remain committed to carrying out a thorough investigation as soon as possible."" Countess of Chester Hospital medical director Ian Harvey said the hospital was continuing to support the ongoing police investigation. The hospital had carried out several independent expert medical reviews into the deaths before alerting the police. ""Asking the police to look into this was not something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened here and get the answers we and the families so desperately want,"" Mr Harvey said in a statement. ""The Countess is now equivalent to a Level 1 Special Care Baby Unit and we are confident the unit is safe to continue in its current form."" Lawyers representing two babies who received treatment at the hospital said they were ""hopeful"" the investigation would provide answers to the families affected.

Conducted over a decade, the study found that coffee drinkers lived longer on average than those who abstained - whether they drank instant, ground, or decaf. No matter the cause of death, drinking coffee was associated with longer life expectancy for all participants, aged between 38-73 years. Blood samples and detailed medical histories, including health and lifestyle questions, showed that 33% of people drank between two and three cups of coffee a day. The live-giving properties of a cup of joe even stayed in place for the survey's 10,000 respondents who drank eight cups or more a day. The researchers said: ""The study provides further evidence that drinking coffee can be part of a healthy diet and offers reassurance to coffee drinkers."""

Speaking in the week that the NHS celebrates its 70th anniversary, Holden said she had just finished a stint on BGT when she realised the baby ""hadn't really moved a lot"". She said: ""He used to jump quite a lot because of the buzzers (on the show),"" but had ""sort of stopped moving"". After going to West Middlesex University Hospital for a scan, the midwife ""walked out of the room because she couldn't hear the heartbeat"". After that, Holden said, ""all hell broke loose"". Praising the NHS care she received, Holden said she and her husband were talked ""through the whole process, which was just horrific"". The ""emotional care"" she received from the NHS was ""terrific"", she added. Midwives ""held my son because I couldn't do it straight away"", she said. She also had bereavement counselling and was given a private room, which ""everyone is entitled too - it's not because I'm off the telly"". ""It's a special bereavement room, which is something I feel very passionately about, so I didn't have to go back on to a maternity ward and see all the lovely, beautiful, crying babies,"" she said. ""I was able to stay privately with my husband and grieve, and be with our son and say goodbye to him. ""The whole thing was done so beautifully in the most amazing maternity unit they have here. ""We couldn't have asked for better care."" The NHS has grown from a budget of less than Â£500m to Â£145bn in its 70 years. Holden, who made a documentary about learning to become a midwife at the same hospital, said she would do it for a living were she not already employed. ""I loved it, absolutely loved it,"" she said. ""I learned so many different skills - people skills, medical skills."" To ensure the NHS continues to function, Holden said that ""we've all got to start looking after ourselves better"". It is important, she said, that people don't ""turn up at hospital for the smallest reasons, or because of stuff we've done to ourselves by not taking care of ourselves"". ""Just look after yourself, and then the NHS can stay around for another 70 years,"" she said."
2018-07-03,NHS England has launched the biggest recruitment drive in its history in a bid to attract more applicants to under-staffed NHS roles.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180703153018/https://news.sky.com/story/staffing-crisis-prompts-nhs-recruitment-drive-11424490,"The Â£8m campaign will primarily target children aged 14 to 18 through TV and radio adverts as well as posters and social media. Initially, it will focus on drawing applicants into nursing. Professor Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for England, told Sky News: ""There is a huge amount of choice out there at the moment, with lots of people competing for young people about where they want to go and work. ""So that's why we want to concentrate on recruiting 14 to 18-year-olds, to give them a real understanding about what being a nurse is all about."" Last year, NHS England had more than 35,000 vacant nursing positions, with mental health and community nursing roles being particularly hard to recruit for. ""This campaign is all about inspiring young people to come and work for the NHS and have a rewarding and fulfilling career,"" Prof Cummings said. Lauretta Ofulue has had first-hand experience of NHS nursing care. Last year, her son, Otito, died from a serious genetic condition, having been in and out of hospital since birth. Mrs Ofulue told Sky News: ""I know how much of a difference it makes when you meet that healthcare professional who really gets it, who's willing to listen, who's willing to communicate with your family, who treats your loved one like theirs."" Mrs Ofulue's experience inspired her to become a nurse and she has just finished the first year of a three-year course to become a learning disabilities nurse. It's a role which she describes as ""stressful and challenging, but really a privilege"" and one that she would ""definitely encourage others to do"". The new recruitment campaign hopes to secure staffing levels for the future by attracting 22,000 applicants. But there are still concerns about the present. Last year, following cuts to student nurse and midwife bursaries, applications to these college and university courses dropped by nearly 20%. And the Royal College of Nursing says concerns about working restrictions for EU and non-EU healthcare staff has deterred people from applying to work in the NHS. In turn, these factors have an effect on retaining existing staff. Stephanie Aiken, deputy director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, told Sky News: ""We know that people are leaving because they can't do the job well, that they are constrained by the lack of staff in order to share the workload. ""So one of the things we really need to think about is how to we attract the right staff so that we have the numbers coming in but then really how do we look after our staff well."""

Fuel duty, which has been frozen for eight years, could raise Â£800m more for the treasury next year when linked to inflation, sources told The Guardian. It would raise billions in the years after, they added. The freeze has cost the government Â£46bn since 2011 when it was introduced and will cost a further Â£26bn to the end of the 2020/2021 financial year, the treasury said. Alcohol duty was only frozen in last autumn's budget but could bring in more than Â£200m of additional funding a year. Senior government sources said the plan, which Mr Hammond has been mulling since becoming chancellor in 2016, is ""under serious consideration"". However, plans to scrap the fuel duty freeze - one of the Tory's key pledges - have angered some of Mrs May's backbench MPs who are worried about the rising cost of living. Former minister Rob Halfon, who has campaigned against fuel duty hikes, condemned the plan. He tweeted: ""Absolutely wrong-headed decision to increase fuel duty. ""Would hit motorists, businesses and increase in transport costs = increasing costs for all. ""Prices at pump have been rising becuase of international oil prices. Why hit motorists further?"" Howard Cox, from FairFuel UK, called the plan ""suicidal"" for the government. ""We have the highest fuel duty in the world despite eight years of a freeze,"" he said. ""Any emotive fuel tax hike to fund the NHS will be suicidal for the government when they know and stated in 2014 that cutting it will generate more taxes to the exchequer."" A treasury spokeswoman told Sky News: ""As the prime minister and chancellor have made clear, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS we all use. ""We will listen to views about how we do this and will set out plans at future fiscal events."""

Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan was among those who hit out at Mr Rees-Mogg's ""insolence"" in ""lecturing and threatening"" the PM, stating it was ""just too much"". Another Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""Enough. Just tired of this endless threat and counter threat."" Several other MPs also backed Mrs May. But unlike his Foreign Office colleagues, Mr Johnson jumped to defend his fellow pro-Brexit Conservative colleague, amid claims from Labour that the Tories were beset with infighting. He tweeted: ""It's vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit. ""Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country."" The foreign secretary's intervention came while Mrs May was in the Commons giving a statement about the EU Council summit last week - where leaders took just 60 seconds to approve their joint approach on the UK's exit. Amid an intensification of the row between Leave and Remain-supporters, cabinet ministers are due to make key decisions on Brexit at a special meeting at Chequers on Friday. Mrs May told the House she had been forced to admit at the council summit that MPs were unlikely to back the Withdrawal Agreement if there was not clarity about what would follow. She said: ""We all agreed we must urgently intensify the pace of the negotiations on our future relationship. ""I warned EU leaders that I do not think this parliament will approve the withdrawal agreement in the autumn unless we have clarity on our future relationship alongside it."" ""The EU will want to consider our proposals seriously. We both need to show flexibility to build the deep relationship after we have left, that is in the interest of both our peoples."" She reiterated the government was sticking to its pledge to leave the customs union and single market, to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and to stay out of the European Economic Area (EEA), despite reports to the contrary. Responding to the prime minister's statement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had consistently ""mishandled"" the Brexit negotiations. He said: ""This government has mishandled these negotiations every step of the way. ""Another summit has gone and another opportunity missed."" Referring to the bitter public battle being waged among senior Tory MPs, he said: ""The division and infighting in the cabinet is having a debilitating effect on this country and threatens jobs and communities in every part of the UK. ""I don't envy the prime minister. ""She has many loud and competing voices in her cabinet... not competing to do the best for this country, but to do the best for themselves."" The row among senior Conservatives spilled over into the chamber when Remainer Nicky Morgan made a thinly-veiled attack on Mr Rees-Mogg. After the Brexiteer asked the PM to confirm the UK would definitely be leaving the customs union at the end of the Brexit transition period, she asked if Mrs May agreed that rather than listening to ""red lines as set down by the member for North East Somerset"", she should do what ""Conservative prime ministers over the ages have done, which is to find a pragmatic, sensible and flexible Brexit which delivers on the referendum result and but protects business and jobs and the economy"". In an apparent bid to overcome the divisions within Mrs May's party, Downing Street has produced a third model for post-Brexit customs arrangements beyond the two that ministers are currently at loggerheads over. After the Chequers meeting, the government will publish a white paper outlining its detailed negotiating position on a future UK-EU relationship. It is understood this will be released on 13 July, the same day US President Donald Trump will visit the UK."

Officers were initially looking at the deaths of 15 infants between June 2015 and June 2016 when the investigation was launched in May last year. On Tuesday, there was a heavy police presence in Westbourne Road, Chester, including a forensics tent. Detective inspector Paul Hughes, leading the operation, said: ""The investigation into the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital is continuing. Since it was first launched in May 2017, a dedicated team of detectives have been working tirelessly on this case. ""This is a highly complex and very sensitive investigation and, as you can appreciate, we need to ensure we do everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses. ""When the investigation was first launched it was focusing on the deaths of 15 babies that occurred between the period of June 2015 and June 2016. ""In addition the investigation was also conducting a review of six non-fatal collapses during the same period."" The officer said the scope of the investigation had now ""widened"" since it started and that police were currently looking into the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016. ""As a result of our ongoing enquiries we have today arrested a healthcare professional in connection with the investigation,"" said detective inspector Hughes. ""She was arrested earlier this morning on suspicion of murder in relation to eight of the babies and attempted murder in relation to six of the babies and is currently in custody. ""Whilst this is a significant step forward in our inquiries it is important to remember that the investigation is very much active and ongoing at this stage. ""There are no set timescales for this coming to a conclusion but we remain committed to carrying out a thorough investigation as soon as possible."" Countess of Chester Hospital medical director Ian Harvey said the hospital was continuing to support the ongoing police investigation. The hospital had carried out several independent expert medical reviews into the deaths before alerting the police. ""Asking the police to look into this was not something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened here and get the answers we and the families so desperately want,"" Mr Harvey said in a statement. ""The Countess is now equivalent to a Level 1 Special Care Baby Unit and we are confident the unit is safe to continue in its current form."" Lawyers representing two babies who received treatment at the hospital said they were ""hopeful"" the investigation would provide answers to the families affected.

Scotland Yard has not formally named the actor as the suspect. But it said they are investigating a man over two more claims. These latest accusations bring the total number of claims against the Oscar winner to six - five complaints of sexual assault and one of assault. Spacey was one of the first stars to be accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. He has faced multiple accusations of sexual harassment since Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey had made a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when he was 14 and Spacey was 26. Responding to the initial historical allegation, the 58-year-old actor said he did ""not remember the encounter"" but offered ""the sincerest apology"" if it had taken place. For years the actor has denied being a homosexual - is it possible that he could be using his sexuality to avoid the bigger issue? Spacey has since lost his House Of Cards Netflix role, been removed from Ridley Scott's 2017 film All The Money In The World, and had his 2017 Emmy Founders Award revoked. He has not been arrested or charged with any crime. The Old Vic theatre in London - where Spacey was artistic director for over 10 years - also said they found 20 people who claimed to have suffered ""inappropriate behaviour"" from the actor. Later this month, Spacey will make his first big-screen appearance since the allegations, in thriller Billionaire Boys Club, which was filmed two years ago."

Her body was found by police in an abandoned hotel less than three hours later. Wendy Davie, headteacher of Chapelside Primary School where Alesha had just finished her second year, said she was ""part of the family"" and would be greatly missed by pupils and staff. ""She loved being at school and enjoyed all aspects of literacy, in particular writing,"" Ms Davie said. ""She was such a perfectionist in her handwriting and was very proud of her work. ""Alesha was very friendly and she welcomed everyone first thing in the morning at breakfast club. She was a very considerate child who loved being part of a group and she was popular with all the other children and was a smiley and happy young girl."" The murder has shocked the small community of Rothesay, where extra officers have been brought in to assist with a murder investigation and 24-hour high-visibility patrols. ""Incidents such as this are extremely rare but we are still in the early stages of this investigation and we would ask people to be vigilant about their children and also their household security,"" Chief Superintendent Hazel Hendren said. ""It is very important that people are vigilant and look after each other."" Family and friends of the murdered girl have placed flowers and cards outside her home. Police said the six-year-old's family were ""devastated"".

She was forced to stay on as a visitor without the right to work, but was backed by major financial institutions in her fight for visa rights. QT won the right to live in the Chinese city when the Court of Final Appeal ruled it was ""counter-productive"" to only extend dependent work rights to heterosexual couples. It said employment visas are granted because the individual ""has the talent or skills deemed needed or desirable... such a person could be straight or gay."" Same-sex marriage or civil unions are not currently recognised in Hong Kong. ""I was like wow, have I actually done it, have we actually got there, finally?"" QT said of her victory. ""And then I was tearful with joy... this is all I wanted for seven years."" She added that the recognition of her civil partnership made her feel ""relevant and valuable, more than anything"". Her lawyer Michael Vidler said that it would ""hopefully pave the way to change"" in regards to the recognition of same-sex marriage. QT's case was publicly supported by top financial institutions such as Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. They said diverse hiring practices were crucial to attracting and retaining top talent. QT previously accused the Chinese government of treating her ""like a second class citizen"" because of her sexual orientation. Last year, she won her case at the Court of Appeal, which ruled immigration authorities had ""failed to justify the indirect discrimination on account of sexual orientation that QT suffers""."
2018-07-04,"Is there an answer to what Danny Dyer has dubbed the ""mad Brexit riddle?""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/is-the-pms-third-way-an-answer-to-the-mad-brexit-riddle-11424438,"Theresa May believes she may have found it - ""a third way"" - but the soundings on this from No 10 have thus far only added another layer of complexity to the mystery that has been confounding the EastEnders star. Dyer surprised viewers of an ITV show last week by expressing what some commentators said summed up the national mood, by saying no one had a ""clue what Brexit is"". It appears even the Brexit Secretary is unclear what Theresa May's ""third way"" is. David Davis visited No 10 at lunchtime, but according to Sky News' Beth Rigby, he was not given sight of the third way plan. What's more, the meeting was held after No 10 had already announced that there was ""a third way"" to the BBC, without saying what it was. So what could it be? How do we leave the customs union and single market without damaging business and creating a hard border in Northern Ireland? The first two ways have met road blocks. The ""customs partnership"" was an arrangement that would see UK officials collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for any other EU member state. It was complicated, untried and, some argued, unworkable. ""Max Fac"", favoured by Brexiteers, would employ new technologies and ""trusted trader"" schemes to remove the need for cumbersome customs checks. Detractors say this would be very expensive and take time to set up. So you would expect the ""third way"" must be some form of compromise. It could, for example, take aspects of Max Fac, but offer alignment with the EU's custom's union over goods, while having a looser arrangement over services. This idea would alleviate some of the concerns expressed by BMW and Airbus, but purist Brexiteers fear it would make international trade deals harder if not impossible. Plus, the EU would probably shelve it in the bin-shaped file marked ""cherry picking"". During her statement to the House of Commons on the European Council meeting the PM seemed to rule this idea out anyway. She said that she would ""ensure we can get trade around the rest of the world"". This requires a full extraction from the customs union. She confirmed that leaving the customs union and the single market remained her intention. During questions after the PM's statement, the Brexit camp tried to eek-out clues as her thinking on this mystical ""third way"". Sir Bill Cash asked Mrs May to rule out ""disturbing"" reports that the government planned to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA). This a Norway-style option would see the continuation of free movement and big budget payments. Cash described these rumours as ""preposterousâ¦ and would undermine trust in our democracy if they were true."" Mrs May did as she was asked and ruled it out saying it ""would not deliver on the vote of the referendum and the vote of the British people"". So no to EEA; no to the customs union and no to the single market. All the red lines look firmly in place. You would think that the Brexiteers have wind of a compromise. Why else would Jacob Rees-Mogg warn his Prime Minister in an article in the Daily Telegraph that his prime minister risked collapsing her government. Why would Boris Johnson lend his backing to Mr Rees-Mogg as a ""principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country""? My advice is don't read too much into it. Mogg's article is the kind that seems to get written at even the slightest twitch from the PM and without any tangible cause. It was a posturing pre-threat. The PM said in the Commons today: ""We will be setting out, in greater detail than we have done so far, our proposals for that trade agreement with the European Union, making very clear to it the options that now lie on the table."" That makes me think that Mrs May still believes the ""third way"" answer is wrapped up in the future trade agreement; giving the EU ""options"" which the PM will argue are mutually beneficial. When asked directly about Airbus and BMW wanting the UK to remain in the customs union, the PM said: ""We will of course be putting in place customs arrangements with the European Union that will match the ambition of our trading relationship in the future."" My bet is that the ""third way"" is packaged as such. In other words, rather than asking for a Norway relationship with opt-outs (which the EU won't allow) she will go for a Canada-style trade relationship with bespoke opt-ins such as an EU financial services passport (which the EU may well also reject). But if, like Mr Dyer you are still looking for greater clarity on this, I refer you to the PM's own words. She told the Commons: ""There has been much jocularity around the term 'Brexit means Brexit', but it does mean Brexit."" It's like a dictionary where next to every word is simply the word itself. What is Danny Dyer's problem exactly?"

In an open letter, auditor general Sir Amyas Morse said parts of her statement were incorrect and unproven, in a highly unusual move that has sparked calls in some quarters for Ms McVey to resign. Prime Minister Theresa May continues to have full confidence in Ms McVey, a Downing Street source said. Sir Amyas said it was ""odd"" that Ms McVey had told the Commons the NAO did not take into account recent changes in the administration of universal credit, when the report was ""fully agreed"" with senior officials at her department days earlier. Rent arrears and food bank use - Sky News obtains figures showing the impact of universal credit He said a claim that the NAO had concerns that universal credit was being implemented too slowly was ""not correct"". Sir Amyas also took issue with Ms McVey's assurance that universal credit was working, describing the claim as ""not proven"". Addressing the Commons following the publication of the letter, Ms McVey said: ""While speaking in parliament in answer to questions on the NAO report into universal credit, I mistakenly said that the NAO had asked for the roll-out of universal credit to continue at a faster rate and to be speeded up. ""In fact, the NAO did not say that and I want to apologise."" She continued: ""I want to apologise to... the House for inadvertently misleading you. ""What I meant to say was that the NAO had said that there was no practical alternative to continuing with universal credit."" Ms McVey defended her claim that the report did not take into account recent changes to universal credit, saying: ""The impact of these changes are still being felt and therefore, by definition, couldn't have been fully taken into account by the NAO report."" Margaret Greenwood, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ""She sought to rubbish the NAO report, rather than respond to its findings, which were damning of her government's flagship social security policy, even though her own department had agreed the report prior to its publication."" Stephen Lloyd, Lib Dems welfare spokesman, said Ms McVey was ""unfit for office"". ""Theresa May should replace her with someone who has the humility to recognise that without significant changes, a national roll-out of universal credit will cause considerable, unnecessary hardship, to some of the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens across the UK,"" he said. The NAO's report, which was published last month, highlighted the problems caused for claimants by delays in receiving payments under universal credit. Its damning assessment was that universal credit was ""not value for money now, and that its future value for money is unproven"". Under the government's reform of the welfare system benefits such as tax credits, unemployment and housing benefit will be consolidated into one monthly payment. It is designed to simplify the system and provide added incentive for claimants to find employment. But opponents say the implementation has been chaotic, with claimants facing hardship, being put into rent arrears and having to rely on food banks because of issues with receiving payments."

Hip-hop artist Shakur was aged just 25 when he was gunned down in September 1996 after watching a Mike Tyson fight. He died from his injuries six days later. Davis, who has been diagnosed with cancer, has chosen to speak now due to his illness granting him immunity from prosecution. The new interview forms part of a new Netflix series - Unsolved: the Tupac and Biggie Murders. In the documentary, which is based on the LA Police Department investigation, Davis describes how he was a front seat passenger in the white Cadillac from which the fatal shots were fired. Davis says the car was driven by Terrence ""T-Brown"" Brown, while DeAndre ""Dre"" Smith and Davis's nephew Orlando ""Baby Lane"" Anderson were in the backseat. After the death of XXXTentacion, Sky News looks at major hip-hop artists killed or seriously injured in shootings and violence. All the men were part of the Southside Crips gang and Brown, Smith and Anderson have since died. Davis says they had been looking for Tupac - who he alleges had beaten up one of their fellow gang members - at the 662 club, owned by Death Row Records boss Marion ""Suge"" Knight, who was known to be with Tupac that evening. However, he says after leaving the club without finding Tupac, they saw him in a BMW standing up ""like a celebrity in a parade"" through the open top of the car. He goes on: ""If he wouldn't even been out the window, we would have never seen him."" When directly asked who fired the shot, Davis answers with a smile: ""Going to keep it for the code of the streets. It just came from the backseat, bro"". For Madonna, being ""with a black man wouldn't jeopardise"" her career, the letter says, but things were different for the rapper. However, in a previous recorded police interview Davis identifies his nephew Anderson as the gunman, saying he ""leaned over"" and fired from the right hand side of the car. Anderson - who died aged 24 in an unrelated gang shooting in 1998 - had previously denied the claim. Kyle Long, the executive producer of the documentary, has criticised the LAPD for taking no action, despite Davis confessing to be an accessory to murder. Previously, links have been made between Tupac's shooting and that of fellow rapper The Notorious B.I.G. - also known as Biggie Smalls - in March of the following year. There have been no prosecutions for either killing."

The ticket, for parking in a restricted zone, was from 1974 and was for $2. The letter said: ""Dear PD, I've been carrying this ticket around for 40+ years. Always intending to pay. Forgive me if I don't give you my info. With respect, Dave."" The return address said: ""Feeling guilty, Wayward Road, Anytown, Ca."" Police Chief Michael Combs said he was blown away that someone would keep a ticket this long, let alone pay it, according to CBS Philly. ""He paid his fine. So that's 44 years later, so that means I only made $3 in 44 years,"" he joked. He said he would like to meet the driver and thank him."
2018-07-04,The former WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell is plotting to raise up to Â£1bn for a takeover spree that could ultimately re-establish him at the helm of a sizeable international marketing services empire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/sorrell-targets-1bn-warchest-for-ad-agency-takeover-spree-11425724,"Sky News can reveal that a shareholder circular posted on Wednesday to investors âin Sir Martin's new marketing services vehicle disclosed its ability to issue stock worth up to Â£1bn to fund acquisitions. The size of the potential war chest is much greater than Derriston Capital - the cash shell that Sir Martin is acquiring - had previously indicated would be available to him. Its disclosure comes as Sir Martin fights a â¬300m (Â£265m) bidding war with his former employer over what could become the first purchase by S4 Capital, his new venture: a Dutch-based digital creative agency called MediaMonks. On Tuesday, Sky News revealed that WPP Group had tabled a rival bid for MediaMonks, pitching it into a headlong battle with Sir Martin less than three months after he quit the company amid acrimonious circumstances.News of their competing offers for MediaMonks comes less than a fortnight after Sir Martin told an audience at the Cannes Lions advertising festival that S4 would not be in direct competition with his former employer. ""I've referred to it being a peanut,"" he said. ""Although it does occur to me that some people have peanut allergies."" The size of Sir Martin's potential takeover war chest will raise expectations that S4 Capital may ultimately be regarded as a competitor to WPP. That poses potentially awkward questions for both parties, given the absence of a non-compete clause in his final WPP contract. He has, nevertheless, given confidentiality undertakings which could impact on S4's ability to strike certain deals. In the circular ahead of a meeting later this month at which he will seek to take over Derriston and rename it S4, its board said it was ""seeking shareholderâ approval to authorise the issue of up to 1bn consolidated ordinary shares...where the implied look-through issue price is not less than Â£1"". Sir Martin would avoid his influence being diluted by a B-share structure which allows him total control of S4. Market speculation has already linked S4 Capital to other targets including MDC Partners, a US-listed agency group, in recent weeks. Sir Martin left WPP following an investigation into allegations relating to the use of company funds to pay for a sex worker - which he has vociferously denied. His ability to establish a business in direct rivalry with WPP, the owner of J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy and Young & Rubicam, while retaining up to Â£19m in unvested share options led to a limited shareholder protest against the chairman, Roberto Quarta, at last month's annual general meeting. Sir Martin remains a significant shareholder in WPP, with much of his wealth tied up in the stock of the company he took from a manufacturer of shopping baskets in 1985 to bestriding the global advertising industry. By the time he stepped down in April, WPP was valued by the stock market at more than Â£16bn. Its shares have slipped in recent months, however, amid investor anxiety about the impact of marketing budget cuts and shifts at major global advertisers. Ford has put its global creative business - held by WPP agencies - under review, while an executive at Unilever, WPP's second-largest client, said it would watch S4 Capital's progress with interest. Sir Martin's progress is being closely watched by the world's biggest marketing services agencies, which are being forced to adapt to a fast-changing media landscape in which Facebook and Google have emerged as powerful challengers to traditional advertising media. Sir Martin has committed Â£40m of his own money to the new venture, with institutional investors such as Lombard Odier, Miton, Schroders and Toscafund all backing the vehicle. Dowgate Capital, a stockbroker, has been working with Sir Martin on fundraising activity by S4, which is structured so that it is controlled by its executive chairman with an iron grip. Roberto Quarta, the chairman, has named two long-serving WPP executives as joint chief operating officers while a permanent successor to Sir Martin is being recruited. It has not made any big strategic moves since Sir Martin's exit, although it has agreed to sell equity holdings in two technology businesses."

No similar incidents have been recorded in Havant, but a council spokesman says the authority will ban the use of bouncy castles until the cause of the incident is known. ""It has been decided that until the reason for the explosion of the bouncy castle has been identified, such that the risk can be properly managed by the event organiser, Havant Borough Council will not permit the use of bouncy castles or inflatables at any events taking place on its land,"" the spokesman said. Ava-May was the only person on the trampoline when, according to witnesses, it burst with a loud bang. Police do not know the cause of the apparent explosion, which happened in Gorleston-on Sea, and say they are investigating. It came a month after two fairground workers were prosecuted over the death of Summer Grant, seven, who died when the bouncy castle she was on blew away. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP for Harlow, Essex, where Summer was from, wants politicians to consider a temporary ban. Disappointed not to have been granted an #UrgentQuestion on #bouncycastles today following the tragedy that occurred over the weekend, but I will be tabling a Commons motion about it. ""After two horrific tragedies, government need to look at update of regulations and inspection regime and consider a temporary ban on bouncy castles in public areas until we can be sure that they are safe,"" he tweeted. His request for an urgent question in parliament was rejected, however. Ava-May's family have paid tribute to their daughter's ""infectious laugh and smile"". ""She was not your ordinary little girl, as anyone she met she would leave a lasting impression on,"" they said. ""Anyone that met her would not want to forget her."""
2018-07-04,"More than two million children in England are growing up in families where there are serious risks, the Children's Commissioner has said.
",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/millions-of-children-fending-for-themselves-and-facing-serious-risk-at-home-11425643,"Anne Longfield's report states the dangers include domestic violence and living with parents who are alcoholics or have substance abuse problems. The study into childhood vulnerability estimates that 2.1 million of England's 11.8 million children, nearly one in six, are living in families with risks so serious that they need some level of help. Of those children there are 890,000 with parents suffering serious mental health problems and 825,000 living in homes with domestic violence. And 100,000 children were found to be living in a family with the ""toxic trio"" - mental health problems, domestic violence and alcohol or substance abuse. The study has widened the number of groups of children associated with forms of vulnerability or risk from 32 to 37. Ms Longfield said: ""Over a million of the most vulnerable children in England cannot meet their own ambitions because they are being let down by a system that doesn't recognise or support them, a system that too often leaves them and their families to fend for themselves until crisis point is reached. ""Not every vulnerable child needs state intervention, but this research gives us, in stark detail, the scale of need and the challenges ahead. ""Meeting them will not be easy or cost-free. ""It will require additional resources, effectively targeted, so that we move from a system that marginalises vulnerable children to one which helps them. ""Supporting vulnerable children should be the biggest social justice challenge of our time. ""Every day we see the huge pressures on the family courts, schools and the care systems of failing to take long-term action. ""The cost to the state is ultimately greater than it should be, and the cost to those vulnerable children missing out on support can last a lifetime. ""We get the society we choose and at the moment we are choosing to gamble with the futures of hundreds of thousands of children."" Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, said: ""It's our most vulnerable children who are paying the price for the punishing central government cuts to council budgets, and being left without the early help they desperately need."" Roy Perry, vice chairman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said: ""We want the Government to heed these increasingly urgent warnings and accept the critical need for properly funded children's services, which face a funding gap of Â£3billion by 2025 just to keep services running at current levels. ""We have long warned of the rising demand councils face, with an average of more than 270 children taken into care or placed on a child protection plan every single day to keep them safe from harm."" The government announced in April that new measures would be introduced to support the children of alcoholic parents. The ""lifeline"" tools include faster access to mental health services and funding to identify children at risk."

The incident took place roughly eight miles (13km) from Salisbury, where former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted with the nerve agent novichok in March. Scotland Yard said in a statement that ""given the recent events in Salisbury, officers from the counter terrorism network are working jointly with colleagues from Wiltshire Police regarding the incident in Amesbury. ""As Wiltshire Police have stated, they are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding the incident and will update the public as soon and as regularly as possible."" A Downing Street spokesman said the incident was being treated ""with the utmost seriousness"", adding that ministers and the prime ministers were receiving updates. A meeting of the government's Cobra emergencies committee took place at official level - not chaired by ministers - on Wednesday morning. Police declared a major incident on Tuesday after the pair were found unconscious in a house in Muggleton Road on Saturday night. They are both being treated at Salisbury District Hospital. Police initially believed the Amesbury pair, who have not been named, fell ill after using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. But further tests are now taking place to establish the substance. Officers were seen outside a Boots branch in Amesbury. Boots UK said one of their stores in Amesbury has closed at the request of police, adding: ""We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause customers and patients, and our team are available to direct patients towards our Salisbury Street store where they will be able to access their prescription medicines."" It is believed one of the last places the couple were seen in public was a family fun day at Amesbury Baptist Church on Saturday afternoon. Roy Collins, church secretary, said: ""Last weekend we held a community fundraiser and we understand this may well be the last event this couple went to in public."" He said he woke on Wednesday morning to find the church cordoned off by police. ""We are all quite puzzled and shocked - naturally the connection with Salisbury and recent events there mean there is a heightened public interest,"" he added. ""We are praying for the couple, one of our members knows them and clearly there are concerns for them and any others in the community."" Those living in the areas have been told to expect an increased police presence. Salisbury District Hospital is open as usual and patients are advised to attend appointments unless told otherwise. A Public Health England (PHE) spokesman said that, based on the number of casualties affected, ""it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public"". The spokesman added the situation would be ""continually assessed"". The police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon Angus Macpherson says there is nothing to suggest the incident is ""in any way connected to Skripal case at this moment in time"". Mr Skripal and his daughter both survived being poisoned with a nerve agent in an attack the British government has blamed on Russia. Moscow has denied any involvement. Ms Skripal said after being released from hospital: ""We are so lucky to have both survived this attempted assassination. ""Our recovery has been slow and extremely painful."" Her father, who has not yet spoken to the media, was discharged from hospital in May. The pair each spent weeks in a coma after they were found frothing at the mouth on a bench in Salisbury on 4 March."

""The moorland fire is now being investigated as arson following information from local witnesses and initial inquiries,"" Chief Superintendent Neil Evans, Territorial Policing Commander for Tameside, said. ""The scale of this fire is exceptional and we are treating it with the utmost seriousness."" He said police are ""under no illusion"" that solid evidence as to where and how the fire started will not be easy to establish. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) were called to a report of land on the fire near to Buckton Vale in Tameside on Sunday 24 June, a police statement said. ""Since then, firefighters have spent more than a week tackling the blaze in extremely challenging weather conditions. ""Although now under control, the fire is continuing to burn despite the best efforts of all those involved,"" it continued. Arsonists were spotted lighting new fires near Bolton even though the blaze continued to burn, Sky News was told this week. It is ""absolutely heartbreaking and unbelievable"", Tony Crook from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said. The perpetrators are putting ""yourselves at risk, your community at risk, and also putting emergency workers at risk"", Mr Crook added. :: Urgent appeal for sun cream, socks and hats for moors fire crews On Sunday, when a police helicopter was sent up to survey the area, people were spotted lighting fires in grassland called Healey Nab. ""Witnesses reported people lighting a bonfire at around 7.30pm on Sunday 24 June on the moors near the Stalybridge estate and officers are currently pursuing this as a possible line of enquiry,"" the police statement continued. Chief Superintendent Neil Evans said their work will be ""painstaking"" with the fire service due to the areas they are able to look including dusty ash, burnt peat and grass. More than 100 firefighters have been tackling the ""rapidly developing, aggressive"" blaze after the two fires on Winter Hill and Scout Road merged into one. Other fire brigades from across the country - including Tyne and Wear, the South West, Nottinghamshire, Humberside and Warwickshire - are also helping at the scene."

It found that the companies had failed to do enough to ensure the ads were not directed at under-16s. The ASA rules say advertisers must use targeting tools to to direct ads away from users whose interests suggest they are younger than they claim, rather than just filter out users who have told social media platforms they are under 16. ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: ""The ban on HFSS ads in children's online media is working, but it's important that we enforce it rigorously. ""These rulings show that we're doing that and will help advertisers understand where we're drawing the line."" The Cadbury ban centred on adverts on its website for a storybook called The Tale Of The Great Easter Bunny, written by pop singer Frankie Bridge and featuring children hunting for Easter eggs coloured the same purple as the company's branding. A spokeswoman for Mondelez UK, trading as Cadbury, said: ""We will be taking the insights and views provided by the ASA as part of this ruling and applying those learnings to our future content so we can continue to build upon our longstanding commitment to not market directly to children under the age of 16."" It also banned four posts on the Chewits Facebook page about Chewie the Chewitsaurus celebrating GCSE results, going back to school, Roald Dahl Day and International School Libraries Month. The ""advergame"" app Squashies World, in which players match pairs of Squashies by flicking them towards each other, must no longer appear. However complaints against the YouTube star Zoella and Pointless Blog, run by her partner Alfie Deyes, were not upheld by the ASA. They had post ads for the confectionery brand Ferrero, but it was found that the company had taken reasonable steps to target their ads appropriately, taking into account datashowing that only a small proportion of Zoella and Pointless Blogs's audience were under 16."

'pour' hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Her hilarity was prompted by a tweet the US president posted attacking ""Fake News"" and explaining his idiosyncratic use of capital letters. Mr Trump wrote: ""After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!"" In a series of tweets, Rowling wrote ""pour"" (again followed by lots of laughter), before mocking his claim to have ""written many best-selling books"", suggesting Mr Trump may use a ghostwriter. A biographer of the president, Tim O'Brien, quickly backed up her theory, tweeting: ""President Trump didn't write any of his books. Ghostwriters on all of them."" Rowling also found Mr Trump's evident pride over his writing ability very amusing, tweeting: ""*wipes eyes, tries to control breathing* Seriously, @realDonaldTrump is the Gratest Writer on earth."" pore Shortly after, Mr Trump's original tweet was deleted, and replaced with a corrected version which used the correct spelling of ""pore"".

Chat show host Jimmy Kimmel and Guardians Of The Galaxy director James Gunn were also quick to flag the president's error. Is it a secret message? An acronym? Or just a typo? Donald Trump's use of the word ""covfefe"" leaves people scratching their heads. It is not the first time Mr Trump has been publicly outed for his Twitter typos. In December 2016, he tweeted about the ""unpresidented"" act of China capturing a US Navy research drone.

The PMI estimate tallies with suggestions from economists that the slowdown during January to March was largely a blip. Then, disruption from bad weather hitting construction and a post-Christmas spending hangover for consumers combined, damaging sentiment and resulting in a crisis for many retailers who were already battling strong cost headwinds. However, the IHS Markit/CIPS services PMI for June showed the fastest growth for the dominant sector since October last year - with the rate of new business jumping at its best pace for more than a year despite uncertainty over Brexit. The surveys for construction and manufacturing earlier in the week had remained muted. The pound climbed above $1.32 after the data was released on optimism it would bolster the case for a rise in interest rates. The Bank of England voted in May to leave rates at 0.5% - citing the slowdown in growth - but support for a hike surged in June with a surprise 6-3 split in favour of no change. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ""Stronger growth of service sector activity adds to signs that the economy rebounded in the second quarter and opens the door for an August rate hike, especially when viewed alongside the news that inflationary pressures spiked higher."" He added: """"It remains encouraging yet also surprising that current business activity continues to show such resilience amid relatively moribund confidence regarding the year ahead outlook. ""The survey once again highlights how the business outlook remains clouded by widespread concerns about the impact of Brexit uncertainty in particular. ""Such a divergence between current and expected future activity stokes worries that the upturn is being fueled by short-term spending, based on hopes that uncertainty will lift, and likely masks a lack of longer-term business investment."""
2018-07-04,"A senior firefighter who arrived at the Grenfell Tower blaze an hour after it started has said he knew as soon as he arrived they needed to ""get people out"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-firefighter-pleaded-with-bosses-to-abandon-stay-put-policy-11425336,"Station manager Daniel Egan told the Grenfell Tower inquiry he had several conversations with more senior staff about the need to change the ""stay-put"" advice, but did not have the authority to alter it himself. The senior fire safety officer described how he heard several thuds after arriving in the area of the tower, which according to the official log was just before 2am. The stay-put advice was not abandoned until 2.47am and firefighters were not able to reach many of the floors until even later. In his written statement to the inquiry, Mr Egan said he made his way towards the fire, stopping at a car where a firefighter was collating information. ""It was horrendous - I could hear shouting and screaming,"" he said. ""I looked at the firefighters... they seemed to be in awe of what they were seeing, but they knew what they had to do. ""As I was standing by the car bonnet I heard a loud thud - it was right near me. I was told people were jumping from the tower. I knew they weren't going to be alive. ""I could hear that people were so scared and crying for help - I couldn't look. I didn't [wish] to see anyone fall, although I knew it was going to happen. I was thinking 'just get out'."" Inside the tower, firefighters were lined up ""like Roman centurions waiting to be deployed"" but Mr Egan said he was unable to get any further so went back to the command unit where he passed on the information he had obtained. It was there that he suggested to the next most senior firefighter on the ground that the ""stay-put"" advice should be changed, he said. His written statement continued: ""I said the advice was still to 'stay put', but I said we needed to get the residents out... The control room giving the advice couldn't see the fire. ""People can be frightened to step outside of policy but at the end of the day we had to save lives and it was my personal opinion we had to get people out. ""I was not in a position to overrule the stay-put advice but I told GM (group manager) Tom Goodall, the fire survival lead, that I thought we should tell people on the phone to get out if they could."" Mr Egan said the same to group manager Richard Welch - then incident commander - and was told: ""We are doing it."" But he said he was informed by others that they ""weren't flooding the tower with firefighters"". After a short while, they decided to evacuate the children and disabled occupants, prioritising those below the seventh floor, and he watched as four people were escorted clear from the building. As he was working to find out which flats were most in need, a firefighter outside the unit had been speaking on a phone to a woman trapped inside. Mr Egan added: ""He said, 'she needs you to get her out'. I said, 'what flat number is she?'... I looked at the board and saw that this already had a P by it, which meant priority. I knew that I had passed on that information ages ago and it had been marked up to show BA (breathing apparatus) sent... But the lady on the phone was still in the flat. ""The crew manager said, 'she just wants to die'. Her boyfriend was 10 yards behind me just staring up at the flat. The woman had said that one of her children was dead and the other was dying. She said she just wanted to die. ""I asked the crew manager, 'can she not get out?' He told me that the phone had gone quiet."" Mr Egan said he went on to speak to another man who he told to get out, regardless of the official advice to stay put coming from the call handlers. ""My view was we should commit crews to every floor - we needed to flood the building with firefighters. I passed my thoughts up the chain of command. It was very frustrating,"" he said. By 4.25am, Mr Egan said he realised the firefighters had only reached the 11th floor and that everyone who he had received information about on the floors above had not got out. Mr Egan, who joined the fire service in 1992, said: ""It was a horrible feeling."" In his written testimony, it also emerged the police and some members of the fire service were using different systems to work out which floor was which. Later, after his statement had been read out, Mr Egan was questioned about why he had asked for the stay-put advice to be abandoned. ""In my opinion, in my experience, through all the years, is that they would have been better off out,"" he said. Before Mr Egan gave evidence, a firefighter who arrived first at Grenfell Tower's upper floors, Justin O'Beirne, told the inquiry it should have been ""obvious"" from the ground that smoke was entering multiple flats. He wrote in his written statement that a fire hose propping open a stairwell door on the fourth floor of the tower was making conditions in the stairwell ""noticeably"" worse."
2018-07-04,"A draft report by the Electoral Commission (EC) has found that the official campaign to leave the EU breached electoral rules during the referendum, according to the former Chief Executive of Vote Leave.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/vote-leave-broke-campaign-spending-rules-says-electoral-commission-11425636,"Matthew Elliott has told Sky News that Vote Leave faces a possible fine over allegations that they overspent during the EU referendum campaign in 2016. But Mr Elliot accuses the EC of a ""huge breach of natural justice"" by only listening to ""the fantasists"" without interviewing the directors of Vote Leave for their side of the story. He also says that a Leave campaign whistleblower who has given evidence to the commission was ""completely lying"" and was motivated by the desire for a second referendum. In an interview with Sky News Mr Elliott said of the EC: ""Their initial conclusion is that we have overspent, that a donation we made to another group during the course of the campaign was incorrect, we shouldn't have made that donation."" But he says the EC has refused to engage or consider evidence that Vote Leave has produced. He said: ""They've listened to these, quite frankly marginal characters who came out in March, and listened to their stories, but haven't had evidence from Vote Leave side of things. ""I think it is a huge breach of natural justice that they haven't wanted to listen to our opinions and our story and we were the people running the campaign. ""We are the people who could give them the facts, rather than basing all their opinion on the fantasists."" His remarks follow allegations from three whistleblowers. Former Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, web designer Mark Gettleson and Christopher Wylie, who worked for controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica, have claimed that Vote Leave used a youth campaign to get round spending limits. But Mr Elliott says: ""One of them wasn't even in the country during the campaign, one was a minor contractor for a few weeks at the beginning of the campaign and one was barely involved in the campaign. ""The key thing is to understand the motivation of the so called whistleblowers and all three of them who came forward to the commission want to have a second referendum."" The allegations centre around a 23-year-old fashion student called Darren Grimes. He was given Â£625,000 by Vote Leave for his youth-focused out campaign BeLeave. But activist Shahmir Sanni says this was done to keep Vote Leave under the EC Â£7m spending limit, and the youth group was simply a proxy of Vote Leave itself. Shahmir Sanni alleges that the cash went directly to Vote Leave's preferred data marketing company Aggregate IQ - and it remained under Vote Leave control. This would be in breach of EC rules. Mr Elliott says: ""He (Mr Sanni) was completely lying about that. Absolutely 100%. What we did with that donation was within the rules and the Electoral Commission told us we could do that. Everything we did was within the rules. ""They haven't found a smoking gun. If they (the EC) follow due process, if they are fair, they will find us innocent."" Mr Elliott denies suggestions that Darren Grimes worked out of the same office as Vote Leave. He says allegations of cooperation between the campaigns over a messaging service called a ""slack channel"" were inaccurate and ""had nothing to do with vote leave infrastructure"". Mr Elliott admits the donation made in the last days of the referendum campaign would help Mr Grimes ""amplify his message more"". But insists there was no collusion or coordination. The Vote Leave chief executive does admit that the donation was paid directly to data marketing company Aggregate IQ. But he insists Darren Grimes asked him to do that, and the marketing company only reported back on how it was spent to Mr Grimes, not to Vote Leave. Solicitor Tamsin Allen of Bindmans LLP, who represents the whistleblowers, told Sky News: ""In March this year we submitted to the Electoral Commission 3 lever arch files of evidence, and a 50 page legal opinion prepared by senior QCs at Matrix Chambers. ""This strongly suggested that criminal offences were committed by members of Vote Leave and Beleave during the Referendum campaign. Having carefully reviewed this evidence, and further evidence which has subsequently emerged, it now seems the Electoral Commission has indeed found them guilty of these criminal offences in its initial report. ""Vote Leave may not like this conclusion, but there is clearly a proper evidential basis for it. The commission should be permitted to complete its work and we await the release of its final report."" On Tuesday, Vote Leave submitted its rebuttal submission to the EC. A spokesperson for the EC, said: ""The Commission has concluded its investigation and having reached initial findings provided Vote Leave with a 28 day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July. ""The unusual step taken by Vote Leave in sharing its views on to the Electoral Commission's initial findings does not affect the process set out in law. ""The commission will give due consideration to the representations made to the commission, including those made by other campaigners under investigation. ""We will then, at the earliest opportunity, publish a thorough and detailed closing report in order to provide a full and balanced account to the public and to Parliament."""

Alesha MacPhail was reported missing from her home in Rothesay by her grandmother at 6.25 on Monday morning. Within three hours, her body was discovered by police in the grounds of an abandoned hotel. Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston said that ""a large amount of forensic examinations are being conducted"" in the woodland area where the child's body was found. At a news conference announcing the investigation he said he wants to speak to people who took part in the search for Alesha after she was reported missing and that officers are carrying out house-to-house inquiries. Chief Superintendent Hazel Hendren said extra officers have been brought in to help the investigation, to conduct 24-hour high-visibility patrols and to support the community in Rothesay. She said: ""Incidents such as this are extremely rare but we are still in the early stages of this investigation and we would ask people to be vigilant about their children and also their household security."" Questioned about this, Chief Supt Hendren repeated: ""It is very important that people are vigilant and look after each other."" Det Supt Houston said: ""Alesha's family is utterly devastated and we are continuing to provide them with the support they require at this incredibly distressing time. ""Alesha has lots of friends who will no doubt find it difficult to comprehend why they will never see their friend again."" Earlier, he said that the ""tight-knit community"" was in shock, adding: ""It is imperative that we find out what has happened."" He went on: ""If anyone has any information, please contact police with that information. You might think it is insignificant, however, please let us be the judge of that, and contact us immediately."" Photos of Alesha have been shared on Facebook and flowers have been laid near her home. :: Anyone with information is asked to contact police via 101, quoting incident number 0695, or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2018-07-04,"If the NHS is to survive, how should it be funded?Â ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/how-should-the-nhs-be-funded-to-ensure-its-survival-11425637,"That will be the question tonight, when on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the NHS, Sky News hosts a live debate about the system's future from Guy's Hospital in central London. Sean Worth, a former health adviser to David Cameron when he was prime minister, and Sonia Sodha, a policy adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader, will present two different arguments for how the NHS should be funded. We give you an outline of the case each of them will make during tonight's debate. ""The NHS is under unbearable pressure, with staffing shortages, financial deficits and over 2,000 operations cancelled every week.""The service is doing a great job, but is constantly pressured to do more for an ever-growing and ageing population. ""We can keep pouring more money in, but it will never be enough.""The big change we need is to allow more outside experts in to deliver more NHS services, including from the private sector. ""There is so much extra capacity, innovation and amazing technology there, but only 7% of NHS services are delivered through outside organisations.""The trade unions' rage against the private sector delivering NHS services is preposterous - especially as many of their senior NHS members are moonlighting for private firms on the side. ""It should be the service we care about, not who delivers it.""I want to see the NHS kept free for everyone, but the money we pay it should be allowed to be spent on expanding choice and value from different providers.""Polling shows people want this change too - especially the poorest who tend to have least choice in the current system.""We can't let fat cats in the trade union establishment block the change the NHS needs: we must open it up to private providers."" ""On its 70th birthday, the NHS faces two big existential challenges. ""Firstly the increasingly long-term and lifestyle-related nature of the conditions it has to treat, and secondly the costs of an ageing population - it costs five times as much to treat someone aged 80 as someone aged 30. ""Anti-statists use these challenges as grist for their privatisation mill, claiming rising cost pressures mean we can't afford the NHS. ""But what they fail to acknowledge is that these cost pressures aren't unique to the NHS. ""All ageing societies that eat and drink too much are struggling with the same questions. ""The answer isn't structural reform or overhauling the principles of the NHS. ""The free-at-the-point of need principle is sound, massively popular, and makes the NHS more, not less, efficient. ""Switching to a social or private insurance system would bring extra costs - just look at the US. ""But there are big challenges in how we transform from a service that's about fixing the sick to helping us live more healthily, and how we choose to respond to older people's care. ""Inaction is not an option with financial resources already constrained. ""The NHS is lagging behind internationally on how it treats several common causes of death including cancer. ""Longer lifespans are an amazing scientific achievement, but they come with a price tag. ""If we're not prepared to pay it, we'll undermine the universal basis of the NHS."" Their arguments will be assessed by a panel of Sir David Nicholson, who was chief executive of the NHS - and then NHS England - until 2016; Dr Sarah Wollaston MP, chair of the commons health select committee; Lord Darzi, Labour peer, former Health Minister and one of the world's leading surgeons; and Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs. At the end of the debate the audience will use real-time voting technology to decide who has presented the more compelling case for the funding of the NHS. :: You can watch the special hour-long live debate presented bt Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News."
2018-07-04,"An influential retail expert says it is time to accept there is too much retail space in the UK and town and city centres must be ""re-fashioned"" into community spaces.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/re-fashion-high-streets-if-they-are-to-survive-grimsey-11425380,"Bill Grimsey, former chief executive of Wickes, Iceland and Booker, came to the conclusion in his latest independent review of the high street. According to the Grimsey Review, bricks-and-mortar retailing can no longer be the anchor for thriving high streets, which must become community hubs that include housing, offices and some shops. The report added that town centres needed to be ""repopulated and re-fashioned"" with libraries and public spaces at the heart of each community. The review is the second in five years from a team led by the former retail boss. It comes as the British high street suffers from a wave of closures and restructurings from major brands including Toys R Us and Maplin amid an ongoing shift to online shopping. The report concluded that greater devolution and stronger local leadership was needed to give high streets a renewed sense of purpose and identity. Its 25 recommendations, which included calls to replace business rates, the creation of a Town Centre Commission to develop a 20-year strategy for local high streets and the acceleration of digital transformation in smaller towns. The review also suggested the appointment of ""high-quality"" designers to celebrate the historic character and local identity of town centres, the availability of up to 30 minutes of high street free parking with no option extend by paying, as well as improved street lighting and free public wi-fi. Mr Grimsey said there had been some progress since his 2013 review ""but not nearly enough"". He said: ""The first six months of 2018 have seen the highest rate of retail closures, administrations and company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) for more than a decade and there is no sign of a slowdown. ""Our cities, towns and communities are facing their greatest challenge in history, which is how to remain relevant, and economically and socially viable in the 21st century. ""Towns must stop trying to compete with out-of-town shopping parks that are convenient and with free parking. ""They must create their own unique reason for communities to gather there - being interesting and engaging and altogether a compelling and great experience."" Local Government Association economy spokesman Martin Tett said: ""Many councils throughout the country are already leading the way in transforming the future potential of their town centres in the face of unprecedented changes in shopping habits and the retail landscape. ""We are pleased that the report backs our calls for councils to have more powers and flexibility, particularly in relation to planning, to help shape and deliver vibrant town centres. ""The LGA stands ready to work with the government, councils and other stakeholders to help secure a prosperous long-term future for our high streets and town and city centres."" In March Mr Grimsey told Sky News that the current high street turmoil, along with business rate changes and Brexit, made this ""the perfect time"" to see which recommendations in his previous report were implemented, and which worked."
2018-07-04,The 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded Thailand cave are set to be rescued in stages.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/thailand-cave-rescue-trapped-boys-to-be-rescued-in-stages-depending-on-their-health-11425753,"The group may be brought out at different times, depending on the health of each person, a Thai official said. ""All 13 may not come out at the same time. If the condition is right and if that person is ready 100%, he can come out,"" said Narongsak Osatanakorn, the Chiang Rai provincial governor. Mr Osatanakorn said the group are still recuperating and a daily evaluation is being made of their fitness. There will be no evacuation if there is any risk, he said. Seal commander Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew said there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they are safe where they are. However, some officials fear that forecasted heavy rains this weekend could force them to bring the boys out earlier. The current water level in the cave means the boys, who cannot swim, will need to dive more than 1.2 miles to get out. :: Meet the British hero divers who found the missing boys Rescue experts have said this would be extremely dangerous as the route is complicated even for experienced divers. Mr Osatanakorn confirmed that the boys have been practising wearing diving masks and breathing, but he doesn't believe they have attempted any dives. Meanwhile, authorities are still exploring other options, such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from it. Another option still being considered is to provide the group with four months of supplies to enable them to wait until the water subsides. Offering a glimmer of hope for the families of the trapped boys, Mr Osatanakorn said that a new cave, suspected to be connected to the complex the group are situated in, has been discovered. Additionally, two main routes of water flowing into the cave have been identified and blocked. A spokesperson for the British Cave Rescue Council, which has members taking part in the operation, has advised that ""although water levels have dropped, the diving conditions remain difficult and any attempt to dive the boys and their coach out will not be taken lightly because there are significant technical challenges and risks to consider."" :: How the trapped Thai boys were found The group are being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy Seals, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. Some of the boys have been treated for minor cuts on their feet and legs. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks. A new video of the football team, who have been stranded in a cave for 12 days, emerged on Tuesday night. The 12 boys and their coach, who were without food for 10 days, are seen in the footage sitting with Thai navy Seals in the dark cave with their emaciated faces illuminated by a flashlight. The boys, some wrapped in foil blankets, introduce themselves and say they are healthy. They appear to be in good spirits, with several of the boys smiling as they interact with the navy Seals. In an effort to ease communication issues, Thai authorities are working with navy Seals to run a fiberoptic internet line into the cave. Once the cable is installed, it is thought phone calls to the cave will be possible. One attempt to bring the cables in was attempted on Tuesday, but the equipment was damaged by the water. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a football game on 23 June. It has been suggested they were taking part in an initiation of sorts. The team were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave and were found by British rescue divers late on Monday night."

The trains will be used for phase 1 of the Â£55.7bn high-speed (HS2) railway, which will link London and Birmingham from December 2026. They will also serve destinations on conventional lines beyond the core HS2 network, including York, Newcastle, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Manufacturing would be expected to be split between Canadian firm Bombardier's plant in Derby and Hitachi's factory in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. The firms, which also have maintenance facilities across Britain, employ more than 5,000 people in the country. Bombardier and Hitachi described themselves as a ""tried and tested high-speed team"", having already built a high-speed train for Italy. Hitachi managing director Karen Boswell said the firms will ""draw on a huge wealth of UK experience"". She added: ""Our aim is to deliver a new British icon that will be recognised around the world - a Spitfire for the British railway."" Richard Hunter, Bombardier's UK managing director said: ""We will combine both companies' global high-speed expertise with unrivalled British experience, and help generate skills and prosperity across a number of UK regions."" The formal tendering process is due to start later this year, with the winner announced in late 2019. Four other bidders have also been shortlisted - Alstom Transport, Patentes Talgo, Siemens and CAF. CAF's bid failed to make the shortlist announced in November last year, but an HS2 Ltd spokesman said it has been added ""to ensure a robust competition"" following the decision by Bombardier and Hitachi to form a partnership. The award of UK train-building contracts to foreign firms with overseas manufacturing plants has been criticised in recent years. In 2011, Germany-based Siemens was handed a Â£1.6bn deal to build trains for London's Thameslink, and in 2016 Spanish company CAF won a Â£490m contract to manufacture trains for Arriva Rail North. Alstom opened a train technology and manufacturing facility in Widnes, Cheshire, in June last year, while CAF will open a train factory in Newport, Wales, this autumn. Another Spanish manufacturer, Talgo, is planning to build a factory in the UK and has visited potential locations in Leeds and Liverpool."
2018-07-04,Jeremy Corbyn has backed Labour's call for the whole of the UK to be given an extra bank holiday should England win the World Cup.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180704151558/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-bank-holiday-if-england-win-world-cup-in-russia-11426106,"On Tuesday night, England overcame Colombia in a tense penalty shoot-out to reach the quarter-finals, which Downing Street revealed Prime Minister Theresa May found too ""nerve-wracking"" to watch. Speaking after Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said the Labour leader had watched the shoot-out. The call for a bank holiday if the Three Lions win their first World Cup since 1966 was first made by shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry at the beginning of the tournament. Mr Corbyn backs the call, his spokesman said. ""We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but I think it is the case that Jeremy believes that if England were to win the World Cup there should be a public bank holiday in celebration,"" he said. ""The World Cup is a very special international competition. ""It's something that brings people together on a very large scale and we need recognition of that and recognition of the importance of football in the country."" Labour is already proposing four new UK bank holidays, on St David's Day (1 March), St Patrick's Day (17 March), St George's Day (23 April) and St Andrew's Day (30 November). In contrast to Mr Corbyn, Mrs May - known to have more of an interest in cricket than football - was revealed to have found Tuesday night's penalty shoot-out too tense to watch. A Downing Street source said: ""She actually said earlier she struggles to watch penalties because it's a nerve-wracking time."" Number 10 also repeated its position that Mrs May or no other minister will attend the tournament in Russia, even if England continue to progress - a boycott made in the wake of the poisoning in March of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. Huge congratulations to @England. Keep the flag flying for us... #WorldCup2018 pic.twitter.com/SBuwPbhGbi The government faced scrutiny over the World Cup boycott when it emerged the UK ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, attended the Colombia match. Number 10 was reported to have said it wasn't a breach because the boycott only technically applies to ministers and royals. The spokesman for Mr Corbyn said Labour has not imposed a similar ban on shadow ministers, although he declined to say how the Labour leader himself would respond if invited to see England play in the final. Earlier, during PMQs, Mrs May hailed England for their ""very rare and welcome"" penalty shootout win, as she urged the team to ""keep that flag flying"" over 10 Downing Street following her promise to raise the flag of St George during the tournament. She said: ""The country witnessed a very rare and welcome event last night: The England football team winning a penalty shoot-out. ""I think the explosion of relief and most of all joy could be felt up and down the country - not just in the smoking room in the House of Commons."" Conservative MP Rachel Maclean later asked Mrs May: ""After last night I'm sure there's one question I don't need to ask the prime minister, which is does she believe that football is coming home?"""

""We had total belief in what we were doing, right through to the end. Even when our first penalty was saved, I've seen enough shootouts where the first penalty missed isn't the key one."" Southgate, who missed the deciding penalty in England's Euro 96 semi-final defeat to Germany, said the victory proves the value of preparation.

2018-07-05,England fans confident of the team's continuing success have been offered a lifeline if they want to see the Sweden match in person.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/world-cup-2018-how-to-get-to-russia-to-watch-england-v-sweden-11426418,"After beating Colombia on Tuesday, England play their quarter-final on Saturday at 3pm (6pm local time). Initial fears over fan safety and a poor display by the team may have put some fans off - but as optimism builds, some England fans are looking to book last-minute flights to watch the game in the Russian city of Samara. Flight booking website Kiwi.com has recorded an 83% increase in bookings from England to Russia since the tournament started in June, compared to the period between England confirming their place in the finals last October to the end of May. Since June, Kiwi.com report a 74% rise in bookings from London to Russia, a 206% increase in bookings from Leeds to Russia and 99% increase from Manchester to Russia. The Association of British Travel Agents reports ""a significant growth in interest for the World Cup over the last few days"". A spokesperson said: ""The warm welcome from the Russian people, efficiency of the organisation and England's success on the field has convinced fans that Russia is the place to be."" With a narrow time frame before the game kicks off, fans will be pleased to know there is still time to hop on a flight to Russia's ninth biggest city - if your pockets are deep enough. The first thing you need to do is get a visa sorted. To make travelling to Russia for the World Cup easier, organisers have arranged for a special pass called a Fan ID. This pass acts as an entry and exit visa to Russia, enabling holders to travel to the country until 15 July. Visitors must leave by 25 July. To order one you must hold a match ticket, even if you don't actually intend on attending the game. The UK Foreign Office told Sky News that the process of applying for a Fan ID once a match ticket has been purchased is quick and an electronic version is suitable to travel on. A physical version can be picked up in Russia. Travellers also must have a passport valid for the duration of their trip. The Foreign Office website advises that if travelling on a British passport issued since January 2017, it must be signed with a black pen before anyone travels as some British nationals who haven't signed theirs have been denied entry into Russia. But the whole package is unlikely to be cheap. Some websites were claiming to offer tickets to the match in Samara, but the conditions varied enormously, with some only available to purchasers outside the UK and most going for several hundred pounds. I've got my documents, how do I get there? One of the fastest options for those coming from London is to take the Thursday 6.05pm flight (UK time) from Heathrow. With a connection in Helsinki, you'll land in Samara's most convenient airport, Kurumoch, at 3.15am (local time). The flight, which lasts just over six hours, will set you back around Â£665. A cheaper option, at around Â£460, is to fly from Gatwick at 10.35am (UK time), wait almost four hours in Istanbul before landing in Samara at 12.45am (local time). If you're flying from Manchester, a quick option is to catch the 5.50pm from Manchester airport where you'll connect up with those flying from London to take the plane from Helsinki to Samara which lands at 3.15am (local time). It'll set you back around Â£665. I don't want to fly, how else can I get there? Sorry, you've left it too late. The drive from London takes an estimated 46 hours and needs you to cover almost 2,500 miles (4,000km). This means to get there in time for the game, you would have needed to leave Thursday morning and drive constantly without stopping. What if I want to be situated in Moscow? The distance between Moscow and Samara is around 650 miles (1,050km) with an approximate travel time of 75 minutes by plane or 15 hours by train. The Samara Arena is nine miles (15km) from the city centre. Kurumoch airport is less than an hour's drive from the town centre. Will there be anywhere for me to stay? Samara is Russia's ninth biggest city and is situated on the banks of the Volga River. It's the centre for Russia's aerospace industry, and has a population of more than one million people. However, the tourism sector is less developed than in other host cities, and as such there are limited accommodation options so it is advised to book somewhere before you arrive. Do I need to speak Russian to get around? The fan zones are equipped to deal with English speakers. A few phrases which may prove useful to know are: One - ""adin"" Two - ""dva"" Three - ""tri"" Thank you - ""spasiba"" Hello - ""zdrastvuite"" Bye - ""da svidania"" Please - ""pazhalusta"" What is your name? - ""kak vas zovut?"" My name isâ¦ - ""menya zovutâ¦"" Entrance/exit - ""vkhod/vykhod"" Please help me - ""pazhalusta pomogite mne"" Bus - ""avtobus"" Train - ""poezd"" Metro - ""metro"" Police - ""politsiya"" I don't speak Russian - ""Ya ne gavaryu pa-russki"" Do you speak English? - ""vy gavarite pa-angliyski?"" What is your Wi-Fi password? - ""kakoy u vas parol ot vay-fai?"""

In fact, the hot weather is set to stay for most of July - with forecasters expecting very little rain following a dry June. But he balmy weather could be harmful to people vulnerable to extreme conditions, such as the elderly, young children and those with heart or lung conditions. There has been an increase in the number of patients at GP surgeries and calls to NHS 111 for heat-related conditions such as sunstroke, heatstroke and insect bites over the last two weeks. Dr Thomas Waite, of PHE, said: ""While many of us will be enjoying the hot weather over the next few days, for some it can pose a real health risk. ""So it is critically important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk."" ""We will see a long spell of fine, dry, sunny weather,"" Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said. The heat is being caused by an area of high pressure, he said, adding: ""That has created an area of clear air above the UK, cloud is suppressed and winds have been low and that has allowed maximum heat to come through from the sun. ""It's homegrown warmth."""
2018-07-05,EDF Energy has announced a second increase to its standard tariffs this year - blaming a surge in the cost of wholesale energy. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/edf-energy-raises-bills-for-second-time-in-2018-11426757,"The company - one of the so-called ""big six"" suppliers - said dual fuel customers on the default tariff would pay 6% extra from 31 August, taking the average annual bill to Â£1,228. That is a rise of Â£70. Electricity and gas customers would need to find an extra 6.1% and 6% respectively, EDF added. The firm had already raised their bills last month but said on Thursday that it had endured a 13% increase in wholesale costs since April, driven partly by high demand during the Beast from the East winter storms, It also cited rising prices this year as the cost of raw energy, in the form of oil and gas, has shot up. Industry price increases have coincided with government plans for a price cap starting this winter on default tariffs - usually a standard variable tariff (SVT) mostly paid by households which do not switch suppliers for better fixed rate deals. SVTs have been condemned by the prime minister as a ""rip-off"" but firms using them argue they reflect not only market forces but also the growing cost of government energy initiatives. EDF's managing director of customers, Beatrice Bigois, said: ""We know that another price rise will not be welcome, and we had hoped that our limited changes announced in April would be enough. ""However, energy costs have continued to rise significantly and, despite our best efforts to absorb some of these by reducing the costs within our control, sadly we can no longer sustain this. ""Customers who wish to avoid this increase will be encouraged to choose one of our fixed price tariffs when we write to them later this month."" Kevin Pratt, consumer affairs expert at MoneySuperMarket, condemned the increase. He said: ""Wholesale costs have been increasing but this is the second price rise from EDF in less than three months and pushes their standard variable tariff right to the top in terms of most expensive - at Â£1,228, just a fraction cheaper thannpower. ""The previous rise, announced in April and effective from June 7, was relatively small compared to the other big six suppliers, but it was still a rise and by announcing another one today they are hitting customers when they'realready down."""
2018-07-05,Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are fighting for their lives in hospital after being exposed to the nerve agent novichok.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/amesbury-poisoning-heres-what-we-know-about-the-novichok-victims-11427471,"The couple are critically ill after becoming unwell in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday, having spent the evening before in nearby Salisbury - where former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the same substance back in March. Public Health England has urged people in both towns not to touch any ""unknown objects"", as police seek to identify the source of the contamination - which is known to have entered the victims' bodies via their hands. :: Victims poisoned at site unconnected to Skripals:: Amesbury pair exposed to novichok nerve agent, police confirm According to a former detective inspector who worked on the Alexander Litvinenko case, officers will be working to gain as much intelligence and knowledge of the movements and lifestyle of the victims as possible. Brian Tarpey told Sky News: ""The police officers will start with what they know last about this couple and where they were last seen - their last whereabouts. ""They have got to look at all aspects of their lifestyle, of their movements, who they may have been in contact with. And this goes to the heart of this investigation, which is public safety."" With that in mind, what do we know so far about the lives and movements of Ms Sturgess, 44, and Mr Rowley, 45, that could prove significant to the police operation? :: Javid accuses Russia of using Britain as 'dumping ground for poison':: Amesbury poisoning: This is where police are investigating :: Their movements During their trip to Salisbury on Friday, the pair visited a number of shops during the afternoon and evening with their friend Sam Hobson. The following day, Ms Sturgess admitted herself to hospital at 11am. Mr Hobson, 29, and Mr Rowley went on to visit a number of places in the town centre. One of their destinations was a Boots chemist, which has since been closed by police. The pair went to a free hog roast at a local baptist church before returning to Mr Rowley's home in Muggleton Road, where he descended into a ""zombie-like state"" and began to foam at the mouth. Mr Hobson called for an ambulance and his friend was taken to Salisbury District Hospital - the same place the Skripals were treated for weeks before their miraculous recovery. :: Who is Charlie Rowley? Mr Rowley is believed to have battled with drug use, including heroin. Another friend of his, who did not want to be identified, told Sky News he is ""a good guy"" with ""a heart of gold"". She said he was ""always there if I needed him"" and is ""a good person to have as a friend"" - and suggested he had likely been caught up in the contamination ""by accident"". ""I think they found a package that possibly looked like drugs and took them,"" said the friend, who last saw Mr Rowley outside a McDonald's last week. ""We're all pretty serious drug addicts and if they were withdrawing and it looked like heroin, they would have injected it straight away without a second thought."" She added that Mr Rowley had been unemployed throughout the time she knew him, which was about three years. :: Who is Dawn Sturgess? Like Mr Rowley, Ms Sturgess is also reported to have suffered from addiction problems - namely alcohol. Based on her social media posts, she has also struggled to hold down a home, having been served an eviction notice in the past. She was staying at a local homeless hostel - John Baker House - at the time of the poisoning. Mr Tarpey told Sky News the hostel would now be treated as a crime scene. ""Literally any item in the hostel - I'm sure they'll be able to narrow it down closer than that - is potentially the carrier of this latest contamination,"" he said. ""So the police will be approaching this with the greatest care and consideration for their own safety as well as the safety of the people who were living in there."" Salisbury City Council leader Matthew Dean has said Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were known to the authority and confirmed that they had ""been through a very difficult time in their personal lives"". ""They had their own demons and they were conquering them and they were well on the road to recovery,"" he said. ""So it's tremendously sad for the individuals concerned and we wish them a speedy recovery."" The mother-of-three has an 11-year-old daughter and two older sons, and her Facebook profile features a photo of her youngest cuddling a beaming Mr Rowley. :: What happens now? Mr Tarpey suggests police will also have to consider whether other people may have come into contact with the item, and then work to identify what it actually was. Officers will then work to find out where it came from, and whether there is any connection to the Skripal case."
2018-07-05,"A vegan burger that ""bleeds"" has been labelled an ""existential threat"" to New Zealand's beef industry by politicians.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/bleeding-vegan-burger-is-an-existential-threat-to-beef-industry-warns-new-zealand-mp-11426830,"Air New Zealand is serving the Impossible Burger, which is made from synthetic meat using wheat, coconut oil, potatoes and ""magic ingredient"" heme. Compared to cows, the vegan product uses 95% less land, less water and creates 87% less greenhouse gas emissions, according to the company's website. Facts, figures and busted myths - why going vegan is on the up. But MP Mark Patterson, of the ruling New Zealand First Party, said the national carrier's decision to serve the vegan burger was a ""slap in the face"" to the country's $6bn red meat sector. The burger could pose ""an existential threat to New Zealand's second biggest export earner"", he warned in a statement. Acting PM Winston Peters added that he was ""utterly opposed to fake beef"". â""Air New Zealand is an airline built by the New Zealand taxpayer, was privatised, was bailed out by the New Zealand taxpayer, and is there because of the taxpayer,"" Mr Peters said. ""Some of the taxpayers are the farming industry who want to ensure they get top end of the product market offshore and our airline should be its number one marketer."" Mr Peters has been running the country since 21 June while Prime Minister Jacinda Arden is on maternity leave. The plant-based burger, made by American company Impossible, is offered to business-class passengers on the airline's Los Angeles to Auckland route. Disappointing to see Air NZ promoting a GE substitute meat burger on its flights to the USA. We produce the most delicious steaks & lamb on the planet - GMO & hormone free. The national carrier should be pushing our premium products and helping sell NZ to the world. Airline New Zealand said it ""makes no apology for offering innovative product choices for its customers and will continue to do so in the future"". ""Indeed, the international media coverage over the past 24 hours positioning Air New Zealand as an innovative airline and, by association, New Zealand as a desirable place to visit has been invaluable,"" it added."
2018-07-05,Leading Brexiteers have met at the Foreign Office ahead of a crunch cabinet session at Chequers tomorrow.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/top-brexiteers-meet-ahead-of-crunch-cabinet-showdown-11427498,"Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Esther McVey, Penny Mordaunt, Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox met inside the building in Whitehall, with a cabinet source confirming there was ""a private meeting"". The meeting lasted about an hour, sources have told Sky News. Dr Fox then entered Downing Street and was been seen leaving around 8.15pm, shortly before the prime minister. Theresa May is due to preside over a meeting of cabinet ministers at her country estate tomorrow to thrash out which of the UK's preferred customs arrangements to seek from the EU in negotiations. Mr Davis has told Mrs May her plan to try and bring her warring cabinet together is ""unworkable"", according to a report. The Brexit secretary has reportedly written to the prime minister and set out his opposition to her so-called ""third way"" on customs. Mr Johnson is reported to have reacted angrily to attempts by some in the cabinet to get the government to adopt an approach which they say will preserve jobs linked to Europe, with the foreign secretary apparently saying: ""F*** business"". Sky's Faisal Islam says he had confirmation the meeting is taking place from a ministerial source. ""Certainly an odd look before a major cabinet meeting,"" the source told Sky's political editor. Islam said: ""Westminster is full of plot and intrigue tonight ahead of this Chequers meeting - a 12 hour meeting to try to thrash out a unified position. ""Others would argue that only this afternoon did ministers get this paper on a 'third-way' for customs - a facilitated customs agreement (is) the official name. ""Many of those Brexiteers will be really rather unhappy with the degree of alignment with EU rules for goods across that part of the economy - that's all to guarantee a frictionless border and a frictionless border in Ireland. ""They'll feel that that's giving too much away."" The International Trade Secretary refused to answer questions as he left No 10. A Downing Street source said Dr Fox had been to Downing Street ""for a chat"" and dismissed speculation he might resign. Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond - one of those who is expected to call for an arrangement that will protect jobs linked to EU trade - ignored questions about tomorrow's meeting as he left 11 Downing Street tonight. Chief Whip Julian Smith told reporters in Downing Street that ""the prime minister will have a great day"" tomorrow. According to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Davis told the PM that her ""third way"" would not work because it was merely a ""customs partnership"" - Mrs May's original preference - with some ""additional technological elements"". Mr Davis also voiced his fears the EU will reject the plan outright, claiming that even talking about it is a waste of time, the report added. It comes after Mrs May was warned on that the Tories will be ""toast"" if they fail to deliver on their Brexit promises. Mrs May has consistently said that any customs arrangement the government seeks will fulfil the Conservatives' manifesto commitments to leave the EU, including the customs union, the European Court of Justice and the single market."

Strict rules are in place for the flight from Parliament Square Gardens, with the balloon being tethered to the ground and restricted from floating higher than 30m (98ft). It will fly between 9.30am and 11.30am on Friday 13 July - coinciding with the president's visit to the UK and a ""Stop Trump"" march in central London. A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: ""The Mayor supports the right to peaceful protest and understands that this can take many different forms. ""His city operations team have met with the organisers and have given them permission to use Parliament Square Garden as a grounding point for the blimp."" Campaigners say the Met Police are in charge of local airspace on the day, have seen their plans and are currently happy for the flight to go ahead - but maintain a right of veto on the day. The group behind the stunt - who call themselves anti-fascist ""art activists"" - are now liaising with the Met and the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure airspace over London is managed safely on the day. Activist Leo Murray told Sky News: ""We didnât get off to the best start with the Mayorâs office over this, who originally told us that they didnât recognise Trump Baby as legitimate protest. ""But following a huge groundswell of public support for our plan, it looks like City Hall has rediscovered its sense of humour. Trump Baby will fly!â Mr Murray has described the balloon as an ""obscene mutant clone of the president"" and says it will ""hold up a huge mirror of truth"" to the world. Describing Mr Trump as a ""dangerous excuse for a president"", the group's spokesperson, Nona Hurkmans, said: âWe are just a small group of friends who set out to show that fascists are not welcome in the UK. ""We have been genuinely overwhelmed and touched by the incredible levels of support we have received for our project."" More than 10,000 people signed a petition calling on the mayor to ""let Trump Baby fly"", and the group has so far raised over Â£16,000 to cover the costs of the protest - more than three times its original target. Activists also hope to take ""Trump Baby"" on a world tour following the president's visit."
2018-07-05,Wiltshire has been rocked by a second novichok poisoning - months after the nerve agent was used in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/amesbury-poisoning-which-salisbury-nerve-agent-attack-sites-were-decontaminated-11426944,"Authorities are investigating the source of the novichok which poisoned Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, who were taken ill in their home in Amesbury on Saturday. The pair were reported to have spent time close to Salisbury city centre, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal collapsed after being attacked in March. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said on Thursday that all sites contaminated after the attempted murder were now safe, adding that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were likely exposed to novichok elsewhere. Nine locations were identified for decontamination following the poisoning of the Skripals - but not all of them have been returned to the owners or Wiltshire Council. :: Sergei Skripal's home The house in Salisbury is believed to be the location where the poisoning took place. The front door of the house was found to have the highest concentration of the nerve agent, which is believed to have been spread in a liquid form. The property remains a crime scene under police control. :: Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey's home Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey was one of the first responders to help the Skripals. He was then allowed to return to his home, but later taken to hospital with symptoms that indicated that he had been exposed to novichok. He was successfully treated and discharged on 22 March. His home has not yet been handed back to Wiltshire Council. :: The Mill pub Decontamination efforts continue at The Mill pub, which was first visited by the Skripals when they arrived to the city centre on 4 March. Around two hours later the symptoms of novichok poisoning started to be visible. :: Zizzi restaurant Zizzi in Salisbury is the last known place the Skripals visited before being found in a critical condition on a public bench, around 40 minutes after leaving the restaurant. It has not been handed back to the council. :: Ashley Wood recovery Sergei Skripal's car was removed from the garage, on Churchfields industrial estate, in March - taken away in a large military vehicle. The red BMW3 briefly became a focus of the investigation. The site has not yet been handed back to the owners. :: Salisbury and Amesbury ambulance stations The ambulance stations used in the response to the Skripal poisoning also had to be decontaminated. Amesbury's ambulance station was handed back on 19 June, while Salisbury's was handed back on 31 May. :: The Maltings The Skripals were found collapsed on a bench on the Maltings walkway, a major shopping street in Salisbury, on 4 March. After decontamination efforts, it was handed back to the council on 26 May. ""Following extensive clean-up operations in Salisbury to remove any potential residual contamination resulting from the nerve agent attack on 4 March, decontamination work is now complete at the Maltings,"" a Defra spokesperson said. After it was returned to Wiltshire Council, businesses in the area were re-opened in what the council said was a ""significant milestone marking that the recovery of Salisbury is well under way."" :: Bourne Hill The council and police offices at Bourne Hill were handed back to the council on 28 June. There was a concern the premises may have been contaminated by police officers and health workers who returned there after visiting other at-risk areas. During the decontamination process, staff and services were relocated elsewhere. The council made the most of the buildings being empty over the summer by doing some refurbishment work."

In a message recorded in an ambulance control room, Mr Stevens said: ""It's a time of celebration, looking back over seven decades when we're all living a lot longer and healthier, more than 10 years extra. #NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has today sent a message of âheartfelt thanksâ to staff on the health serviceâs 70th anniversary, saying that the NHSâs enduring success is down to their âbrillianceâ. #NHS70 pic.twitter.com/37CnqFtsAu ""We've seen amazing medical advances, whether its organ transplantations or new cures for cancer or vaccines. ""But the reason why the health service does so well is frankly due to the brilliance of the staff. ""So, although this is our birthday, today our ambulance crews, here in the ambulance control room where I'm standing, our community nurses, our midwives welcoming new babies into the world, people who are going to be visiting their GP today... ""Staff are going to be doing what they do day in day out. ""And it's frankly because of the staff of the health service that the nation has just re-committed to the idea of a health service, there when you need us based on how sick you are - not whether you can afford us, a principle that has stood the test of time. ""On that basis, we should use this moment to say a heartfelt thank you to the million-and-a-half staff of the National Health Service for everything you do for all of us and for our families, day in, day out."" The day will see celebrations around the country, including thousands of Big 7Tea events to thank staff and raise awareness of NHS charities. There will also be services at Westminster Abbey and York Minster to thank staff and patients. Ethel Armstrong, an 87-year-old former nurse cadet and radiographer - who was working in the NHS on its first day - will be running the @NHS Twitter account."
2018-07-05,"The poison used to target a former spy and his daughter is Russian-made nerve agent novichok, the PM has said. The chemicals are among the most deadly nerve agents ever created.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/salisbury-poison-was-russian-made-novichok-pm-confirms-11287491,":: Who made it? There are more than 100 formulations in the novichok family, all developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok is the Russian word for ""newcomer"". :: How did it get here? Andy Oppenheimer, a biological and chemical specialist, has told Sky News the chemical could have been brought into the UK through an airport. ""These things can evade detection if they are very small amounts and very well shielded, whether they are biological, chemical or a biological agent,"" he says. ""This chemical may have come through an airport, we really don't know yet."" :: How is it used? Novichok agents are dispersed as an ultra-fine powder rather than a gas or vapour. They can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. :: What are the symptoms? As with other nerve agents, the chemicals block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme active in the nervous system. The result is involuntary contraction of all muscles, leading to cardiac arrest and asphyxiation. :: Is washing clothing enough? Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, has said the ""immediate risk to the general public remains low"". She advised people who were in either The Mill pub or Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday March 4 to wash any clothing they were wearing, wipe personal items including phones or handbags with baby wipes and to wash hands thoroughly. Mr Oppenheimer says the advice was just a ""precaution"". He told Sky News: ""Unlike a conventional explosive device going off, it really has a kind of a spread, it will produce particular symptoms. ""I would have thought those symptoms would have emerged by now and all the advice is a precaution."" :: Is there an antidote? All nerve agents have an antidote in atropine, but it needs to be administered as soon as possible. The problem is it can take time to diagnose that a nerve agent has been used. :: Does it contravene international law? Novichok is ""highly illegal"", ""extremely powerful"" and created to avoid detection, says Mr Oppenheimer. Significantly, several of the novichok chemicals are so-called binary weapons - with two less-toxic precursor chemicals that can be mixed prior to use. This makes them safer to transport and handle. One of these is novichok-5, derived from the highly potent A-230 chemical. Its precursor chemicals are ordinary organophosphate pesticides and can be legally made at agricultural chemical manufacturers. According to Dr Vil Mirzayanov, who worked on the novichok programme in the Soviet Union until he fled to the US, the legitimate use of precursor chemicals was deliberate as it meant they were not placed on the controlled list of the Chemical Weapons Convention. :: Who could be behind it? Theresa May told the Commons her Government has concluded it is ""highly likely"" Russia is responsible for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The PM said the attack, using a ""military-grade"" nerve agent, fits a pattern of Russian aggression and said Russia's ambassador to the UK has been summoned to explain what happened. She said: ""We will not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has told the Russian ambassador that Moscow must ""immediately provide full and complete disclosure"" of its novichok nerve agent programme to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Moscow has been given until the end of Tuesday to respond, Mrs May said. If Russian involvement is proved, it will be considered an ""unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom"", she added. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in a critical condition more than a week after they were found slumped unconscious in Salisbury."

The Met Office also recorded the hottest June ever for Wales, where temperatures reached 33C (91.4F) in the coastal town of Porthmadog as the month drew to a close. Meanwhile, there have been some unprecedented conditions some 5,000 miles away in Oman. Residents in the small fishing village of Quriyat, on the northeast coast, had to endure temperatures of 42.6C (108.7F) for 51 hours straight last week. The unprecedented spell made for the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded anywhere in the world. While no records have fallen in Iraq, it has been so hot in parts of the country - including Baghdad - that some people have been allowed to take time off work. Records have also been tumbling in parts of Europe and the US. The capitals of Georgia and Armenia - Tbilisi and Yerevan - have soared to 40.5C (104.9F) and 42C (107.6F) respectively during the day this week. Across the Atlantic, The Washington Post reports that Denver in Colorado equalled its all-time highest temperature of 40.6C (105F) on 28 June. And the paper reported that on Monday this week, Mount Washington in New Hampshire and Burlington in Vermont both set their highest ever low temperatures - coming in at 15.6C (60F) and 26.7C (80F) respectively. On the same day in Montreal, Canada, the city recorded its highest temperature in 147 years - 36.6C (97.9F). More highs could well be set in other parts of the US and Canada in the coming days, with forecasters expecting temperatures to hit triple digits in California. Newshounds among you may be wondering why Scotland has been left out of this round-up so far. Earlier this week Sky News reported that the Met Office had provisionally recorded the country's highest ever temperature, with it having reached 33.2C (91.7F) in Motherwell on 28 June. That looked to have broken the previous record of 32.9C (91.2F), set in August 2003 at Greycrook in the borders. However, the Met Office has now uncovered evidence that a stationary vehicle with its engine running was parked too close to the observing station at the time. Although the measurement appears plausible given the conditions, the Met Office has said it ""cannot rule out the potential for contamination"" by this ""non-weather-related factor"" and so has decided to reject it. ""The spell of weather at the end of June and into July is without doubt a notable heatwave for the UK, and particularly for Scotland and Wales, with some very high temperatures on 28 June,"" read the Met Office blog. ""The rejection of the Motherwell observation for that day does not detract from that."" The UK is set to bask in fine weather until the end of July, with forecasters predicting very little rain and scorching sunshine throughout the month."

Hopefully he will eventually be back on duty."" A 27-year-old man has been arrested for domestic assault and serious offences relating to officers. It comes a day before a bill making it a criminal offence to attack a police animal gets another reading in parliament. No officers were physically hurt during the incident; however, a police dog was injured and is now recovering well. A 27-year-old man has been arrested and nobody else is being sought in connection with this incident. Known as ""Finn's Law"", named after police German shepherd Finn who was stabbed in the head and chest, the Service Animals Offences Bill has been backed by Michael Gove. Finn saved his handler PC Dave Wardell's life while they chased a robbery suspect in 2016. Criminal damage is currently the only available charge for someone who attacks a police or service animal, despite them being attacked frequently. PC Wardell, who has campaigned for the law to change, told Sky News: ""This tragic incident once again demonstrates the heroism and courage of our police dogs who put themselves in harm's way to protect the public and their handlers. ""Despite my best efforts I haven't been able to get Finn's Law in place prior to PD Axle being stabbed last night. This is something that deeply troubles me.

""A number of reports have been received from members of the public in Newdigate, Dorking, Horley and Charlwood, Surrey and from Crawley and Horsham, West Sussex,"" it said. ""Reports describe 'was outdoors close to a building and you could hear it creak', 'felt large impact then 2-3 seconds of shaking', 'felt much bigger than the last two recent quakes', 'it was like two huge explosions', 'my chairs at the table shook and the lights moved'."" We've posted details of this Morning's 3.1 event in surrey on our website- https://t.co/0kFnAwLOFV pic.twitter.com/pGwZlbEzw5 People at Gatwick Airport also reported feeling tremors. Matt Temple told Sky News: ""I was at work in our office at Gatwick Airport with four colleagues. We felt the building shake and a dull banging/thud noise. Just felt an earthquake at Gatwick Airport - felt whole building move and a dull banging noise. (11:53am) #earthquake #sussex ""From the sound we initially thought maybe a vehicle had crashed into the building or someone had dropped something heavy on the roof above us. But then we thought it was an earthquake as it felt strange and the building seemed to wobble and creak.

He told police he had bought the boat ""to pull women"" and that he had taken several girlfriends out on it. On the night of the crash, both Shepherd and Ms Brown had both been drinking. A jury at the Old Bailey has been told how Ms Brown was at the wheel and the boat was speeding when it collided with a log and tipped over near Wandsworth Bridge on the River Thames. Shepherd was found clinging to the bow and was rescued from the water just before midnight on December 8 2015. Ms Brown was later pulled out of the water but was ""unresponsive"", with her mouth full of water and red wine in her vomit, the court was told. Steven Morrissey, whose balcony overlooks the bridge, told the jury he heard a voice calling out after the crash. In a statement read to the court, he said: ""I could see the silhouette of a boat upturned. The boat's nose was underwater and part of the boat was protruding out of the water. ""My attention was taken away from the boat when I heard screaming. I had the feeling it was a young man. ""He kept saying, 'help me, help me, somebody help me'. It was just 'help me' - not 'us', or 'her'. ""I could see some people on the bank and lights where people were shouting, 'tell us where you are, we can't see you'. ""He just kept repeating, 'help me, help me'."" In his statement, Mr Morrissey said he could see search lights and torches along the bank, and later heard a policeman say ""they've got him"". He said he did not hear a female voice but he did see ""something in the water"". ""My first thought was it was a body,"" he said. ""I shouted at the police I had seen something."" Shepherd and Ms Brown had been drinking wine at The Shard before taking a bottle of champagne onto the boat. Neither was wearing a life jacket. In a statement read to the court, the accused said the boat was going ""full throttle"" at the time of the crash. RNLI helmsman Ian Owen described finding Shepherd in the water. He told the court that Shepherd did mention Ms Brown to him. ""He was anxious to stay with us to find the female. He was quite adamant in assisting us with searching,"" Mr Owen said. PC Liam Winter told jurors that Shepherd was ""confused"" and seemed ""quite intoxicated"". ""His words were slurred noticeably. He said, 'is she all right? Have you found her?""' Shepherd is on trial in his absence, with the judge warning jurors not to speculate about the reason nor to hold it against him. He denies manslaughter by gross negligence."

JLR exports 80% of its cars worth Â£18bn annually. Dr Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, said: ""We, and our partners in the supply chain, face an unpredictable future if the Brexit negotiations do not maintain free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market. ""We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees."" There are also a further 260,000 jobs connected to the company's supply chain. :: UKIP-fuelled emotion drives Gove to Peterhead for Brexit support Dr Speth added: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than Â£1.2bn profit each year. ""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. ""We have spent around Â£50bn in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further Â£80bn more in the next five. ""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome."" He was more specific on a potential exit from the UK in comments to the Financial Times when he said: ""If I'm forced to go out because we don't have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. ""This is hypothetical, and I hope it's an option we never have to go for."" His words follow similar warnings from BMW and Airbus. Airbus said in June that it was making plans to leave the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, which could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. BMW also weighed in - its customs manager Stephan Freismuth warning the company ""cannot"" manufacture its products in the UK if Brexit means its supply chain is disrupted. The intervention by big business in the Brexit debate has strained relations with the government ahead of Theresa May's meeting of cabinet ministers at Chequers on Friday to decide a strategy for exiting the EU. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has described, what he sees as, threats from firms as ""completely inappropriate"" while Boris Johnson, a leading Brexiteer on the top table of government, has not denied saying ""f*** business"". In his response to JLR's latest warning, the business secretary Greg Clark tweeted: ""JLR is a great British success story. We are determined to make sure that it can continue to prosper and to invest in Britain."" The PM has also insisted firms are being listened to. The British Retail Consortium became the latest to warn of the consequences of any cliff-edge Brexit in March 2019 by warning that consumers in the UK and EU food producers would lose out if there was no deal to allow the free movement of goods. Its chairman, Richard Pennycook, said: ""Frictionless trade is essential if the industry is to continue to provide the level of choice and value in shops that UK consumers are used to seeing. ""It is now of the utmost importance that the UK Government proposes a workable solution to the backstop that gets the withdrawal agreement over the line and allows for a smooth transition. ""We need the EU to be flexible and creative in negotiation and recognise what is at stake for exports to the UK."""

If the Amesbury poisoning turns out to be an accidental and delayed legacy of the original attack, as seems likely, she will not need to drum up the same show of allied support. But it serves a useful purpose for May and her allies nevertheless. Next week NATO meets for a summit as the alliance looks shakier than ever. :: Here's what we know about poisoning victims Donald Trump, who once called NATO obsolete, fell out spectacularly with his allies at the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada. If he does the same at NATO, the implications are more serious. Not least because he then meets Russian leader Vladimir Putin for an encounter promising to be far more cordial. A sinister reminder of the attempted murder blamed on Russia in an English cathedral town is more than timely. It will make it harder for Trump to do a Quebec next week. Harder though not out of the question. If he arrives in the UK from the NATO summit having scuppered carefully a planned demonstration of allied unity, it will make his visit here doubly uncomfortable for May in the current climate. She will be seen rolling out the red carpet for a president who seems determined to undermine the western alliance at every turn while cosying up to the man Britain believes launched a nerve agent attack on its streets. She will have one more reason to regret ever asking him."

The 18-year-old woman had been on a night out in southeast London before being asked to leave as she had had too much to drink. Naker had been outside the bar when he saw the victim and began talking to her. CCTV showed them chatting at around 4am. Naker appeared to show concern, picking the woman up when she fell and offering her his jacket. At one point he gave her a piggyback. He then tried to kiss her and she pushed him off. Naker repeatedly tried to pull her in the opposite direction to where she was walking and eventually succeeded, dragging her to a secluded corner of The Queen's Walk, London Bridge. Security staff working nearby became suspicious by activity on CCTV and went to investigate. Naker told them he had met the woman in a club nearby, gave them his details and left. The staff then found the woman unconscious on the ground with her underwear pulled down and called an ambulance. She was taken to hospital to recover and later to a sexual assault referral centre where it was determined she had been raped. Naker was arrested the following day. He claimed in the police interview that the victim had asked him for sex. Detective Constable Aidan Kersley said: ""Naker deliberately targeted his victim as someone intoxicated and vulnerable. ""After talking to her for a matter of minutes, he managed to drag her to a secluded area where he raped her. ""She has no memory of what happened. ""Naker then brazenly gave security guards his name, confident that the victim's intoxication would protect him. ""However, we were able to prove she had been raped and build a strong case against him - the simple fact was, she was too drunk to give her consent."" Naker was found not guilty of sexual assault by penetration."

Mr Fox said one of the reserve's anti-poaching dogs had alerted her handler that something was amiss. The handler heard a loud commotion coming from the lions but this is not uncommon, Mr Fox said. As it was still dark, they investigated after sunrise. Mr Fox said it was not clear exactly how many of the men there were, as there was ""not much left of them"". ""Clearly, the poachers had walked into a pride of six lions and some, if not all had been killed,"" he said. The reserve is still open to guests.

There is no evidence they had visited any of the sites in Salisbury that were decontaminated following the attempted murders of ex-KGB agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March. But it is understood one line of inquiry is whether Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley came into contact with a contaminated container, such as a phial or a syringe, that was discarded after being used to poison the Russians. CCTV footage has emerged of the pair buying alcohol more than 24 hours before they became seriously unwell. The couple, who are known drug users, spent Friday afternoon and evening in Salisbury and visited a number of shops. They are not thought to have been deliberately targeted. Police are said to be working to gain as much intelligence of the movements and lifestyle of the couple as possible Police were called to Mr Rowley's home in Muggleton Road, Amesbury, on Saturday when Ms Sturgess collapsed. They returned later that day when Mr Rowley also became ill. Officers have cordoned off the estate where his home is and have evacuated the hostel in Salisbury where she lived. It was initially believed they had possibly been using drugs from a contaminated batch, police said. Wiltshire's chief constable has said he hopes there is not another novichok poisoning after scrutiny over the clear-up of the Skripal attack. Kier Pritchard said: ""With the best information, with the available facts that were provided, the locations that we secured were deemed to be those that were fully adequate at that time."" Met Police say around 100 counter-terrorism detectives are working on the investigation alongside Wiltshire officers, and they were trying to identify the source of the novichok. Health officials have said the risk to the public is low but have urged people in Salisbury to avoid picking up objects if they ""don't know what they are"". And it has not been confirmed if the novichok was from the same batch that was used on the Skripals, who were released from hospital earlier this year. The UK government blamed Russia for the Salisbury attack - an allegation the Kremlin denied. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has accused Moscow of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"", while the Russian embassy said the UK government was trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""frighten its own citizens"". There are more than 100 formulations in the novichok family, all developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Brian Tarpey, a former detective inspector who worked on the Alexander Litvinenko poisoning case, told Sky News: ""I would say that this type of investigation is probably at the highest level of challenge for both the police and the security services. The potential political ramifications sit behind the investigation."" He said novichok was a ""difficult agent to be investigating"". He went on: ""The hostel (where Ms Sturgess lived) now becomes a crime scene and they will treat that with the utmost respect. Literally any item in the hostel - I'm sure they'll be able to narrow it down closer than that - is potentially the carrier of this latest contamination. ""So the police will be approaching this with the greatest care and consideration for their own safety as well as the safety of the people who were living in there."""

""The night before the game we all sat down - the keepers, goalie coach and the analysts - and went over everything that could possibly come up,"" he said.

The town is roughly eight miles (13km) from Salisbury, where former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted with the nerve agent novichok in March. A number of places in Salisbury and Amesbury have been cordoned off. Here are the investigation points. House in Muggleton Road, Amesbury The pair were found at a house on a new housing development on the southern edge of the town, which lies close to Stonehenge. Resident Chloe Edwards, 17, described seeing police cars, fire engines and people in ""green suits"" on Saturday night. ""We saw everything... We were just eating our dinner and all these emergency vehicles turned up. ""They were putting on these green suits and we thought it was the gas as our electricity was turned off as well."" Amesbury Baptist Centre About a mile from the house is Amesbury Baptist Centre. This is believed to be one of the last public places the man and woman visited on Saturday afternoon. They had been attending a community fundraiser. Church secretary Roy Collins said 200 people attended the event, including many families and children, but ""nobody else has suffered any ill effects"". Queen Elizabeth Gardens Queen Elizabeth Gardens, in Salisbury, is also being investigated. It is about 10 miles away from the house. On Wednesday morning, a large section of the road was cordoned off and a blue forensic tent was set up. Harcourt Medical Centre Right by Queen Elizabeth Gardens is the medical centre, which is also under investigation. Property at John Baker House Police have cordoned off a property at John Baker House - a supported housing scheme in Rolleston Street, Salisbury, for homeless people. Boots Two police officers have been guarding a Boots store, which was closed as part of the investigation. Patients trying to get their prescriptions filled have been turned away. Amesbury resident Coral said she was directed to another store. ""It's concerning,"" she said. Another resident spoke of her concerns, saying: ""We all asked straight away 'what is it?' After Salisbury, that was a nightmare, I don't know if this is the same or not."" Shopkeepers said police entered the Boots at about 8.30am and were not in protective clothing. Porton Down Samples of the substance are being sent to experts at government chemical weapons research laboratory Porton Down, five miles away. It is the same facility that identified the substance used in the Skripal poisoning as novichok. A Downing Street spokesman says the incident is being treated ""with the utmost seriousness""."

Surgical robots for example offer great advances. We watched at the Princess Grace Hospital in London as a surgical arm called Mako helped carry out a hip replacement on 57-year-old Richard Ellis. :: The NHS in numbers Because of the robot's precision, Mr Ellis's pain and recovery time should both be reduced. ""When the robot cuts, the robot cuts in the right place,"" said Professor Fares Haddad, a pioneer in surgical robotics in the UK. ""I think there's no question that this is the future of surgery. There is no industry where robotics have come in where they've left again. It's the way forward."" He also admitted, however, that the ""surgical community are scared of losing their jobs"". Surgeons should be safe for a while though. At present, the NHS owns only one of these expensive tools. :: 'Thank you will never be enough': Your stories as NHS marks 70th anniversary One of the biggest potential developments involves pre-empting an illness by reading a patient's DNA. People are hailing gene-editing technology as every bit as revolutionary as the invention of antibiotics. It is something that could happen before you are born - for example in cases where a woman carries a mitochondrial condition, and is well herself, but could pass it on to her offspring. ""We have new techniques which are just starting where you transfer the nucleus from her egg, making sure you don't take any mitochondria from her egg, into another woman's egg, where there are totally normal mitochondria, and remove the nucleus that's in that egg,"" said clinical geneticist at St George's Hospital in London, Dr Meriel McEntagart. ""Then she's able to have a child with great reassurance that the child won't have one of these devastating mitochondrial diseases. ""That level of manipulation is on the horizon, I think."" While it may not be as glamorous as a robot, or DNA analysis, a bedside computer at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham is almost as powerful as a team of medics. It is replacing paper with data and represents another massive breakthrough for the NHS. Such computers are already relieving much of a nurse's work by recording patients' conditions. The digital profiles they produce enable doctors to treat patients almost instantly. Isha Ali, who has been in and out of hospital all her life with kidney failure, said it made her more comfortable. ""If I need pain relief the nurses won't even take five minutes to give it to me,"" she said. ""If I go back five or six years I'd have to be waiting hours on end for pain relief. ""And it wasn't the staff's fault. It was just the way the system was. Now all I have to do is ask and I've got my pain relief. ""I'm just so happy with it all."" The Queen Elizabeth, however, is one of very few hospitals to have gone digital. If the NHS can digitise its tens of millions of medical records, it could offer untold possibilities for data sharing and diagnosis. With this extraordinary innovation comes many ethical questions. Could gene editing, for example, lead to social cleansing and a race of superhumans who could afford it? Tom Shakespeare, who was born with achondroplasia, and is professor of disability research at the University of East Anglia, thinks it is a dangerous idea. ""The number of people with disabilities who've built the world we live in is extraordinary,"" he said, adding that the internet and mobile phones were designed, ""mostly (by) people on the autistic spectrum""."

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) were called to a report of land on the fire near to Buckton Vale in Tameside on Sunday 24 June, a police statement said. ""Since then, firefighters have spent more than a week tackling the blaze in extremely challenging weather conditions.

Rescuers are battling against the clock to beat monsoon rains expected on Saturday, and have managed to reduce water levels in the cave by around 40%. But parts of the passageway leading to where the boys and coach were found are still flooded all the way to the ceiling - leaving diving out of the cave the only option for survival. Timeline shows how the events unfolded Sky News' Asia Correspondent Alex Rossi, reporting from outside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex, said rescuers have been pumping out ""huge amounts of water"". ""Around 40% of the water has now receded - about 1.5km - a bit less than a mile into the cave. ""They are trying to get more of that water out so that those boys can scramble out, walk and perhaps do a little diving."" If that fails, they will have to ""put those full face masks on and go through - which is going to be extremely difficult,"" he added. ""The Monsoon rains are due on Saturday - which would mean all of those efforts to pump out the water would be for nothing"". Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said the weather was the biggest concern for rescuers, adding: ""We can't risk having the flood back into the cave."" Mr Osatanakorn said that not all 13 may be extracted at the same time depending on their condition, and revealed that the boys have been practising wearing diving masks and breathing. They are not thought to have attempted any practice dives. The Thai navy Seals are in charge of extraction plans, with the help of dive teams from Britain, America, Australia and Asia. Officials hope to get the boys out as soon as possible before the heavy rainfall, which could lead to water levels rising again. If the draining effort sufficiently lowers the water level of the passageway leading to the boys and their coach, they could keep their heads above water and would not need to rely on scuba apparatus on their way out. The diving experts discovered the 12 boys and their football coach in a flooded cave It has been three days since the boys were discovered. They are currently being taken care of by seven members of the Thai Seals, including medics, who are sitting with them in the cave. The boys, who are in a stable condition, have asked for an update on the World Cup in Russia. They wanted to know ""which team qualified"", a member of the SEALs said. ""The big teams are already out,"" another member told them."
2018-07-05,"David Davis has told Theresa May that her plan to try and bring her warring cabinet together on Brexit is ""unworkable"", according to a report.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/davis-tells-may-customs-plan-is-unworkable-on-eve-of-crunch-brexit-meeting-11426655,"On the eve of a crunch meeting of ministers intended to agree a united front on Britain's EU exit, the Brexit secretary has reportedly written to the prime minister and set out his opposition to her so-called ""third way"" on customs. Mrs May came up with the plan in a bid to solve the thorny issue of Britain's post-Brexit customs system, after two previous options provoked opposition from different factions of her top team. Brussels also gave the plans - a ""customs partnership"" and ""maximum facilitation"" - a short shrift. But any hopes it would be a case of third time lucky appear to have been dashed by Mr Davis. According to the Daily Telegraph, he has told the PM that her ""third way"" will not work because it is merely a ""customs partnership"" - Mrs May's original preference - with some ""additional technological elements"". Mr Davis also voiced his fears the EU will reject the plan outright, claiming that even talking about it is a waste of the time, the report added. Sky News has contacted the Department for Exiting the EU. The proposed ""facilitated customs arrangement"" would see technology being used to work out where goods arriving into the UK will ultimately end up. This would mean the correct tariff could be paid - either at the EU or UK rate. âFacilitated Customs Arrangementâ will be âbest of both worldsâ between Customs Partnership and Max Fac models being tested - confirming my account of a hybrid/fusion model being tested at this recent meeting with business a fortnight ago https://t.co/348If3OyIt No 10 sources say the new âFacilitated Customs Arrangementâ  allows for frictionless trade with EU & freedom to set own tariffs. But heavily reliant on new technology > So the next obvious question: how long will the transition have to be extended and will the #ERG accept that? Mrs May was warned on Wednesday that the Tories will be ""toast"" if they fail to deliver on their Brexit promises. Eurosceptic MPs have been maintaining the pressure on the PM in recent days ahead of Friday's crunch meeting at Chequers, the PM's country retreat. It comes amid suggestions the PM could be set to compromise on her Brexit red lines - leaving the EU's single market and customs union - in a bid to corral the disparate wings of her cabinet into falling into line behind a common position. Brexit-supporting MPs worry such compromises - often referred to as a ""soft Brexit"" - will leave Britain closely aligned to EU rules and restrict the UK's freedom to strike free trade deals in the future. Top Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg warned Mrs May that a deal that keeps regulatory alignment with Brussels for goods, as well as keeping the same level of tariffs as the EU, is ""not Brexit"". The chair of the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs said that continued regulatory alignment would mean the UK ""cannot do trade deals with the rest of the world"" and would mean ""we haven't really left the EU"". ""Indeed, worse than that, we're a vassal state because we take the EU's rules and have no say over them,"" Mr Rees-Mogg said. Quoting William Shakespeare's Henry V, he urged ministers to ""stiffen your sinews, summon up the blood and imitate the actions of a tiger"" ahead of tomorrow's gathering. Ahead of the Chequers meeting, Mrs May is in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with Brexit featuring on the agenda. She heads to the German capital after Britain's biggest carmaker - Jaguar Land Rover - warned 40,000 jobs are at risk if the country leaves the EU without a free trade deal."
2018-07-05,A 16-year-old boy has been charged in connection with the death of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail on the Isle of Bute.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180705223723/https://news.sky.com/story/boy-16-charged-with-in-connection-with-death-of-alesha-macphail-11427184,"The teenager remains in custody and is due to appear at Greenock Sheriff Court on Friday. Alesha was reported missing from her home on the Scottish island of Bute at 6.25am on Monday and her body was found in woodland less than three hours later. Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston praised Alesha's parents for their ""incredible bravery"" during what he called an ""unimaginable ordeal"". He said: ""Officers and staff from across Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority have been involved in what has been a difficult and challenging investigation during which they have worked tirelessly to bring us to where we are today."" Alesha vanished from a home in Rothesay where she was staying and was reported missing by her grandmother. Her body was discovered by police in the grounds of an abandoned hotel around two-and-a-half hours later. On Wednesday there was an increase in police activity at the property on Ardbeg Road where Alesha had been before she disappeared. Several officers entered the garden with long sticks and searched the grounds. Later, a recovery truck removed a black Dacia car from the rear of the house. It was the second car to be removed. Officers have carried out house-to-house inquiries and conducted 24-hour high-visibility patrols to support the island's 7,000-strong community. It is understood that Alesha had been living in North Lanarkshire with her mother Genie Lochrane, who is separated from her father, during term time. The home from which she went missing was occupied by her paternal grandparents and Alesha's father Robert MacPhail. She was a few days into a three-week break. Alesha was remembered by a school teacher as as a friendly and happy child. Wendy Davie, headteacher of Chapelside Primary School in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, where Alesha had just finished her second year, said she was ""part of the family"" and would be greatly missed by pupils and staff. ""She loved being at school and enjoyed all aspects of literacy, in particular writing,"" Ms Davie said. ""She was such a perfectionist in her handwriting and was very proud of her work. ""Alesha was very friendly and she welcomed everyone first thing in the morning at breakfast club. She was a very considerate child who loved being part of a group and she was popular with all the other children and was a smiley and happy young girl."" Family and friends of the girl have continued to place flowers and cards outside her home. Police said the six-year-old's family was ""devastated""."

2018-07-08,Four young footballers have been successfully rescued from a flooded cave in Thailand - more than two weeks after their ordeal began.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180708215813/https://news.sky.com/story/after-two-weeks-trapped-four-boys-leave-thai-cave-11430474,"Although the risky operation has gone ""better than expected"" so far, their football coach and eight other boys will have to wait up to 20 hours before the rescue effort resumes. Governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said: ""We can only carry on the operation once we are ready and this will be done soon, because the air tank and other systems have to be reinstalled. ""The conditions must be stable like today before we can continue the operation."" :: LIVE - Race to save boys trapped in Thai cave Officials have said they are battling a ""war with water and time"" to save the team - warning it could be two to four days before all 13 are brought to safety. Among them are weak swimmers and children as young as 11. Each of the four boys rescued on Sunday were accompanied by two expert divers as they were gradually extracted. Their only way out was through dark, tight passageways filled with muddy water and strong currents - perilous conditions that claimed the life of a former Thai navy SEAL earlier this week. One diver told Reuters: ""It's dangerous to the most experienced divers to go through. It's pretty scary."" :: Risky plan could be ""greatest rescue in history"" After leaving the Tham Luang cave, the boys were flown by helicopter to the nearby city of Chiang Rai, where ambulances took them to hospital. Five emergency doctors were awaiting their arrival, with a source at the hospital telling Reuters: ""The teams here are happy the boys are being rescued but also anxious about the severity of the boys' conditions. We're under a lot of pressure."" Governor Narongsak said the condition of those still trapped is a constant concern, telling reporters: ""Divers will work with doctors in the cave to examine each the kids' health to determine who should get to come out first."" :: ""Take me for grilled pork"" - Letters written by trapped boys At the end of Sunday's rescue efforts - described as ""D-Day"" by one official - Thai navy SEALs wrote on Facebook: ""Have sweet dreams everyone. Goodnight. Hooyah."" A total of 90 divers are involved in the operation and 50 of them are foreign, some of them from the UK. The boys went missing after football practice with their 25-year-old coach on 23 June. They had set out on an adventure to explore the cave - reportedly for a picnic to celebrate one of their birthdays. :: How the rescue operation unfolded Bursts of monsoon rain caused the water inside the cave to rise, leaving them trapped. Millions of litres of water have been pumped out in recent days, but experts have warned that further downpours could shrink the unflooded space where the boys are sheltering to just 10 square metres (108 square feet). Governor Narongsak warned: ""Finding the boys doesn't mean we've finished our mission. It is only a small battle we've won, but the war has not ended. The war ends when we win all three battles - the battles to search, rescue and send them home."""
2018-07-08,"Labour must listen to criticism of its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism and make changes ""sharpish"", a senior member of Jeremy Corbyn's top team has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180708215813/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-should-change-anti-semitism-code-of-conduct-sharpish-sir-keir-starmer-11430175,"Sir Keir Starmer said he backed the full definition of what constitutes anti-Semitism outlined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). Labour's new guidelines have stopped short of signing up to it in full - omitting a number of examples set out by the IHRA. After the code of conduct was approved on Thursday, Labour described it as ""detailed and comprehensive"". However, campaigners and community groups were quick to describe it as ""toothless"". Amid calls for Labour to review its guidelines, Sir Keir said the party should ""reflect on what's been said in the last few days, and if we are not in a position of supporting the full definition we need to get into that position and sharpish"". The code of conduct has been devised in the wake of a row that saw Jewish groups protest outside parliament. The guidelines explicitly state that anti-Semitism is racism, adding: ""It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society."" However, they add that criticism of Israel and its policies should not automatically be deemed anti-Semitic. The code of conduct makes clear that even ""contentious"" comments ""will not be treated as anti-Semitism unless accompanied by specific anti-Semitic content... or by any other evidence of anti-Semitic intent"". It says: ""The party will encourage considered and respectful debate on these difficult topics, but will not tolerate name-calling and abuse."" The code of conduct has provoked controversy because it does not include four behaviours identified as anti-Semitic by the IHRA: :: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country:: Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour:: Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations:: Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis. Sir Keir, who serves as shadow Brexit secretary, said he supported the ""full definition"", telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Councils, institutions across the country have accepted the full definition. I think that's the right position to be in."" Asked why Labour has not adopted this definition, he said: ""There's some argument as to whether Labour has or hasn't, but I would urge everybody within the Labour Party to listen to the voices that have come out in recent days and get to a position where we are supporting the full definition. ""I think it's really important, including the examples. We have to be very clear about our position on this."" A Labour spokeswoman said: ""Labour has adopted the full IHRA definition on anti-Semitism in our Code of Conduct, which covers all the same ground as the IHRA examples. ""But, as a political party, we needed to go further to produce a more thorough and detailed code for members which can actually be put into practice and enforced."" A Labour source added: ""Keir was acknowledging that concerns have been raised by the NEC's decision and hopes these concerns will be responded to as part of ongoing discussions and dialogue the party is having with Jewish organisations. ""He supports the ongoing work the party is undertaking to root out anti-Semitism."""

2018-07-08,A police officer treated in connection with the Amesbury nerve agent attack has been given the all clear.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180708215813/https://news.sky.com/story/police-officer-seeks-treatment-after-amesbury-nerve-agent-attack-11429681,"The officer went to Great Western Hospital in Swindon on Saturday evening for ""medical advice"", before being transferred to Salisbury District Hospital for ""appropriate specialist tests"". In a tweet, Wiltshire Police said the police constable has now been assessed and given the all clear. Salisbury is a short distance from Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill last Saturday. They remain in a critical condition in Salisbury District Hospital after exposure to the nerve agent novichok by ""handling a contaminated item"", Scotland Yard said.   In a statement about the police officer, a spokesperson said: ""Salisbury District Hospital has seen a number of members of the public who have come to the hospital with health concerns since this incident started and none have required any treatment. ""We would like to reiterate the advice from Public Health England that the risk to the wider public remains low."" A Wiltshire police officer is seeking medical advice at Salisbury District Hospital in connection with the ongoing incident in Amesbury. This is a precautionary measure. We would like to reiterate the advice from Public Health England that the risk to the wider public remains low https://t.co/WUCo0lA3TQ Wiltshire Police said the police officer's admission to Salisbury District Hospital was ""precautionary"". The hospital is where former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia, were treated after being poisoned by novichok in March. Forensic investigators are continuing to comb for clues in Wiltshire after the latest novichok poisoning. On Friday, investigators wearing hazmat suits looked for evidence at the John Baker House assisted-living accommodation in Salisbury, where Ms Sturgess, a mother of three, was staying. They are also searching other sites visited by the pair before they were taken to hospital. Detectives have said they expect their work in the county will take ""weeks and months to complete"". Police have been unable to locate the source of the contamination and have warned that they cannot rule out more people falling ill. Salisbury MP John Glen has told Sky News it is highly likely the source of the second novichok poisoning is ""debris"" from the first attack in March, which left former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia seriously ill. One theory understood to be under investigation is whether the infected pair inadvertently found the container used to transport the nerve agent in that attack. Mr Rowley has been described as having foraged for goods to fix and sell, and is known to have collected discarded cigarettes. The Metropolitan Police said approximately 100 counter-terror officers are working round the clock alongside Wiltshire Police, adding: ""The focus of the investigation remains identifying the source of the contamination as quickly as possible."" Detectives say they have spoken to ""several key witnesses"" and are trawling through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage."

2018-07-08,The City grandee who narrowly survived a bid to oust him as chairman of Stobart Group is lining up a succession plan that will see him step down within months.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180708215813/https://news.sky.com/story/under-fire-stobart-chairman-lines-up-exit-from-warring-boardroom-11430632,"Sky News has learnt that Iain Ferguson, the former boss of Tate & Lyle, has discussed with boardroom colleagues a proposal to recruit a new chairman before next year's annual meeting. A formal timetable has yet to be agreed but a source close to Stobart said this weekend that directors ""acknowledged the need to look at the composition of the board"". Mr Ferguson was re-elected at Friday's annual meeting with 51.2% of shareholder voting in favour, following weeks of increasingly fractious disputes between the incumbent board and a faction led by Andrew Tinkler, Stobart's former chief executive. The re-elected chairman described it as ""an important day for corporate governance"" but made no reference to his plan to step down. The row has deteriorated into one of the City's bitterest fights for many years, and is unlikely to be alleviated by the outcome of the AGM - which was announced 29 hours after it was held in Guernsey. Mr Tinkler, who was forced to apologise over a sexist email he wrote about Stobart's former boss, was re-elected to the board by shareholders at the AGM, but was immediately sacked for the second time in little more than a fortnight. He has the support of Neil Woodford, arguably Britain's best-known fund manager, and a number of senior managers at the company, which owns Southend Airport. They have proposed that Philip Day, the billionaire owner of Jaeger and Edinburgh Woollen Mill, replace Mr Ferguson, and are seeking to have him elected to the Stobart board later this month. Separately, M&G Investments, which is part of the FTSE-100 insurance giant Prudential, has tried to broker a compromise deal by asking the former Asda and Royal Mail chief Allan Leighton to take the reins at Stobart on a temporary basis. M&G's proposal would also have seen Warwick Brady, the former easyJet and Ryanair executive, remaining in place as Stobart's chief executive. However, the fissures which have been exposed in the company's warring boardroom mean that that solution is unlikely to be acceptable to Mr Tinkler, Mr Woodford or other opponents of Mr Ferguson. The emergence of Mr Tinkler's intention to vote his shareholding against Mr Ferguson's re-election ignited a series of lawsuits between him and the company. Lawyers for Stobart allege that Mr Tinkler breached his fiduciary duties and tried to structure corporate deals for his personal advantage. Stobart has also sued Mr Tinkler and former director William Stobart for nearly Â£4m in connection with a tax payment linked with the purchase of an engineering firm in 2008. Mr Tinkler responded by launching his own lawsuit against directors including Mr Brady. The former chief executive has been backed by William Stobart, son of the founder of the separate Eddie Stobart haulage business whose trucks bear the family name. Previously released internal emailsâ have revealed that Mr Tinkler had discussed in recent months with Mr Day the idea of reuniting Stobart Group, an industrial conglomerate, with Eddie Stobart. Mr Woodford's 19% stake is in Mr Tinkler's camp, while Invesco, another big shareholder, voted in support of the existing board. M&G is understood to have voted against Mr Ferguson's re-election. The company has endured a difficult time in recent months, a period in which it aborted a potential takeover offer for Flybe, the regional airline. Stobart Group operates across sectors including the supply of biomass for renewable energy generation, civil engineering for rail projects and a domestic airline called Stobart Air. A Stobart spokesman declined to comment on Sunday."
2018-07-08,"The prime minister intensely dislikes the phrase ""soft Brexit"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180708215813/https://news.sky.com/story/chequers-mate-brexiters-rely-on-eu-rejecting-pms-win-11428982,"But there can be no denying the hard approach with her cabinet to softening her own Brexit plan and red lines, in pursuit of a deal that can pass parliament. This is the logic of the commons maths asserting themselves through Number 10. In the end there was nowhere to go for the cabinet Brexiteers. By that I mean, there was literally nowhere to go, because Number 10 had taken their phones and immediate use of their ministerial cars should they resign. In the middle of the Buckinghamshire countryside, such things can help focus minds. :: PM and cabinet agree new UK-EU free trade area The PM and her team have pulled off an impressive feat. The cabinet is now united behind a position that can win the acceptance of Parliament and the business community. As her Chief Whip Julian Smith commented (he seemed to be quickly reunited with his phone): ""Cabinet unity for the next stage of Brexit."" Our Brexit #DealForBritain â the 12 key principles that we will use in our EU negotiations as we continue along the road to Brexit. pic.twitter.com/CJaWmEigXs More than that, as was made clear in an email to MPs afterwards, for the first time since February 2016, cabinet collective responsibility on Brexit was firmly reasserted. No more special licence for ministers to speak their mind on this issue. Any minister freelancing with long personal manifestos or private recorded statements will be fired. Other delighted cabinet ministers included Business Secretary Greg Clark, defender of Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover, who said it was a ""very positive conclusion"" which meant ""zero friction"" for trade between UK and EU countries and Justice Secretary David Gauke, who praised the ""positive support from cabinet for Theresa May and her Brexit plan"". Not much from the Brexiteers just yet. :: 'Sell out' free trade area plans torn apart by Brexiteers The statement of agreement was emailed to the press as dinner began, without cabinet ministers having contact with their advisers, giving two hours for newspapers to conjure ""PM wrestles Brexit triumph"" style headlines, on a day when most of the country will want to return to the World Cup, rather than squabbling political parties. The European Union will not accept this plan, and that much has been made clear. But that was easy for them while there was no plan and no unified position even to have to consider. Now there is something for them to bite into. A conversation to be started. Their initial response to actually having a negotiation partner was warmish. But they were careful not to sound too dismissive about the wider attempt to enjoy existing economic terms with the single market where the UK feels it is in its interest, without the payments or adherence to freedom of movement. The most significant piece of the agreement is that the government has changed its position on what it wants from ongoing trade with the European Union. No longer is it ""as frictionless as possible"", which was always fairly meaningless but actually ""frictionless"". The PM has been persuaded by the arguments of business, the car industry and Airbus in particular, that any border checks would fundamentally imperil the business strategies that have led them to thrive in the UK and in particular their supply chains. The answer is a ""free trade area for goods"" with a common rule book which is in essence participation in a goods customs union and single market, with some eventual flexibility to conduct independent trade externally, when tariff tracking technology is developed. :: Behind the scenes of crunch Brexit talks It is not membership of these structures however. The UK becomes rule-taker of the EU interpretation of these rules for globalised industries. The theory, however, is that the UK will have had strong influence in the setting of the global standards in the first place, so not a total rule-taker. It is a position that envisages the development in coming decades of global standards in advanced manufacturing and trade. The inclusion of agriculture in this system is to keep borders open both in Northern Ireland and at Dover, Holyhead and the Channel Tunnel. It means no environmental checks on produce. But it is a trade off. It also surely means no capacity to accept third party trade standards, vital to many trade deals. So whereas Number 10 stresses that with an ""independent trade policy"" we can now sign deals with the US and New Zealand and Australia, our adherence to standards in goods and farm produce will limit the attractiveness as a partner and the scope of any deal. But deals can be done. The ability to levy different tariffs will be dependent on the facilitated customs arrangement technology being developed, agreed with the EU and applied. As I have written before this will take years, and perhaps several years. In the interim we will de facto stay in both the customs union and the single market. The document talks of a flexible phased introduction. This is almost exactly the same as the new customs partnership that was decried as ""crazy"" by the foreign secretary - yet he has signed up to it. The gravitational pull on any future government not to change tariffs will be strong, but the UK parliament will have the power to change them. Britain will have taken back some control, but in other senses (directly influencing the EU rules) have lost it. Brexiteer backbenchers were restrained immediately, but anger is brewing. ""As bad as I feared,"" said one. A despondent Brexiteer MP said he was ""deeply disappointed, this is associate membership of the EU, we haven't worked so hard all these years for this"". One very pro-Brexit junior minister told me: ""If this was the final deal, then I could probably live with it as a necessary compromise. But EU will never accept it (cherry picking, four freedoms indivisible etc), so what happens next?"" #Chequers discussion on future to be welcomed. I look forward to White Paper. We will assess proposals to see if they are workable & realistic in view of #EUCO guidelines. Next negotiations w/ #UK on WP, & Withdrawal Agreement, w/c 16 July #Brexit Indeed why you would choose to lay out such tough red lines if you thought things might end up here is a bit of a mystery. How Brexiteer cabinet ministers have signed up to this having argued so publicly for ""a clean Brexit"" is another. ""I can't see how they can accept this and not look a laughing stock,"" one former senior minister said. It is early days yet. One ministerial aide suggested the analogy of a budget that unravels after a time delay of two days, would be the correct analogy. The most evident possible method for that is the section on a ""labour mobility partnership"" which suggests maintaining mutual freedom to move and then apply for study and jobs [presumably not benefits] between UK and EU. This will help lubricate any single market deal. It will also inflame internal political opposition. There is also a section on ""no deal"" preparations, meant as a stick for the EU and a carrot for Brexiteers. If the PM cannot stomach a Canada-style trade deal because of the negative impact on advanced manufacturers, it seems that ""no deal"" is inconceivable. So we are left in an extraordinary position. The hard Brexiteers need the EU to reject this out of hand now. The EU will have noted the shift in Government position, the actual adoption of one, and see a landing point at least for many years that is close to the European Economic Area (EEA) plus customs union solution they anticipate and prefer. We are probably three quarters of the way there already. Do they split the difference and pay lip service to a magical Europe-wide tariff refund IT system in a few years? Or do they undo the PM's impressive manoeuvres with outright rejection? The devil will be in the detail, to be released in the white paper. But that in itself is a win for the PM. She has ended the split in her cabinet, asserted her authority, and for now turned Brexit into a technocratic exercise on the detail of trade policy. It seemed highly unlikely a month ago, and it may not last the week, but a win is a win."

However, Monday is predicted to be the 16th consecutive day of temperatures over 28C (82F). Still basking in the glow of winning against Sweden in the World Cup on Saturday, England fans were a bit calmer on Sunday as they enjoyed the sun. There were scenes of excitement following the quarter-final - with crowds screaming, hugging and throwing their pints into the air. Those who are struggling with the heat will be relieved to hear that it is expected to cool off a bit from Monday, with temperatures predicted to be in the mid-20s. However, anyone hoping their garden will receive some much-needed rain may be disappointed. Most places are going to stay dry, although southern and eastern Britain may see an isolated shower or two. Water companies are urging people to use water sparingly to avoid a potential hosepipe ban as they struggle to pump billions of extra litres to meet high demand. Northern Ireland is into its second week of a hosepipe ban, with Ireland introducing one on Friday across the whole country. Some parts of southeast England saw just 6% of expected rainfall in June, according to provisional figures from the Met Office. Sky's weather producer, Chris England, says temperatures are set to turn hotter again by the weekend."

It is the third tragedy to hit the family after William's father Robert died in a crash at the North West 200 in 2008 and his uncle Joey was killed while racing in Estonia in 2000. The Dunlops are household names in motorcycle racing, with Joey winning a record 26 times at the Isle of Man TT races. William's brother Michael has also won 18 races at the Isle of Man event. William - a former winner at the North West 200 and Ulster Grand Prix - chose not to compete in this year's Isle of Man TT but returned home to be with his partner Janine who is pregnant with their second child. During his career, he recorded 108 Irish National Road Race wins, including 15 at the Skerries circuit, which claimed his life. He is understood to have been taking part in an open race practice session on his R1 Yamaha when he crashed on the third lap. In a statement, the Loughshinny Club, which organises the Skerries 100, said they ""deeply regretted"" that William Dunlop had passed away ""following injures received in a tragic accident that occurred during practice"". It added: ""The Loughshinny Motorcycle Supporters Club extends their heartfelt sympathy to William Dunlop's family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as this very sad time.""

She tweeted: ""Motorcycling was his life and he will be forever remembered for his many achievements, both in Ballymoney and across the world.""

And it was the most viewed live programme on the BBC's online iPlayer, with 3.8 million watching it via the app or online. But that meant nearly four million people were left disappointed after iPlayer crashed with just three minutes left of the game. The viewing figures were lower than the round of 16 game when 23.6 million watched England secure a nail-biting penalty shootout win over Colombia. England fans are convinced that football is 'coming home' and share their joy on social media However, Saturday's quarter-final was most likely watched by many more than recorded as pubs across the country were packed with fans. Former England striker Gary Lineker, who headed up the BBC coverage, said: ""Crikey. Humongous figures again for England.

Despite talk of potential resignations ahead of the Brexit showdown, Mrs May's cabinet signed up to the proposals, which will now be set out in full in a white paper presented to parliament this coming week. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson reportedly described defending the plans as like ""polishing a turd"" during the Chequers summit, before eventually falling into line behind the PM. The central idea of the government's new proposal for the future relationship with the European Union after Brexit is a 'free trade area for goods'. While full details of Mrs May's plan have yet to be revealed, backbench Brexiteers are struggling to digest what has been published thus far. The disquiet has sparked speculation some Conservative MPs could submit formal letters calling for a leadership contest, with 48 being the requisite number. Mr Gove - a key figure in the 2016 Leave campaign - said it was a ""perfect balance"" between the need for close access to Europe and allowing the services industry to diverge from EU rules and regulations. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""...I'm a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn't, you shouldn't make the perfect the enemy of the good. ""I think people have every reason to be concerned"" says veteran Conservative MP and arch-Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash on the deal agreed at Chequers #Ridge pic.twitter.com/fol6dtGPS5 ""One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the cabinet."" He added: ""All those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit, and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the prime minister in order to negotiate that deal."" Mr Gove said the onus was now on Brussels to be flexible, with Britain stepping up preparations to show it can walk away from the negotiations without a deal if necessary in March 2019. âThereâs a lot of unhappiness... is this going to be a proper Brexit?â says Tory euro-sceptic MP Bill Cash on whether Theresa May's position is any more secure since Chequers #Ridge pic.twitter.com/1gNjHRhshx Quizzed about claims his cabinet colleague used colourful language to describe what was on the table at Chequers, Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: ""It is very easy to take what can sometimes be seen as a joke in a particular conversation somewhat out of context and make a story out of it."" In an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sunday he added: ""The reality is Boris and all of us came to an agreement about a strong package that we think is good for the UK economy (and) delivers what the Brexit vote was about in 2016."" A meeting involving the PM and Tory MPs on Monday evening will provide an indication of the strength of feeling in Mrs May's party. ""That's why we are such a strongly united cabinet"" - Conservative Party Chairman @BrandonLewis dodges questions about cabinet divisions despite reports Boris Johnson called Chequers proposals ""polishing a turd"" #Ridge pic.twitter.com/yt23FoZgqs All the indications are that it will be a stormy gathering. Veteran eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash told Sky News: ""There are a lot of questions in here, there is a lot of unhappiness, there is a great deal of concern that we are saying that we leave - it's not 'to be or not to be' it's 'to leave or not to leave'. ""The question is how do you leave and is this going to be a proper Brexit? There will be a massive discussion about all this."" Analysis: In the end there was nowhere to go for the cabinet Brexiteers. Sir Bill said he had not penned a letter calling for a leadership contest, but ominously noted: ""If people were to decide to put in those letters you only need 48."" Fellow backbencher Andrew Bridgen was far more forthright, saying he would not back the deal even ""if the EU were paying us"". ""I can't support the offer which emerged at Chequers - I think it's a breach of the red lines, in fact the offer is so poor that I couldn't support it even if the EU were paying us for it,"" he said. ""Obviously if the government and the prime minister continue to support that very poor offer then I won't have any confidence in the government or the prime minister."" Mr Brigden said he would ""listen to what the prime minister has got to say on Monday evening at the 1922 committee"" before deciding how to act. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, he said Jacob Rees-Mogg was now the only credible challenger to Mrs May, after Brexiteer cabinet ministers failed to oppose the PM's plan."

""It's been a long time since I heard that. It sounded positive, which was nice,"" said one eavesdropper. ""Let's hope it lasts."" It has been quite an astonishing 48 hours in which Theresa May - and her cabinet -- has travelled a huge distance. We began the week with ministers in open warfare over Brexit and ended it with the cabinet struck mute by her reassertion of collective cabinet responsibility. No wonder her team are worried about whether this handbrake turn will really stick. But for now, discipline is restored and her cabinet - including the Brexiteers - have fallen in behind a soft Brexit plan that crosses many a red line for those who backed Vote Leave. How did she do it? The clue was in the words realised on the eve of her Chequers cabinet away day when Mrs May told her colleagues they needed to agree an approach that is in ""the best interests of the UK and EU and, crucially, one that commands the support of public and parliament"". Parliament was key to her argument. I'm told that Chief Whip Julian Smith warned the cabinet that if no deal was reached in Chequers, he'd be unable to stop Tory remainers voting with Labour to keep the UK in the customs union in two weeks' time when the Trade Bill arrives on the floor of the Commons. The chief whip said there were 20 Conservative MPs who would vote against the government to thwart Mrs May's Brexit manifesto promises. When it boiled down to it, her soft Brexit plan was the best they were going to get. There are, of course, huge concerns within the Brexiteer ranks over what has been settled on. Senior Brexiteers are hugely concerned there will further concessions over EU citizens having some form of freedom of movement via the backdoor. Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid were two ministers pushing her on this. I'm told the home secretary pressed the prime minister to draw an unequivocal red line. ""Free movement must, end, no ifs, or buts, no back door, end in all forms. People voted to take back control of our borders,"" Mr Javid said. Mrs May said it would - in fact she shouted - ""it will end"" to her cabinet in order to make the point. But her cabinet left Chequers last night still full of suspicion this red line will blur when the horse trading with the EU intensifies in the autumn. But Theresa May steps up 'no-deal' preparations And that too is why the Brexiteers broke bread with the prime minister last night rather than flouncing out. They might not like this version of Brexit, but its better than the one on offer from a Remain-backing parliament. The big fear now for those on the Vote Leave side is that there'll be even further concessions on what red lines remain as negotiations continue. Better then to stick around for the next battle in Brussels than fall on your sword now. Peace for now - but it feels very fragile indeed."
2018-07-08,"Divers taking part in a ""highly dangerous"" operation to save 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a cave in Thailand could pull off ""one of the greatest rescues in history"", an expert has told Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180708215813/https://news.sky.com/story/thailand-cave-rescue-no-way-out-for-divers-in-very-high-risk-operation-11430082,"Peter Faulding, founder of rescue response provider Specialist Group International, said the right team of people were handling the operation but warned of the dangers faced by the divers and the children. He said air supply for everyone involved would be one of the biggest issues to deal with given the length of the journey in and out of the cave. He predicted it would take four hours to get in and four hours to get out. The only way to get to the group is by navigating 2.5 miles (4km) of dark and tight passageways filled with muddy water and strong currents, as well as oxygen-depleted air. Mr Faulding told Sky News: ""Besides the claustrophobia, it's full of water and silt and they have got to keep their nerve. ""I would imagine there will be two divers bringing each child out. ""One of the biggest issues for the children is oxygen deficiency and CO2 build up is an issue too. It causes fatigue and all kinds of issues."" Divers are attempting to free 12 boys and their football coach from a flooded cave network ""The children may have to exchange mouth pieces and the divers will be following a line in - they're not free swimming it - and that will be laid into the passages,"" he added. Thirteen foreign divers, five Thai divers and five Navy SEALs are expected to take part in the complex operation, with the boys expected to gradually exit the cave. Officials say the quickest time that the boys - who have been trapped for more than two weeks - could begin emerging from the cave is 9pm local time (3pm UK time) on Sunday, and the mission could take up to four days. Mr Faulding said the children could be taken out on rescue sleds or stretchers and have an air line running directly to them. Rescue workers could also use through-water or hard-wire communication tools such as air masks with in-built two-way radios that would allow a child and a diver to speak while navigating through water in the cave. Mr Faulding said the children's inability to swim would not cause a problem as long as they could manoeuvre themselves and showed ""confidence to be in the water"". Former Navy SEAL diver Saman Gunan died while taking part in the rescue effort during an overnight mission in which he had been delivering oxygen canisters in the Tham Luang cave system. ""It's a highly dangerous operation - I can't stress that enough. If it goes wrong there's no way out. If they run out of air you have got a big problem, it's very, very dangerous - there's no second option really,"" said Mr Faulding. ""There's no one to come to the rescue and bring you out. Because it's inside a big mountain, they can't build a shaft down to rescue them, it's solid rock above them."" He added: ""It's a major feat of physical endurance just to get the [air] cylinders through. The physical side will have a heavy effect on the rescuers - they have got to be very fit to do this."" Mr Faulding said the operation could go down as ""one of the greatest rescues in history"" and compared it to the rescue of the 33 Chilean miners in 2010, whom he said did not have the issue of water to contend with. He added: ""This is a very high risk operation."""

Much of the plush cabins are covered in glass - including some of the floors - so passengers can take in the views from 16,000ft. The Â£25m aircraft, which is 302ft long, 143ft wide and 85ft tall - is being developed by British manufacturer Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV). HAV and Design Q unveiled the Airlander 10 passenger cabin at the Farnborough Airshow to demonstrate what is possible in luxury expeditionary tourism. It claims Airlander 10 will be able to take off and land on ""virtually any flat surface"" and visit locations which cannot be reached by existing transport methods. The aircraft will have no need for traditional infrastructure such as ports or airports, according to the company. ""Air travel has become very much about getting from A to B as quickly as possible. What we're offering is a way of making the journey a joy,"" HAV chief executive Stephen McGlennan said. The company believes Airlander 10 could be used for other functions other than leisure trips, including surveillance, communications, delivering aid and search and rescue missions. Built in 2012, it is named the Martha Gwyn after the company chairman's wife but has become popularly known as ""the flying bum"" due to its shape. A spokesperson for HAV said: ""Passengers on Airlander will have luxurious private en-suite bedrooms and will be able to enjoy horizon-to-horizon views in the aircraft's extensive Infinity Lounge. ""The Altitude Bar will offer drinks with the ultimate view, while 18 guests can enjoy fine dining in the skies."" Used by the US army until 2016, it has been redesigned for domestic use and the 150ft-long cabin will accommodate up to 18 passengers and crew members for a three-day expedition. Its maximum speed is around 91mph - with the tourism-focused, eco-friendly aircraft being a leisurely voyage of the skies in comparison to the Airbus A380's cruising speed of 560mph. HAV say Airlander 10's design is practical and ready to go into production - with it being possible to customise it to individual customer requests. The aircraft's cockpit was severely damaged in August 2016 when it nose-dived and crashed during a test flight. It also collapsed in November last year after coming loose from its moorings - with both incidents occurring at its former base at Cardington Airfield, Bedfordshire."
2018-07-20,"Police believe they have identified the suspected perpetrators of the novichok attack on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, the Press Association has reported. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180720041801/https://news.sky.com/story/suspected-perpetrators-of-skripal-novichok-attack-identified-11441349,"But security minister Ben Wallace dismissed the report as ""wild speculation"" on Twitter. The 66-year-old and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were attacked with the deadly nerve agent at their home in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The pair were taken to hospital after shoppers found them collapsed on a bench at The Maltings shopping centre on 4 March. Both survived the attack and were discharged from Salisbury District Hospital after extensive treatment. Officers believe several Russians were involved in the attempted murder and say they are looking for more than one suspect. ""Investigators believe they have identified the suspected perpetrators of the novichok attack through CCTV and have cross-checked this with records of people who entered the country around that time,"" a source close to the investigation told PA. They said investigators were ""sure"" the suspects were Russian. Scotland Yard, which is leading the investigation, declined to comment. Sky's crime correspondent Martin Brunt said: ""This would chime with the government's long-held belief that the Russian state was behind the attack on the Skripals, or at least had lost control of the nerve agent novichok which scientists say is made only in Russia."" In an analysis of samples taken from the Skripals' home, the highest concentrations of the toxic chemical was found on door handles. The day before the pair were found unconscious by members of the public in Salisbury town centre, Mr Skripal was driven to Heathrow Airport by a friend to collect his daughter returning from the Russian capital, Moscow. Brunt said this left around a five-hour window for the attackers to visit their home to apply the nerve agent. He said police officers had collected 5,000 hours of CCTV from the local area during the course of their enquiries. ""Those images would have been matched with CCTV taken from Heathrow Airport and any other airport within a few days of the attack,"" said Brunt. ""That gives you an insight into the kind of meticulous and complex work that has been going on. ""It may be that through that work police have come to the conclusion that they have found people who were around the Skripals' home on 3 or 4 March and have been able to identify similar figures, or the same figures, getting on flights and perhaps going back to Russia."" The breakthrough comes as an inquest was opened into the death of Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowley, both from Amesbury which is situated about eight miles north of Salisbury, were poisoned by novichok believed to be from the same batch as that used to target the Skripals. Ms Sturgess, 44, died earlier this month - eight days after being exposed to 10 times the amount of nerve agent the former spy and his daughter came into contact with. Investigators believe the substance was in a discarded perfume bottle that the couple found in a park and that Ms Sturgess likely sprayed the substance directly onto her skin. Mr Rowley, 45, survived coming into contact with the chemical and is still being treated in hospital. David Ridley, senior coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, confirmed a small glass bottle of fluid was recovered by investigators and that tests showed it contained novichok. He said details of the cause of Ms Sturgess's death would not be disclosed until further tests had been carried out and adjourned the inquest until 16 January, 2019. More than 400 exhibits, samples and items have been recovered by police investigating the poisoning of the couple. A high police presence remains in Amesbury and Salisbury as searches of properties and a clean-up of public places continues. Public Health England has said the risk to the public remains low, but has advised people not to pick up any unknown items such as syringes, needles, cosmetics, or similar objects made of materials such as metal, plastic or glass. ""The advice remains, 'if you didn't drop it, then don't pick it up',"" it said. The government has continued to make clear it believes the Russian state was behind the attack on the Skripals. Vladimir Putin and other senior Russian politicians have continued to deny any involvement in the poisonings. The row has led to tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions between the UK, its allies and Russia."
2018-07-20,A store worker has been convicted of murdering a father-of-seven with an axe before taking his body in a shopping trolley to a cemetery.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180720041801/https://news.sky.com/story/man-guilty-of-murdering-father-of-seven-in-brutal-axe-attack-11441947,"Imran Muhammad, 31, had searched terms such as ""how to kill a man with a hammer"" and ""how to kill a man with one punch"" on his mobile phone four days before the attack. He murdered Seyed Khan, 49, with a metal axe at the A-Z Furniture and Carpets Shop in Ilford, south east London, on 24 January. Mr Khan, from Thamesmead, was looking after the shop for a friend when he suffered more than 12 blows to the head with the weapon, according to local reports. Muhammad was working at the shop when Mr Khan caught him stealing, the Ilford Recorder added. He is then said to have begged Mr Khan not to tell the store's owner what he had done. Muhammad, from Ilford, has reportedly not admitted this was reason for the killing but it is strongly suspected to be the motive. After the murder Muhammad tried to clean the premises and painted over the walls. He transported his victim's body and the axe in a shopping trolley to Ilford cemetery in the early hours of 25 January. Muhammad then hid his body in undergrowth. Mr Khan's body was found eight days later, by which time Muhammad had fled to Glasgow. Muhammad was found guilty of murder on July 19 after a trial at the Old Bailey in London. He had previously admitted perverting the course of justice. Devi Kharran, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This was a brutal and premeditated attack on a hard-working family man. ""Imran Muhammad went out of his way to cover his tracks. ""After murdering Mr Khan he painted over bloodstains in the shop and also called the police claiming to have been robbed and injured by a stranger, leading to him being taken to hospital. ""In the days that followed police put out numerous appeals in search for Mr Khan while all along Muhammad knew that he had murdered him. ""It was eight days until Mr Khan's body was found and by that time Muhammad had fled to Glasgow. ""Using forensic evidence, witness accounts and CCTV footage showing Muhammad's journey to the cemetery where Mr Khan's body was found, the prosecution was able to prove Muhammad had deliberately carried out this murder. ""I hope this conviction brings some closure to the family and friends of Mr Khan."" Muhammad will be sentenced on Friday."

In the space of five days, the Brexit plan carefully constructed at Chequers was smashed into a million pieces. The issue of the Irish border in particular has become more delicate than the world-famous thin porcelain produced in Belleek. :: EU member states told to step up 'no deal' Brexit preparations No one wants a hard border, but six months from Brexit, there is no plan in place to prevent one. In his resignation statement, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the House of Commons the Irish border had become ""politically charged"". He added that the problem of the land boundary ""had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble"". When they needed agreement last December, the UK and EU found a solution - a safety net they call ""the backstop"". :: Northern Ireland 'unsupportive' of 'no deal' Brexit The EU understood it meant that, in the event of no deal, Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union. But Monday's vote in the Commons, ruling out a customs border in the Irish Sea, put paid to that plan. The DUP, who are shoring up Mrs May's government, would never accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to other UK regions. And Sinn Fein say the Irish government must insist that the backstop agreed last December is translated into legally binding text. :: Jacob Rees-Mogg at Irish border: 'UK can win game of chicken' The issue is further complicated by the fact that most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. But the DUP campaigned to leave, their MPs vote with the Brexiteers, and the prime minister needs them right now. It is not by coincidence that Mrs May's visit will take in Fermanagh - Arlene Foster's own Stormont constituency. If ""no deal"" produces a hard border, it will not be better than a ""bad deal"" for people living here. With six months to Brexit, the prime minister is under pressure from the EU, her own party, and the DUP. Some might argue that it is difficult to tell which one is the potter and which one the clay."

It also says British consumers could be unwittingly buying billions of pounds of goods made by people trapped in the slave trade in other countries. The UK imports Â£14bn ($18bn) worth of goods each year which the foundation believes are at high risk of being made by slaves - including electronics like laptops and mobile phones, clothes, cocoa, sugarcane and even fish. :: Modern-slave family rescued in dead of night Cocoa is one industry with a particularly high level of risk of forced labour. The report focused on analysing G20 countries and their levels of imports of at-risk products, finding G20 countries together import about Â£271bn ($354bn) annually of products which could have been made by slaves. Only seven of the G20 countries, including the UK, have enacted laws which attempt to minimise the impact of modern slavery on supply chains. :: Damning stats show police failing UK's modern slaves The report notes: ""The UK Modern Slavery Act (MSA) has been described as a 'game changer' for tackling modern slavery and requiring transparency on modern slavery in supply chains."" The MSA requires all companies with a turnover of Â£36m or more which provide goods or services in the UK to produce an annual report to explain how they are tackling slavery in their supply chains. Kevin Hyland, the UK's independent anti-slavery commissioner, said the law had ""undoubtedly"" served to raise awareness of slavery and had given year-on-year increases in the number of slaves being identified. He added: ""It is unacceptable that modern slavery continues to exist in a climate of low risk criminality and high profit reward making it the crime of choice for criminals who for too long have operated with impunity in the UK and beyond."" In an essay published alongside the report, Fiona David, the executive director of global research for the Walk Free Foundation, said: ""The 2018 Global Slavery Index confirms that governments are taking more of the steps we ask of them to respond to modern slavery - strengthening laws, training police, providing services and shelters to victims, and engaging with businesses on supply chain transparency."" But she continued to say the laws will have little impact without implementation and enforcement, while police training is worthless if a judge can be bought. Ms David also criticised the US for withdrawing on discussions in the UN on refugees and migration, saying it was ""unthinkable"" that so many leaders had agreed on so much, except for the safe travel of people around the world.

2018-07-20,MPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions after a series of rape and sexual assault cases cases collapsed because key evidence was withheld.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180720041801/https://news.sky.com/story/cps-boss-saunders-criticised-over-rape-case-evidence-failings-11442928,"CPS chief Alison Saunders ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the disclosure process"", according to a Commons' justice committee report. It said there had been ""insufficient focus and leadership"" over the issue - but Ms Saunders said tackling the problem was now her ""top priority"". Committee chairman Bob Neill said some people had been sent to prison after evidence was not handed over to defence lawyers by police and prosecutors. ""This is not acceptable,"" said the Tory MP and barrister. ""As we've seen in high profile cases since last year - disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact. ""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result."" The Crown Prosecution Service and police must hand over material that helps the defence but this is often viewed as an ""administrative headache"", said Mr Neill. A series of rape trials collapsed in 2017 when it became clear that vital evidence had not been properly handed over. Samuel Armstrong, who was chief of staff for a Tory MP, said at the time that his ""whole life had been turned upside down"". He said his defence had only received ""crucial evidence"" eight days before the start of the trial. He was then found not guilty. That evidence is believed to have been messages from his accuser's phone that showed she had contacted a journalist hours after the alleged assault to get a ""sympathetic"" portrayal. Her medical notes also contained details of a history of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.Liam Allan also told Sky News how he spent two years living in fear after a rape claim was made against him. His case was also thrown out of court after it emerged a detective had failed to hand over text messages on the accuser's phone - seriously undermining the case. ""While the police are trying to prove the accuser's word, no one is really out looking for evidence to support what you're saying,"" he said. The collapsed cases led to a review of all live rape and sexual assault prosecutions in England and Wales, with disclosure problems found in 47. The justice committee report says diclosure must be seen as a ""core justice duty"" rather than an ""administrative add-on"". A National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being brought in as part of a review by the attorney general. ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all,"" said Mr Neill. He said the improvement plan ""must deliver"" and that ""too many reviews of disclosure that have not resulted in real change"". Alison Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority."" She said there was now an ""unprecedented focus on finding solutions"" and changing ""the wider culture within the CPS and policing""."

Police discovered the rented house from where he had vanished was a massive cannabis factory. When Teresko turned up safe and well the next day, officers searched his semi-detached house in Cobham to find a keepkey device on which was stored Â£1.25m worth of the digital currency Bitcoin. They also found Â£263,000 in cash in a heavily sealed box, and a number of designer watches and jewellery. Teresko, 31, from Latvia, had no obvious employment - yet drove a Range Rover Evoque. He also had access to a safety deposit box containing gold bars, loose gemstones, jewellery and Â£20,000 in cash. Considering the suspicious amount of cash at his home and suspected links to the cannabis factory, Teresko was arrested and charged. In October 2017, he pleaded guilty to money laundering, cultivation of cannabis and the possession/control of articles for use in fraud at Kingston Crown Court. Teresko was sentenced to nine years and three months imprisonment. On Thursday, a judge at the same court found that Teresko had benefited from his criminal activity to the tune of Â£2m. He has been ordered to forfeit Â£1.45m - including the value of the Bitcoin. Teresko must also pay an additional Â£13,150 within three months or face another 10 years in jail.

It will have 30% less sugar than the current bar and Cadbury owner Mondelez International has described it as the ""most significant innovation in the brand's history"". The company is also planning reduced sugar versions of some of its other confectionery brands such as Oreo and Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums and Jelly Babies products. A survey by Vouchercodes.com earlier this year suggested that on average each person in the UK ate 22 Dairy Milk bars a year. In the new bar the sugar content will be 39g per 100g, down from 56g per 100g in the traditional one, however the calorie content will be similar. Glenn Caton, Mondelez International president for Northern Europe, said the science behind the reformulation was a ""trade secret"" but the taste of the new bar as ""incredibly similar"" to the original. He said: ""It tastes very, very close to the original but a little less sweet. It's been tested extensively on consumers and they love it."" He added: ""Taking sugar out of our products isn't easy and will take time. ""Ultimately they are treats and people expect them to taste great, but we're working hard to find innovative solutions that provide more choice without compromising on their world-renowned taste and quality."" In May research by the UK Heart Forum and Institute of Technology, Sligo predicted that the number of morbidly obese people in England, Scotland and Wales is set to double over the next 20 years. The study found that if current trends continue, nearly five million Brits will have a Body Mass Index (BMI) above 40, up from 1.9 million in 2015. Last month the government revealed a series of new proposals to tackle childhood obesity including tougher restrictions on supermarkets displaying unhealthy foods at checkouts, banning sales of energy drinks to children and a 9pm watershed for advertising unhealthy food on television."
2018-07-20,The proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) has sparked a bitter divide between the trans community and groups of feminists across the country.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180720041801/https://news.sky.com/story/line-18-gender-debate-sparks-bitter-divide-among-trans-and-feminist-groups-11439676,"At one protest in Newcastle, the frustration was palpable. Protesters, who chanted ""transphobia has got to go"", were upset about a meeting of feminists taking place to discuss their concerns about the reforms to the law. A protester told Sky News: ""No one has the right to tell you how to identify, that is up to you. These groups, they sit and perpetuate hateful rhetoric."" But feminist campaigner Dr Heather Brunskell-Evans, who was speaking at the event having written a book on transgender children, has found herself at the centre of this conflict and warned free speech was being shut down. ""I'm absolutely shocked at the level of vitriol, the level of silencing. Even asking for a discussion is considered transphobic,"" she said. Describing the aggression she had come up against from trans activists, she highlighted one meeting where she was blocked from entering. ""I don't like being on a stairwell where I'm frightened that I'm going to be pushed down by a man in a balaclava and a mask, who's telling me that he is a woman and that if I don't accept that, I'm a Nazi - it's extremely frightening,"" she said. ""Why do I do this? Not because I'm transphobic and illiberal... we shouldn't have anything that we are frightened to speak about, I'm flagging this up as a societal problem. I don't think trans women are women. My values are in line with protecting girls."" The government consultation taking place this summer is to update the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, and the real fly in the ointment is the idea of self-identification - essentially the trans community want to make transitioning less bureaucratic. The current law requires a doctor's diagnosis of gender dysphoria, that you have lived in your preferred gender for two years, are assessed by a panel of medical experts, and that you pay around Â£140. It is a process described by many trans people as onerous. Although Elijah Harris has fully transitioned, he has not bothered getting a gender recognition certificate. ""If you think about what someone has to go through after everything they've already been though, it seems old fashioned and quite sad,"" he said. The government estimates there are up to 500,000 trans people living in the UK, and Sky News research shows 12,253 people were seen at NHS gender identity clinics last year in England alone, but only 4,910 gender certificates have ever been issued since the GRA introduced them in 2004. The idea now is to do away with the assessment and reduce the admin, allowing self-identification to obtain a gender recognition certificate. However, staunch feminist campaigners such as Dr Nicola Williams argue the public have not been given enough information to fully understand what is at stake. She said self-identification could be abused, that it could compromise female-only spaces and described the debate as ""an urgent fight for women's rights"". ""I've got no problem with trans people living in role as a woman because gender dysphoria is real,"" she said. ""But there are times when biological sex does matter for safeguarding, privacy and dignity, fairness in sports for example, and that's when the sex of a person must be acknowledged, in a society where we have checks and balances so people don't abuse the system. ""Essentially any man could change his birth certificate whether trans or not and that's the issue, that is why this is a bad law, because it's open to abuse."" And that fear of the system being abused is what the Man Friday group campaigns to highlight. It holds meetings and stages stunts to publicise the cause - that it thinks the proposed change in law is ludicrous, potentially dangerous, and an attack on women's rights. Sky News joined Hannah Clarke from Man Friday at a stunt in Hampstead, London, where her group claimed to be self-identifying as men in order to swim in the male-only swimming pool. Ms Clarke said: ""We protest against bathrooms and changing rooms but they aren't really the problem, it's where women are really vulnerable, that's the issue - prisons, hospital, refuges. ""It's been in the news hasn't it that Ian Huntley wants to identify as a woman and be transferred to a female prison... if anyone can be a woman, what is to protect a woman in a woman's space?"" At a rally of feminists in Hyde Park, one woman was attacked by a trans activist. It went to court and charges were brought against her attacker, but Maria MacLachlan said the ordeal made her all the more passionate about campaigning for women's rights. ""My anger could lift a bus"" she said. And although she accepts gender dysphoria a real and serious thing, Ms MacLachlan does not believe trans women should have the rights of people born into female body. ""The most they can be is trans women,"" she said. At another feminist meeting, you could hear the chorus from trans protesters outside chanting ""No TERFS on our turf"". TERF stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist. It is what the trans activists have branded the feminists they say campaign against their very existence. ""I've had abuse for what I do, been called a TERF... it's the age old practise to silence women, it's used to instil fear,"" said Dr Williams. She said it was crucial all women - not just trans women - are involved in the debate over the government consultation over the GRA without fear of being accused of transphobia. ""It's not right that we should be silenced,"" she added. Sky News struggled to find transgender people to comment on the issue. Many were afraid of the repercussions, and many refused to go on record alongside the feminists they said denies their very existence. Jess Bradley, the NUS trans officer in Manchester, identifies as a non-binary woman, and said it was a ""hostile time"" for the trans community, saying people were ""very scared"". ""I know simply by doing this piece of media, I will be hounded on social media, it will have a real material impact on my life,"" she said. ""One of the things about the gender recognition debate is it's given licence to anti-trans activists to feminists using this is an excuse to debate our existence and trans issues in general, in a way that has felt very violent. ""It feels extremely painful to have a group of people campaigning against your participation in every day life."" Ms Bradley dismissed the claim that self-identification could lead to female-only spaces being compromised. ""If you wanted to go into a female changing room to attack a woman you'd just do it... we've had the Equality Act for the last eight years and that is the act that allows trans people to enter women's spaces. That's a long time for these abuses to take place but they haven't, the evidence isn't there. ""Trans people are vulnerable and disproportionately need access to those services [rape and domestic abuse centres] in a safe and trans-friendly way."" The British Social Attitudes Survey, an annual study of public beliefs carried out by NatCen, has been looking at opinions about transgender people. They gave this year's findings exclusively to Sky News. In general they reveal that people, especially women, appear to be more relaxed about those who are transgender. Activist Susan Pascoe has fully transitioned - and because of long NHS waiting lists, travelled to India for reassignment surgery. Ms Pascoe also changed her gender legally on paper so she can marry as a woman and her death certificate will state female. She said this was not a case of feminist rights verses trans rights. ""Feminists are standing up for their rights, and yet they want to deny us our rights, and all we want to do is be ourselves,"" she said. The government consultation on the proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 will take place over the summer. You can watch the Line 18 special programme on the debate on Sky News. :: Line 18 is a journey through modern Britain in 2018.

He also said he had warned Vladimir Putin to stay out of American elections. ""I let him know we can't have this,"" he said of the pair's meeting in Helsinki on Monday. ""We're not going to have it, and that's the way it's going to be."" The admission is the latest in a series of reversals in Mr Trump's assessment of Vladimir Putin and Russian meddling. When asked by reporters a few hours earlier if the US was still being targeted by Russia, he had answered ""no"". This was a belief that put him at odds with his intelligence chiefs. But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said hours later that she had talked with the president and he had instead been saying ""no"" to taking further questions from reporters. When asked if she was reversing what the president had said, she answered: ""I'm interpreting it, not reversing it."" The White House has struggled to contain the fallout from a news conference from Helsinki, in which Mr Trump, standing next to Mr Putin, said he ""didn't see any reason"" why Russia would be involved in US election meddling. The basis for the assessment, despite what he said was ""great confidence"" in his intelligence agencies, was that Mr Putin had given an ""extremely strong and powerful"" denial. The comments prompted bipartisan bemusement and fury. The next day, Mr Trump claimed he had misspoke, and had intended to say he did not see any reason why Russian wouldn't be responsible for interfering in the 2016 vote. ""In a key sentence in my remarks I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't',"" he said. ""I thought it would be obvious but would like to clarify in case it wasn't."" In the Wednesday interview Mr Trump continued with his changing assertions, saying he would hold Putin personally responsible for future election interference."
2018-07-20,Israel has approved a controversial law that defines the country as the nation-state of the Jewish people - leading to accusations that it discriminates against Arabs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180720041801/https://news.sky.com/story/israel-approves-contentious-jewish-nation-state-law-angering-arabs-11441345,"The Jewish Nation-State Bill, passed just after the state marked the 70th anniversary of its birth, was hailed as a ""defining moment in the annals of Zionism"" by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But critics, including many Arabs, however, said it was racist and discriminatory, planting the seeds of an ""apartheid state"". The law, backed by the right-wing government, was passed with a 62-55 vote and two abstentions in the 120-member parliament, after months of political argument. Some Arab MPs shouted and ripped up papers after the vote. The bill enshrines Hebrew as the only official language of the state, stripping Arabic of that status, and names Jewish settlement as a priority. Mr Netanyahu said the bill was about defending the Jewish character of the state, which was established in 1948 as a homeland for the Jewish people, ""for generations to come"". ""We will keep ensuring civil rights in Israel's democracy but the majority also has rights and the majority decides,"" he said. About 20% of Israel's population of nine million are Arab, with an additional 2.8m Palestinians living in the Israel-occupied West Bank and about 1.7m in the Gaza strip. Arabs living in Israel - descendants of those who stayed after many were expelled from historic Palestine in 1948 - have equal legal rights, but they say they are discriminated against in areas such as work, housing and education. Recent high-profile cases of Arab bedouin villages being demolished to make way for Jewish majority towns, and warnings by the government of a demographic threat have drawn attention to Arab complaints. Adalah, a legal centre for Arabs living in Israel, called the law ""illegitimate"" and ""colonial"". It said it ""seeks to maintain a regime in which one ethnic-national group controls an indigenous-national group living in the same territory while advancing ethnic superiority by promoting racist policies"". Months of debate preceded the law's approval, with previous versions of the bill including sections that instructed courts to rule according to Jewish law when there was no legal precedent and which explicitly allowed establishment of Jewish-only communities. That was replaced by a vaguer clause which said it would ""encourage and promote"" Jewish settlement, after Israeli President Reuven Rivlin voiced fears it would lead to ""discrimination and exclusion"". Mr Rivlin was one of many Jewish Israelis who objected to the law, and thousands protested the proposed legislation under the banner ""this is home for all of us"" in Tel Aviv last week."
2018-07-20,"The manufacturer of a groundbreaking cystic fibrosis drug has accused the NHS of ""undervaluing"" the lives of patients after failing to reach a supply deal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180720041801/https://news.sky.com/story/orkambi-drugs-maker-says-nhs-undervalues-patient-lives-11442845,"US pharmaceuticals company Vertex has called on the NHS to return to the negotiating table after price negotiations over its drug Orkambi broke down. In an unusual development, details of the negotiations have become public in an increasingly bad-tempered row. Vertex has been accused of blackmail by MPs after its chief executive wrote to the prime minister suggesting he might reduce investment in the UK if the drug was not made available on the NHS. Earlier this week, the company dismissed an NHS offer worth Â£500m over five years and up to Â£1bn over 10 years, but now say they want to reopen negotiations. Orkambi's list price is Â£104,000 per-patient per-year, and Vertex says the NHS offer is worth just Â£14,000 per head. The NHS has also proposed including two drugs in development in the deal. ""If you look at the offer the NHS has made, essentially they are asking for a 90% a discount for our current and future medicines compared to what the German government is paying for Orkambi, our approved medicine,"" Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex's chief commercial officer, told Sky News. ""We think that is a clear demonstration that the NHS is undervaluing the benefits these medicines can have for people living with cystic fibrosis. ""We have formally requested that Simon Stevens, head of the NHS, meet with our chief executive Jeff Leiden in the hope that we can bring this to successful conclusion for CF patients in the UK."" Orkambi is the first drug to treat the underlying condition rather than just the symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a result of a genetic mutation that causes the lungs to produce too much mucus, but Orkambi has been shown to significantly improve lung function. There are around 10,000 people with the condition in the UK, around 12% of the global total, making it a crucial market for Vertex. Orkambi was rejected for general NHS prescription by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which ruled its pricing was ""unsupportable"" in 2016. Since then the NHS and Vertex have been trying to reach a deal at a price the health service believes it can afford. The UK is not the only country that has failed to reach a deal for Orkambi. Australia, Canada and some US states, including New York, have baulked at the price. Vertex counter that Ireland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have all agreed deals for their patient populations. The dispute highlights the ongoing challenge for the NHS and other public health systems in meeting the cost of ever-more complex treatments as well as rising demand. NHS England has reached discounted deals in the last year for new lung and breast cancer drugs, but is currently not indicating it will move on Orkambi. A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""This country has a long established, internationally-respected independent body NICE which recommends whether or not a drug company is proposing a fair price. NICE has been clear that Vertex's pricing is unsupportable. ""If Vertex really believe they are offering a reasonable deal they should waive their confidentiality clause and let patients and taxpayers judge whether it is fair."""

Winchester Crown Court was told that Crichton had used the dark web to access the website of the ""Chechen mob"", where he selected an order to ""kill the bastard"" and agreed a price of Â£3,800 to be paid in bitcoin. The 64-year-old is also facing three charges of sending a malicious communication - two texts and one phone call - with the aim of making Mr Bolden fear he would kill himself. Crichton denies all four charges. Prosecutor Simon Jones said officers from the National Crime Agency had been monitoring the dark web page Crime Bay By Chechen Mob when they found the order to kill Mr Bolden. Crichton had used a special browser on his computer and created an account on the website, Mr Jones added. Other options were ""beat the s*** out of (the victim)"", ""set his car on fire"", and ""set his house on fire"". Mr Jones said: ""The defendant's intention could not be clearer. ""The steps he took were very clearly an attempt to solicit, ask for, request, seek a murder."" Crichton had a Â£1.8m pension when he met Mr Bolden, who worked for London-based private bank Brown Shipley, in September 2011. Mr Bolden was paid to give investment advice to the GP, with an agreement for further advice in future. The prosecutor said: ""Dr Crichton delayed some aspects of his advice, he missed certain deadlines and incurred a tax penalty."" Crichton complained to the financial regulator but Mr Bolden's advice was found to have been correct. Mr Jones said Crichton sent his financial adviser hundreds of emails and on 4 February last year he sent a text saying: ""I am contacting you out of desperation, I believe you are the only person who can help save my life."" Crichton is alleged to have then called Mr Bolden to say his ""life is at risk"". He is alleged to have sent another text on 4 March, saying: ""I remain desperate to speak to you and since you know my life is at risk I can't believe you are obstructing me in this."" The court heard that Crichton told police he had been ""drunk and feeling suicidal"" when we went on the website. He had become obsessed with hitmen but had ""thought it was a game and it wasn't real"". The trial continues."
2018-07-20,Two children have fallen victim to separate shark attacks off the coast of New York - the first time such incidents have been reported in the area in seventy years.Â ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180720041801/https://news.sky.com/story/two-children-fall-victim-to-first-new-york-shark-attacks-in-70-years-11441331,"A 12-year-old girl and 13-year-old boy were bitten on the legs miles apart from each other on Wednesday. The incidents resulted in some beaches being closed, and two sharks were reported to have been caught nearby later in the day - although they were not confirmed to be the creatures responsible. The girl, Lola Pollina, told a press conference she had been standing waist deep in the water, and rushed back to the shore with a bloody leg after she had been bitten. ""I saw something, like, next to me, and I kind of felt pain, and looked and I saw a fin,"" she said of the attack, at Sailors Haven in Brookhaven. ""I thought it was a shark, because we were at the beach, so it wasn't like it could have been a tiger or something."" Lola believed the animal that bit her had been around 90cm-122cm (3-4ft) long. Around 40 species of shark now live off the UK coast - but warming waters are likely to increase the variety in coming decades. Shark attacks are extremely rare in the waters of Fire Island, where the attack took place, and indeed anywhere else around New York. Ian Levine, chief of the Ocean Beach fire department, said only ten cases of shark bites have been reported of New York State. The last incident was in 1948, he said. A tooth was extracted from the leg of the boy, who was boogie-boarding two miles away at Atlantique beach when he was bitten. The tooth will now be analysed to identify the species of the attacker. Experts have said both the tooth and the bite marks on the girl's leg were ""consistent with a large fish""."

Eight awards have been given to police officers and everyday heroes who were involved during the June 2017 London Bridge and Borough Market terror attack. Ignacio Echeverria, a 39-year-old Spanish banker, died whilst trying to defend a woman from the terrorists, armed with only his skateboard. He was posthumously awarded the George Medal, one of the highest accolades for a civilian. PC Wayne Marques, a British Transport Police Officer, and PC Charles Guenigault, from the Metropolitan Police, also receive the George Medal. PC Guenigault was off-duty when he saw the attack happening. Without any protection, he ran towards the armed three terrorists and confronted them, sustaining serious injuries. ""It's a very, very proud moment,"" said PC Guenigault. ""Not just for me, I hope it's a proud moment for my family and my friends as well."" PC Marques, who was on-duty at the time of attack, took on the terrorists armed with just a baton. He too was seriously injured but caused enough of a distraction to the attackers to allow others around him to escape. ""It was pretty much a horror story that night,"" PC Marques told Sky News. ""But as time goes on and you have time to reflect on some of the great stories, not just your own but of other people that were there and involved that night."" ""For every evil that was done that night there were some fantastic stories of bravery and courage."" Australian nurse Kirsty Boden is also recognised with the Queen's Commendation For Bravery. Ms Boden was giving first aid to victims at the scene when she was fatally stabbed. Her family said they were ""very proud"". Also on the Queen's List, but not involved in the London Bridge attack, were British backpackers Thomas Jackson and Daniel Richards. In August 2016, the two men tried to defend a fellow backpacker, Mia Ayliffe-Chung, during a knife attack. Mr Richards managed to escape but Mr Jackson died of his injuries. Mr Jackson's family described the posthumous award as ""clearly a bittersweet moment"". ""We are inestimably proud and grateful that his actions in trying to protect Mia on that awful day have been recognised in this way.

At the invitation of Guernsey's Lieutenant-Governor, the soldiers spent two weeks pressure washing and repairing headstones with supervision from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is the first time German military have been in uniform on the island since the wartime occupation, which lasted until 1945. The Channel Islands were left defenceless at the beginning of World War Two and were invaded in June 1940, the only part of the British Isles to fall under German control during the conflict. Thousands of islanders were evacuated to the UK and for those who remained, life was very difficult. When the German volunteers, all from NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps in Gloucestershire, arrived on the island this month they may not have been sure of what to expect - but all were welcomed by the islanders. German Captain Sebastian KÃ¼hne, from the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, said: ""When we arrived on Guernsey we had a very warm reaction - so many people supporting us and they offered their spare time to help us with our endeavours, providing us with tools, and showing us around the island. ""I feel very touched to work on the graveyard and see the names of the British and German soldiers that died here because they are very young, most younger than me."" German businessman Johann Andreas Werhahn, whose father served as a corporal during the German occupation, travelled from northern Germany to be part of the event. He said: ""I'm thankful that my father came back home. ""He rarely spoke about the war but he told us he was in Guernsey."" Guernsey resident Graham Williams welcomed the return of German troops to the island, saying: ""Some people here have long memories, but the majority of people say it's over and done with and it's part of our history."" Major Laurence Roche, from NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, said: ""There are people alive on Guernsey who still remember the occupation, but most islanders feel than an appropriate amount of time has now passed. ""The German soldiers who have been invited to be here are our friends and allies, and they have been touched by the reception that have received from the people they've met."" There are 111 German war graves in the cemetery, and Maj Roche said: ""It's very unusual to have German and British World War Two headstones in the same military cemetery and this represents the unique history of the island."""

This figure excludes cases linked to terror attacks and the Hillsborough disaster. Knife crime has also continued to rise, with police recording 40,147 offences. When it came to overall crime, forces logged a total of 5.5 million offences, a rise of a 11% compared with the previous year. There was also a 2% increase in gun crime, with 6,492 offences recorded. A rise in violent crime in London has sparked concerns about the capital's rising murder rate The number of robberies recorded by the police increased by 30%. and there was a 17% rise in thefts from vehicles. Although there has been a long-term downward trend in burglaries and robberies, crimes involving mopeds may have contributed to an increase in some types of theft. Computer crime saw a 31% drop largely because of a decrease in viruses. The Office for National Statistics, which published the figures, said: ""Over recent decades, we've seen a fall in overall levels of crime, a trend that now looks to be stabilising."" The figures also show that 48% of investigations into recorded crimes are closed without a suspect being identified. Caroline Youell, of the ONS, said most people do not experience crime. She said: ""Today's figures show a fairly stable picture in England and Wales for most crime types. ""It is too early to say if this is a change to the long-term declining trend. ""There have been increases in some lower-volume ""high-harm"" offences such as homicide and knife crime, consistent with rises over the past three years."" Alex Mayes, policy and public affairs adviser for charity Victim Support, said: ""It's truly shocking to see these rises in homicides and violent crime such as knife crime. ""While overall crime levels are generally stable, these increases in some high harm crimes are concerning. ""Too many lives are being shattered by these violent crimes."""

Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: ""Unfortunately the Cau brand has struggled in the oversupplied casual dining sector with rapid overexpansion, poor site selection, onerous lease arrangements and a fundamentally poor guest proposition all being factors in its underperformance. ""As such, the decision has been made to close this loss-making part of the group with immediate effect, unfortunately resulting in today's redundancies."" Mr Smith added that Gaucho was still trading well and had strong customer loyalty. The restaurant group has 1,305 employees in total: 540 at Cau, 714 at Gaucho and 51 at the company's head office. The announcement comes a day after Sky News revealed that Gaucho had filed a notice to appoint administrators. Gaucho is the latest in a lengthening line of casual dining chains facing tough conditions on the high street. The steak restaurant group joins the likes of Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian, which have all shut restaurants and axed hundreds of jobs this year. London food chain Hummus Bros also went into administration this summer. Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at real estate adviser Altus Group, said: ""There has been huge growth in the casual dining market with restaurant numbers up 16% overall since 2010. ""The race for space has pushed up rents impacting on rateable values. ""Extra tax for business rates coupled with rising food prices and staff costs through increases in both the national and minimum wages are creating a potentially lethal cocktail as margins are squeezed."""

UK sports retail sales fell 2% to Â£2.2bn while its wholesale and licensing division saw revenues tumble almost 23% to Â£186.3m. It was the write-down on the value of its Debenhams holdings that caught the eye. Sports Direct chief executive and majority shareholder Mr Ashley began building a 29.7% stake in the department store chain in 2017 - stopping short of the 30% threshold that would require moves towards a takeover. Debenhams has since bled market value - down 64% in the year to date alone - amid the pressures that have been facing the high street. A surge in costs from wage rules, business rates and rents have combined with tougher times for shoppers to squeeze their finances. :: Debenhams shares slide on credit insurer woes Sports Direct chairman, Keith Hellawell, said: ""In terms of statutory reporting, our profit before taxation has reduced by 72.5%, which arises predominantly from the profit on sale of the Dunlop business and the profit on the sale of JD Sports shares included in the results for the prior period and the recognition of the net losses on our strategic investment in Debenhams in the current period."" Mr Ashley and Mr Hellawell have been working to turn around Sports Direct's image since 2016, when allegations of dire working conditions and poor pay practices at its Shirebrook warehouse sparked condemnation from shareholders and politicians.

Sports Direct shares fell as much as 11% in early trading on Thursday despite signs the company was escaping the worst of the trouble on the UK high street - its main market. They regained some ground by closing, down 7%. Chief Financial Officer John Kempster told Sky News he expected its market value to reflect the underlying strength of the business over time. ""Our retail margins are static but there are tougher times ahead"", he said, saying Brexit was ""an interesting one"" and that the company was hedged against the dollar for the next couple of years."" ""We're well cushioned"", he added. Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, said of the company's trading figures: ""Underlying earnings before nasties of Â£306m was at the top end of its guidance and ahead of market consensus. ""Underlying profits after tax were up sizeably at Â£105m. Revenues were a tad soft but Premium Lifestyle - think Selfridges of Sport - were 43% higher at Â£162.1m.

The most serious point of contention is the right to self-identify as a woman - rather than go through the lengthy assessment and medical diagnosis currently required to obtain a recognition certificate and legally change your gender. Elijah Harris, a transgender man, makes a compelling case for why the process should be simplified. Although he had surgery to fully transition, Elijah hasn't bothered getting a gender recognition certificate because the process is so arduous. ""If you think about what someone has to go through after everything they've already been through, it seems old fashioned and quite sad,"" he said. When we started researching this story, we had no idea of the depth of distress and anger we would encounter. Initially, no one on either side was prepared to speak to us - scared of repercussions and reticent about being misrepresented in such a polarised debate. Many transgender people refused to go on record alongside the feminist campaigners who they say deny their very existence. Jess Bradley, the transgender officer for the National Union of Students, identifies as a non-binary woman and was one of the few trans women prepared to speak on camera. She said her community feels under siege and is subject to abuse, which she says has risen sharply since the debate started. ""It's a hostile time, trans people are very scared... I know simply by doing this piece of media, I will be hounded on social media, it will have a real material impact on my life,"" she said. ""One of the things about the gender recognition debate is it's given licence to anti-trans activists using this is an excuse to debate our existenceâ¦ in a way that has felt very violent. ""It feels extremely painful to have a group of people campaigning against your participation in everyday life."" :: Opinion - ""We need to combat moral hysteria over gender recognition"" Proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) has sparked a ferocious debate between the trans community and feminist groups She is talking about the so called gender critical feminists. This is a group of women who are worried that the right to self-identify - essentially ticking a box to become a woman as they see it - is open to abuse, compromising female-only spaces and eroding women's rights. We were shocked at the vitriol expressed online from both sides of this conflict. The extremity of feeling and hatred appears to be making any kind of reasonable discussion around the subject seem impossible. My first real experience of the feminists at the heart of this feud was at a meeting in Basingstoke run by a group called A Woman's Place, set up by women from across the country to discuss their concerns. The majority of the women we met were ordinary, sensible and sympathetic individuals who were genuinely concerned about protecting the rights of women and girls. They voiced concerns about men abusing self-identification to gain access to women's spaces such as refuges and prisons, and the need for women to feel safe and enjoy the rights they have fought so hard, and so long for. They too were scared of repercussions and worried about the abuse they would face for flagging their concerns. We travelled to another feminist meeting with Dr Heather Brunskell Evans, a writer and academic who was speaking at the event. She said she was not against the proposed changes to the GRA in principle, but felt angry that free speech is being curtailed and women are being silenced with accusations of transphobia. The government's LGBT action plan in detail Dr Nicola Williams is another staunch feminist embroiled in the debate. She warns that a system which allows anyone to self-certify as women would be open to abuse, and that it would amount to an attack on women's rights. But all the trans men and women we spoke to were at pains to stress that for them, there is nothing theoretical about this issue. Far from theory, this is their reality. The misunderstanding and misinformation surrounding the GRA and self-identification makes everyday life even harder for a group of people already subject to prejudice and abuse. They point out that the Equalities Act is the law that allows trans people to use the facilities appropriate to their preferred gender. So for many years trans people have been using changing rooms, toilets and women's services such as rape centres - and there is no evidence to suggest that there has been any problem with this at all. The British Social Attitudes Survey, an annual study of public beliefs carried out by NatCen, gave this year's findings on attitudes to transgender people exclusively to Sky News. In general, the public seem to be liberal with 84% claiming not to be prejudiced at all against trans people. They also found 72% of women said they are comfortable with a trans woman using a female public toilet, and 65% of men comfortable.Those at the heart of this battle are polarised, utterly distressed and offended by the opposite side. But this affects us all when it thrusts questions over gender, rights, and who gets to be a woman into the spotlight."

The suspected gunman shot his victim in the head outside a cafe, before fleeing the scene on a bicycle taxi, going toward the Dam square. He was caught on CCTV and police have released images to help locate him. Witnesses say he spoke with a north west accent, possibly Manchester or Merseyside. Police believe as the victim was from Manchester, the gunman may have links with the area. The victim, who survived his injuries, is originally from the Sale area of Manchester but now lives in the Netherlands. He is in a stable condition in hospital. Jayne Lloyd, North West Branch Commander, said: ""The attack took place in a public area. This man is clearly very dangerous, which is why we need to identify him quickly and make sure he cannot harm anyone else. ""Witnesses say he spoke English with either a Merseyside or Manchester accent, which is what leads our Dutch colleagues to suspect that somebody here in the north west knows his identity. ""Someone knows who this is, and anyone with information about this man or his whereabouts should contact the NCA on 0370 496 7622 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

But there is expected to be cloud and rain in the North West. Sky News weather producer Jo Robinson said: ""There has been a slight dip in temperatures over the last few days, but the heat is set to build again. ""Temperatures could reach 30C in the Southeast over the weekend, with the low to mid-twenties likely in the North. ""Early next week, it'll turn even hotter in the South, but cloud and rain will keep parts of the Northwest cooler."" She added: ""As the heat builds here, sadly Iceland will have another cool and wet weekend; a country that is experiencing one of its worst summers."" On Wednesday, Met Office forecasters announced this summer ""could well be record-breaking"" for the UK if the rest of the season remains above average. The highest temperature recorded in the UK this year was in Porthmadog in Wales, which reached 33C (91.4F) on 28 June. It could also be one of the five sunniest summers on record if the UK sees an average amount of sunshine through August. Met Office meteorologist Dean Hall said: ""The last heatwave ended with a temperature breakdown, but it looks as though we are going back into the heat again. ""The heat will be building into the weekend and early next week. ""But with the increasing heat and humidity there's always a chance of one or two thunderstorms."" Some rain is expected in Northwest Scotland and Northwest Ireland on Thursday afternoon, with possible showers in Eastern England. The prolonged rain in the North West will move further south overnight, affecting Wales and Central and southwest England on Friday. A Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning is in place for the South East between 2pm and 11.59pm on Friday, as the increasing heat and humidity could trigger some lively storms. The warmer weather has provoked plans for a hosepipe ban which is set to affect millions in the North West in the coming weeks. Despite downpours in the region earlier in the week, water restrictions by United Utilities are still expected to come into place."

The investigation is being carried out by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and is centred on claims ""potentially conflicted"" senior officers within the DPS interfered with and curtailed investigations, or failed to look at alleged wrongdoing altogether. The inquiry is believed to be at a relatively early stage, but so far gross misconduct notices have been served on three officers, one of whom is also under criminal investigation. A number of other officers are also being assessed and could face a more detailed investigation. In a brief statement, the Met said it was ""fully co-operating"" with the IOPC's investigation into allegations against ""a number of Metropolitan Police service personnel"". Jonathan Green, the IOPC's London director, said the watchdog was also investigating claims of racial discrimination within the DPS. Mr Green said: ""I can confirm we have begun an investigation into allegations of serious corruption and malpractice within the directorate of professional standards of the Metropolitan Police. ""The investigation includes alleged interference in, and curtailment of, investigations by potentially conflicted senior officers, failure to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, systemic removal of the restrictions of officers under investigation and racial discrimination."" The Sunday Times has reported that ""three whistleblowers"" from the force approached the IOPC to allege members of the DPS were shielding officers from a range of allegations. The Met said the force had referred allegations regarding the conduct of a number of MPS personnel to the independent police watchdog."

The boat was escorted to Newlyn in the county, with the National Crime Agency calling the operation a ""signficant seizure of cocaine"". It was listed in court that at least 1.6 tons of cocaine has been removed from the boat, but the exact quantity recovered has not been disclosed. The amount has been described as one of the biggest ever hauls of cocaine off the coast of the UK. Pieterse and Schoemaker appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court via videolink from Camborne, Cornwall, for their brief hearing. The pair are accused of being ""knowingly concerned in the carrying or concealing of controlled drug of Class A, namely cocaine, on the SY Marcia knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that the drug was intended to be imported or had been exported contrary to Section 3(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act"". Pieterse and Schoemaker spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth, Dutch nationalities and to say they did not have UK addresses. Andy Young, prosecuting, said: ""The searches are ongoing and therefore more may be on there. Two crew members were on board."" Solicitors representing the two defendants did not make bail applications and they were remanded in custody until a hearing at Bristol Crown Court on 20 August."
2018-07-22,"A parliamentary inquiry sparked by a Sky News investigation on the fur industry has found ""complacent"" retailers and poor labelling legislation are failing consumers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180722222540/https://news.sky.com/story/complacent-retailers-failing-over-fur-say-mps-11444897,"The environment, food and rural affairs select committee has concluded that the ""current labelling system is confusing, not fit for purpose and with a high degree of non compliance. It is also not being enforced"". The cross-party group of MPs has also ""recommended the government holds a public consultation to consider whether to ban fur"". The political inquiry was initiated after a series of reports on Sky News revealed major high street stores were mis-selling real animal fur as synthetic. Products advertised as ""faux"" fur were tested by a fibres expert and found to in fact be rabbit, mink, fox, raccoon dog, and most consistent with cat. :: Real animal fur sold as fake on British high street :: More 'fur free' retailers found selling rabbit and fox fur Sky News was invited to give evidence in parliament about our findings - as were bosses from the major retailers we featured, including House of Fraser, Missguided and Boohoo. All the retailers highlighted say they have strict no-fur policies, would never knowingly mislead customers, and removed the items once we notified them The committee's report, published today, notes that many retailers told them there had been a ""lack of knowledge about why a supply chain would be contaminated with real fur and this was only something that came to light with the Sky News inquiry"". The chairman of the inquiry, Neil Parish MP, said: ""Sky News brought it to our attention that there was real fur being sold as fake fur. ""We found the retailers were not finding the real fur, trading standards were not fit for purpose and we want to see a public consultation done by the government on whether in the future we should actually ban fur."" The charity Humane Society International (HSI) argues that having banned fur farms in the UK in 2000 on ethical grounds it is ""morally inconsistent"" to import foreign farmed fur. HSI UK executive director Claire Bass said: ""The UK was the first country in the world to ban fur farming, after the British public, politicians and veterinary experts concluded that it is an inhumane and completely unnecessary industry. ""So it is total double standard for us to still be importing and selling fur from animals still suffering the same conditions we banned here. ""The UK government has the opportunity to blaze a trail as the first country to ban the sale of all animal fur, so we are delighted that EFRA committee members are pressing government to launch a public consultation to help inform and build that case."" Last month, the Labour Party announced it would back a fur imports ban. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News: ""Labour are committed, we are going to ban imports. But we think there is enough support in other political parties to put pressure on the government to move, just as we did on the ivory trade."" Over 100,000 members of the public signed a petition triggering a debate on banning fur in parliament last month. Another 400,000-strong petition was handed in to Downing Street by Queen guitarist and animal rights campaigner Brian May. But the British Fur Trade Association believes ""it is a matter of consumer choice to wear fur or not"". Its CEO Mike Moser said: ""I welcome the recommendations of EFRA select committee. ""They represent a sensible, proportionate and pragmatic way to address the problem of misselling of both fake and real fur in the UK. ""The committee agreed with our call for stronger enforcement by Trading Standards and clearer labelling to help consumers make the right buying decision."" ""The committee does not support calls for a trade ban but instead recommends a consultation on the issue. They also recognise that animal welfare concerns should be balanced by consumer choice."" Michael Kors, Gucci, Versace, and Jimmy Choo have all banned fur in recent years, joining other top designers including Hugo Boss, Armani, and Tommy Hilfiger in opting for synthetic materials. Charlie Gowans-Eglinton, senior fashion editor at The Telegraph, says British fashion has made a strong shift away from fur, driven by British consumers. She told Sky News: ""A lot of magazines in the UK won't shoot fur at all, and haven't shot fur for some years. ""Even the stores are taking note of this. Selfridges stopped selling fur in 2004, Net a Porter stopped - last year was when they made the announcement - but for years before that you wouldn't be able to find any on their site. ""Even if designers make fur, they will find they can't sell it in the UK."" A government spokesperson said it shared ""the public's high regard for animal welfare"". They added: ""Trade in fur from domestic cats, dogs or commercial seal hunts are also banned, but while the UK is a member of the EU it is not possible to introduce additional restrictions on the fur trade. ""Brexit gives us the opportunity to go further. Meanwhile, we will closely consider the committee's report and respond in due course."""

A 16-year-old boy appeared in court earlier this month charged with her rape and murder. Scores of people gathered for the little girl's funeral in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, on Saturday, with many mourners dressed in pink at the family's request. A pink coffin featured an image of a unicorn on the side. Dozens of bows were tied to the railings of the building, while cuddly toys including teddies and unicorns lined the wall outside. During the service mourners heard tributes from people close to Alesha including an emotional speech from her uncle Calum MacPhail. He said: ""Alesha is everything that I wanted to be, she was kind, caring, smart, I just cannot believe she is gone. ""She was the brightest thing."" Toni McLachlan, the girlfriend of Alesha's dad Robert, gave a tribute, saying: ""Alesha, you meant the world to us and everyone you knew. ""That cute, wee face, your hair so blonde, your eyes so sparkly blue. ""Sleep tight, little angel."" Calum was comforted by Alesha's mother, Georgina Lochrane, known as Genie, as he returned to his seat near Alesha's father Robert, little sister Courtney, aged four, and other family members. Staff from Chapelside Primary School in nearby Airdrie, where Alesha was a pupil, also paid tribute. Her class teacher Emma Gibson said: ""Alesha was a bright and bubbly little girl, she always came into class with that big beautiful smile of hers. ""It was an absolute pleasure to have taught Alesha. I'm so grateful to have known this special little girl."" She added that Alesha loved working on her literacy and handwriting and enjoyed performing in school shows such as The Lion King. Headteacher Wendy Davie said: ""May your smile shine brightly wherever you are, you will always be remembered as our Chapelside star."" The service was led by funeral director Fraser MacGregor, who said Alesha was the ""best big sister, best daughter, best granddaughter and friend that anyone could have asked for"". He said that Alesha will always be remembered as a ""very loving girl, friendly, good natured and full of love"" who enjoyed everything from doing gymnastics and riding her bike to baking cakes, listening to music and watching Peppa Pig. Mr MacGregor also said that Alesha was fascinated by bubbles and had always wanted a bubble party on her birthday. As music played at the end of the service, a bubble machine sent bubbles drifting above the mourners' heads. People lined the street as the hearse set off for Coltswood Cemetery, followed by two black carriages carrying flowers, and family members in cars."

Paid-for channels Gold, Alibi, Eden, Good Food and W have also been dropped.

On-demand and catch-up programming for the channels will also no longer be available for Virgin customers. Come on Virgin sort it out before Red Dwarf XIII is confirmed !! David Bouchier, chief digital entertainment officer at Virgin Media, said the decision to remove UKTV was due to ""restrictions put on UKTV by the BBC"" with regard to on-demand programming. He said replacement programming was being offered in place of the lost channels. UKTV's comedy and entertainment channel head, Steve North, posted a video on Twitter apologising to disappointed subscribers, but said the ""significant"" drop in fees being offered to them by Virgin would no longer allow UKTV to ""to invest in the shows and channels that you love"".

Relatives said the last contact they had with her was at 10pm through Snapchat. They knew something was wrong when she failed to show up for work the next day.

Tibbetts's boyfriend, Dalton Jack, told ABC News she went for a run around 10pm.

The paper also claims Mrs Leadsom, who has publicly backed the prime minister since the summit on 6 July, attacked the Treasury's record on economic forecasting and revealed that some numbers will in future no longer be published. According to the leak, her private comments during the Chequers summit are in stark contrast to her public statements. The day after the summit she tweeted that the deal brokered by the PM was ""good for the UK"". The following day she wrote in the Sunday Express: ""This is an offer the EU must not refuse and which the country must get behind."" And three days after the summit she said in an interview: ""Theresa is absolutely sticking to delivering the will of the people."" The leaked minutes confirm a report of the summit in The Sunday Times on 8 July, which said: ""When Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the Commons, spoke she admitted, 'I hate this', but made clear to May immediately: 'I'll support you no matter what decision you take'."" Now, according to The Times, the minutes say: ""The Leader of the House of Commons said that she hated the proposal and regarded it as a breaching the government's red lines and not being true to the 17.2 million people who had voted for Brexit. ""Those people had known what they were voting for and the government could not just congratulate itself on knowing better than them. ""In her view, the majority of both ministers and civil servants had Remainer tendencies and what came with that was an arrogance that they knew better."" The Times says it understands that Mrs Leadsom is concerned about the accuracy of the minutes taken by officials at the Chequers summit and may request changes to them. The leaked minutes on her contribution to the summit continue: ""This proposal did not look like a government trying to get the best deal it could - many were already unhappy with where the government had landed on the European Union (Withdrawal) Act and the implementation period - but she knew that getting the best deal was exactly what the prime minister was trying to do. ""So she would back the proposal, but she appreciated this one opportunity to be frank about her views."" According to the minutes, Mrs Leadsom also warned: ""The government was on the slippery slope. The Commission would bank this proposition and move on. The only way to counter that was to rule out EEA and talk strongly about 'no deal'."" The minutes suggest Mrs Leadsom also called for redrafting of parts of the Brexit white paper ""to avoid the accusation of UK become a vassal state or of 'Brexit in name only'"". And on the Treasury and the pro-Remain chancellor Philip Hammond, the minutes continue: ""The Leader of the House said that economic forecasts were only ever as good as the factors that were used in them and she would wager a large sum that the chancellor's numbers were wrong. ""Others would say they were wrong so it was a massive relief that they would not be published."" Hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has since said that Britain is heading for a no-deal Brexit - and that people should not be worried about such a scenario. Speaking on LBC, he said: ""I think we are heading to World Trade Organisation (rules) and I think WTO is nothing to be frightened of."" He added: ""I don't think we necessarily need the theatrics of walking away, but the truth is that WTO is likely to be all that they will offer us."""

They started their search of public toilets yesterday and resumed the investigation earlier today. The toilets are cordoned off with protective screens, and swabs have also been taken from a park bench. Sky News' Lisa Dowd, who is at the scene, said: ""This is believed to be one of the areas where Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess visited before they fell ill. ""The forensic intensification at this scene will probably continue throughout the day."" Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were exposed to the deadly nerve agent after handling a contaminated bottle later found at Mr Rowley's home in Amesbury, near Salisbury. In March, the Wiltshire cathedral city was the scene of the novichok poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who both survived. Admitted to hospital on 30 June, Ms Sturgess, 44, later died, while Mr Rowley, 45, was discharged on Friday, three weeks after falling ill. Mr Rowley's brother, Matthew, told Sky News he was ""ecstatic"" at his brother's release from hospital, but expressed surprise at his swift recovery given only a few days previously he had still seemed very weak. Mr Rowley said: ""He's obviously improved in his condition. ""He was very weak. He could barely lift his head off the pillow. He had lots of tubes... and a lot of machines around him. ""Obviously he's stronger than I thought."" Mr Rowley said his brother's recollection of what happened was ""very vague"", but added: ""He definitely said to me that they found this bottle of something and Dawn sprayed it on her wrists and that he picked it up and broke it somehow - and that's how he got it on his hands."" Public Health England medical director Paul Cosford has said Mr Rowley's discharge from hospital does not pose a risk to the public. He added: ""Our advice to the public remains unchanged. Do not pick up any items such as syringes, needles, cosmetics or similar objects made of materials such as metal, plastic or glass. ""If you didn't drop it, then don't pick it up."" Detectives are investigating the possibility - described by Mr Rowley's brother - that Ms Sturgess tested the spray on her face and hands, believing it to be perfume. The mother-of-three's death is being treated as murder. The results of a post-mortem could help establish whether the novichok was from the same batch used to poison the Skripals. Police are believed to have identified the suspects behind the March attack."

Mrs Thatcher decided more guests were needed and a longer list of ""a possible 229 without spouses"" was drawn up - including some suggestions from former culture secretary John Whittingdale, then political secretary to the prime minister. ""He was not then the grizzled elder statesman of the present day,"" said Chris Collins, of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation. ""This was the young man whose evenings were spent watching Meat Loaf at the Hammersmith Odeon. ""His idea of a good party was to invite Paul McCartney, Freddie Mercury, the Jaggers.""

In a note to the Private Office, he wrote: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on 'our' side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard."" He explained that more than one red tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"". His absolute favourite was comedian Eric Sykes, who got four ticks. There were also ticks for Rolf Harris, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, Dame Judi Dench, Ronnie Corbett and golfers Tony Jacklin and Nick Faldo, among others. Question marks were placed beside names including Paul McCartney, Sir David Attenborough, Sebastian Coe, Shirley Bassey and Paul Daniels. In the end the longer guest list was dropped in favour of the original 45 plus the Parliamentary Skiing Team and the British Winter Olympics Squad.

It has steadily grown operating profits in recent years, with results for the 52 weeks ended 24 September showing year-on-year sales, margin and profit growth. Stonegate, which is owned by the buyout firm TDR Capital, is focused on town centres, with venues ranging from traditional community pubs to late-night bars. The company has explored a stock market listing that would have created one of the UK's biggest listed pub groups, but since deciding against doing so has continued to expand through a string of acquisitions. Last year, it fought a battle to buy Revolution Bars but ended up abandoning its interest. In addition to Be At One, Stonegate is also understood to be on the verge of at least one other significant acquisition. Its purchase of Be At One will come 20 years after the chain was founded by a trio of cocktail mixers who had worked together at TGI Friday's in London's Leicester Square. They sold a minority stake to Piper Private Equity in 2011 and last year signed a Â£20m refinancing deal with Santander UK to pave the way for the expansion of the number of sites from 33 to 70. The decision to sell their business comes at a time when a number of leisure and hospitality operators on UK high streets are facing serious hardship because of rising costs and wavering consumer confidence."

Ozil, who is of Turkish descent, cited comments from far-right politicians and football supporters when he said he would ""no longer be playing for Germany at international level whilst I have this feeling of racism and disrespect"". He added: ""Racism should never, ever be accepted."" A photograph of Ozil and Manchester City's German player Ilkay Gundogan meeting President Erdogan in London caused uproar two months ago. Gundogan is also of Turkish descent. Reinhard Grindel, who was the head of Germany's soccer federation at the time, accused the players of allowing themselves to be ""exploited"" by Mr Erdogan for political purposes. Some German politicians questioned Ozil and Gundogan's loyalty to Germany and suggested they should be removed from the national squad ahead of the World Cup. Gundogan distanced himself from the picture, but Ozil refused to comment publicly until Sunday, when he published a three-part statement in English defending his actions and attacking those who have criticised him. He wrote that the ""picture we took had no political intentions"" and ""was about me respecting the highest office of my family's country"". Ozil, who won the World Cup with Germany in 2014, also took a swipe at the country's media who suggested that he was partly to blame for his side's group-stage exit from the 2018 tournament. He said: ""This crosses a personal line that should never be crossed, as newspapers try to turn the nation of Germany against me."" Ozil noted that there had been little criticism of former Germany captain Lothar Matthaus over a recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The midfielder reserved his sharpest words for Mr Grindel, alleging that the federation president had been ""patronising"" towards him. He continued: ""I will no longer stand for being a scapegoat for his incompetence and inability to do his job properly."" The footballer claimed that Mr Grindel had made ""unforgivable and unforgettable"" comments about immigrants and Muslims in the past. On Twitter, Ozil said: ""The treatment I have received from the DFB and many others makes me no longer want to wear the German national team shirt. ""I feel unwanted and think that what I have achieved since my international debut in 2009 has been forgotten."""

They are grouped under six themes - express myself, be well, know myself, skills for my future, have adventures and take action. There are 12 new badges for Rainbows (aged 5-7), 18 for Brownies (aged 7-10), 24 for Guides (aged 10-14), and 18 for Rangers (aged 14-18). Rainbows can study for badges in healthy minds and recycling. New badges for Brownies include aviation, mindfulness, my rights and baking. A zero waste badge for Brownies involves finding ideas to save water. Guides can learn about mixology, which involves using fruits, juices, herbs and spices to create a drink. And Rangers can study for badges in women's rights, festival goer or entrepreneur. Over the last 18 months, more than 50,000 girls and young women were involved in testing new activities. The new programme should be fully implemented by September 2019. ""We've really listened to what girls have told us they'd like to see and incorporated their suggestions,"" said volunteer Jess Bond, who helped develop the programme.

In the space of five days, the Brexit plan carefully constructed at Chequers was smashed into a million pieces. The issue of the Irish border in particular has become more delicate than the world-famous thin porcelain produced in Belleek. :: EU member states told to step up 'no deal' Brexit preparations No one wants a hard border, but six months from Brexit, there is no plan in place to prevent one. In his resignation statement, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the House of Commons the Irish border had become ""politically charged"". He added that the problem of the land boundary ""had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble"". When they needed agreement last December, the UK and EU found a solution - a safety net they call ""the backstop"". :: Northern Ireland 'unsupportive' of 'no deal' Brexit The EU understood it meant that, in the event of no deal, Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union. But Monday's vote in the Commons, ruling out a customs border in the Irish Sea, put paid to that plan. The DUP, who are shoring up Mrs May's government, would never accept Northern Ireland being treated differently to other UK regions. And Sinn Fein say the Irish government must insist that the backstop agreed last December is translated into legally binding text. :: Jacob Rees-Mogg at Irish border: 'UK can win game of chicken' The issue is further complicated by the fact that most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. But the DUP campaigned to leave, their MPs vote with the Brexiteers, and the prime minister needs them right now. It is not by coincidence that Mrs May's visit will take in Fermanagh - Arlene Foster's own Stormont constituency. If ""no deal"" produces a hard border, it will not be better than a ""bad deal"" for people living here. With six months to Brexit, the prime minister is under pressure from the EU, her own party, and the DUP. Some might argue that it is difficult to tell which one is the potter and which one the clay."

The photo shows Prince George beaming while standing in front of a brick wall. He will celebrate his special day with his parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and his younger siblings Charlotte and Louis. However, his party may be in a rather exotic location this year, as according to reports William and Kate may have taken their young family to the exclusive island of Mustique for a summer break. It's been a busy year for the prince who has welcomed a new little brother, completed his first year at school and joined his great grandmother the Queen on Buckingham Palace's balcony to mark her official birthday. First born child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington. He met the world's media one day later, leaving with his mother and father after being safely strapped into the baby car seat. He was christened on 23 October 2013, at The Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby. Prince George, who is third in line to the throne, was the Queen's third great-grandchild. She now has seven. The young prince has just completed his first year at Thomas's School in Battersea, south London. He arrived hand-in-hand with William on his first day, his mother Kate's morning sickness meaning she was unable to go along with him too. When Prince Louis was born in April, Prince George joined younger sister Princess Charlotte at the Lindo Wing to visit their new brother. With a love of planes, just like his father, Prince George enjoyed a fly-past in June to honour the Queen's official birthday on Buckingham Palace's balcony. The youngster - who aged just two made the best dressed list in GQ - was last seen at Prince Louis's christening in July wearing his custom summer staple, a pair of shorts. Despite only being five, George is a well-travelled little boy having visited Australia, New Zealand, Poland, Germany, Canada and now possibly the Caribbean too. As a royal, each of his birthdays is marked with a special set of photographs. For George's first birthday, pictures of him enjoying a day out in the Natural History Museum were shared. For his second, the Palace posted a snap of a grinning prince in his father's arms, leaning forward into the camera as William laughed behind him. On his third birthday, they gave a glimpse behind Palace walls, showing him playing in the garden and with their dog Lupo. For his fourth birthday, Getty Royal photographer Chris Jackson took a grown-up snap of George wearing a blue shirt and giving his trademark cheeky grin."

Some showery rain is possible - mainly in the North and West - but Wednesday and Thursday have the potential to break records. Porthmadog in Wales is currently the record holder for the year - where the mercury reached 33C on 28 June. ""Wednesday will be warm but Thursday is more likely to reach 33C or 34C,"" Sky News weather presenter Isobel Lang said. Think it's hot now?!

High levels of humidity can be expected in some places and it could also feel muggy. It is too early to predict how long the UK heatwave will last for, but the dry, warm weather is here to stay for at least another week or so. ""There are no signs of change with the dry weather in the foreseeable future,"" Ms Lang added. Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: ""It does look likely it will be at least 33C at some point this week, most likely on Wednesday or Thursday, in the South East and East, London, Essex, Kent, east Anglia and into Lincolnshire. ""And that would make it the hottest day we have had so far."" Temperatures are likely to be lower elsewhere. A West/East split in the weather is likely towards the end of the week, with the West seeing cloudier, windier conditions with some rain at times, according to the Met Office. Central and eastern areas will remain largely fine and settle with the risk of some thundery showers, while the South and South East will be very warm or hot with warm and humid nights. Occasional rain in the West may spread to other parts and there will be an ongoing risk of thunderstorms - particularly across central and southern and the South East. The all-time July record was 36.7C (98.6F) set at Heathrow airport on 1 July 2015. The hot weather could lead to thunderstorms - and it ""could all happen on the same day"", Mr Burkill said. ""The heat and humidity means there is a lot of energy in the air and a high risk of intense thunderstorms. Whether or not it will happen is where the uncertainty is,"" he added. The warmer weather has led to plans for a hosepipe ban which is set to affect millions in the North West in the coming weeks. Despite downpours in the region earlier in the week, water restrictions by United Utilities are still expected to come into force.

The project to place 53 million smart meters in homes and small businesses by 2020 has been ""plagued by repeated delays and cost increases"", the British Infrastructure Group of Parliamentarians (BIG) said. Its report found the expected saving on an annual dual-fuel bill in 2020 has fallen from Â£26 to just Â£11. Up to one in 10 smart meters ""go dumb"" due to poor signal, while more than half of the devices - about 500,000 a year - stop working when consumers switch providers, the BIG said. The cost of installing smart meters has risen to Â£1bn more than planned, threatening to eventually outstrip the Â£16.7bn gross benefit the project was supposed to deliver, it added. Tory MP and BIG chairman Grant Shapps called on the government to ""immediately review"" the progress of the roll-out and ""intervene to tackle its points of failure and risk"". He said: ""[The report] has found that the roll-out has been plagued by repeated delays and cost increases, with suppliers now almost certain to miss the 2020 deadline, and programme benefits likely to be slashed even further. ""Moreover, although the entire programme has been funded by customers through higher energy bills, unlike suppliers, they are not presently guaranteed to see the majority of savings that do materialise."" The report found that suppliers are still rolling out ""obsolete"" first generation smart meters, which were supposed to have been succeeded by November 2016. Suppliers have fallen behind schedule, with just over 11m smart meters reported to have been operational by March 2018, it said.

It feels, at last, like the contours of the Brexit process, its endgame, have been revealed for what they really are. And for the first time, after last week's parliamentary contortions, both sides now believe that no deal is a real possibility. In the past, Theresa May often said that no deal was better than a bad deal, but she didn't mean it. It was a negotiating ploy. But not for the first time, idle words and brinkmanship with Brussels have come back to haunt a Tory prime minister. Theresa May has spent two years as prime minister as David Cameron spent six - trying, often in vain, to keep the Tory party together over Europe. Her strategy is much the same as Cameron's: to appease the carnivorous Brexiteer right by throwing them fresh, Eurosceptic red meat at regular intervals. So Cameron vetoed the EU budget in 2011, he tried to veto Jean-Claude Juncker as commission president, he pulled the Conservatives out of the pro-EU European People's Party Group in the European Parliament and so on and so forth. Again and again he chose not to confront them, for fear his position was too weak, until the very end, when the referendum came and by then it was too late. In delaying the battle, he made the war worse. Every time he went on TV to disparage Europe, every time he vetoed something, or lambasted this EU initiative or that, he bought himself a few positive headlines, a few glowing Brexiteer smiles, but their appetite was undiminished, they would come back for more, smile gone, hungrier than ever. Moreover, this wasn't an internal conversation - the public was listening too. To the very end he kept his options open, ducking and diving - even suggesting in the weeks leading up to the announcement of the referendum, that if his negotiations with Europe were unsuccessful he might lead the Leave campaign. This was absurd - but it was only the last example of his storing up credibility problems. The dire prediction comes as the newly appointed Brexit secretary did not dismiss reports of official contingency planning During the referendum, when Cameron claimed that disaster would come if we voted to leave, the voters were rightly puzzled: if so, they said, why are you even asking us in the first place? Why risk a referendum? And why did you say you might lead the Leave side only a few months ago? And while we're at it, if Europe is so great, why have you been eviscerating it for the last 10 years while you've been Tory leader? Cameron's political dexterity and agility, for so long an asset, had become a profound liability. And history has repeated itself. Theresa May, so determined for so long to keep her party together, has waited for too long to reveal her hand. In the meantime, others have filled the vacuum with their own hopes and dreams - her Brexiteers believing she was now one of them and when her proposals for a deal came, they would not disappoint. How aghast they were. As Arthur Miller said: ""Betrayal is the only truth which sticks."" Justified or not, betrayal is the word on the Brexiteers' lips - in parliament and country alike. Perhaps this was inevitable but Mrs May made it worse. In saying ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" she helped convince the public that no deal wouldn't be so bad. She said it again and again and again and so she ought not to be surprised to learn that the voters believed her. In saying ""Brexit means Brexit"" she helped set impossibly high standards for what Brexit might mean. She could never meet them. No surprise then, that only 11% of the public back Chequers and 38% think we must come out with no deal at all. Like Cameron, she finds her own words and actions haunting her. In both cases, the political breathing space they bought in the short-term suffocates them in the end. Over the summer, she must do her best to sell her proposals which in fact fall a long way from the soft Brexit many Remainers would like. But as Cameron found, selling his ""renegotiation"", the stories prime ministers tell about themselves and their motives, built over years, are hard to escape. Nick Clegg said that his former coalition ally Mr Cameron was ""all tactics, no strategy"" when it came to Europe. Theresa May runs the risk of historians saying much the same about her. Since taking office, her cardinal objectives have been 1/ to prevent a Tory party split, 2/ to minimise economic damage, and 3/ to prevent a betrayal narrative infecting our politics. The tragedy of the Theresa May premiership might yet be that we get all three."

Conservative MP Dominic Grieve says a second #Brexit referendum may be ""the only solution"" #Ridge pic.twitter.com/cdJ1Mx540k He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show: ""We've got to be realistic about this. We will be in a state of emergency. ""Basic services that we take for granted might not be available. ""It wouldn't be possible, for example, for someone to fly to Rome because the overflying rights over the other countries of the EU are regulated by EU law.

""And, there'd be difficulties bringing food into this country because of the number of regulatory checks that would take place."" :: No deal, no divorce bill - Raab ramps up Brexit pressure However, Mr Grieve expressed hope that if an all-encompassing agreement is not reached before March next year then ""side deals"" would address some of the issues of a ""no deal"" Brexit. The prominent Conservative backbencher spoke after new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab revealed the government will be ""engaging with the public more clearly"" about ""no deal planning"" over the summer. Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs there would be around 70 ""technical notices"" sent to businesses and households over the next few weeks. Mr Raab, who held his first face-to-face talks with EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier last week, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he is ""focused relentlessly and unflinchingly"" on achieving a deal with the EU. But he did not dismiss claims the government is planning to stockpile foods and medicines. Despite attacking the ""unhelpful"" reports, he said: ""We're making sure, both in the allocation of money - Â£3bn extra allocated at the last budget - through operational things, like hiring extra border staff, through the legal arrangements, both domestic but also the treaty arrangements, that we're ready for any and every eventuality. ""We will gradually and responsibly, which is the right thing for a government to do, set out more of the detail of that through technical notices. ""I'm not going to get drawn into the selective snippets that are leaked out and make hair-raising stories."" Mr Raab also appeared to confirm the government is planning for a lorry park on the M26 motorway in Kent, should severe tailbacks occur due to post-Brexit delays at the Port of Dover. ""Of course, if we have no deal, we want to make sure we're prepared at the border with the knock-on effects that that would have if, on the EU side, they take the worst-case scenario approach, which is frankly irrational,"" he said. ""I'm confident we won't get there but, even if we did, we will have the planning in place, the preparation in place, the operational matters in place, from the infrastructure to the planning laws to deal with that."" The Brexit secretary added: ""All of that planning is under way, from every aspect of the infrastructure to the legal position to make sure we're ready for no deal and Britain thrives whatever the outcome of these negotiations."" Mr Raab also accused Brussels of an ""irresponsible"" attempt to ""ramp up the pressure"" by issuing warnings about the impact of a no deal Brexit on UK expats living on the continent and EU nationals living in Britain. Amid deep divisions in parliament over Brexit, Mr Grieve claimed a second EU referendum ""may be the only solution"", even though it would not be ""ideal"". Former prime minister Sir John Major also backed a fresh Brexit vote, as he attacked the ""irreconcilable"" attitude of Tory Brexiteers for having ""boxed the government and particularly the prime minister into a corner"", which could lead to no deal ""by accident"". He told the BBC: ""It has downsides. I mean, frankly, a second vote has democratic downsides. It has difficulties. ""But is it morally justified? I think it is. ""If you look back at the Leave campaign a great many of the promises they made were fantasy promises. We now know they are not going to be met.""

He told Sky News: ""We're not averse to any form of democratic engagement, but our view is that's not our policy to have another referendum. We respect the existing one. ""Our preference is a general election - we've not ruled anything out but our preference is a general election because then you discuss the issues, not just Brexit but other issues, but also you'd determine the team that'll be able to negotiate upon it."""

Ms Maines, 20, said in an interview at a Comic-Con event in San Diego, California: ""A lot of shows are introducing trans characters to their casts because this is such a hot topic issue right now and it's so important in our society."" She added: ""You know it seems fitting to have a trans superhero - Supergirl stepped up and I stepped in."" Nia Nal, who is also known as Dreamer in the show, appears to be a new take on the DC character Nura Nal who was also known as Dream Girl, according to the superhero fan site Fandom. A ""DC Database"" on the site lists Nura Nal's abilites as being able to see the future and having a ""genius-level intellect"". Nia Nal will feature in season four of the show when it airs on Sky One on an unconfirmed date. Ms Maine said in an interview with Variety: ""When I was first coming out to my parents, you know late 90s early 2000s, we had trans people on television portrayed by cis men (a feminine male) as sex workers and drug addicts - which painted a very specific image."" She added: ""Having trans women portrayed by cis men contributed to that idea that we are men in dresses, and that was damaging for a long time.""

2018-07-30,Boris Johnson appears to have moved out of the grace and favour home he enjoyed as foreign secretary - three weeks after quitting the role.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180730184433/https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-moves-out-taxpayer-funded-home-three-weeks-after-resigning-11454531,"Removal vehicles were spotted outside the One Carlton Gardens residence in central London on Monday, with Mr Johnson's wife Marina Wheeler and son Milo Johnson seen removing rubbish from the property. Mr Johnson resigned from government on 9 July in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy, which he has described as ""semi-Brexit"". Since then, the Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP has resumed a role as a Daily Telegraph columnist and made a resignation speech to the House of Commons. The foreign office insisted there had been no additional cost to taxpayers as a result of Mr Johnson not moving out of One Carlton Gardens immediately after his resignation. A spokesman said: ""Former ministers are expected to leave official residences as quickly as practicable at the end of their tenure, taking into account their personal circumstances and family requirements. ""We can confirm there is no additional cost to taxpayers involved."" One Carlton Gardens, which is less than half a mile from Trafalgar Square, is an official ministerial residence normally reserved for the foreign secretary. A lorry from the Restore Harrow Green removals firm was seen outside the property, into which a series of white boxes were loaded. A case of Jacques Depagneux wine, a large painting, a luxury armchair and a home gym kit with a light set of dumbbells were also put into the vehicle. Lookalike Drew Galdron, who calls himself the Faux BoJo, stood outside the residence to mark the occasion. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who is opposed to Brexit, said: ""Leave means leave and Boris has finally got the memo. ""He resigned, so why should the taxpayer pay his lavish rent? ""Of course, he won't be too disappointed: his meagre Â£1.5m house in Oxfordshire will be waiting for the return of its chaotic king."" Last week, One Carlton Gardens was targeted by a spoof removals firm, who said they ""knew how important leaving is"" to Mr Johnson, the figurehead of the official Brexit campaign. Fake workers carried boxes labelled ""Boris Johnson's chances of becoming PM"" and ""Boris Johnson's dreams"". The People's Vote campaign was behind the stunt, to promote their call for a referendum on the final Brexit deal."

The officers are heard discussing what to do with Ms Webb in the video. Officer Brown says she doesn't have speed-detection equipment before opening the coin-toss app on her phone to decide the driver's fate. ""A (arrest) head, R (release) tail,"" Officer Wilson says, adding ""This is tail, right?"" Despite the toss of the virtual coin saying release, they go on to make the arrest anyway, saying ""23"" - which is the police's code for arrest, according to local station WXIA. After making a joking reference to Michael Jordan - who famously wore 23 - then they discuss the charges. Ms Webb, who appears to be in tears, is then seen being handcuffed and placed in the back of a police patrol car. The officers were initially placed on administrative leave on 26 July following the incident. ""This isn't a police procedure, to bring a coin flip - whether it's an app or an actual coin toss - that's not part of that decision making to decide to take someone's freedom,"" Roswell Police Chief Rusty Grant said in the termination letter. The driver, Ms Webb, later said she was driving fast because she was late for her job at a hair salon and the charges were dismissed."

Lidl, which began its involvement in housing development in 2008, says it has already supported the creation of 811 homes - with 335 already built and another 476 currently in the pipeline. It has now revealed plans to be part of house-building schemes in London that could lead to the construction of more than 3,000 new homes in just three years. The German discount retailer says it is increasingly supporting the development of mixed-use schemes to include offices, hotels and student accommodation. In London, Richmond's Deer Park primary school will get a new home above one of the supermarket chain's new stores following a two-year search for a suitable site. Lidl chief executive Christian Hartnagel said the firm was ""proud"" to help ""pave the way for mixed-use developments"". ""To date, our stores have supported the creation of over 800 homes, which have either been built, or are soon to be built, and we're entirely open to exploring opportunities to help facilitate further developments,"" he said. ""In London alone, for example, there is the potential for Lidl stores to be part of schemes that could see over 3,000 new homes being built over the next three years. ""It continues to mean a great deal to us that we are able to support many of the communities that we're a part of by providing added value above and beyond affordable food."" Retail rival Tesco has been involved in housing since 2006, having built homes for key workers in Streatham, south London. The company also released some of its considerable land stocks to launch a home-building scheme for 4,000 properties in 2014."

Just 10% think they are doing a good job - down 13 points. Theresa May's personal approval ratings have similarly taken a substantial hit - 74% are now dissatisfied with her performance as prime minister, up 14 points, while the proportion satisfied is now at 24%, down 17 points.

Ms Brown, who met Shepherd on dating website OkCupid, drank champagne with him on his boat at the end of a night out in December 2015. Both took turns at driving the 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte GTO vessel, which ended up hitting a submerged log and tipping over near Wandsworth Bridge, sending them crashing into the river. Shepherd - who drove the boat at more than double the 12 knot speed limit - was found clinging to the hull, while Ms Brown was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. He was given a six-year jail sentence but failed to show up for his trial and sentencing due to ""cowardice"", his barrister said. Police have been unable to track him since then, but Ms Brown's father says he is sure that he will eventually be found. In an interview with The Sun, which is offering a Â£10,000 reward to anyone who helps find Shepherd, Graham Brown urged people with information about his whereabouts to contact police. ""Those who know something need to examine their consciences,"" said the 52-year-old. ""I'm sure someone will make that call. Justice is coming, of that I'm certain."" Other members of the Brown family have made several appeals for Shepherd - a web designer originally from Exeter - to turn himself in, but to no avail. Ms Brown's sister Katie called on him to ""assume the responsibility of his guilt and the devastation he caused"", and her mother, Roz Wicken, questioned why he had failed to offer an explanation for what he has claimed was an accident. ""The fact is, if Charlotte had not met him she would still be alive today,"" she said. Detective Sergeant Christopher Davis said after Shepherd's sentencing on Friday that police have had ""indications"" as to his whereabouts ""but it would be wrong to speculate at this time"". He added: ""We are open to the fact he may be in or out of the country."" Shepherd - who married a childhood friend shortly after the fatal crash and now has a two-year-old child - was said to have a ""totally cavalier attitude to safety"" by judge Richard Marks QC. The Old Bailey heard how he bought the boat from Gumtree to ""pull women"", and that he had entertained up to 10 women on board before meeting Ms Brown, who died after suffering from hypothermia and going into cardiac arrest."

As of today, the operator says many of these trains will start running again, with the remaining 25% to be reinstated at the start of September. Among the routes returning to normal is the Lakes Line - vital for tourism in the Lake District - with a full service of 35 trains a day being offered. A full service from Blackpool to Manchester Airport and Lancaster to Morecambe will also return. Northern Rail also announced that other routes will see some cancelled trains reintroduced as of today, with the remainder to be reinstated in September. They include: :: Blackpool South to Colne - 17 services a day to return, with the remaining 13 reinstated in September :: Ormskirk to Preston - 10 services a day to return, with the remaining six reinstated in September :: Kirkby to Manchester Victoria - Four services a day to return, with the remaining six reinstated in September. Some services - including Blackburn to Southport, Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge and Preston to Blackburn - are only going to return in September. David Brown, Northern Rail's managing director, said: ""Whilst we are ready to reintroduce all 168 daily services, given the need to drive further improvements across Manchester, we have agreed to a more gradual reintroduction of our services. ""A phased introduction is the right approach to ensure a more stable and reliable service for customers."" The returning services come as a report reveals the ongoing disruption in the North of England has cost businesses nearly Â£38m so far - with losses reaching Â£1.3m a day at one point. Prime Minister Theresa May has also been facing renewed pressure to intervene and end the ""chaos"" still affecting the region. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has said Northern Rail services have ""continued to be poor"" despite repeated calls for action from Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. Mr Burnham claimed that passengers have been ""left in the lurch"" as recently as Sunday, with Northern Rail emailing customers a night before to warn that 47 services - including journeys from Liverpool to Manchester Airport - were going to be out of action. The mayor said: ""It is frankly outrageous for emails to be dispatched at 9pm on a Saturday night telling people that there will be a much-reduced service the following day. People heading to Manchester Airport to go on holiday will have been left stranded as will others with work and family commitments. ""Passengers cannot be left in the lurch like this. This is no way to run a railway and we cannot continue to put up with a rail service provided when the operators can be bothered. People's lives are being badly affected by this chaos and the government cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the plight of Northern commuters. ""There are only so many times that I can call on Chris Grayling to do his job and help rail passengers in the North. He has failed to deliver on his promise to make sorting out rail chaos here his top priority and that is why I feel have no choice but to ask the prime minister to intervene."" Mr Burnham also invited the prime minister to visit Greater Manchester to speak with commuters and hear about the ""detrimental effect"" that the rail disruption was having on their lives."
2018-07-30,Tourists heading to southwestern Europe are being warned to take extra care as record-breaking temperatures are predicted for later this week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180730184433/https://news.sky.com/story/british-holidaymakers-warned-as-southwestern-europe-temperatures-could-break-records-11454207,"Forecasters are advising holidaymakers in Spain, Portugal and southwest France to prepare for extreme heat by staying inside during the hottest parts of the day and keeping hydrated. Very hot weather is expected to build up due to hot air coming up from North Africa - particularly over southwestern Europe. ""An area of high pressure will bring dry and sunny weather across Iberia and southwest France with hot air being drawn up from North Africa,"" Sky weather presenter Isobel Lang said. ""This could lead to potentially historic heat from midweek, reaching a peak into the weekend."" Spain's record high is 47.3C (117.14F) and Portugal's is 47.4C (117.32F), but these temperatures ""could well be beaten"", she added. ""Southwest France could see temperatures locally top 40C (104F). ""And 48C (118.4F) is possible across inland parts of Portugal and valleys of southern Spain"". The all-time continental European maximum is 48C, recorded in Athens, Greece, in July 1977. The intensity and duration of the heatwave will affect vulnerable people the most - while British tourists on European holidays may struggle to acclimatise to the sweltering heat. Disruption to travel is likely, especially on railways, and the threat of wildfires is also likely to increase. It comes after the deadliest wildfire in Europe since 1900 in Athens earlier this month, killing 86 people. Meanwhile, the Met Office's 30-day forecast says the UK should expect another long spell of dry, hot weather, with areas set to be ""fine and dry with plenty of sunshine"" during August. Thunderstorms and atlantic winds of up to 60mph battered Britain on Friday, breaking the 58-day drought. Temperatures fell to below 20C and parts of the country saw as much as three inches of rain in what Sky's weather producer Jo Robinson described as a ""blip"" in this year's British summer. The mercury will rise steadily with temperatures reaching as high as 30C (86F) in southeastern England on Thursday. It will be cloudier in the northwest with a risk of rain at time, though much of this area will be fine and dry too. The weekend will also be hot and dry, especially in the southern half of the UK."

""However we ask people not to speculate on social media - it is unhelpful to the investigation and to Lucy's family. ""Please allow us to do our job and find out what happened to Lucy."" The teenager was reported missing at the time her body was located by a member of the public, having last been seen at her home just a short drive away from the sports centre on Wednesday. Officers revealed on Sunday that she had died of stab wounds. ""We cannot say at this stage whether this is a knife, scissors or other bladed implement,"" the force said in a statement. ""Even if someone has put an item in a bin, we will try and recover it."" Police have also released images of the type of clothing she was wearing at the time of her disappearance. They include a distinctive black jacket with white sleeves, featuring branding for the band Falling In Reverse on the front and the words ""RADKE 01"" emblazoned on the back in red. Lucy was also wearing camouflage leggings, a white vest top and black and white trainers. :: Those with information can call 101 quoting the reference number 44180282545."
2018-07-30,"Advisers to House of Fraser (HoF) are courting Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct tycoon, to fund an emergency Â£50m deal to stave off the ailing department store chain's collapse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180730184433/https://news.sky.com/story/ailing-house-of-fraser-in-talks-with-ashley-over-50m-rescue-deal-11454679,"Sky News has learnt that bankers acting for the retailer, which is trying to force through the closure of dozens of shops and thousands of jobs being axed, held initial talks with Mr Ashley's executives late last week. A source close to HoF said on Monday evening that Rothschild, which is advising HoF, had been approached by Mr Ashley about providing new funding, potentially in the form of a loan or equity injection. In a letter from Sports Direct dated July 2 which has been seen by Sky News, the company told HoF that it ""would like to look at making an alternative offer"". The move follows the disclosure that a Â£70m capital injection into HoF from the Chinese owner of Hamleys, the toy store, would be delayed for several months. House of Fraser (HoF) is aiming to cut around 6,000 jobs and more than half its stores under a plan to save the chain amid the crisis facing the high street Sources said that a secured loan from Mr Ashley's Sports Direct International, which owns an 11% stake in HoF, was one of a number of options now being explored. In its letter earlier this month, Sports Direct said it was ""willing to structure a transaction on similar terms (subject to due diligence to confirm the level of investment/cash injection required"". Mr Ashley's company added that it had cash resources available for investment and the ability to support HoF in areas such as ""warehousing, online sales and the running of the business generally"". A number of other parties, including unnamed financial investors, have also been approached, although the status of the talks is unclear. The department store group, which traces its roots back to 1849, is understood to be seeking new financing within the next four weeks. People close to HoF believe it is likely to collapse into administration without such support, putting 17,000 jobs at risk. HoF is understood to require new capital to purchase stock ahead of the crucial Christmas trading period, with its lending banks, led by HSBC, said to be reluctant to provide further financing with the company's survival in the balance. The talks with Mr Ashley underlines the fragile nature of HoF's prospects given the hostility of their recent relationship. The high street billionaire, who also owns Newcastle United FC, had to go to court last month to force HoF to hand over its confidential business plan. Mr Ashley has made little secret of his interest in owning HoF outright, having tried to buy it in 2014, when Sanpower gained control. The terms of a prospective loan are unclear, although insiders believe Mr Ashley is unlikely to sanction financial support for HoF unless there is a clear path to him ultimately acquiring control of the business. Alternatively, he could calculate that a deal would be easier to effect in the event that HoF goes bust. Under his stewardship, Sports Direct has accumulated stakes - often through complex financial instruments - in a number of British high street chains, including HoF's rival, Debenhams, and French Connection. Last month, HoF, which is currently owned by China's Sanpower Group, confirmed plans to shut 31 of its 59 British stores through an increasingly controversial mechanism called a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). The move would put roughly 6,000 jobs at risk. HoF employs about 5000 people directly, with a further 12,500 people working in fashion and beauty brand concessions in its stores. The Â£70m investment in HoF from C.banner, Hamleys' owner, is contingent upon the CVA being implemented. The C.banner deal is supposed to hand it a 51% stake in HoF. However, the plans have been rocked by a challenge in the Scottish courts from a group of landlords who are arguing that the restructuring plan imposes unfairly Draconian financial pain on them. HoF had informally asked store landlords to agree to big rent cuts earlier this year, before signing off plans to conclude a CVA before the June rent quarter day. If it collapsed, it would be the biggest retail failure for well over a decade, and would come during a tumultuous period for the high street, with jobs being axed at chains including Carpetright, Debenhams, Mothercare and New Look. The CVA mechanism offers no guarantee of revival, with Toys R Us UK crashing into administration just weeks after its deal was approved earlier this year, with more than 3,000 jobs lost as a result. Retailers have become casualties of a tough market characterised by rising costs combined with caution among British shoppers. HoF, one of the best-known names in the British retail industry, has been living a hand-to-mouth existence for some time, with its shareholders periodically providing it with multimillion pound sums to enable it to pay landlords and concession operators. Last year, it lost nearly Â£44m as pressure mounted on the business. The company is carrying âhundreds of millions of pounds of debt, including a Â£350m bond which is publicly traded. It is run by executive chairman Frank Slevin and Alex Wiliamson, who was brought in from the Goodwood Group last year. Last week, it responded to an enquiry from Sky News by saying that it had no need for short-term financing. A spokesman for Sports Direct did not respond to a request for comment."

Experts had deemed that the man - a 52-year-old financial analyst who can only be identified as Mr Y - would likely never regain consciousness, having fallen ill after suffering a cardiac arrest in June last year. Even if he had, they concluded he would have suffered from profound mental and physical disability. Although Mr Y had not drawn up any advance decision as to whether to refuse treatment, his family and medical team agreed it would be in his best interests for his feeding tube to be cut. It meant he would likely die within three weeks. In November, a High Court judge ruled that it was not necessary for them to bring the matter to court beforehand. My Y died in December, but an appeal by a solicitor representing people who lack capacity was granted because of the general importance of the issues raised by the case. Richard Gordon QC argued that common law or EU human rights law should require that any case involving the withdrawal of such treatment should be subject to an application as to whether it is in the best interests of the patient. He said such cases should be brought to court regardless of whether or not there was an agreement between relatives and doctors. Justices at the Supreme Court have now unanimously dismissed his argument. Justice Lady Black explained that having looked at the issue ""in its wider context as well as from a narrower legal perspective"", she did not believe common law or human rights law made it necessary for a court to rule on such matters. ""If the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act are followed and the relevant guidance observed, and if there is agreement upon what is in the best interests of the patient, the patient may be treated in accordance with that agreement without application to the court,"" she said. Lady Black acknowledged that there could be occasional cases in which circumstances would make an application required or desirable, but said that generally decisions such as those involving Mr Y should be made without court input."

Another 40% said they were against and 10% said they didn't know. Asked to choose between those options, not leaving the EU would be the preferred option for 48%, with 27% preferring to leave the EU with no deal, and 13% choosing the government deal.

""Untie my hands, let me negotiate properly, because youâre going to face a @peoplesvote_uk at the end of the day.""That's the message Lord Mandelson wants Theresa May to send to her ""Brextreemists"".https://t.co/qD4aYsgPgn pic.twitter.com/un4Yu7oZsG Responding to the results of the poll, Lord Mandelson - who is a director of the Open Britain group who run the People's Vote campaign for another referendum - told Sky News: ""The only way to give democratic legitimacy to the final deal, and to get approval from the public is to put it to such a vote."" The former Labour minister also insisted promising a referendum on the final Brexit deal would help Mrs May ""strengthen her hand against the Brextremists in her own party"". Asked whether he is actively preparing for a second EU referendum in the UK, Lord Mandelson - who was also a key member of the official Remain campaign during the 2016 vote - told Sky News: ""If public opinion continues to shift, as the Sky poll has indicated now it is doing, everyone will have to get ready for a people's vote on the final deal."" ""We can quote polls and the like until kingdom come...  ""Now we're in a slightly rockier patch, I don't deny that.

However, Tory Brexiteer Kwasi Kwarteng dismissed suggestions of a second Brexit vote as a ""red herring"". He told Sky News: ""I don't think that's going to happen, it shouldn't happen. We had a clear cut mandate to deliver Brexit and that's what the government is doing."" The Sky Data poll also revealed the public overwhelmingly think the government is doing a bad job of negotiating Brexit, with Mrs May's personal approval ratings also taking a hit. Fellow Conservative Leave-supporter Andrew Bridgen, a prominent critic of the prime minister and her Brexit strategy, said voters would ""obviously"" reject Mrs May's plan for leaving the EU, as agreed by ministers at Chequers earlier this month. ""Being in the EU is a bit like being pregnant - you're either pregnant or you're not, you're either in the EU or you're not.""Conservative MP @ABridgen says the Chequers agreement is ""not fulfilling the promise we made to the electorate"". https://t.co/qD4aYsgPgn pic.twitter.com/L7ZOpa7Vzr He said these proposals were ""not fulfilling the promise we made to the electorate with regard to Brexit"". Commenting on the Sky Data poll, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""In overwhelming numbers, people are concerned about the negative consequences of Brexit. ""However, the Tories are just not listening. They are instead consumed by chaos and confusion.""The Liberal Democrats do not accept the fatalistic view that people voted to be poorer. We do not believe the Brexit battle is over."" :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,466 Sky customers online 20-23 July 2018.

The group were driving to a wedding party from Quang Tri province to the bride's home in Binh Dinh province during the early hours of the couple's wedding day. The crash happened at about 2.30am local time on Monday (8.30pm on Sunday in the UK). Ten of the victims were killed instantly, the government said in a statement. Three others, including the groom, died on the way to hospital. ""All victims' bodies were brought back to their home for burial. We are treating some of the injured in a local hospital,"" police said. The truck driver is said to have suffered minor injuries in the crash. Local authorities are investigating the cause. Road accidents are the biggest single cause of deaths in Vietnam as traffic laws are loosely obeyed and road infrastructure is patchy, despite efforts to make the roads safer. Last year, about 8,200 people died in traffic accidents across the country - down from around 8,600 the year before. On average, one person dies every hour in a road accident in Vietnam, with most being killed on motorbikes. Traffic congestion, inadequate law enforcement and poor driving are some of the reasons cited as the main causes of road deaths in crowded cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh."
2018-07-30,"British farmers and growers are facing the ""soul destroying"" prospect of leaving more crops to rot in the fields unless a post-Brexit visa scheme for seasonal workers is announced soon.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180730184433/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-farmers-fear-more-crops-will-rot-in-fields-as-eu-workers-move-abroad-11453766,"Parts of the UK's army of seasonal fruit and vegetable pickers have already started to look for jobs in other parts of the EU after receiving no firm assurances that they will still be welcome after Brexit. The overwhelming majority of those who harvest our crops are eastern European - just 0.6% of the 85,000-strong workforce is British. Romanians, Bulgarians and other eastern Europeans, who all pay taxes here in the UK, are a vital cog in how British produce gets from our fields to our shops. For over a year now, British farmers and growers have been calling on the Home Office to promise to reintroduce a seasonal worker visa scheme after Brexit. The last one was scrapped five years ago due to freedom of movement within the EU. But the political impasse means recruiting from eastern Europe has become more difficult. Figures from the National Farmers' Union (NFU) show that the shortfall in seasonal workers is about 30%. In the Wye Valley in Herefordshire, where the Chinn Family have harvested crops since the 1920s, harvest manager Elina Kostadinova explained: ""They have families, they need to provide for them and they need security. ""We have lost people from last year... they have moved to other countries in the EU."" Farmer Chris Chinn told Sky News he is a realist and not another Brexit ""remoaner"". In total, his business employs up to 1,000 seasonal workers and they have struggled to fill their positions this season. Twice during their asparagus season they had to leave crops unpicked in the fields - something he describes as ""soul destroying"". He said: ""Without staff we don't harvest the crops, if we can't harvest the crops we are going to stop planting the crops... that means that business disappears and that means those crops disappear from the supermarket shelves."" While many of the seasonal pickers enjoy working and living in the UK for part of the year, they could easily find similar work elsewhere in the EU. On the blueberry packing lines on the farm, technical supervisor Monica Sermas, from Romania, explained the work is the same in different countries. ""It doesn't matter for them [her colleagues] that much, they still want a job and that can be anywhere,"" she said. ""They just want to know the future here."" A government spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that up until December 2020, employers in the agricultural and food processing sectors will be free to recruit EU citizens to fill vacancies and those arriving to work will be able to stay in the UK afterwards. ""We are determined to get the best deal for the UK in our EU negotiations, not least for our world-leading food and farming industry which is a key part of our economic success."""

Reverend Philip Bromiley, who led the service, said Ms Sturgess' life had been ""really celebrated"", adding that special security measures expected to be in place were absent. Among those who attended the service was Ms Sturgess' partner Charlie Rowley, who also fell ill after exposure to novichok. ""Charlie was sat on the front row, obviously very emotional,"" Mr Bromiley said. ""It was lovely to see him there and I'm really hoping that the service will have given him a healing that he will doubtless need to have in the days and months to come."" It was thought there would not be any pallbearers but Mr Bromiley said it was ""absolutely straightforward - just like any other funeral"". ""I touched the coffin as I did the committal - there was nothing strange at all about it,"" he said. ""The funeral directors handled the coffin in just the same way that anybody else would have handled the coffin."" The service began with James Blunt's song Beautiful Dawn, which Mr Bromiley said was ""entirely appropriate"". There was a also a ""time of reflection"" during which mourners sang Into The Light. Mr Bromiley said Ms Sturgess' sister Claire delivered a ""wonderful eulogy and sharing memories about her childhood, and sharing a room with Dawn"". Ms Sturgess' 11-year-old daughter also paid tribute, and got a ""round of applause at the end of it, so she did incredibly well"". ""The music was lovely - it couldn't have gone better,"" Mr Bromiley said. There were a ""lot of people there"", he said, and numbers were ""greater than the room - spilling out at the back"". Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were found unconscious on Saturday 30 June, with police later confirming they had been exposed to novichok. Ms Sturgess died on 8 July, while Mr Rowley was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 20 July. Mr Rowley has since said he recalled giving his partner a sealed bottle containing the deadly nerve agent, thinking it was perfume. She went on to spray it on her wrists before they both fell ill in Mr Rowley's home in Amesbury, Wiltshire. The 45-year-old said he could not remember where he found the perfume box but added that it ""looked expensive"". The exposure of Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley to novichok came a few months after former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with the nerve agent in nearby Salisbury."
2018-07-30,"Jeremy Hunt may have replaced Boris Johnson as the UK's top diplomat, but it seems the sight of a gaffe-prone British foreign secretary isn't about to disappear any time soon.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180730184433/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-tells-chinese-hosts-his-wife-is-japanese-when-shes-actually-from-china-11454017,"Mr Hunt marked the first day of his trip to China - where he hopes to strengthen trade ties ahead of Brexit - by mistakenly telling his hosts his wife is Japanese, rather than Chinese. The foreign secretary, who moved from his health brief to replace Mr Johnson earlier this month, made the ""terrible mistake"" while meeting his Chinese counterpart. Exchanging pleasantries as his UK delegation sat down to talks with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and officials, Mr Hunt sought to demonstrate his family ties to China. But Mr Hunt erred and told his hosts: ""My wife is Japanese - my wife is Chinese. Sorry, that's a terrible mistake to make."" Following some laughter, he added: ""My wife is Chinese and my children are half-Chinese and so we have Chinese grandparents who live in Xian and strong family connections in China."" As well as risking upsetting his wife, Mr Hunt's blunder also threatened to offend the Chinese officials sat across the table from him. Chinese-Japanese relations have been mired in tensions since Japan's invasion of China before and during the Second World War. Mr Hunt is married to Lucia Guo and the couple have three children. After graduating from Oxford University, Mr Hunt spent two years in Japan teaching English and learning Japanese. Shortly after becoming the longest-serving health secretary since the NHS was created, Mr Hunt moved to the foreign office at the beginning of the month. He replaced Mr Johnson, who resigned from government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan. During his two-year spell as foreign secretary, Mr Johnson demonstrated his own gaffe-prone streak when he compared New Zealand's traditional Maori greeting to a headbutt. He also angered Sikhs during a visit to a temple when he claimed a trade deal with India would boost sales of whisky, seemingly unaware the drinking of alcohol is forbidden under many Sikh teachings. Mrs May was forced to slap down Mr Johnson when he accused Saudi Arabia of abusing Islam and acting as a puppeteer in proxy wars throughout the Middle East. On a trip to Myanmar, the senior Tory was caught on camera reciting a colonial poem before being stopped by an ambassador. And he caused a storm at last year's Conservative Party conference by claiming a Libyan city could become the ""next Dubai"" if they ""clear the dead bodies away""."

The aircraft went missing on 8 March 2014, on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, in one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries. Investigators previously found that the plane turned west off its predetermined route, heading back over Malaysia. A media briefing by the Malaysian safety investigation team said the plane was under manual control when it turned back, rather than flying on autopilot. It said it could not exclude the interference of a third party, but concluded it was unable to determine the real cause of the disappearance. Calvin Shim's wife, Christine Tan, was a member of the crew. He admitted he expected nothing new to come from the report, but told Sky News his family would continue to fight for answers until the wreckage was found. ""It's difficult because we have to live with not knowing why my wife has gone missing,"" he said. ""We need closure. I can't even tell my children what happened to their mother. We can't even have a proper ceremony or a proper place to remember my children's mother. ""I just want to find the plane and then whatever data we can get from the sea we can find what actually happened. I need the government to proactively be looking for clues and continue the search. ""We want the answer of why the plane has gone missing and where it has gone. As soon as all my questions are answered it will be finished for me. As long as there is still some hope, I will still pursue it."" On 29 May, Malaysia called off a three-month search by US firm Ocean Infinity, which had spanned 112,000 square kilometres (43,243 square miles) in the southern Indian Ocean and ended with no significant findings. It was the second major search, after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless AUS$200m (Â£112.8m) search across an area of 120,000 square kilometres (46,332 square miles) last year. Families said the new report pointed to mistakes by the Malaysian air traffic control centre. It showed there were only two attempted phone calls made to the aircraft from the ground, four to five hours apart. Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane, said: ""We hope that these mistakes will not be repeated and that measures are put in place to prevent them in the future."" Friends and relatives of 53-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah also expressed their dissatisfaction. Peter Chong, who became friends with Mr Shah after meeting him at a community project, told Sky News: ""I feel sad for the next of kin of MH370. ""After all the hype and expectations, the report released brings forth nothing new. They are nowhere near to closure. ""[It is] just another round in the emotional roller-coaster ride. I am happy to note there is no blame apportioned to anyone. However, there are also no answers as to what happened to the flight."" Next of kin living in Australia and Beijing are angry that they only heard about the briefing late last week, meaning they did not have time to attend. The investigator in charge, Kok Soo Chon, agreed this ""was not fair"", but explained he was not in control of invitations. He confirmed that the team would travel to China later in the week to present to report to relatives in Beijing."

Police believe the 23-year-old, who was stationed at RAF Honington, climbed into a waste bin and was taken away by a refuse lorry. A landfill site was searched as part of the inquiry, but earlier this year the case was reportedly passed to a cold case team. ""Corrie is no longer missing,"" his father, Martin McKeague, wrote on Facebook. ""What we mean by this is that after looking at all of the facts and evidence we now know what happened to our son. ""We are certain he is somewhere in the Suffolk waste disposal system, but his remains are essentially irretrievable."" Martin McKeague said police visited the family in October last year and in February. The evidence was ""as thorough as it was compelling"", he said, adding that experts had ""concluded beyond any doubt that Corrie had ended up in the Suffolk waste disposal system"". ""Accepting that conclusion has clearly not been easy for the McKeague family in Scotland, nor anyone else,"" he wrote. The remaining areas not covered in the inquiry are either ""too toxic to search"" or ""so vast it could take years to do so"". Mr McKeague said his son's disappearance had been an ""unbelievable and horrific journey of grieve (sic) and acceptance for the McKeague family"". There are plans for a memorial for Corrie in the future, he said."

Sinn Fein's Caral Ni Chuilin, the Northern Ireland Assembly member for Belfast North, condemned the attack and called it ""sickening and depraved"". She called on police to do more to tackle the ""scourge of loyalist paramilitaries from our society"" as she accused the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) of being behind the incident. Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) said an investigation had been launched into a report of criminal damage and threats at a property. The attack comes as another women was reportedly held under virtual house arrest and threatened with ""bother"" if she left her home, according to the Wave Trauma Centre support group, which said more of its resources were being stretched to deal with recent paramilitary intimidation. Speaking about the north Belfast incident, Ms Ni Chuilin said: ""Police have confirmed that the loyalist paramilitary group, the UFF, threatened a woman and ordered her to leave her home in Oldpark today. ""Only hours later her home was attacked and the windows of her home were smashed. ""These shameful and depraved actions were carried in the full knowledge that her son, who died tragically last Thursday, was due to be waked from the family home."" She said the woman alerted authorities after a group of men told her she had 24 hours to leave her home. She returned to the property with police to collect clothes, only to find her windows had been smashed and the anti-Catholic slur ""taigs out"" had been sprayed on her wall. Ms Ni Chuilin added: ""These sickening actions must be condemned by all and the criminals responsible should pack up and get off the backs of the community. The continued existence of these armed groups is a blight on society. ""The PSNI needs to intensify its efforts remove the scourge of loyalist paramilitaries from our society."" Officers said they were called to an incident in Summer Street at 7.10pm. PSNI's Inspector McCullough said: ""Inquiries into this incident are ongoing and at an early stage and we are working to establish a motive. ""We would like to hear from anyone who has information in relation to this incident and can assist our investigation to contact us on 101."""

She told Sky News that ""some young people"" had approached her and after a verbal exchange two of the group had ""spat on me once or twice each"". ""They circled about a little and then re-appeared with a bag of flour...and water and eggs."" A photo posted on social media shows the woman cowering on the bench, covered in flour and eggs, as four boys stand around her, grinning and making hand gestures. The 49-year-old, who does not want to be identified, said: ""I was covered in flour etc and was later told that pictures had been on social media, which I have not investigated or seen myself, as a self-preservation precaution."" Suffolk Police described her as ""severely distressed...but was physically unharmed"". She told Sky News: ""I do not wish to over-react and will accept what neighbours and friends say has been said online. ""I certainly do consider this to be an assault on my person and my ability to enjoy the green area there. ""Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they have behaved in such a way towards me. ""I would like to hear their reasons if possible. ""It was not a pleasant experience and the limit of what I can publicly tolerate, however, I have no wish to escalate current tensions."" Police arrested four boys, two aged 17 and two aged 15, over the weekend but all have since been released on bail pending further enquiries. On Monday, another boy, 15, was arrested on suspicion of common assault and was also bailed pending further enquiries. A sixth boy, 16, was also questioned under caution and remains under investigation. Suffolk Police Acting Detective Superintendent Barry Byford said: ""This is a live investigation and we do not support vigilantism in any way, shape or form. ""Social media users should remember that sharing names and images, which may later form part of a criminal investigation, can disrupt or jeopardise the case.

In a written account, he said he was given slips of paper with information from residents during fire survival guidance (FSG) calls to 999, which he wrote on a wall. But Mr Williams was soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of calls as crews had no training about safely rescuing someone through ""a toxic environment 20-plus floors high"". The friends and families of the 72 who died in the Grenfell fire pay tribute to their loved ones He said: ""At times I would ask the casualties themselves as they walked passed, but communication was difficult as they were either too traumatised to speak or unable to understand due to the language barrier. ""Most of the information I was able to correlate came from children as their English was better. ""There was a woman carrying a little boy. As the woman walked passed me crying, I asked them where the rest of their family were, to which the little boy said: 'All dead'."" Mr Williams wrote that flaming debris began raining down from the tower's facade, putting in danger those trying to flee to safety. Firefighters handed children their helmets to keep them safe, he wrote. One little girl was alone and in her pyjamas as she was being carried out. He wrote: ""She looked to be in shock as her eyes were wide open. To protect her from the falling debris, I gave her my helmet before the firefighter carried her out the main entrance."" ""The Grenfell Tower had a massive emotional impact on me and shortly after the incident I started to feel really angry that (I) did not go in and rescue someone,"" Mr Williams added. ""When I was asleep I started to have visualisations of the little girl's face who I had given my helmet to."" The lack of a working fire lift meant rescue teams clogged the only escape route in Grenfell, a single stairwell, which ""prevented their ability to fight the fire and conduct rescues"". It also meant crews had a limited amount of time on the upper floors before their oxygen ran out. A makeshift system of transporting FSG information from the control room to a command vehicle to Mr Williams worked poorly. Towards the end of the night, the details of every person they knew needed rescuing was sent by a station manager. Mr Williams wrote: ""At that point I realised that my original FSG list was incorrect as there were far more numbers on second list. This clearly showed there was a breakdown in communication between the management within the foyer."" Later he was told it was too dangerous to send rescue crews above the 10th floor where most of the stranded residents lived. He said: ""This was difficult for me to hear and I expressed my dissatisfaction on hearing this."" The blaze in west London on 14 June last year claimed 72 lives."

The company reported a Â£113.5m statutory pre-tax loss in the first half of the year, compared with profits of Â£47.3m a year earlier. Shares were down 2.7% in early trading. The company said it had faced a ""more challenging than expected"" outlook within regional newspapers during the period. The Express & Star takeover however boosted group revenues, which grew from Â£320m to Â£353.8m in the six months. Reporting its first half-yearly results since the group bought the Express & Star newspapers from Northern & Shell Media in February, the company warned there was now ""greater uncertainty"" for its regional titles over the medium term. But the company insisted that the integration of the papers into the wider group was under way, ""in order to accelerate the benefits that our combined scale will deliver."" Reach said it took a further hit after putting aside another Â£7.5m to deal with higher than expected civil claims over the phone hacking scandal. The money includes the costs of having to cover claimants' legal expenses, and brings the total amount put aside for settlements to Â£70.5m. Reach chief executive Simon Fox said: ""We have delivered a positive financial performance in what remains a difficult trading environment for the industry, in particular the regional businesses. ""The benefit of improved performance from national print advertising coupled with further cost mitigation will support profits over the year despite a further increase in newsprint prices for the second half."""

The last couples standing - Dani and Jack, Kaz and Josh, Laura and Paul and Wes and Megan will all go head-to-head this evening to claim the prize. And if you are one of the show's millions of viewers finding it hard to picture a life post-Love Island, you are not alone. The series, which turns falling in love into a reality gameshow played out for maximum viewing pleasure, has charmed the nation. It brought record-breaking viewing figures for ITV2, with the launch show in June attracting the channel's largest ever audience with 2.9 million viewers. That figure was topped just a few weeks into the run, with three million viewers tuning in mid-week. But why is it so successful? WOW! @LoveIsland @itv2 ð´âï¸â¤ï¸ pic.twitter.com/VY6J47BGyR An idyllic location (Majorca), beautiful contestants and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week) certainly gave the show a boost from the start. BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling's quippy voiceover also helps to lubricate the on-screen action. Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University before going on to present children's TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore - who apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis. And she's not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance during last year's series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show. American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: ""@LoveIsland Jack & Dani are goals! ð #LoveIsland"". @LoveIsland Jack & Dani are goals! ð #LoveIsland There's even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give the show a little star dust, with Danny Dyer's daughter Dani (yes, really) a clear favourite to win. Dani and pen salesman Jack Fincham have been coupled since the start, and say they plan to move in together after the show comes to an end. The popular pair have even received the thumbs up from The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thanks to Jack's penchant for bird watching during his time in the villa. Winning an A* for ingenuity, the show's producers even managed to wangle an appearance of sorts from Daddy Dyer over the weekend. The always awkward meeting of boyfriend and father was given an extra excruciating twist, with Jack meeting the EastEnders actor over Facetime. Luckily the soap star, who was speaking from his family holiday in Florida, said he ""approved"" of Fincham, telling him ""I think you're absolutely bang on"" and a ""proper geezer"". He also told him he had a bit of a belly using cockney rhyming slang - a classic Dyer move. Viewers were quick to share their love for Danny's appearance on social media, hailing it the best moment of the series so far. The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it is not just Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries. Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, the UK show even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show and paving the way for the current series' success. Thorpe Park has opened its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer. And more than one university student has written a dissertation on the reality show. Adam's treatment of Rosie led to accusations of emotional abuse from Women's Aid. And when Niall, a construction worker from Coventry, made an unexpected exit due to ""personal reasons"", concern was palpable across the country. Wait -what Niall has quit #LoveIsland?! Totally focused on Brexit votes obviously but do hope the shows Neville longbottom alrightâ¦.  Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right. The show even had its own underdog. Unlucky in love Alex, an A&E doctor from Wales, won the hearts of the nation before being dumped from the villa just one day before the final. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: ""It's the first series I've ever watched, but I'm addicted. It's the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people's lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they're not real, but it doesn't matter. ""Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl's mates. ""It's on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day."" The world, it seems, cannot get enough. With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas. A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night's antics - presented by Kem Cetinay, one half of last year's winning couple, and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year. A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: ""It's a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to - the uncertainty, the lust, the love. ""Last year's show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that's why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you're always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn't work out for some of them."" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: ""It's really important that it's not a salacious show - that it isn't grubby."" Stavri also puts its success down to ""not being full of conflict"" and the fact ""it doesn't feel exploitative"". When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don't cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension. Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show ""aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love"". However, Cowles goes on: ""If people don't like it they don't have to watch. We're not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that's a distraction from real life."" Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island's launch night viewers were aged 16-34. Only Britain's Got Talent - shown on ITV's main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Arielle Free says the show's success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: ""I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It's such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible."" It's also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen. If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble. As Free puts it: ""Sometimes we act so differently when we meet someone we like and to see others be exactly the same gives you a reassurance or a lightbulb moment that it's a natural human reaction. ""It shines a spotlight on how weird and wonderful we all are when it comes to finding love."" The Love Island final takes place tonight at 9pm on ITV2."
2018-07-30,Our Sky Data poll shows a quite fundamental backlash occurring in public perceptions of the Brexit negotiations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180730184433/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-middle-ground-disappearing-from-under-theresa-mays-feet-11454197,"For a year or so now, underlying polling has shown that the public is unconvinced by how Brexit is being handled. But by and large, small numbers of people were actually changing their mind. The small lead for Remain came from 2016 non-voters, including younger voters not then eligible, falling heavily for staying in the European Union. Now the lack of faith in the handling of Brexit is affecting perceptions of Brexit itself. Not just that, most troubling for Number 10, the Brexit middle ground is disappearing from underneath the PM's feet. A survey reveals the government is haemorrhaging trust over Brexit, with two-thirds thinking the outcome will be bad for Britain. Brexiteers such as Andrew Bridgen MP blame the Chequers compromise of staying in a common rule book for goods and trade for a shift in the polls against Brexit, and demand the abandonment of the plan. Remainer campaigners feel equally emboldened that demographics and the brutal clarity of plans for stockpiling food and medicines, are on their side if they can somehow get Parliament to vote for a referendum on the exit deal. And, as importantly, at a time when the Cabinet is touring European capitals seeking their backing to force Brussels to compromise on its red lines, the perception that the UK public does not back the Chequers compromise is very problematic. The government's official response to polls such as this is that there will be no further referendum. Indeed the PM regularly uses the fact that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has not fully ruled one out as a stick to try to beat him in the Commons. But Number 10 needs to ask itself some pretty fundamental questions about strategy. Leaked ""snippets"" of No Deal preparedness work have confirmed the need for stockpiling of food, medicines and plasma products. All this is now deemed too scary for the public to consume. The EU itself has published 70 such preparedness notices this year. It is rather difficult to reconcile with repeatedly parroting ""No deal is better than a bad deal"". It was always likely that its Brexit plan would land somewhere near Chequers. But Number 10 did not roll the pitch for this compromise, by, for example, getting the PM to promise car or aviation workers that their jobs would be protected. The Clean or Hard Brexiteers feel the red lines that she herself announced have been betrayed. But having staked out a fairly hard line initially, the PM has not now persuaded Remain leaning voters to be thankful for her attempt at compromise. She has not sold Chequers. And the public is not now buying it. That makes it less likely that MPs will feel the need to compromise in the autumn to pass the withdrawal deal, or even that they get a deal to vote on from the European Union. And if that deal is voted down then it is difficult to see how there will not be either a general election or a referendum. This polling shows why even if there is a deal, we cannot now rule out another visit to the ballot boxes within the next 12 months."
2018-07-30,"Twitter is turning to academics, including from Oxford's department for experimental psychology, to tackle hate speech and promote ""healthy conversations"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180730184433/https://news.sky.com/story/twitter-turns-to-oxford-experimental-psychologists-over-hate-speech-11454439,"The company said that it ultimately intends to be able to measure ""the health of public conversation on Twitter"" although it isn't yet clear how this healthiness could be measured. Professor Miles Hewstone and John Gallacher at the University of Oxford's department for experimental psychology, in partnership with Dr Marc Heerdink of the University of Amsterdam, are working with the company to study how people use Twitter. ""We're very excited about the opportunity to work with Twitter on investigating the important social challenges of a digitally connected world,"" said Professor Hewstone. ""Evidence from social psychology has shown how communication between people from different backgrounds is one of the best ways to decrease prejudice and discrimination. ""We're aiming to investigate how this understanding can be used to measure the health of conversations on Twitter, and whether the effects of positive online interaction carry across to the offline world."" The company has launched a ""global health initiative"" in response to criticism that it was too soft on those using the platform to harass female public figures and espouse racist abuse. A crackdown on locked accounts prompted some of the most followed people to lose millions of followers, with Katy Petter, Lady Gaga and Barack Obama losing millions each. Additional work based on ranking high-quality conversations led to Twitter being accused of political bias when US Republican politicians discovered they were not being ""auto-suggested"". Twitter said this was due to a bug which had affected some Democratic politicians too, and which had since been fixed. The company's shares plunged 15% last week when it reported losing more than a million users and stated that it expected to lose more as part of a drive to get rid of abuse."
