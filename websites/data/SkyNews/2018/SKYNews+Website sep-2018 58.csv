2018-09-02,A woman has been charged with explosives and terror offences following a raid in Cardiff in which another man was held.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/cardiff-woman-charged-after-explosives-found-in-fridge-11488909,"Natalie Parsons, 51, was charged with two counts of making or possessing an explosive substance and possessing terrorist documents, after a raid on a house in the Ely area of Cardiff. Officers were reported to have found triacetone triperoxide (TATP) in the fridge of the home, and another explosive substance, hexamethylene triperoxide diamene (HMTD), in the garden shed. Edward John Harris, 27, was also arrested and appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday. Harris was charged with explosive offences and possession on terror materials including The Improvised Munitions Handbook. During his brief court appearance he spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, address and nationality of ""white British"". He has been remanded in custody until 27 September. Police said there was no specific terror threat against the city. ""Our investigation continues but we must stress that there is no evidence to suggest any specific terrorist threat against Cardiff or that people in Cardiff are at any greater risk,"" said detective superintendent Jim Hall, the head of the Wales extremism and counter terrorism unit. ""However, we would remind people to remain vigilant and report any suspicions to the police."" Parsons will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday."
2018-09-02,"The EU's chief negotiator has delivered his most withering condemnation yet of Theresa May's Brexit proposals, as he insisted accepting the plan would spell the ""end"" for the European project.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/michel-barnier-trashes-theresa-mays-chequers-plan-for-brexit-as-end-for-eu-11488846,"As resistance to the prime minister's policy mounts in both the UK and Europe, Michel Barnier revealed why he is ""strongly opposed"" to her so-called Chequers strategy. The European Commission official also delivered a chilling warning for the UK car industry over its future after Brexit. Mr Barnier used an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to largely trash Mrs May's outline of a future UK-EU trade relationship. Theresa May says is would be 'a gross betrayal of our democracy' The prime minister has proposed a ""common rulebook"" for goods to enable frictionless trade between Britain and the bloc after Brexit, along with a ""facilitated customs arrangement"" to remove the need for extra border checks. However, Mr Barnier suggested the UK's proposals for future regulatory alignment on goods, while remaining outside the single market, threatened the EU's future. ""The British have a choice,"" he said, as reported by The Guardian. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice. ""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. ""Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits. That would be the end of the single market and the European project."" Mr Barnier also declared the prime minister's plan to levy EU tariffs on behalf of Brussels, in order to bypass the need for post-Brexit customs checks, would be ""an invitation to fraud"". Highlighting how the EU is already demanding €2bn (£1.8bn) from the UK for failing to crack down on customs fraud by Chinese clothing importers, he said: ""We cannot relinquish control of our external borders and the revenue there to a third country - that's not legal."" Economics editor Ed Conway cuts through the text and highlights the key points Adding to concerns over the post-Brexit prospects of the UK car industry, Mr Barnier claimed EU firms must be prepared to disregard British manufacturers once the UK has departed the bloc, in order to preserve other trade agreements signed by Brussels. ""In order for EU carmakers to benefit from the tariff benefits of the EU-Korea agreement, only a certain proportion of the services may be provided in a car in a third country,"" he said. ""Businesses have to be careful not to use too many parts of Britain in their vehicles in the future."" Mr Barnier also offered further evidence he has ditched his previous deadline of October for tying up a Brexit deal, stating negotiations must now be concluded by ""mid-November"". ""We don't need more time. What we need are political decisions,"" he added. Mr Barnier and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have agreed to continuous talks from now on in a bid to reach a breakthrough in negotiations on both Britain's withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on a future EU-UK relationship. The Sunday Times reported Mr Raab was recently told by Mr Barnier to choose between a future relationship along the lines of the EU's current partnerships with either Canada, Norway, Switzerland or Ukraine. Mrs May has consistently argued the UK should be offered a bespoke deal. On Sunday, Mr Raab's predecessor Mr Davis continued his attack on the prime minister's Chequers plan amid reports of a wider national campaign by leading Tories against her proposals. Responding to Mr Barnier's comments, a UK government spokesperson said: ""We are confident that we have put forward a proposal that is precise, pragmatic and that will work for the UK and the EU. ""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. ""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU."""
2018-09-02,"A drone was flown deliberately within 20 feet of a light aircraft, its pilot has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/drone-flown-deliberately-towards-light-aircraft-11488774,"It happened as the PA-31 twin-engined plane was coming in to land at RAF Northolt in west London on 11 June. The pilot ""lost sight of"" the drone under his plane's nose, a report from the UK Airprox Board (UKAB) said. It was ""identified as a small white drone of the lightweight hobbyist type"", the report added, and it passed about 20 feet below the aircraft. The small, remote-controlled device ""passed close to his right wing and was possibly launched from a park"". The pilot had ""no doubt that it was being deliberately flown under the flight path in an attempt to collide with an aircraft"". An airprox is a situation in which two aircraft get close enough to compromise safety. There were six near misses between drones and aircraft in 2014 - rising to 93 last year. Research has found that a drone weighing 2kg could critically damage an airliner's windscreen, while a lighter one weighing 400 grams could smash a helicopter windscreen. The incident in Northolt posed the most serious degree of risk, UKAB said. Police could get the power to issue on-the-spot fines of up to £300 for the misuse of drones, as well as the power to seize them, under proposals being considered by the Department for Transport. It is also considering banning children from owning drones weighing at least 250 grams. Drones are already banned from flying above 400 feet, and within 0.6 miles (1km) of airport boundaries. Anyone breaching those rules faces fines of up to £2,500. They could also be charged with recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or any person in an aircraft, carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison."

The missing are ""presumed submerged"". One person was airlifted to the University Medical Centre of Southern Nevada with life-threatening injuries. Nine others had to be taken to hospital. Some of those on board the boats were thrown into the water by the force of the collision or jumped, and were swept down the river. ""We had victims of this collision that were located three to five miles downstream from the original point of impact,"" said Eric Sherwin, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire District. Rescuers had to call off the search for the missing until Sunday morning because it was too dangerous for divers to swim in the river after dark. The smash happened in Moabi Regional Park, a popular water recreation area situated about 290 miles east of Los Angeles. The stretch of river along the California-Arizona border where the collision took place had been crowded with people enjoying the Labor Day weekend."
2018-09-02,"Theresa May has said that ""giving in"" to calls for a second referendum on the final terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU would be ""a gross betrayal of our democracy"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-slams-call-for-second-brexit-referendum-as-betrayal-of-trust-11488381,"The Prime Minister dismissed calls from the People's Vote, a cross-party group that includes several high-profile figures and MPs, for a second Brexit vote. What are the battlegrounds for the PM, the EU and the Tories? Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs May said: ""In the summer of 2016, millions came out to have their say. In many cases, for the first time in decades they trusted that their vote would count; that after years of feeling ignored by politics, their voices would be heard. ""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy - and a betrayal of trust."" Mrs May said the coming months were ""critical in shaping the future of our country"". She said she was ""confident"" that the government could strike ""a good deal"", but in the event of a no-deal Britain would ""be ready if we need to be"" and ""go on to thrive"". She insisted she would not be pushed around by Brussels and stood by the government's controversial Chequers exit plan, despite continued sniping against it from Tory benches. ""I will not be pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest,"" she wrote. But former Brexit secretary David Davis said he would vote against the Chequers plan in any Commons vote. He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: ""No I'd vote against it, it would be rather odd for me to resign over something and then vote for it when it came back. ""In my view the Chequers proposal - it's not a deal, we shouldn't call it the Chequers deal, it's the Chequers proposal - is actually almost worse than being in."" Mr Davis added: ""We will be under the rule of the EU with respect to all of our manufactured goods and agri-foods, that's a really serious concession. What about take back control? It doesn't work. ""That actually leaves us in a position where they dictate our future rules without us having a say at all, so it's a worse deal."" His comments came as it was reported that the election strategist who helped Boris Johnson win the London mayoralty was involved in a bid to scupper the Cabinet's Chequers compromise. The Sunday Times claimed Sir Lynton Crosby, who also advised Mrs May in last year's general election when the Tories lost their majority, is manoeuvring to derail the PM's EU withdrawal agenda with a co-ordinated national campaign. The claims emerged as former minister and high-profile Tory MP Nick Boles, who backed Remain at the referendum, came out against the Chequers deal. He told the Sunday Telegraph that under current government plans, the UK faces ""the humiliation of a deal dictated by Brussels"", which is treating the Chequers proposals as an ""opening bid""."

2018-09-02,Richard Hammond and his family believe they were gassed before being burgled while on holiday in the southeast of France.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/horror-story-richard-hammond-gassed-by-burglars-in-saint-tropez-11488578,"The 48-year-old presenter was staying in a villa in Saint-Tropez with his wife Mindy, teenage daughter and a group of friends when they were targeted by thieves. Describing the experience as a ""horror story"", Mindy told the Sunday Express how she almost came face to face with the night-time intruders. After hearing a door shut downstairs and going down to investigate, she heard a ""male voice behind the door"", but went back to bed thinking it was one of the other couples. It was only later she realised it was the voice of one of the burglars. ""That just makes my blood run cold. I could have easily walked in and it could have been unpleasant,"" she said. It wasn't until the following day that Mindy began to realise something was wrong, and the 15 guests discovered cash had been taken from their wallets and purses. The Hammonds' daughter, Willow, 15, also discovered her watch had been taken. Explaining the blatant nature of the theft, Mindy said: ""I'm pretty convinced we must have been gassed or something, because they were in all of the bedrooms - they went where they wanted, into each room, opening and closing the drawers, searching through handbags etc."" Mindy said that the perpetrators ""have got to have some kind of confidence to do that and to be quite satisfied that people aren't going to wake up"". She also said even Richard's snoring failed to wake her the following morning, when the whole house struggled to get up. The guests, who woke to discover their bedroom doors wide open, learned that the neighbouring property had also been burgled that same night. The mother-of-two added: ""It's particularly worrying when you have a teenage girl who knows that her bedside table has been rifled through while she was sleeping - that's not very nice at all."" Fearing for their safety, they hired a security guard for the remainder of their stay. Two burglars, whose faces were caught on CCTV, were arrested less than 48 hours later. Mindy described one of the men as looking ""quite a lot like Richard"". A string of burglaries in France, allegedly using anaesthetic-based gas to knock-out residents, have taken place in France in recent years. In 2015 Formula 1 driver Jenson Button and his now ex-wife Jessica had about £300,000 of jewellery stolen while they slept while holidaying in Saint-Tropez. The couple's spokesman believed gas was pumped into the house. In separate incidents, ex-Arsenal footballer Patrick Vieira and TV stylists Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine also say they fell victim to gassing while staying in Cannes in 2002 and 2006 respectively."
2018-09-02,The issue of whether there should be a second referendum is significant when you go to places where the Brexit vote was tight.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/i-believed-scaremongering-discussing-second-brexit-referendum-11488819,"Nottingham voted to leave but only just, with 50.8% tipping the balance away from Remain. But it also had the fifth lowest turnout of all voting areas. A recent poll here revealed there could be a change of heart. If a second vote were to occur the outcome here could swing the other way. There's a discussion going on inside a pub that was once a church. It involves three people with very different views about Brexit. They are talking about whether their faith has been tested since the Brexit referendum. Property developer Colin Watkins was a staunch Remainer but is now a born-again Brexiteer. ""I voted with my head instead of my heart,"" the 72-year-old said. ""I now think the scaremongers got the better of me, swayed my opinion in a way that, if they had dealt in facts, may not have happened. ""I believe Europe needs us more than we need Europe and so I have come round to the idea that we should leave. Theresa May cannot back down to this campaign to get a second vote. ""For all of the shouting, it's done. We know where we are, we know where we're going."" Olivia Kendall, a trainee teacher, voted to remain and is sticking to her guns. ""I think the campaign on both sides was disgusting - full of misinformation,"" she said. ""Having said that we can't keep asking the people what they think. The vote has happened and it should stand, despite what I think. ""I want to remain, I respect that fact that the referendum result was that people wanted to leave."" Alongside the two is Liam Martin, a local government officer. He is ""not confident"" about the future. ""I see all sorts of companies slimming down their operations here and leaving the UK and taking their investment back to Europe. Maybe another vote would produce a different result. ""I feel like we get a lot out of the EU, I feel like the EU gets a lot out of us,"" he said. ""I feel like it would be more beneficial if we were together."""
2018-09-02,Frank Field's resignation as a Labour MP has caused much confusion - both in Westminster and beyond.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/frank-field-quits-what-does-it-mean-to-resign-the-whip-11486413,"Complex parliamentary process was pored over to discover, for example, if the work and pensions select committee chair would be forced to quit his role. Or whether the man who has been a Labour member for nearly 60 years could remain so, despite resigning the whip. But to those outside the Commons bubble, more fundamental questions remain. Sky News has unpacked the technical detail behind Mr Field's move. :: Why is the whip called a whip? The parliamentary expression originates from hunting terminology, with a ""whipper-in"" defined as a ""huntsman's assistant who keeps the hounds from straying by driving them back with the whip into the main body of the pack"". In a similar way, a whip in parliament will attempt to prevent MPs from straying from the party line in votes. :: What does it mean to resign the whip? The whip is effectively the rules and policy an MP is bound by. An MP with the Labour whip must follow internal party rules, will be investigated in line with that party's procedure if they break them, and must support the party's policy in parliament. Resigning the whip means Mr Field will no longer be bound by Labour rules or forced to vote in line with the party. Another MP who resigned the Labour whip recently was Jared O'Mara. He originally had the whip taken away from him by Labour, meaning he did not represent the party. The Sheffield Hallam MP was later reinstated but chose himself to resign the whip, saying he had been made to ""feel like a criminal"" for a history of controversial online comments. He now sits as an independent. :: What is a ""three-line whip""? MPs are sent a document each week telling them upcoming business and when votes are expected to be held. The importance of business to the party is reflected by the number of times potential votes are underlined. A ""one-line"" whip is a guide to the party's policy on a matter and notification of when a vote is predicted to take place. There is no binding commitment for MPs to attend debates or vote. A ""two-line"" whip is an instruction to attend and vote. Attendance is required unless permission has already been given by party officials. A ""three-line whip"" is the strictest instruction for an MP to attend and vote with the party line. Breaking a three-line whip has serious consequences, with non-attendance only excused in emergencies. :: Is there such thing as an ""independent Labour MP""? In his resignation, Mr Field said he would now be sitting as an ""independent Labour MP"". He can label himself how he likes, but in parliament the Birkenhead MP will officially be recognised as an ""independent"". Confusingly, there was an ""Independent Labour Party"" founded in 1893 - years before the Labour party that is today's official opposition. :: Can Frank Field remain a Labour member despite resigning the whip? This was certainly his intention, but Mr Field has admitted it might not be possible. Labour's former head of compliance said any MP who resigns the whip but is still a Labour member would have 14 days to re-take it, or face expulsion. ""You can't be a half member,"" he said. :: Will Frank Field have to quit his select committee chair role? Mr Field has one of the most influential roles of any backbencher in parliament, chairing the Commons' work and pensions select committee. There is little precedent to rely on to say whether he must give up that role, as the chairs of all Westminster's select committees are divvied up by party. They are a delicate political to ensure oversight of the government, with 12 chaired by Conservative MPs, nine by Labour, two by the SNP and 1 by the Liberal Democrats. Given that committee chairs are elected by fellow MPs for a term, it is unlikely Mr Field will have to give up the role."

Her reaction sparked thousands of complaints from viewers. A CBB spokesman said: ""Roxanne has decided to leave the BB House. The remaining housemates have been informed."" Pallett told producers Thomas punched her ""repeatedly, unprovoked"", adding in tears: ""He actually punched me like a boxer would punch a bag. And we weren't play fighting, there was no banter, it wasn't a joke."" She later slept in a separate bedroom from her fellow contestants, saying it was ""because I felt uncomfortable, because Ryan assaulted me"". She also said she was ""in pain all night"". Thomas, who was given a formal warning for physical contact by Big Brother, apologised for his actions saying there was no ""malice"" intended. The pair later spoke about the incident, and Thomas told Pallett: ""I want you to know from the bottom of my heart I was showing my affection. ""Maybe it came across the wrong way. I promise you, you've got it wrong and I apologise if it has come across that way."" The pair later agreed to put the incident behind them and shook hands. Rodrigo Alves, 35, had been given a formal warning after he used racist language on the Channel 5 reality programme Media watchdog OFCOM received 11,215 complaints over the episode - thought to be about Pallett's reaction - and is deciding whether to investigate. A backlash on social media also saw scores of Twitter users come to Ryan's defence, with many commenting on how the allegation damages real crimes against women. Pallett's Twitter account was later deleted. Pallett is the second star from this year's series to leave without being evicted, following the removal of Rodrigo Alves. The 35-year-old Brazilian reality star was given a formal warning after using racist language. He later told The Sun he quit because he ""could not cope without his mobile phone""."

But while she continues to feel ""numb in her legs and dizzy and has headaches"", Mr Ratcliffe said she was feeling better when he spoke to her on Sunday. Gabriella, who was ""really upset"" after her mother returned to prison and ""wouldn't sleep and wouldn't settle and wouldn't eat"", visited Nazanin for 45 minutes on Sunday, and is now back in her normal routine. While the family was extremely disappointed that Nazanin's temporary release from prison was not extended, Mr Ratcliffe said the new foreign secretary had been ""very strong on Nazanin's case"" after replacing Boris Johnson in July. He continued: ""I wanted him to make her a priority - it feels like he has. He's issued statements saying he thought she was innocent. He's been as strong as we could have wanted. ""It feels like she's got a big brother in the playground. ""It feels like we've got a more strident tone being taken from the foreign secretary."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe threatened to go on hunger strike when she was in the prosecutor's office last month on the way back to Evin prison in Tehran. The family was ""terrified"" and managed to talk her out of it, Mr Ratcliffe said. Since being back behind bars, the head of the prison has visited Nazanin twice, telling her to ""keep calm"", and promising to find out what was happening her case, without giving any clear answers. ""They were clearly very worried about her health condition - I think probably covering their own backs, as much as genuinely concerned,"" Mr Ratcliffe said. The situation the family is in feels like a power game ""between different parts of the Iranian regime, showing they're in charge, (and) between the Iranian government and the British government"". Mr Ratcliffe said: ""We're being used in the middle, and it's cruel, because obviously there's a real family just trying to have a normal life."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 for ""plotting to overthrow the Iranian regime"" and was convicted last year, despite her denials."
2018-09-02,The British government has revealed that Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan are communicating with cells in the UK and western Europe with the potential to carry out attacks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/islamic-state-fighters-in-afghanistan-in-touch-with-uk-cells-11489142,"Although the rise of IS in Afghanistan has been well documented, it is the first time the government has confirmed the franchise now poses a direct threat to the UK. On a visit to British troops in Afghanistan, the defence secretary told Sky News that the UK must act to prevent an attack. ""What we see is a real threat posed by these groups to the UK and we've got to be acting as we are to ensure that we do not see future Manchester-style attacks,"" Gavin Williamson said from the northern city of Mazeer-i-Shareef. ""We consistently see terrorist groups operating here in Afghanistan, [and] evidence of their links back not just to the United Kingdom but to the whole of continental Europe."" The group, known as IS-Khorasan or IS-K, is a rival to the Taliban and al Qaeda and has been targeted by US and British special forces in Afghanistan. Its latest leader, Abu Saad Erhabi, was killed in a US airstrike a week ago - he was the fourth IS leader to be killed in the country in the past few years. Thousands of foreign fighters are believed to have arrived in Afghanistan having been pushed out of Iraq and Syria but the defence secretary's words suggest the group is more established than previously thought. Sources wouldn't confirm whether any Britons are known to be among their number but said IS-K represents a ""broad demographic"". However, General John Nicolson, the highly respected outgoing American head of the international coalition, rejected the claim that IS-K is growing. ""They have been able to replenish a portion of their losses by recruiting from other violent extremist organisations,"" he told Voice of America. ""Despite this recruiting there are losing fighters and losing ground."" The news that IS-K poses a threat to the UK is a worrying development and comes as 440 extra British troops arrive in Afghanistan as part of an uplift requested by Washington to tackle the threat and stabilise the country. Sky News was the only television news organisation to fly in with the troops. The total UK commitment to Afghanistan now numbers around 1,100 personnel, the third largest behind the United States and Germany. The small increase comes four years after British troops ended their combat mission in the country and left Camp Bastion in Helmand. The move was criticised at the time as being too soon, but the defence secretary defended it, pointing out that Afghan forces, not the international coalition, are now in charge of security across the country. ""You've seen the Afghan government move forward very rapidly in terms of the development of their forces. I think what we have done is recognise where we can add value and support. ""The Afghan people are one of the most proud people and nations you could imagine. They want to be able to defend their country against the threats they face."" The arrival of more British forces in the country, to operate in a non-combat role, comes at a crucial moment - President Ashraf Ghani has offered formal peace talks to the Taliban and, although nothing is likely to happen before the presidential elections next year, there is quiet optimism. ""We now have a real chance to make progress,"" Britain's deputy ambassador to Afghanistan, Giles Lever, told Sky News. ""I appreciate that people have been saying that for a long time but we have a particular set of circumstances this year which do represent qualitatively different from where we've seen before since 2001. ""First if all the president's peace offer to the Taliban, the offer of unconditional talks. Second, the US/South Asia strategy which doesn't set any timeline for US military support to Afghanistan. ""Finally, the Eid ceasefire in June where we've seen something we had not previously seen in 17 years which was a complete cessation of violence and Taliban fighters coming into the city and welcomed."" The suggestion of peace talks has attracted Russia, who recently proposed hosting the talks. Russian-funded radio stations are now broadcasting in Afghanistan, putting out anti-NATO messages on the airwaves. There are multiple reports that Russia has been arming the Taliban, sources say via Iran as a proxy. Mr Williamson criticised Russia's increasing ""meddling"" in the country. ""What we want Russia to do is play a positive role in Afghanistan. I think that they could be playing a much more positive role,"" he said."

Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, the rocker said: ""I once took a drug, DMT. There was the gallery owner Robert Fraser, me, a couple of others. We were immediately nailed to the sofa. And I saw God, this amazing towering thing, and I was humbled. All trains for #EgyptStation calling at https://t.co/A3FwvYMNqo pic.twitter.com/I2EVLYRf5j He went on to describe God as ""huge"" and like ""a massive wall that I couldn't see the top of, and I was at the bottom… We felt we had seen a higher thing"". Dimethyltryptamine - known as DMT - is a hallucinogenic drug which occurs naturally in plants and animals, including humans. Usually smoked or injected, the drug causes intense and abstract ""trips"", with many users reporting almost out of body experiences. Talking about this vision of God as ""a clue"", he went on to describe a ""thrilling"" moment which later occurred following the death of his first wife, photographer and activist Linda. While grieving, he spent time in the country, where he saw a white squirrel which he believes was ""Linda, come back to give me a sign"". Touching on his musical career of over 60 years, the singer said he once gave Stormzy an impromptu music lesson, with the help of a piano. McCartney said he knew the rapper would already be a master of words, so decided to ""show him basic stuff - how you get middle C, make a chord, a triad and, just by moving that, get D minor, E minor, F, G, A minor, and how that's enough for anyone"". Egypt Station - McCartney's 17th solo studio album - is released on 7 September. The concept album will be followed by a world tour, kicking off in Canada on 17 September, before heading on to the US, Japan, Denmark and Europe."
2018-09-02,"The number of staff bringing banned items into jails has risen by 58% since 2012, figures reveal.

The Ministry of Justice figures show in the last six years more than 340 people have undergone disciplinary or judiciary proceedings for bringing in drugs, mobile phones or other contraband items. Commenting on the data, Centre of Social Justice director Andy Cook said the level of smuggling was ""concerning"" and ministers needed to ""get a grip"". ""Drugs are at the heart of this, fuelling violence, suicide and completely undermining the likelihood that prisoners will be able to turn their lives around,"" he said. Which are Britain's best and worst prisons? Drugs were found 35 times a day in prisons in England and Wales last year, and the number of finds has trebled since 2014, the paper reported. Figures released by the Ministry of Justice in July revealed that the number of drugs found in English and Welsh prisons rose by 23% last year, and that one in five inmates tested positive for illegal substances in random tests. They also showed a 15% rise in finds of mobile phones and a 13% increase in sim cards. The figures for the year between March 2017 and March 2018 also revealed that 20.4% of drug tests came back as positive - with the psychoactive substance spice, nicknamed ""the zombie drug"", found in 60% of these cases. The poor state of UK prisons was thrown into stark relief last month when the Ministry of Justice was forced to take over HMP Birmingham after G4S, the security firm contracted to run it, conceded it could not get the jail under control. One inmate told Sky News the ""prisoners are in control of that jail"" and drugs and violent incidents were a constant threat. ""It's full of mobile phones - it's a disgrace,"" he said. ""As soon as you walk on the wing, you'll get googled - now how the f*** are you getting googled in jail from a mobile phone anyway?"""

Daniel Hepplewhite, a reptile expert from Snakes Alive, said the reptile was unlikely to attack dogs. ""It will be more interested in squirrels,"" he said. ""It's an arboreal species, so it's probably up a tree."" Mr Hepplewhite, 37, said the boa constrictor has not been sighted for three weeks. ""A lady phoned up a few weeks ago saying she saw a snake heading into the woods,"" he said. ""She sent a picture, which is the picture on the poster."" If the snake is a pet, it has either escaped or been illegally released. A boa constrictor would be able to survive in the British climate until the winter."
2018-09-02,"Dozens of young male gorillas in UK and European zoos face being castrated as part of a plan to make them more manageable, reports say.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180902234416/https://news.sky.com/story/zoo-gorillas-face-castration-so-they-are-easier-to-keep-11488527,"Scientists apparently want them to develop more like ""butch"" females instead of turning into ""silverback"" mature males which are very strong and can be aggressive and difficult to look after. As the young males get older they start to challenge their fathers and have to be kept separately or in bachelor groups which can create more problems with how they are managed. Also there tends to be a surplus of males - as gorillas produce equal numbers of males and females but they go on to live in harems of one male to two or three females. The Gorilla Foundation said Koko's capacity for language and empathy opened the minds and hearts of millions. Castration involves the apes having their testicles surgically removed. Mbula and Mwana, young males living in Chessington Zoo, have been castrated. The castration programme is overseen by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (Eaza). Eaza director of communications David Williams-Mitchell told The Sunday Times that castration was an ""ethical alternative"". He added: ""Carried out at a young age, [it] prevents development of the full range of adult male characteristics and behaviours... research points to castrated animals continuing to live in their original family groups with no problems."" Mbula and Mwana are in a research group of 11 gorillas who have had the surgery over the past decade, according to the newspaper. A study involving 75 male and female gorillas of all ages - including 10 males who have not had the operation - found the castrated ones were more often tolerant of being near other gorillas than ones who had not had it. Now some young gorillas are on so-called ""castration row"", awaiting a decision by scientists as to whether they will be allowed to develop into fully equipped adult males, the paper added. There are 40 male and 60 female gorillas in British zoos. At least one owner, the charity The Aspinall Foundation, which runs Howletts Wild Animal Park and Port Lympne Reserve, both in Kent, is against moves to castrate gorillas. Anti-zoo campaigners have also hit out at the idea. Dr Chris Draper, head of animal welfare and captivity at the Born Free Foundation, told Sky News: ""It's a classic example of making the animal fit the environment rather than the other way around."" Born Free is against the ""exploitation of wild animals in captivity"" and Dr Draper described castration as ""a pretty drastic step"". Speaking about the surplus of males outside the harems, he said: ""In the wild, gorillas move about in groups. The males would have a chance of forming a group. It's not possible in a captive situation."""

It is believed he was bitten by a blue shark - the most common species in Irish waters and one not usually considered dangerous to humans. ""This was more of an angling accident than a shark attack, there was a bit of a struggle when pulling the shark on board,"" an RNLI spokesperson said. ""We're not trying to panic anyone."" The RNLI added: ""We wish the patient well."" The incident took place about eight miles offshore on the boat Deora De, which was met by a Crosshaven lifeboat about four miles south of Roches Point. The man was then transported to the mainland by boat and was taken to Cork University Hospital by an ambulance. Blue sharks normally feed on squid and fish and can live for around 20 years. Until 2013 the species was implicated in only 13 biting incidents with humans, four of which ended fatally."

""It is time to say that this wrong must and can be righted,"" he said. ""This injustice has got to be remedied, this stain must be removed. The sore that exists and the harm that has been done, and the hurt it has caused, has got to be undone."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry later added further pressure on party leader Jeremy Corbyn to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Association's (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism and its examples in full. Although Labour's new code of conduct, which has been approved by the party's ruling body, endorses the IHRA's working definition, it also omits four examples from the IHRA list relating to Israel. The party argues although the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered. However, Ms Thornberry told the Financial Times: ""My view is that we should adopt the full definition with the examples. ""I understand why people looked at some of the examples and thought, 'Hang on a minute, how can we implement this? Might it mean that people can't criticise the state of Israel?' ""My interpretation is that clearly, we can. I've read a number of legal advices that say that we can."" A crunch meeting of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee this week will decide whether the party should now adopt the IHRA definition and examples in full. Mr Brown delivered his speech hours after rabbi Lord Sacks launched a renewed attack on Jeremy Corbyn over anti-Semitism. The former chief rabbi told BBC1's Andrew Marr programme that unless the Labour leader ""expresses clear remorse"" for comments made about British Zionists in 2013, he posed ""as great a danger as Enoch Powell"". ""Jews have been in Britain since 1656, I know of no other occasion in these 362 years when Jews - the majority of our community - are asking 'is this country safe to bring up our children',"" said Lord Sacks. ""Now, this is very, very worrying. ""Anyone who uses the term Zionist loosely, without great care, is in danger of engulfing Britain in the kind of flames of hatred that have reappeared throughout Europe, and is massively irresponsible. ""There is danger that Jeremy Corbyn may one day be prime minister, he is the leader of Her Majesty's opposition. ""I'm afraid that until he expresses clear remorse for what he has said and what his party has done to its Jewish sympathisers as well as its Jewish MPs, then he is as great a danger as Enoch Powell was."" In another interview with Andrew Marr, shadow chancellor John McDonnell invited Lord Sacks to speak further with Mr Corbyn. He said he believed ""all sides would be satisfied"" with Labour's planned proposals for a new definition and that the party would ""resolve this matter"" and ""move on"". ""I think when you sit down with Jeremy you will find you are virtually on the same page on many of these issues,"" he said. ""You'll be able to work together to tackle this issue of anti-Semitism in our society, which we acknowledge exists and we've got to tackle together."" As allegations of bullying and anti-Semitism persist for the Labour Party, its senior leaders fear it could shatter Mr McDonnell has expressed his concerns about the prospect of the Labour party splitting. In an interview with the New Statesman, Mr McDonnell said he wanted to avoid a split ""at all costs"" and address the ongoing anti-Semitism scandal ""as quickly as possible""."

A month ago, the Birkenhead Constituency Labour Party dealt a crushing blow to the 76-year-old by winning a vote of no confidence against him. Mr Field, who has represented his Merseyside seat since 1979 and won in 2017 with a majority of 25,514, has faced previous efforts to de-select him. He denied he had ""jumped before he was pushed"" and said he intended to fight the next general election as an independent Labour candidate. One Labour source told Sky News that was like ""having your cake and eating someone else's too"". Fast forward a month and the venomous language on both sides lays bare the deep division within the Labour party. Frank Field resigned the Labour whip and has gone it alone as an independent because he says Labour's anti-Semetic tendencies have filtered down to his own constituency. Sky News digs into the detail behind a move from MP Frank Field which has prompted much confusion. He described some local Labour members as ""often racist, ageist and sexist in nature"". On the high street in Birkenhead, they're all talking about it. ""I think he's made a mistake to resign the whip,"" says retired bricklayer Roger Lythe, 73. ""He's a good MP. If he stands as an independent, he'll get my vote."" Worth considering that Mr Lythe has voted Conservative all his life. Brenda Fazakerley, a nurse, tells me: ""I think Frank Field has done a good job, but he's been doing it for a long time. And sometimes new ideas and new ways of thinking are what's required."" Some of Labour's 'old guard' MPs in the northwest have felt the pressure from those loyal to Jeremy Corbyn. New MPs such as Dan Carden, who represents Liverpool Walton - loyal to Mr Corbyn and prepared to defend the Labour leader, thinks Mr Fields should move aside. However, when Sky News knocked on the door of Mr Carden's constituency office in Liverpool to ask him some questions he was unavailable for comment. A queue of local Labour councillors think the same; the same group Mr Field accuses of being ""thuggish"". But over the Mersey, Mr Fields has support. ""The leadership doesn't seem to recognise the gravity of the problems,"" said Labour's Louise Ellman. ""It's the job of the leader to recognise what's wrong and to do something about it. Jeremy has been slow to see this. ""He sometimes talks solely about the membership of the party and tries to sideline MPs who are elected by millions of people across the country. That's a major mistake."" Labour Party sources suggest Mr Field may be kicked out immediately, rather than being given the usual 14 days to consider retaking the whip. Mr Field says he will take that decision to court as Labour infighting intensifies."

An area the size of two football pitches was ablaze from the first floor of the five-storey building upwards, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said. Six hours later, the fire service reported the blaze had been brought under control and that the crews had been able to prevent the fire spreading through the whole site. Area manager Paul Murphy said: ""This has been a significant fire and extremely difficult for our crews to deal with due to the size of the building. ""However, crews have worked extremely hard to battle this fire and have prevented it from spreading into the remainder of such an iconic building. ""We are all Merseyside firefighters and this building is as much iconic to us as it is to anyone else, so we are really pleased that we have been able to prevent further spread of fire. ""It has been a challenging incident but we are in a position with the council where we feel the structural integrity of the building may remain intact."" Firefighters had been using breathing apparatus to tackle the fire inside the building, while two main jets were being used to fight the flames from the outside. Large plumes of smoke came from the building and nearby residents were advised to keep their windows and doors closed. More than 60 calls from members of the public were received about the fire. The iconic Littlewoods building up in flames 😟 pic.twitter.com/ZR58Gawv0s Joe Anderson, mayor of Liverpool, posted on Twitter: ""Absolutely heartbreaking news that the iconic Littlewoods Building is ablaze, looks pretty bad at this stage, let's hope and pray it's salvageable."" Formerly the headquarters of Littlewoods, the building started life as the hub of the family-owned business empire's department store, catalogue shopping and football pools operations. However, it was requisitioned just a year after it opened in 1938, to become the government's postal censorship department during the Second World War. The vast printing presses were used to print 17 million National Registration cards. After the end of hostilities, Littlewoods took the building back but it has been empty since the 1990s. However, earlier this year, £50m plans were unveiled to use the building as part of Liverpool's bid to become ""the Hollywood of the North"". Twickenham Studios, famous for films such as The Italian Job, agreed to take 8,000 square metres of space in the building. The Littlewoods site, which is 17,000 square metres in total, is owned by regeneration specialists Capital & Centric. The firm posted on Twitter: ""Heartbroken tonight that our Littlewoods Building is on fire. Fire crews are trying to control it at the moment.

2018-09-09,Police will be given extended stop and search powers under a proposed crackdown on acid attacks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/stop-and-search-powers-may-be-extended-to-tackle-acid-attacks-11493701,"A public consultation has been launched on widening the circumstances in which the tactics can be used, as figures suggest there are 15 incidents involving acid every week in the UK. Officers can currently stop and search individuals they suspect of being in possession of a corrosive substance with ""intent on causing injury"". The proposed extension will allow police to search anyone they suspect of carrying a corrosive in a public place. Ministers say the move - first mooted as part of a blueprint to tackle serious violence earlier this year - will enable forces to take better preventative action. Experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory are also developing a portable kit so that police can test suspected corrosive substances on the street. Policing minister Nick Hurd said: ""A bottle of acid can be as lethal as a knife or a firearm, and these new powers will enable police officers to prevent these despicable thugs from carrying out their terrible crimes. ""The home secretary has been clear that stop and search is a vital and effective policing tool when used correctly."" Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Kearton, National Police Chiefs' Council lead for corrosive attacks, backed the proposals. ""Officers should be confident to use stop and search - proportionately and respectfully - because it's an important investigative tool,"" she said. The government also unveiled plans to extend stop and search powers to cover offences relating to misuse of drones and laser pointers. Last year there were 93 near-misses between drones and manned aircraft and there are growing concerns over lasers being pointed at aircraft, with more than 1,000 reported instances annually since 2010. Mark Swan, director at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: ""Laws are now in place to protect aircraft from both drones and laser pointers, and we support efforts by the police to enforce these laws."" In the year to March 2017, police in England and Wales carried out 303,845 stops and searches - the lowest number since current data records started in 2001/02. The tactics have repeatedly attracted controversy, amid criticism they unfairly focused on black and minority ethnic individuals. Reforms were introduced in 2014 by then home secretary Theresa May to ensure stop and search was used in a more targeted way."

The speakers included Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury; Harriet Harman, a veteran Labour MP; and Norman Lamb, the former Lib Dem health minister who still sits in parliament. An even more surprising figure arrived in the shape of George Osborne - fresh off the red-eye flight from New York - who called up last minute and insisted on speaking. It was shocking how in all their political differences, it was the murdered MP for Batley and Spen's message that rang through all eight tents. The aim was to reach out to ordinary people of all political persuasions - and none, organiser George Freeman MP told me. That was immediately clear from the wacky ""scribble wall"", a 10 metre-long canvas where attendees were encouraged to express themselves. Underneath the caption ""draw our current government as an animal"" was a picture of a large mouse. Other additions included: ""Love Lib Dems"", ""Move parliament to Birmingham"" and ""Bush did 9/11"". It was easy to spot the different types of people mingling, too. There was the family of five, ministers mingling amiably with members of the public, and those who would happily stand and speak to a crowd of three on some obscure topic from ""Speaker's Corner"". There were, it has to be said, few voices I heard singing the praises of Jeremy Corbyn. But then there were equally few parroting how brilliant Theresa May is. It's not that these views weren't held, but given the political dominance the Conservative and Labour leaders have, this felt like a genuine space to hear sincere debate without being told you had to pick a side. So many I spoke to paid tribute to Jo Cox, and repeated her message: ""We have more in common than that which divides us."" That was proved by the call from Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester's Labour mayor, for the festival to move northwards next year. If it can retain its non-combative, free-flowing, free-thinking atmosphere, the Big Tent Festival Of Ideas will be the antidote to the PMQs poison. Where everyone comes together to discuss ideas - from capitalism to culture - without having to sit in one camp or the other."
2018-09-09,The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is heaping pressure on the Labour Party over whether it supports a second referendum on Britain leaving the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/tuc-pressures-labour-party-to-support-second-brexit-referendum-11493888,"General secretary Frances O'Grady said that the public should have a say on the terms of the Brexit deal through a ""popular vote"", despite the prime minister ruling it out. The head of the TUC, speaking after members of Britain's biggest three unions appeared to back a second referendum, said unions would never negotiate a deal and not consult their members. A poll of Unite, Unison and GMB members on the eve of the TUC conference found twice as many were in support of a final vote on the government's deal than against. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Ms O'Grady said time was running out for the UK to avoid ""crashing out"" of the EU. She said: ""That would be an absolute disaster for the people we represent. If we don't get a deal that working people need, the TUC will be throwing its full weight behind a campaign for a popular vote so that people have a say."" The general secretary said a deal in which the UK would stay within the customs union and single market would be the best way to protect people's livelihoods. She added: ""Trust in the government to deliver a good deal is nosediving."" Last week, the GMB union, which represents 639,000 workers, came out in support for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Three days ago, members of Unite, the UK's largest trade union, voted to agree a policy stating it is ""open"" to a public vote on the agreement the government strikes with Brussels. They are among the latest unions to raise the issue of giving people a final say on the proposed deal, with the Royal College of Nursing - which represents 400,000 nurses - also backing a second vote. The TUC move puts further pressure on Jeremy Corbyn. He has so far refused to rule a second vote out, but he has not said whether he is in favour of it. ""There's this sense that 'OK, maybe I voted for this, but I didn't vote for this mess'"" - Labour's @ChukaUmunna on ""a country divided on #Brexit"" #Ridge pic.twitter.com/JduJNgg3FB Campaigners who want a second Brexit referendum have been working hard to change Labour's stance on the issue, according to a leaked memo. The People's Vote campaign, which is lobbying for a vote on the final deal Prime Minister Theresa May secures with the EU, will attempt to secure a motion on the issue at the party's annual conference in Liverpool later this month. MPs and other senior Labour figures, including David Lammy and former frontbencher Andy Burnham, have also expressed support for a second poll. Labour has never taken the option of a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal off the table, and many constituency parties are understood to be willing to back a motion at conference committing the party to a fresh poll. The Corbyn-supporting Momentum group has also said it will ask members about the issue later in the year rather than take a position at the Labour conference in Liverpool. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a long-standing opponent of Brexit, reiterated his view that there should be a second referendum on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme."

He also ordered a cab to collect him from the next stop after he had got on the wrong bus from Holy Family Catholic High School in Thornton. The younger boy, without any money or a mobile phone, had no other means of getting back to his home in Netherton. Two fellow Year 7 students, Harry Campbell and Dylan Robson, stood with him while he waited for the cab to arrive. Tom's generosity did not go unnoticed, with the mother of one of the children on the bus sharing the act of kindness on Facebook. Ruth Furlong wrote in a post: ""There really are some truly decent kids out there! ""A year 11 lad came over to them all asking how their first day went? He spots a new kid crying because he's gotten on the wrong bus and it's getting further away from where he lives. ""'It's ok mate, don't worry, you'll be home soon' he told him. He whipped out a tenner and arranged for a taxi to pick him up at the next bus stop and made sure he got home safe."" Ms Furlong urged anyone who knew Tom to let his parents know ""what a lovely lad"" they have raised. The Facebook post received over 2,000 likes after gaining traction from fellow parents and friends. Tom's older sister Katie O'Brien left a comment confirming his identity, writing: ""Ahhh everyone it was my little brother."" She added: ""I've just been tagged in this by a friend of mine who's seen this status. We are so proud of Tom and it's so lovely to know he's a good lad in the outside world"". Katie told Sky News that the family are ""all incredibly proud of him, as well as the two younger lads who helped"". She said: ""It is just so nice to see teenagers getting some good press for a change. ""Tom can't quite believe all the fuss he honestly never thought it would go this far but he's happy that teenagers can be seen in a good light."" The taxi driver did not charge the boy and his parents for the young boy's ride home, and dropped the £10 back off at school for Tom, the Liverpool Echo reported. Tom's father Kenny later said how proud he is of his ""thoughtful and caring"" son. ""I am very proud of him. He is a very thoughtful lad and has a great personality"" he told the Echo. ""He didn't tell me what had happened until later in the night when he realised people were talking about it on Facebook""."

Police received multiple calls from 8.20am on Saturday. One man suffered minor injuries, the force said. The suspect - Ayaan Ali, from Isleworth, west London - has also been charged with affray and possession of an offensive weapon. She has been remanded in custody and is due before Barnsley Magistrates' Court on Monday. The online speculation has created ""a lot of fear and distress locally"", Chief Superintendent Scott Green said. He added: ""We are satisfied that this was an isolated incident by a single person. ""We would therefore ask the public to stop reinforcing the rumour that there were multiple people involved. ""We can now also confirm definitively that this was not an act of terrorism."" Mr Green said that while the presence of ""so many officers may have been disconcerting"", the force's priority was to ""ensure the safety of the public""."
2018-09-09,North Korea has held a huge military parade - the first since negotiations with the US over denuclearisation began in earnest - as the country celebrates the 70th anniversary of its founding.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/n-korea-holds-military-parade-without-ballistic-missiles-11493707,"Previous public parades have included nuclear missile launchers, but they did not feature during Sunday's celebration in Pyongyang - a clear sign that leader Kim Jong Un did not want to cause diplomatic provocation as negotiations continue. At the end of the parade, Mr Kim waved to the crowd hand in hand with Li Zhanshu, one of Chinese President Xi Jinping's closest advisers - a sign of ever-closer relations between the two countries, and an indication this display was also intended for a global, diplomatic audience. Mr Xi has congratulated Kim Jong Un and North Korea on the 70th anniversary of North Korea's founding, hailing it once again as the ""new historical period"" that the country was entering. The parade was nevertheless a huge affair, lasting about two hours. Ranks of soldiers filed past in the characteristic North Korean goosestep-like march. The military hardware on show included tanks, artillery, and short-range rocket and missile launchers. Thousands of civilians followed afterwards, waving flags and shouting slogans. Some were crying - the sort of mass display of obedience, loyalty and devotion only possible in a totalitarian regime. Tong Zhao, a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy, told Sky News: ""This is an internal event for North Korea: it's their anniversary, they want to celebrate that. ""But by having a major military parade, it could be seen by outsiders as a provocation. ""So North Korea needs to strike a balance between enhancing their domestic morale. ""They also want to send a big signal, that they want to now focus on economic development. ""The celebrations are also expected to include a revival of the mass games - a large-scale performance involving tens of thousands of North Korean people. We were told they have been practising for months after school and work. The anniversary comes at a crucial time during talks over denuclearisation. For a long time, the US and North Korea were at an apparent impasse, with the US asking for a comprehensive list of the North's nuclear facilities, and Pyongyang asking for a formal end to the Korean War - a proper peace treaty was never signed. Neither side has seemed willing to give way. But over the last few days, there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity from Pyongyang. A third summit between Mr Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in has been confirmed for later this month. Mr Kim also sent a message to Donald Trump, who happily tweeted his thanks in return. :: Kim Jong Un pledges to denuclearise N Korea by end of Trump's first term Prior to the parade, Mr Kim visited the mausoleum where his father and grandfather are interred. Accompanied by dozens of officials and army officers, he was seen bowing repeatedly while soldiers formed an honour guard and carried wreaths. North Korea declared its establishment as an individual state in 1948 following Korea's liberation from Japanese occupation in 1945."
2018-09-09,A scout leader who was expelled after comparing a woman canoeing in a hijab to Darth Vader has reached an out-of-court settlement with the movement.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/ex-scout-leader-gets-payout-after-darth-vader-hijab-quip-11493890,"The Scout Association expelled Brian Walker, 62, for penning a letter to the official magazine complaining the movement was promoting Islam and drifting away from its Christian roots. Mr Walker, who joined the scouting movement when he was 10, wrote about a female leader taking girls canoeing in a hijab - and said: ""Hello! Canoeists don't dress like that. ""They need all round unobstructed vision so they protect the group, and of course they will most likely drown wearing that Darth Vader tent!"" He also accused the association of ""promoting political correctness and interfaith issues"", including through visits to mosques, while it recommended the use of non-religious venues for St George's Day services. Mr Walker also said that the scouting faith calendar attached no meaning to Christmas and Easter, yet Islam was prominent. The organisation should be careful promoting Islam ""given the way the religion treats women and their rights"", he wrote. He sent the letter in March 2017. Although it was never published, the scout's district commissioner for Bristol South, Scott Stowell, decided to expel Mr Walker immediately. Mr Walker, who was supported by the Christian Legal Centre, appealed against the decision in June 2017. He claimed he did not intend to offend anyone personally and was making a more general point about the scouting movement. However, the decision was upheld and Mr Walker responded by bringing a legal action for discrimination on the grounds of his Christian beliefs and that the association had breached its equal opportunities policy. The association agreed to settle the case a month after a court hearing in Bristol. A judge refused an application to throw out Mr Walker's claim on the grounds he had no realistic chance of winning. It is not known how much Mr Walker received from the settlement but he told The Mail on Sunday that he remains banned from the scouts. In a statement he said: ""Scouting was started in 1908 by Sir Robert Baden-Powell, based on Christian principles, whilst welcoming those of all faiths and none. Over recent years, I have been concerned that the movement has increasingly promoted Islam above Christianity. ""Islam is not what has given the scouting movement its inclusive and welcoming nature. ""I am raising this case as I believe the fundamental values of Scouting are being undermined. ""Parents need to be made aware of what is happening at the centre of Scouting, and will eventually flow out into the local groups. ""We need to act now to maintain and protect the values on which the movement was based."" A spokesperson for the Scout Association said: ""We can confirm we have come to an out-of-court settlement with Mr Walker regarding his claim. This settlement does not imply that we accept Mr Walker's claim made against us or his view of the world. The scouts do not accept Mr Walker was right when he made his offensive comments. ""As a charity, we had to weigh up whether it was worth using our limited time and money on a costly and prolonged legal dispute. In this case, we decided it was in our best interests to settle this matter out of court."""

2018-09-09,Seventeen-year-old Jayden Parkinson was pregnant when she was strangled and buried by her violent ex-boyfriend in Oxfordshire in December 2013.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/my-daughter-was-killed-by-her-violent-ex-a-domestic-abusers-register-could-have-saved-her-life-11492653,"Ben Blakeley, who had a history of violence towards previous partners, is serving a life sentence for the teenager's murder. Here, Jayden's mother Samatha Shrewsbury tells Sky News why she hopes her daughter's death is not in vain as she backs calls for a register of domestic abusers. I don't want another mum to have to stand there and look at their daughter's body on a slab. I will never forgot that until the day I die. For the year before Jayden was killed, I thought it was me he was targeting. I didn't expect it to be her. I really thought he wanted me out the way. He could manipulate her, he could get money out of her. I remember him coming round one day after he'd spat at her the day before and punched her in the face. He managed to get into the block of flats and he was banging on the door. I refused to let him see Jayden so he walked off and spat at me. Later that afternoon, Jayden went outside for a cigarette and I didn't see her again for two weeks. He had met her outside. She was at an age when she had no income or benefits. They were living rough - here, there and everywhere. It became hard to contact her. He would cut up her sim card or break her phone. She didn't want to admit to herself that that was what he was like. Everybody had heard the stories before. She wanted to change him. He burnt her, beat her, starved her. She was a wayward teenager that wasn't listening. I was told because she was 16, it didn't matter where she went. If the police said it was okay for her to stay there, they didn't have to tell me where she was. I didn't have a leg to stand on. But when she was murdered, she was classed as a child. Where does that get lost? Why couldn't the police bring her back home? She was safe with me. I do believe that she could have been helped if people believed she wasn't a naughty kid and I wasn't an irate mum with a wayward child that was on benefits, that didn't deserve to be looked at or listened to. I'm angry at the government. Really angry. This isn't a new epidemic at all. It's just more of an epidemic now because people are listening and people like me are standing up and saying this isn't right. It's got to stop. There were other girls that were hurt before my Jayden. If there was a register then, she would be sat here with my grandchild now. The register should be public and everybody should be able to access it, not just the police or social services. The amount of times he had been arrested, there would have been flags all the way along. That could have saved her life. I'd also like a programme rolled out in schools about healthy relationships. A lot of people don't realise they're in a coercive, controlling relationship until it's too late. I just want more protection for women like my Jayden and the women that are too come. Two women are killed every week in England by a partner or ex-partner. In my lifetime, I know I won't eradicate it. But if I can stop one girl from dying and one mum feeling like I do, then Jayden's death will not be in vain."

2018-09-09,A New York City subway station has re-opened almost two decades after it was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of 9/11.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/new-york-opens-wtc-cortlandt-subway-station-17-years-after-911-destroyed-it-11493702,"When the twin towers of the World Trade Center fell in 2001, Cortlandt Street station was buried under the rubble. Its shell, tracks and tunnels were all destroyed. For the past 17 years, the new World Trade Center has risen around it piece by piece, but the subway station has remained closed, missing from the city's subway map and bypassed by the No 1 train. In 2015, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was given control of the site and began planning to rebuild it. But the project was complex, with the rest of the World Trade Center site having to be rebuilt before work could begin, according to reports. Transport officials had to work with other authorities to determine where the new buildings would be before they could even plan the subway entrances. Eventually they were able to complete some 1,200ft of tunnel, rebuild tracks and repair the station shell and other infrastructure. The new station - 700ft long, 47ft wide and several floors below street level - was named WTC Cortlandt to reflect its connection to the World Trade Center. The result, at a cost of $181m (£140m), was seen on Saturday by the city's transport officials, politicians and excited commuters who cheered as the first train stopped by just after noon. The new WTC Cortlandt station on the 1 line is now open to the public. It’s fully accessible, has fewer columns for easier customer flow, and is also air-tempered to keep you cooler on hot days. pic.twitter.com/A5DaiBb06w The New York Times described the new subway station as ""sleek, bright and airy"", bearing ""little resemblance to its old, dank self"". MTA chairman Joseph Lhota said the reopening ""represents a major milestone in the recovery and growth of downtown Manhattan"". He added: ""WTC Cortlandt is more than a new subway station - it is symbolic of New Yorkers' resolve in restoring and substantially improving the entire World Trade Center site."" Among the station's new features is a marble mosaic by artist Ann Hamilton based on the Declaration of Independence. Explaining the thought behind her work, Hamilton said in the New York Post: ""I think when we see things that are beautiful, maybe our hearts fall open a little bit, and we are a little more generous."""

There could also be a rise in acquisitive crimes such as theft, along with massive traffic queues at ports, leading to ""unprecedented and overwhelming"" disruption in the wider road network. But Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the public need not worry and that departments had to ""prepare for all possible outcomes"". He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr show: ""I don't expect a no-deal outcome but we need to prepare for all contingencies and it's absolutely correct... I'm not going to go into what the situation may or may not be but I think it's fair to say we're preparing for all contingencies. ""This is an unprecedented situation but most important of all we must keep focussed on the deal and get a deal delivered but at the same time every government department should prepare for all possible outcomes."" He added: ""I don't think people need to worry."" However, the report added that there was a ""real possibility"" that soldiers would be deployed and police would have leave cancelled around the date of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union in March next year. Some police forces would need ""widespread leave embargoes"" and others, such as Kent, are expected to unilaterally cancel rest days and leave immediately after 29 March. The document was obtained by The Sunday Times and will be considered by the National Police Chiefs' Council later this month. It focuses on the potential consequences for the police service if a Brexit Britain turns sour. Among these are: :: EU police officers losing their legal right to carry a warrant card. This would potentially affect 750 officers in the Metropolitan Police alone :: Increased data costs hitting the budgets of forces which rely on mobile communication :: Disruption potentially lasting for three months either side of Brexit day, rather than the six weeks planned for by the government :: A perceived lack of communication between the Home Office and the Brexit department :: The impact of the Operation Stack (used for queuing traffic at Channel ports) needing to be used at docks around the country NPCC lead for operations Chief Constable Charlie Hall told The Sunday Times: ""The police are planning for all scenarios that may require a police response in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""At this stage, we have no intelligence to suggest there will be an increase in crime or disorder. ""However, we remain vigilant and will continue to assess any threats and develop plans accordingly."" Shadow police minister Louise Haigh said: ""This is the nightmare scenario long feared; according to the UK's most senior police officers a no-deal Brexit could leave Britain on the brink."" The Home Office said it would not comment on leaked documents. A spokesman said: ""We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and are increasingly confident that we will secure a deal with the EU. ""However, it is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. ""With that in mind, we are working closely with operational partners - including the police - on contingency planning so we can ensure the safety and security of our citizens in all scenarios."""

The MoD said it used secure encryption among other methods to stop potential criminals in their tracks. It told the paper: ""We have robust procedures to deter and prevent losses and thefts, whilst precautions like securely encrypting electronic devices ensure they cannot be accessed if they cannot be located."""
2018-09-09,At least two percent of people in the UK could be suffering from the long-term effects of their mother drinking alcohol while pregnant.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/thousands-affected-by-hidden-epidemic-of-foetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorder-11493613,"Not enough is known about foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), a condition that is often misdiagnosed or missed completely, charities say. The main symptoms of FASD include growth problems, behavioural issues, learning difficulties and issues with hearing or eyesight. There is no treatment for the condition but its symptoms can be managed. When Anna Webster adopted her son, she was told his birth mother had drunk alcohol during her pregnancy but she had no idea of the effect it would have on him. ""He was a lovely, gorgeous little baby,"" she told Sky News. ""There weren't any obvious signs particularly, but he was always very hyper, had lots of energy and had some difficulty with focusing and concentrating and speech and language issues as well."" Because so many cases are not picked up - with some people being labelled as badly behaved, for example, it is difficult to know exactly how many people are suffering with the condition. Sandra Butcher from the charity NOFAS-UK, which is raising awareness of the condition, told Sky News: ""A conservative estimate would be more than two percent of the population, so here in England that translates into more than 15,000 babies a year. ""It's vastly undiagnosed and it's something that the government is going to have to really get on top of because the problem is that these children are being seen in the NHS through different services but they're not being properly supported so it's kind of a waste of resources."" Dr Raja Mukherjee works at a clinic specialising in the disorder in Surrey and cites research showing there are serious consequences for adults who have not been diagnosed. ""If you don't support it then 90% have gone on to have mental health problems, half the group that they were studying ended up in prison at some point, a third of them ended up with their own addictions,"" he said. ""There are lots of secondary disabilities. Many of them end up homeless or on social security so there's a lot of support that's needed."" On International FASD Awareness Day (9 September), charities are calling for more help and advice for vulnerable mothers. Adoption UK described the situation as a ""hidden epidemic"". John Simmonds from CoramBAAF adoption and fostering academy told Sky News: ""Children who come into care, whether they then go on to be adopted or into foster care, are likely to come from a group of families who face all kinds of adversities but where alcohol and drug use are quite common."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The chief medical officer's low risk drinking guidelines provide clear advice for women across the UK that for those who are pregnant, or could become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all. ""However, we know that more needs to be done for vulnerable groups and later this month, we will be hosting an expert roundtable on foetal alcohol spectrum disorder to inform the new alcohol strategy."""
2018-09-09,The inventor of a controversial plastic collection system has defended the project as it launches into the Pacific Ocean for the first time.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/inventor-defends-use-of-giant-pollution-scooper-11492922,"Boyan Slat's Ocean Cleanup system is aimed at sweeping up billions of pieces of plastic waste floating in the massive so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The 600-metre long technology was launched from San Francisco Bay on Saturday amid intense media interest. The 24-year-old Dutch inventor has expressed frustration at scepticism and criticism of the project from many in the ocean science community. He told Sky News: ""I don't think there's much of a choice in what we're trying to do. ""Research shows the plastic doesn't go away by itself and keeps fragmenting over the next few decades. ""If we don't clean it up now, all of it will become micro plastics and then we are in a much worse state than we are today. ""This is the best way we could figure out how to do it. ""If there are better ways, we'd love to know."" Mr Slat said he agreed the long-term solution to the problem of plastic waste is reducing it on land and preventing it from reaching the ocean in the first place. He said he feels as confident as he can with the equipment about to undergo testing 250 miles off the California coast. If those tests are successful, it will travel 1,000 miles towards Hawaii to begin the job of collecting plastic waste. The first results are expected by the end of the year. Great Pacific Garbage Patch, here we come pic.twitter.com/3rX77a5NMa The system comprises a 'floater', a boom which bends into a u-shape, with a skirt attached, forming an artificial coastline to corral plastic so it can be picked up and recycled. Some of the plastic in the garbage patch, also known as a gyre, has been found to date back to the 1960s. Experts say the amount equates to 250 pieces for every person on earth. Despite huge financial backing, the project has faced criticism from some environmentalists concerned marine life could become trapped in the system alongside waste. And groups like the Ocean Conservancy have expressed concern that, even if plastic can be removed, a lot more is pouring into the ocean every day. George Leonard, the conservancy's chief scientist, said: ""We hope it works.

2018-09-09,"Reading some of today's headlines, it might be tempting to conclude that the UK was on the verge of declaring cyber war on Russia in retaliation for the nerve agent poisonings in Salisbury earlier this year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-has-not-declared-cyber-war-yet-but-russian-threat-is-impossible-to-deny-11492480,"That is the interpretation being given to a speech by the director of GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, in Washington last night, two days after senior Whitehall sources told The Times that Theresa May was ""preparing a cyber war"" against Russia. A closer inspection of Mr Fleming's exact comments, however, tells a different story. Describing the Russian state as ""reckless"", the GCHQ director said the threat ""will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies, able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus"". What we heard was a statement of fact, a recognition that ""offensive cyber"" now forms part of the arsenal of weapons at a state's disposal. Given that a British national has been killed on British soil, it would be astonishing if the government was not considering technological responses. Mr Fleming's speech simply confirmed that was the case. Still, seeing as it has been floated, even tentatively, it is worth asking the question: what would cyber war look like? Here, the picture becomes murky. To assess the options at the UK's disposal, it helps to think of offensive cyber on a spectrum. At one end are ""hard"" attacks on critical national infrastructure such as the Stuxnet worm used by the United States and Israel to disable Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009. At the other are ""soft"" attacks which use social media to spread misinformation and disinformation (or even just information, which is in precious short supply in Russia at present). Britain has declared that the Russian people are not its enemy, so launching a hard attack would be an extreme reaction with very risky consequences. As the WannaCry attack showed, the UK's own national infrastructure is hardly in a state to resist an aggressive retaliation. Launching a soft attack would be, if anything, more difficult. As the indictments released by special counsel Robert Mueller showed, the Russians schemed for years before hitting the United States in the lead-up to the 2016 election, employing hundreds of people at the Russian Internet Agency. What's more, even if it did get under way, this kind of campaign would be hard to justify politically in the UK, a state supposedly based around respect for the value of truth. So what's left? Naturally, UK authorities aren't saying. But the reality may be that there are not too many options - and those that remain rely as much on old-fashioned tradecraft as modern technology. But, whatever happens - and we may never hear about the result - it is becoming increasingly clear that the threat from Russia is forcing the UK and other western states to gear up for all aspects of a cyber conflict. Because, with the Russians launching ""fake news"" attacks on the US, France and the UK, as well as numerous other states, you could say that cyber war is already here. We just don't know it yet. As the GCHQ director put it in his speech last night: ""The threat from Russia is real. It's active."" That is impossible to deny."
2018-09-09,"The bodies of five people, including a woman and children, have been discovered at a suburban home in the Australian city of Perth.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/children-among-five-found-dead-at-home-in-perth-australia-11493771,"Police do not yet know how they were killed, and it is unclear whether any weapons have been found at the scene. A man, said to be in his 20s, is in custody and being questioned after presenting himself to police. Western Australia assistant police commissioner Paul Steel said: ""This is early and we've not yet fully examined the scene. ""We understand that there are adults and children involved."" He confirmed that up to five bodies were found at the scene when police arrived in the suburb of Bedford at noon on Sunday. Mr Steel added: ""I can say there was at least one woman but I can't say more than that I'm afraid. ""The scene has not yet been forensically examined so the exact number of adults and children is actually unknown to me."" Investigators are currently searching the home for evidence, and police could not provide any further details on the victims. There are no ongoing concerns for public safety. While violent crime with multiple victims is rare in the country, this was the second major incident in Western Australia this year. Seven people were shot and killed in the Margaret River mass shooting in May, while a mother and her two children were murdered in Ellenbrook in July. Gun crime fell sharply in Australia after strict controls were introduced following the 1996 mass shooting in Tasmania, when lone gunman Martin Bryant killed 35 people."
2018-09-09,"The justice secretary has ordered a full review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, amid criticism that some victims are being unfairly denied payouts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/govt-to-review-scheme-giving-compensation-to-victims-of-crime-11493727,"David Gauke said the assessment was necessary to ensure that those affected by offences such as sexual abuse and terrorism receive the compensation they are due. Officials will examine several existing rules in the scheme, including a time limit on applications and restrictions on compensation claims from victims who have criminal records. The scheme may also be extended to cover other crimes such as grooming. In addition to the review, the government also announced the abolition of a controversial rule which blocks victims from receiving financial awards if they lived in the same home as their attacker before 1979. Known as the ""same roof rule"", it was part of the original compensation scheme introduced in 1964. Mr Gauke said: ""Whilst no amount of compensation can make up for the immense suffering endured by victims of violent crime, it is vital they receive the help and support needed to rebuild their lives. ""Today I'm announcing that we will review the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme to ensure it reflects the changing nature of crime and can better support victims, especially of historic and current child abuse."" Victims of violent crimes that take place in England, Wales and Scotland can be awarded taxpayer-funded payments of up to £500,000 through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. Claims can be made in relation to mental or physical injury, sexual or physical abuse, loss of earnings and the death of a close relative. In 2017 to 2018, the scheme paid out more than £150m. But MPs and campaigners have called ministers to overhaul the rules, claiming they are outdated and illogical. Mr Gauke added: ""Over the years we've seen more prosecutions for sexual offences and sadly experienced the horror of terrorism. ""We need to make sure these victims get the awards they're due so we will be looking to ensure the criteria are appropriate."" In July, the Court of Appeal declared that the same roof rule is incompatible with human rights laws. Possible changes to the post-1979 same roof rule, and previous applications, will be considered as part of the new review. The plans are set out in the first ever cross-government victims strategy and will launch on Monday."
2018-09-09,Chuka Umunna has told Sky News he believes the Labour Party is institutionally racist because of its handling of antisemitism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180909202053/https://news.sky.com/story/chuka-umunna-labour-is-institutionally-racist-11493849,"Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, the former frontbencher said the Labour Party ""beyond doubt"" met the definition of institutional racism outlined by Sir William McPherson in the McPherson Report. Asked whether he believed the party was effectively institutionally racist, the MP for Streatham replied: ""Yes I do. It's very painful for me to say that. ""Part of the reason that I joined the Labour Party [and] my family started supporting the party was because it was an anti-racist party and I think the failure to deal with the racism that is antisemitism in particular and clearly is a problem. ""It's a sadness to listen to you talk about what has happened and transpired over the summer, because we failed to deal with this issue properly and most recently whether or not we adopt the International Holocaust Memorial Alliance's definition of antisemitism, which we should have done right at the beginning of the summer."" ""There's this sense that 'OK, maybe I voted for this, but I didn't vote for this mess'"" - Labour's @ChukaUmunna on ""a country divided on #Brexit"" #Ridge pic.twitter.com/JduJNgg3FB It comes after the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Trevor Phillips, said: ""It doesn't help that one of our great parties, the one I belong to, is led by antisemites and racists who basically want to eliminate anyone who disagrees with them."" The comments were criticised by Labour's shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, who tweeted: ""I have literally spent all of life fighting racism. And today is a sad day. ""UK Labour is NOT institutionally racist. If it was I would go. Chuka Umunna and Trevor Phillips' interventions are disappointing. Windrush, hostile environment that's a clear example of a racist institution."" On the first Sophy Ridge on Sunday after the summer recess, Sky News asked Mr Umunna: ""If you think Labour is institutionally racist, why are you still in the party?"" He replied: ""Because I want it to change. Look, there is institutional racism in many institutions in our country and if you simply leave the field as it were, instead of try and argue and see change through in an organisation, then I'm not sure you always necessarily make progress and that's the reason why."" Pressed on whether he would rule out leaving the Labour Party, he said: ""I don't want to leave the Labour Party… Who knows what I'll be doing when I'm 80. I've been a member of the Labour Party for more than 20 years and I joined with the intention of never leaving it. I wanted to be a member of the Labour Party on my deathbed and I hope that is the case."" Mr Umunna was criticised on the show by Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery for his comments calling on Jeremy Corbyn to ""call off the dogs"" targeting centrist MPs in the party. He said: ""That is so disrespectful, it's so offensive to members of the Labour Party. Calling anybody a dog is absolutely outrageous in the extreme and Chuka Umunna of all people should know that and I hope when he comes on to your show this morning that he takes this opportunity of apologising to those people who he has offended immensely."" When Sky News asked him how many people had been suspended or expelled from the Labour Party for antisemitism, Mr Lavery said: ""It would be wrong of me to try and tell you exactly what the number is but there certainly has been people kicked out the party and rightly so."""

The patient, who has not been identified, is believed to have contracted the disease in Nigeria before travelling to the UK. Public Health England has sought to reassure Britons that monkeypox does not spread easily and most patients recover within a few weeks with no lasting effects. It can cause severe illness in some people, with symptoms including fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, which usually starts on the face and spreads forming a scab which falls off. PHE is working with the NHS to identify people on the same flight as the patient and contact them. There is no confirmation about whether the patient is a member of the military. PHE said in a statement: ""People without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly."" Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said: ""It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries. ""It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients."" Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE said ""well established and robust infection control procedures"" were being followed. The World Health Organisation says monkeypox occurs primarily in west and central Africa, near tropical rainforests, and is mostly passed to humans from rodents and primates. There was an outbreak in Nigeria in 2017, with 172 suspected and 61 confirmed cases between September and December. WHO reported one death."

The EEA is an area where people, services and goods flow freely across borders. All 28 EU countries are in it - apart from Croatia which is in it with provisions - as well as Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised Britain will quit the EEA when it leaves the EU, saying people voted to ""take back control of our borders"".

""I first started having conversations about Europe with him when we were 18 years old. ""He - who has impeccable Brexit credentials and is probably one of the most influential people over 20 or 30 years in bringing Britain to the point that we decided to leave - suggests that we should remain in the EEA. ""People who hadn't even thought about our membership of the EU say 'that's a betrayal'. ""I think that's an interesting option."" :: Theresa May under further pressure to 'chuck Chequers' He continued: ""I think if you can find a venn diagram where you've got Dan Hannan and Michael Gove, potentially, and George Osborne and [Tory MP] Nick Boles - and that's just in the Conservative family, let alone in the Liberal Democrats and Labour family... ""I think you'd have a solution, which also by the way allows the country to get on and talk about the things you've been talking about at this festival."" :: Jo Cox echoes in 'Tory Glastonbury' tents Mr Gove, the environment secretary, remains a close friend of Mr Osborne. The pair were pictured this year attending an opera in Germany. Mr Gove - one of the leading campaigners for Britain to leave the EU - was sacked from the cabinet in July 2016 and then promoted back into it a year later by Theresa May. The Daily Mail claimed last month he discussed ""parking"" the UK in the EEA if Brexit talks end without a deal. Asked later about the claim, he said: ""I don't know what you're talking about."""

Housing Secretary James Brokenshire told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that he is backing the PM, while Home Secretary Sajid Javid cuttingly said the Tories are not looking for a new leader. One minister called Mr Johnson's comments ""disgusting"", while another said he needs to ""grow up"". Mum Agnes Bergman reacts to the former foreign secretary's latest controversial comments Mr Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. ""It's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see."" Amid growing speculation that Mr Johnson is angling to replace Theresa May in Number 10, Mr Javid added: ""The Conservative Party is not looking for a new leader because we are lucky to have a very good leader. She is also the prime minister of this country and is doing a great job."" Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Mr Brokenshire said: ""Boris has obviously expressed his views... I think he's wrong on that. I think the tone that he's used isn't right and I think we just need to be very focused, all actually moving forward with the Chequers plan."" In The Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson once again attacked Mrs May's so-called Chequers plan, writing: ""We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla. ""And the reason is simple: Northern Ireland, and the insanity of the so-called 'backstop'. We have opened ourselves to perpetual political blackmail.

""We have given him a jemmy with which Brussels can choose - at any time - to crack apart the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, Mr Johnson's former deputy, wrote on Twitter: ""For Boris to say that the PM's view is like that of a suicide bomber is too much. ""This marks one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics. I'm sorry, but this is the political end of Boris Johnson. If it isn't now, I will make sure it is later."" Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said: ""A suicide bomber murdered many in the courtyard of my office in Helmand. ""The carnage was disgusting, limbs and flesh hanging from trees and bushes. Brave men who stopped him killing me and others died In horrific pain. Some need to grow up.

""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal."" Labour's education spokeswoman Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson's comments showed the state that the Tories were in. She said: ""Tory leadership battle has not yet officially started and they are already using analogies such as 'suicide vests' to slur one side against the other. The other side is reported to have a 'dirty dossier' on Boris Johnson. Truly awful stuff in our politics."" In other political news, Chuka Umunna told Sky News that he believes Labour is institutionally racist.  Meanwhile, the head of the TUC has called for the public to have a say on the terms of the Brexit deal through a ""popular vote"" - warning that time is running out to avoid the UK ""crashing out"" of the EU. The union's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, told the Andrew Marr Show: ""That would be an absolute disaster for the people we represent.

The proposal is calling for the number of parliamentary constituencies to be reduced from 650 to 600. It should have been implemented before the 2015 general election, but was abandoned after splits in the coalition government. If it had been in place last June, Mrs May would not have had to make a deal with Northern Ireland's DUP to gain her current small working majority of 13. All the main political parties would have lost MPs overall due to having 50 fewer constituencies, but the gap between Labour and the Conservatives would have widened under the plans from the current 55 MPs to 76.

2018-09-10,The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier believes a deal is possible before the beginning of November.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180910165942/https://news.sky.com/story/pound-jumps-as-michel-barnier-says-brexit-deal-possible-before-november-11494677,"In remarks that saw a jump in the value of the pound, the European Commission official claimed a treaty could be agreed ""within six or eight weeks"" if both sides are ""realistic"". It came as it was reported that EU leaders are expected to announce next week - at an informal meeting in Salzburg - that an extraordinary Brexit summit will take place in November. According to The Guardian, the special gathering is likely to be held on 13 November and will allow a political declaration on the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU. However, the newspaper said a solution to the Irish border issue would need to be finalised at an already scheduled EU summit in October for a deal to be possible. Mr Barnier offered hope of a UK withdrawal agreement within that timeframe during remarks at an economic forum in Slovenia on Monday. ""I think that if we are realistic we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks,"" he said. ""Taking account the time necessary for the ratification process, the House of Commons on one side and the European Parliament and Council on the other side. ""We need, we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November. I think it's possible."" The pound was up a cent against the dollar at more than $1.30 on the reported comments, while sterling was also up half a cent against the euro at just over €1.12. Chris Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said: ""Sterling has become very sensitive to positive Brexit news over the last couple of weeks, having spiked on a couple of occasions on reports that the UK will get a bespoke deal and that Angela Merkel is willing to accept less detail on future ties. ""Clearly there is a feeling that a lot of Brexit pessimism and no deal risk has been priced in which is why we're in a state of such sensitivity to any reports that indicate a breakthrough will come."" Prime Minister Theresa May is still facing opposition to her so-called Chequers plan for Britain's future ties with the EU, with 80 Tory MPs claimed to be willing to vote against her Brexit proposals in the House of Commons."

After waking up on Monday, the president tweeted a volley of attacks and denounced the award-winning journalist's reconstruction of scenes in which frustrated aides scramble to contain the president's impulses. Mr Trump tweeted: ""The Woodward book is a Joke - just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. ""Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction. Dems can't stand losing. I'll write the real book!"" The president is quoted in the book brutally insulting members of his cabinet and refers to attorney general Jeff Sessions as ""mentally retarded"". Former chief of staff Reince Priebus is described as ""a little rat"", according to Woodward's book. :: Woodward on Trump: Explosive claims in latest book on White House The Woodward book is a scam. I don’t talk the way I am quoted. If I did I would not have been elected President. These quotes were made up. The author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle. I wish the people could see the real facts - and our country is doing GREAT! Defence secretary Jim Mattis is quoted as saying the president has the mental capacity of a ""fifth or sixth grader"", while chief of staff John Kelly is said to have called Mr Trump ""an idiot"". ""We are in Crazytown,"" General Kelly is quoted telling a small group of confidants. ""I don't even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I've ever had."" Calling the book a scam, Mr Trump said last week: ""I don't talk the way I am quoted. ""If I did I would not have been elected president. These quotes were made up."" Mr Mattis, Mr Kelly and other aides have vehemently denied making the disparaging statements attributed to them in the book. In a statement, Mr Kelly said: ""The idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true, in fact it's exactly the opposite. He and I both know this story is total BS."" Mr Mattis also issued a statement, re-tweeted at least twice by Mr Trump, saying, ""The contemptuous words about the president attributed to me in Woodward's book were never uttered by me or in my presence."" He said the book was ""the product of someone's rich imagination"". In response, Pulitzer Prize-winning Mr Woodward, who along with Carl Bernstein exposed the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, said Mr Mattis and Mr Kelly ""are not telling the truth"" when denying they made the remarks and ""these are political statements to protect their jobs""."
2018-09-10,The government is planning to overhaul support services offered to victims of major disasters such as Hillsborough and the Grenfell Tower fire.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180910165942/https://news.sky.com/story/government-pledges-greater-support-for-disaster-and-crime-victims-11494286,"As part of a cross-department initiative dubbed Victims Strategy, the Ministry of Justice has launched a consultation with a view to providing bereaved families a greater role during investigations into how and why such tragedies unfolded. It includes an opportunity for their voices to be heard at inquests, and direction to appropriate support services, via the creation of an independent public advocate. Justice Minister Edward Argar said ""it is clear there remain serious concerns about how far the voices of the bereaved are heard"", with the government having been criticised for its handling of the Grenfell Tower blaze. Earlier this year, Theresa May admitted she ""will always regret"" not meeting survivors of the fire the day after the tragedy unfolded as it gave the impression she did not care. She said the new strategy, which also aims to improve support for victims of crime, showed the government was taking steps to ""enshrine"" the rights of victims into law for the first time. ""Nothing can take away the distress and trauma of being a victim of crime, but ensuring people get the support they need as they rebuild their lives is vital,"" the prime minister said. ""How we support victims is fundamental to a caring society, and in recognition of that we are taking steps to enshrine their rights in law for the very first time. ""The duty of a government is to keep people safe, but it is not enough to simply bring offenders to court. ""Victims need to know they are protected and listened to, and we will continue to work with charities and support groups to improve their experience."" The strategy, which also outlines plans to fully review the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme after critics warned some victims are unfairly denied payouts, will be consulted on until early December. In a foreword, Mr Argar said he hoped to ensure the ""painful experience"" of families of the 96 who died at Hillsborough would never be repeated. Last November, a damning 240-page report into how the relatives were ""dehumanised"" after the tragedy was published by the former Bishop of Liverpool. Mr Argar said: ""An independent public advocate will help to address these concerns. ""I am determined that we should never again see families struggling, as we did in the many years that followed Hillsborough, against the very system that was supposed to deliver answers and, ultimately, justice."" During the consultation period, officials will assess a number of proposed rules, including a time limit on when applications for compensations must be lodged and restrictions on claims from those with criminal records. The Ministry of Justice will also weigh up whether to extend the crimes covered to include grooming. In addition to the review, which will report back next year, the government has also announced that a controversial bar on financial awards to victims if they lived in the same home as their attacker before 1979 will be abolished. :: Justice Secretary David Gauke will discuss the plans live on Sunrise on Sky News at 7.15am on Monday."

Cook scored his 33rd hundred from 210 balls and is the fifth player to get a century in his first and last Tests. The entire Indian team lined up to shake his hand when he was finally caught out and the crowd gave him a standing ovation. Cook's ton sent the home fans wild - the England great held his bat aloft and removed his helmet as he soaked up the moment. ""What was telling about the reaction of that 100 was the reaction of his teammates and the reaction of the crowd, the country,"" said former England player Nasser Hussain. ""They virtually had to stop play there for a while because of the crowd showing what he means to the nation.

Cook's innings finally ended when a small nick saw him caught behind after a ball by Indian spinner Hanuma Vihari. The 33-year-old announced his retirement from the international game earlier this month. He said he was quitting international cricket ""after much thought and deliberation"" following below-par performances that had put him on an average of under 19 runs for this year. Cook will still play county cricket for Essex. His fifth place in the all-time list puts him behind Sachin Tendulkar (India, 15,921 in 200 Tests); Ricky Ponting (Australia, 13,378 in 168 Tests); Jacques Kallis (South Africa, 13,289 in 166 Tests) and Rahul Dravid (India, 13,288 in 164 Tests).

Other options the firm could be looking at include renegotiating leases on stores that are up for renewal, selling off its Danish arm Magasin du Nord and giving up space in some of its large stores. The company has brought in KPMG to help draw up the turnaround plans, according to The Sunday Telegraph. Debenhams chairman Ian Cheshire said: ""As we started in June, the board continues to work with its advisers on longer-term options, which include strengthening our balance sheet and reviewing our non-core assets."" Debenhams also updated investors on its trading performance, saying it expects to report pre-tax profits of around £33m this year, within the current market range of £31m to £36.5m. The retailer also expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £157m and year-end net debt of about £320m. Chief executive Sergio Bucher said: ""The market environment remains challenging and underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months."" CVAs have been used by a number of retailers, including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare, to seek creditors' permission to close stores and slash rent bills. The use of CVAs is unpopular among landlords who have seen rents slashed by up to 90%. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at Xtb, said: ""The firm has lost two-thirds of its market value in 2018 alone, as it issued three profit warnings and has announced a series of job cuts and it now appears to be seeking outside help in a bid to stop the rot. ""Debenhams has been a stalwart of the British high street for more than a century but its recent decline is in keeping with broader troubles for bricks and mortar retailers that have failed to adapt to the rise in e-commerce. ""These troubles are widely known and Debenhams has been one of the most widely shorted stocks on the LSE (Londons Stock Exchange) of late with more than 10% of the float currently believed to be out on loan to those betting on its share price to fall."" In June, the company issued its third profit warning, admitting sales were falling short of already lowered expectations amid the crisis facing the high street. At the time, Debenhams said it had accelerated its cost-cutting plans so further efficiencies could be identified in future. Debenhams last month said it would cut up to 90 staff at its fashion and home departments as part of a major cost-cutting drive. Mr Bucher, who is leading the shake-up, slashed 320 store management roles in February. To compound matters, Debenhams is also the subject of takeover talk, with speculation building that Mike Ashley is set to merge it with his newly acquired House of Fraser. Mr Ashley owns just under 30% of Debenhams, close to the threshold at which he must launch an official takeover bid."

2018-09-10,"Theresa May faces ""a tremendous amount of political crisis and rupture"" if she does not ditch her Chequers plan for leaving the EU, a former Brexit minister has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180910165942/https://news.sky.com/story/80-tory-mps-ready-to-vote-against-pms-chequers-plan-says-ex-brexit-minister-steve-baker-11494310,"Steve Baker, who quit the government in July in protest at the prime minister's proposals, is warning Downing Street that around 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote down the Chequers plan in the House of Commons. With just 200 days until Brexit, the Wycombe MP also put Mrs May on notice to ditch her Brexit blueprint before the Conservative Party conference later this month, warning of a ""catastrophic split"" in Tory ranks if she sticks to her current strategy. A cabinet minister has dismissed Mr Baker's claim that a large number of Tory MPs are prepared to act against the Chequers plan in a parliamentary vote. But, backing up his declaration that 80 Conservative MPs would side against the prime minister in a vote on her Brexit proposals, Mr Baker highlighted how a similar-sized group of Tory Brexiteers had been ready to vote against the government prior to parliament's summer break. Ahead of the Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Bill passing through the Commons in July, Tory eurosceptics added amendments to the legislation in an apparent bid to kill off key parts of the Chequers plan. The Brexiteers were ready to back the changes in a show of force to the government, before Mrs May subsequently accepted their demands and avoided a parliamentary showdown. His claim that the PM is wrapping a 'suicide vest' around the UK has been described as a 'disgusting moment' in British politics Speaking to Sky News' deputy political editor Beth Rigby on Monday, Mr Baker said: ""That's why I've said, on the record, that there are those numbers, because people shouldn't be under any illusions that the Conservative Party does face a catastrophic split if this plan is pushed through. ""And, particularly, if it's pushed through with Labour votes. ""About the only thing the Conservative Party has come together on around Chequers is that it is unacceptable, unviable and won't go through."" Prior to his spell in government, Mr Baker led the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory eurosceptics and was also a key critic of the deal David Cameron agreed with the EU prior to the 2016 Brexit vote. He denied opposition to Mrs May's Brexit deal - based on Brexiteers' fears it leaves the UK too closely aligned to EU rules and will restrict Britain's ability to sign new trade deals - should also necessitate pushing the prime minister out of Downing Street. Mr Baker said: ""I'm not here today to either threaten the prime minister or make any suggestion about who should replace her. ""What we want to do is change the policy not the person... it's not for us to start pushing for any leadership change."" He also appeared to confirm reports Tory Brexiteers have abandoned supposed plans to present their own blueprint for leaving the EU. Mr Baker added Conservative eurosceptics are merely asking the prime minister to take up the EU's offer of a free-trade agreement. Justice Secretary @DavidGauke dismisses claims 80 MPs are ready to vote down the PM's #Brexit plan pic.twitter.com/iOxx0Ut9tu He said: ""We're only asking for what the EU offered us. And what the EU offered us fits within their framework of law and the red lines which determine what a true Brexit would be. ""So, this is not about purity, this is about pragmatism, it's about fitting within the framework of EU law and delivering a Brexit which will work sustainably for the entire UK."" If the prime minister sticks with her Chequers plan beyond this month's Tory conference, Mr Baker is warning that she faces ""unchartered territory"". Noting how leading Tory Remainers such as Nick Boles are also unsatisfied with Chequers, he said: ""It's inconceivable to me the Conservative Party either in the country or in parliament is capable of uniting around Chequers."" Mrs May's official spokesman insisted on Monday that Chequers was ""the only plan on the table which will deliver on the will of the British people while avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland"". ""The prime minister is working hard to secure a deal and hopes all MPs will be able to support it,"" he added. Earlier, Justice Secretary David Gauke dismissed Mr Baker's claims 80 MPs would vote down the Chequers plan in parliament. He told Sky News: ""This is a process that's going to require compromises from all sides and I think it's really important that we go forward with the Chequers proposal because, frankly, there isn't an alternative that is put on the table by the critics of Chequers."" Labour MP Ian Murray, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a fresh EU referendum, said: ""Westminster is back in session after a long summer recess, but it hasn't taken long for all hell to break loose again."""

The move by The Football Association aims to honour the 25th anniversary of Kick It Out. The campaign aims to tackle racism and discrimination and encourage inclusive practices in football. Viewers tuning into Sky Sports' live coverage on Tuesday night will see the picture switch from colour to black and white as the teams walk on to the pitch at Leicester City's King Power Stadium. It will then switch back to colour before they line up for the national anthems. The move is to celebrate the impact Kick It Out has had in tackling racism and all forms of discrimination in the game since 1993. England players will show their support by warming up in branded T-shirts and entering the pitch alongside eight mascots nominated by the organisation. It follows the FA's recent launch of the 'In Pursuit of Progress' plan, which is part of the organisation's commitment to ensure the diversity of those leading and governing football better reflects what viewers see on the pitch. The plan will deliver initiatives primarily focused around gender and ethnicity across the FA's general workforce and leadership roles, including coaching staff across the England teams. Paul Elliott, the FA's Inclusion Advisory Board Chairman, said: ""Kick It Out have been a catalyst for the change in English football both on and off the pitch and we're delighted to celebrate their inspirational work in promoting football for all. ""Hopefully the footage will encourage the millions of viewers at home to spend at least 25 seconds thinking about the importance of diversity in this beautiful game of ours. ""We're very grateful to Sky Sports for supporting the idea since its conception and look forward to seeing Three Lions in black and white for the first time in nearly 50 years."" Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of Kick It Out, said: ""We at Kick It Out are delighted with this gesture in recognition of our work to make football a better sport for all across the last 25 years. ""We hope the footage will be a powerful reminder of how far football has come in the last 25 years to make the game a more open and diverse place - welcoming to all regardless of age, disability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation."""

Aston Martin Lagonda also confirmed its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange. Ms Hughes' arrival, alongside other heavyweight business names, signals the company's commitment to corporate governance standards befitting its premium listing. Ms Hughes, a former chair of the remuneration committee at Royal Bank of Scotland, has been a director of companies including Cable & Wireless Worldwide, Reuters Group, Wm Morrison and Vodafone. She now chairs The Gym Group and iQ Student Accommodation, a privately owned business backed by Goldman Sachs. She also sits on the board of fashion brand Superdry. The government has pushed for listed companies to diversify their boardrooms‎, although figures continue to show only sluggish growth in the number of female chairs and executive directors on blue-chip boards. The listing of James Bond's favourite car marque, with a valuation of up to £5bn, is one of the most eagerly awaited floats for years. Roughly £1bn of shares are being sold by existing investors in the company, which has been bankrupt on seven separate occasions. Ms Hughes said: ""I am impressed by the turnaround that has been achieved by the team under the leadership of chief executive Andy Palmer and excited by the group's future. ""Private shareholders have displayed successful long-term stewardship to date and are fully committed, as am I, to transitioning the group, the board and its governance arrangements to those expected of a world-class public company operating from the UK."" Aston Martin Lagonda, the maker of the Vanquish S, DB5 and Lagonda, is owned by Italian and Kuwaiti shareholders. Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, will convert its current non-voting stake of about 4.9% to ordinary shares."

The white board featured 12 slang words listed under the caption ""youth language"", with officers' translations next to them. Words on the list included ""beef-ting fam"", which the board said means ""starting an argument"", and ""peng"" which was said to be the same as ""good/attractive"".

She believes bosses and shareholders ""must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech"", and that the benefits should instead allow companies to boost wages and give workers more time with their families. Research by the TUC, which represents most UK trade unions, shows that most workers expect managers and shareholders will reap the benefits of new technology. Ms O'Grady will tell the TUC Congress in Manchester on Monday that the results of the survey show that change is needed to ensure workers remain motivated. ""In the 19th century, unions campaigned for an eight-hour day. In the 20th century, we won the right to a two-day weekend and paid holidays,"" she will say. ""So, for the 21st century, let's lift our ambition again. I believe that in this century we can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone. ""It's time to share the wealth from new technology. Not allow those at the top to grab it for themselves. We need strong unions with the right to go into every workplace - starting with Amazon's warehouses here in the UK."" Amazon - which recently became only the second company to reach a market value of $1trn (£779.3bn) - is among the firms to have been accused by the TUC of using technology to take advantage of employees. Employers are alleged to be making staff work unpredictable hours because of an ""always on"" culture, with more than 1.4 million people working on seven days of the week and 3.3 million working more than 45 hours a week. TUC polling identified stress and long hours as workers' biggest concerns after pay, although more and more jobs are feared to be at risk as robots and software improve. Experts are worried about a ""big bang"" moment, where a large number of jobs are automated in a short space of time, with transportation, manufacturing and retail and wholesale the industries thought to be most at risk."
2018-09-10,A motorbike racer who pulled his rival's brake while hurtling down a straight at more than 100mph has been sacked by his team.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180910165942/https://news.sky.com/story/motorbike-racer-romano-fenati-faces-lifetime-ban-call-after-he-grabs-rivals-brake-11494363,"Romano Fenati pulled up alongside his countryman Stefano Manzi as they accelerated out of a corner at Sunday's Moto2 race in San Marino. Video then shows him reaching across with his left hand and squeezing the front brake as the pair reached around 130mph. Manzi's machine wobbled and swerved and he briefly lost his grip on the bike with his leg. Fenati, 22, was disqualified and barred from the next two races. But on Monday his team sacked him for ""unsporting, dangerous and damaging conduct"". Marinelli Snipers said that ""his irresponsible act endangered the life of another rider and can't be apologised for in any way"". After a barrage of criticism, Fenati also said sorry and insisted he did not intend to harm Manzi. ""I apologise to the world of sport,"" he said. ""This morning, with a lucid mind, I wish it had just been a bad dream. ""I think about and think back to those moments, I made a disgraceful gesture, I was not a man!"" The incident came after Fenati and Manzi made contact earlier in the race when Manzi tried to overtake - for which he received his own penalty. British racer Cal Crutchlow, who came third in the premier class MotoGP race, said Fenati ""should never race a motorcycle again"". ""He should have walked in his garage and his team should have kicked him straight out the back. ""You can't do this to another motorcycle racer. We are risking our lives enough... To grab the brake lever on the straight he deserves to be kicked straight out."" Former American MotoGP rider Colin Edwards, who was commentating on the race, said the incident was ""unbelievable"" and that Fenati had ""put somebody's life in danger""."
2018-09-10,The UK economy grew at its fastest pace in almost a year in the three months to July thanks to stronger consumer spending during the World Cup and summer heatwave. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180910165942/https://news.sky.com/story/britains-economy-expands-at-fastest-pace-in-almost-a-year-boosted-by-world-cup-11494456,"Gross domestic product in the three months to July rose 0.6% compared to the previous three months, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The pace of growth picked up from the 0.4% experienced in the three months to June. The economy grew 0.3% in the month of July, up from 0.1% in June. Consumers who had been squeezed by rising inflation after Britain's decision to leave the European Union spent more money in bars and restaurants as England progressed to the semi-final stages of the World Cup. The services sector, which represents about 80% of the British economy, rose 0.6% and construction gained 3.3%. UK economy growing at strongest rate since last summer. Driven by a bounceback in construction and retail activity. All in the latest monthly GDP release: https://t.co/OeYcspiwcC pic.twitter.com/iSqhHbHqTV Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said: ""Services grew particularly strongly, with retail sales performing well, boosted by warm weather and the World Cup. ""The construction sector also bounced back after a weak start to the year. ""However, production fell back, with manufacturing again slipping a little while energy generation and supply fell due to reduced demand. ""The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level."" The latest data will vindicate the Bank of England's decision to raise rates in August. It had argued the sharp slowdown witnessed at the beginning of the year was a temporary blip, mostly down to a cold snap. ""Far from running out of steam UK activity has picked up after a very poor start to the year,"" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said. ""Monthly data is choppy, but this pickup shows that the UK is entering the crucial phase of the Brexit talks in better shape than seemed likely six months ago."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: ""Uncertainties and risks around Brexit are likely to make the Bank of England particularly cautious during the critical months ahead. ""We expected a pause before interest rates are raised by 0.25% in November 2019 to 1%. ""If Brexit negotiations fail, we expect rates to be cut to at least 0.25%, along with additional measures to ease any significant pressure on the banking sector."""

They were American tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea, 31. Masood then fatally stabbed a police officer - PC Keith Palmer - who had been guarding the Palace of Westminster. The inquests into the deaths opened on Monday and were dominated by tributes to those killed and distressing footage of the attack. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC told the court: ""The lives of many were torn apart by 82 seconds of high and terrible drama."" He then warned the court, which included many of the victims' relatives, that some of the footage to be shown would be ""graphic and shocking"". Gareth Patterson QC, who represents three of the victims' families, said the images showed Masood was ""deliberately targeting pedestrians"". He said it appeared people were being hit like ""human bowling pins"" and ""thrown in the air like rag dolls"". He said witnesses had described ""the noise and the repeated thuds and bangs of the impact"". The inquests heard that Masood's vehicle had mounted the pavement at 14.40.08 and within 30 seconds had hit the four pedestrians and crashed into railings at the Palace of Westminster. Detective Superintendent John Crossley said that Masood ""would have seen and heard every impact as he drove over the bridge"". Earlier in the hearing, there was a minute's silence for the victims and tributes were read by their loved ones. Mr Cochran had died at the scene after pushing his wife Melissa out of Masood's path, the inquests heard. Melissa's sister Angela Stoll read a tribute on her behalf. She described Mr Cochran as ""my inspiration, my rock star, and most of all my hero"". In the words of those who knew and loved them Amanda Rhodes, niece of Mr Rhodes, said her family had been ""devastated"" and ""incredibly angry"" about the death of a man who ""would do anything to help anyone who needed it"". Mr Rhodes had been dragged under Masood's vehicle for 33 metres and died the next day from head injuries. Mrs Frade's widow John recalled the day he first met her in 1996, her smile like the sun ""popping out from behind a cloud"", he said. She was hit from behind and thrown into a bus lane, where she was run over by a bus and died from a head injury. Some of Ms Cristea's family watched proceedings from the British Embassy in Bucharest and a video tribute was played describing her as a ""lovely, enchanting and life-loving"" woman who had a busy interior design business. Ms Cristea was thrown off Westminster Bridge, where she had been walking with her boyfriend, falling 12.5 metres into the Thames. She was found nearly nine minutes later but never regained consciousness, dying on 6 April when her life support was switched off. PC Palmer's sister Angela said he had ""died protecting strangers whilst doing his job, and he will be remembered by many for his courage and bravery"". The police officer had struggled with Masood but had stumbled and fallen. Masood had then stabbed him before being distracted by two of PC Palmer's colleagues. There were no armed officers near the scene at the time, something that will be examined during the inquests. PC Palmer had managed to escape but collapsed and, despite first aid from the public, his colleagues, paramedics and air ambulance crews, he died at the scene. Masood was confronted by an armed close protection officer, who shot him three times after he refused to drop the two knives he had been holding. The inquests continue on Tuesday. A separate inquest into the death of Masood will be held before a jury."
2018-09-10,"Reading some of today's headlines, it might be tempting to conclude that the UK was on the verge of declaring cyber war on Russia in retaliation for the nerve agent poisonings in Salisbury earlier this year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180910165942/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-has-not-declared-cyber-war-yet-but-russian-threat-is-impossible-to-deny-11492480,"That is the interpretation being given to a speech by the director of GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, in Washington last night, two days after senior Whitehall sources told The Times that Theresa May was ""preparing a cyber war"" against Russia. A closer inspection of Mr Fleming's exact comments, however, tells a different story. Describing the Russian state as ""reckless"", the GCHQ director said the threat ""will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies, able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus"". What we heard was a statement of fact, a recognition that ""offensive cyber"" now forms part of the arsenal of weapons at a state's disposal. Given that a British national has been killed on British soil, it would be astonishing if the government was not considering technological responses. Mr Fleming's speech simply confirmed that was the case. Still, seeing as it has been floated, even tentatively, it is worth asking the question: what would cyber war look like? Here, the picture becomes murky. To assess the options at the UK's disposal, it helps to think of offensive cyber on a spectrum. At one end are ""hard"" attacks on critical national infrastructure such as the Stuxnet worm used by the United States and Israel to disable Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009. At the other are ""soft"" attacks which use social media to spread misinformation and disinformation (or even just information, which is in precious short supply in Russia at present). Britain has declared that the Russian people are not its enemy, so launching a hard attack would be an extreme reaction with very risky consequences. As the WannaCry attack showed, the UK's own national infrastructure is hardly in a state to resist an aggressive retaliation. Launching a soft attack would be, if anything, more difficult. As the indictments released by special counsel Robert Mueller showed, the Russians schemed for years before hitting the United States in the lead-up to the 2016 election, employing hundreds of people at the Russian Internet Agency. What's more, even if it did get under way, this kind of campaign would be hard to justify politically in the UK, a state supposedly based around respect for the value of truth. So what's left? Naturally, UK authorities aren't saying. But the reality may be that there are not too many options - and those that remain rely as much on old-fashioned tradecraft as modern technology. But, whatever happens - and we may never hear about the result - it is becoming increasingly clear that the threat from Russia is forcing the UK and other western states to gear up for all aspects of a cyber conflict. Because, with the Russians launching ""fake news"" attacks on the US, France and the UK, as well as numerous other states, you could say that cyber war is already here. We just don't know it yet. As the GCHQ director put it in his speech last night: ""The threat from Russia is real. It's active."" That is impossible to deny."

The 74-year-old former chief superintendent appeared at Preston Crown Court via videolink and spoke only to confirm his name and enter his plea. Duckenfield was in charge of policing at the 1989 match at Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died, but only 95 charges have been brought against Duckenfield because Tony Bland died more than a year after his injuries. Sheffield Wednesday's former club secretary, Graham Mackrell, also pleaded not guilty to one charge of contravening a term or condition of the stadium's safety certificate and one health and safety offence. About 15 family members of the victims were at the court. A provisional trial date for both men has been set for 14 January. In June, a judge cleared the way for Duckenfield to go on trial when he lifted a block on legal proceedings that had been in place since 2000."

It prompted anger from survivors of last year's Manchester terror attack and condemnation from fellow Tories, with Downing Street adding to the censure of Mr Johnson on Monday. Asked about Mr Johnson's comments, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""This isn't language the prime minister would choose to use, beyond that I don't plan on giving this article further oxygen. ""The prime minister is fully focused on Brexit negotiations."" Mum Agnes Bergman reacts to the former foreign secretary's latest controversial comments Mr Johnson's old Foreign Office colleagues Sir Alan Duncan and Alistair Burt were among those to criticise his claims, with the former saying that it should mark the end of his political career. The row was followed by Mr Johnson using a further newspaper article to suggest the UK employ Donald Trump-style tax cuts in a bid to catch up with the economic growth being enjoyed in the US. He believes income tax, stamp duty and capital gains tax should all be slashed - measures likely to appeal to Conservative voters at a time he is being tipped to launch a leadership challenge. Writing in his regular Daily Telegraph column on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""Instead of canvassing tax rises, we should say that tax henceforward will not go up. That's it. No new taxes and no increase in rates. ""We do need to spend more on the NHS. We must find the extra £20bn that the chancellor has rightly promised. We do need to step up our investments in the police and schools and other vital public services. ""But I am afraid I am not convinced that the answer is immediately to turn to the hard-pressed taxpayer, when Britain is now by no means a low-tax economy compared with several other jurisdictions in Europe."" :: 80 Tory MPs 'set to vote against Brexit plan' Mr Johnson again hit out at the ongoing Brexit negotiations with the EU as part of his pitch, suggesting that it was ""very odd to be proposing tax hikes when we are about to hand over £39 billion to the EU for nothing in return"". He said that public finances were improving and that the government needed ""to show how a post-Brexit Britain will be a happy and dynamic economy"". In a reference to the policies of President Trump, Mr Johnson said: ""The US currently boasts economic growth rates far in excess of this country, at about 4.5%, and with record low unemployment. Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts make these good times to work for America's biggest corporations. ""That growth is being driven not just by the US government's decision to cut taxes and regulation, but perhaps even more by psychology: by the sense that the government wants to cut taxes, wants to liberate and energise people. ""Do we send out that signal, here in this country? I am not so sure."" The US president signed his $1.5tn (£1.1tn) tax cut programme into law last December. It was the first major overhaul of tax laws in the country in 21 years. Justice Secretary @DavidGauke dismisses claims 80 MPs are ready to vote down the PM's #Brexit plan pic.twitter.com/iOxx0Ut9tu Reacting to Mr Johnson's latest intervention over Brexit, Justice Secretary David Gauke claimed Mr Johnson had yet to set out an alternative plan to the government's Chequers proposals. He told Sky News: ""This is a time where we have to seriously address the issues in front of us, have a serious plan to deal with the situation, make sure that we deliver Brexit in the right way. ""The prime minister is a serious politician who has set out a serious plan and I for one, and I know many, many others in the parliamentary party are supporting her in delivering that."""

Police say Ms Harvey and her children were murdered last Monday, while Ms Quinn died when she arrived at the house the following morning. Each murder charge carries a potential life sentence. Western Australia state police commissioner Chris Dawson said several weapons were used, including a blunt instrument and knives, but no guns. The women were allegedly attacked in the kitchen, while the children died elsewhere in the house. Harvey is alleged to have remained at the house for several days, before driving for more than 16 hours to a police station in Pannawonica. He did not enter pleas or apply to be released on bail. A neighbour told ABC he had returned from a holiday to ""silence in the street"". ""We noticed that the house next door was pretty quiet, which was unusual,"" Richard Fairbrother, who lives next door to the family's house, said. ""We could hear and see the kids playing in the backyard quite often."" Other neighbours said the spoke of a shocked community that had been close, calm and peaceful. While violent crime with multiple victims is rare in the country, this was the second major incident in Western Australia this year. Seven people were shot and killed in the Margaret River mass shooting in May, while a mother and her two children were murdered in Ellenbrook in July. Gun crime fell sharply in Australia after strict controls were introduced following the 1996 mass shooting in Tasmania, when lone gunman Martin Bryant killed 35 people."

Hurricane Florence is around 500m north of the Leeward Islands, which includes four Commonwealth nations - Saint Kitts, Nevis, Barbuda and Antigua. Henry McMaster, governor of South Carolina, warned the US should be braced for the hurricane to hit. ""Pretend, assume, presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina and is going to go way inshore,"" he said.

The six-year-old had been spending the summer holidays with family friends in Brussels, but was prevented from boarding a plane back to the UK two weeks ago. Belgian officials had reportedly said that his passport had been revoked by the Home Office, leaving the youngster unable to return home. On Monday, however, Mohamed was outside the British Embassy in Brussels clutching the travel documents that would allow him to return to his mother in the UK. When asked by a reporter where he was going, his reply was: ""Home."" When Mohamed was denied passage to the UK, the Home Office had said: ""A letter was sent to Mohamed's mother in March advising her that her son's passport had been revoked. ""We understand that, despite this, Mohamed was taken out of the UK in July and last Sunday was unable to re-enter as he did not hold a valid passport. ""We have now contacted Mohamed's mother to inform her that her son is being issued with emergency travel documents to allow him to travel to the UK."" The Independent previously reported that Mohamed's claim to British citizenship had been in doubt because neither Ms Keita - who is originally from Guinea - or her husband were settled in Britain when he was born. Since 1983, children born in the UK are only eligible for British citizenship if at least one of their parents is a British citizen or is living in the UK with permission to remain permanently. Because of her nationality, Ms Keita could not travel to Belgium to be with Mohamed because it would have required another visa."

The FBI has charged Bennett, 41, with second degree murder and for the first time prosecutors have revealed details of what they believe to be his motive. Ms Hellmann's body has never been found but if she is presumed dead, Bennett would inherit her money and her apartment in Delray Beach, Florida. This week, prosecutor Benjamin Greenberg said that the couple were ""consistently"" arguing ""with potentially one of the arguments ultimately resulting in the murder of Hellmann"". Mr Greenberg asked a judge in Florida to admit into evidence conversations Ms Hellmann, 41, had with others, during which she is said to have argued about their finances, raising their daughter, and a possible move to Australia. He added: ""Hellmann's murder would remove the marital strife from the defendant's life, allow the defendant to live his life as he pleased, and would enable him to inherit money from Hellmann's estate, all of which provide strong circumstantial proof that the defendant had a strong motive to murder Hellmann."" Bennett had been smuggling rare English and Canadian coins stolen from his former employer two years earlier when he was picked up from the stricken catamaran by rescuers off the Cuban coast. He was alone and on a life raft. Prosecutors say Ms Hellmann, who had a daughter with Bennett, may have found out about the coins, possibly leading to an ""intense argument"" resulting in her death, Mr Greenberg wrote in the court documents. Bennett, who is British-Australian, is already serving a seven-month jail term for transporting the coins, worth £29,450. He will go on trial for the second degree murder charge in December."

In the Giro d'Italia, Yates held the top spot in the general classification earlier this year before seemingly running out of steam in the race which Froome eventually won. Yates has previously competed for the British national team, winning a gold in the Track World Championships in 2013 and third overall in the Tour of Britain in the same year it was won by Sir Bradley Wiggins."

""Check."" It comes a month after his spokeswoman confirmed that the 49-year-old was in hospital recovering from surgery, saying ""he is grateful for the concern and asks for continued privacy as he heals"". Three months in a hospital bed.  Check. A punctured bowel - or gastrointestinal perforation - can occur along any point in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, small intestine and large intestine. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain. The Canadian-American actor found fame in the 1990s when he was one of the six lead characters in Friends. Alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer, he was one of the most recognisable faces on TV. Friends ended in 2004, but fans rejoiced when all 10 series were brought to Netflix in January this year. Perry previously said he would not want to take part in a Friends reunion because it would ""ruin"" the sitcom's ending. He also appeared in the films The Whole Nine Yards and Fools Rush In. Perry told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2017 that he fought the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in fifth grade. He recalled: ""My friend Chris Muray, who was in the fifth grade in Canada, reminded me that we actually beat up Justin Trudeau. ""We both beat him up."" The Canadian leader jokingly replied on Twitter: ""I've been giving it some thought, and you know what, who hasn't wanted to punch Chandler? ""How about a rematch?"""

The Restricted Growth Association described it as a ""freak show"" that was ""primarily about encouraging audiences to laugh at people with dwarfism and the spectacle of violence against dwarf bodies as entertainment for average height people"". One of the venues, Leicester's Morningside Arena, tweeted at the time: ""We pride ourselves in being an inclusive venue, that welcomes performers and guests from all backgrounds, with or without disabilities, and are keen that any athlete or performer has an equal opportunity to perform and earn a living.

The Corn Exchange in Devizes said: ""Since taking the booking, it has become clear many members of the dwarf community are subjected to higher than average levels of abuse and personal attack. ""Given the nature of the event, it is difficult to see how it would not suggest a level of credibility to the behaviour which is shown towards members of the dwarf community and this is not something we as a venue can be associated with, however unintended."" The third venue was the Ferndown Leisure Centre in Dorset. On Facebook, Dwarfanators responded: ""Dwarfanators, a pro show with people with dwarfism, is being discriminated against because of our size. ""The RGA a lobbyist group from the England is trying to get our shows cancelled because they feel people with dwarfism cannot compete in a pro wrestling sport. ""They have called us despicable, side show, freak show, Victorian, and grotesque show."" On Saturday a report said that event organiser Center Stage Entertainment was suing the venues alleging discrimination. The company was also said to be taking action against the RGA, alleging they made false claims. Three letters of complaint have been written to the venues and the RGA giving them the chance to respond and come to an agreement out of court, according to the BBC. Shows are still due to go ahead in Cardiff, Torquay, Swansea and Liverpool in October."

The former prime minister, who won three elections for Labour, said his comments applied to both Labour and the Conservatives in a conference season that will be ""a watershed in British politics"" because of Brexit. Rumours that Labour MPs unhappy with current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would try to leave to form their own party surfaced over the summer. But Mr Blair wrote in The Times: ""I am not advocating a new party, organising one, or wanting to vote for one. ""In the British system such an endeavour may be impossible. Tony Blair was never in the right party and there will never be a return to his politics in @UKLabour ""But the serious figures in both main parties need to demand of their leadership: enough, you do not have indefinite licence to go towards the extremes or unlimited time to return to reason."" Mr Blair was an advocate of what was sometimes called the ""third way"", a type of political philosophy that broke from the more socialist policies of 1960s and 1970s Labour governments and yet was more state-oriented than the free-market tendencies of 1980s Conservative governments. A week ago, Mr Blair said that under Mr Corbyn, Labour was now a ""different party"" than it had been in the past, but he hoped it was not ""lost"". It prompted Jon Lansman, founder of the Corbynite Momentum movement, to say Labour would ""never"" again choose the kind of policies advocated by the ex-PM and said he ""was never in the right party"" anyway. :: Labour raise record £56m in a year - almost £10m more than Tories But Mr Blair countered in Saturday's comment piece: ""Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin, in the 1945 Labour government, set up NATO, allied themselves to the USA, initiated the British nuclear deterrent and shut the door on the Marxist left. ""Successive Labour leaders kept the door firmly shut. Under Jeremy Corbyn the door has been opened, and with a welcome mat. ""In have poured these outcasts, suddenly in charge of a potential party of government. ""Their foreign policy is motivated by visceral anti-Western sentiment and their domestic policy is a rehash of old-style leftism that shows little understanding of the modern world."" Much of the disquiet in the Labour movement over the summer has stemmed from an ongoing row over antisemitism. Mr Blair used his comment piece to attack the local party's no-confidence vote in Enfield MP Joan Ryan ""because of her role with Labour Friends of Israel"". ""If you think the party is institutionally racist, then why don't you leave?"" - @RidgeOnSunday questions Labour MP @ChukaUmunna about his future in the party #Ridge pic.twitter.com/CekgVIBmA7 It came as Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable urged disillusioned Labour and Tory supporters to jump ship to his party. He said: ""I want to make an open pitch to the people of this country who are fed up with the extremes of the current Conservative and Labour parties. ""Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together."" Meanwhile, on Friday, Unite union leader Len McCluskey told the BBC that Labour could attract more members if Tony Blair left the party."

The 35-year-old suspect, an intel supervisor for the Border Patrol, was found hiding in a car park in Laredo, Texas, at around 2am after he initially fled police on Saturday. He is alleged to have carried out the killings from 3 September. He has been charged with four counts of murder as well as aggravated assault and unlawful restraint. Webb County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said: ""We do consider this to be a serial killer."" Mr Alaniz said that after the suspect picked up the fifth woman she quickly realised that she was in danger. ""When she tried to escape from him at a gas station that's when she ran into a (state) trooper,"" Mr Alaniz said. Mr Alaniz said investigators are still trying to determine a motive for the killings, and that they think Ortiz acted alone. He said two of the victims were US citizens but the nationalities of the other two were not yet known. All of them were working as prostitutes and one was a transgender woman, he said. The bodies of two them were discovered earlier this month along Interstate 35 in rural northwest Webb County, according to reports. The third and fourth were found in the same area this weekend. Andrew Meehan, a senior US Customs and Border Protection official, said in a statement that the agency was co-operating fully with investigators. His statement added: ""Our sincerest condolences go out to the victims' family and friends. Ortiz had worked at the Border Patrol for 10 years."

Witnesses say he was boogie-boarding in the sea off Newcomb Hollow Beach when the attack happened at about 12pm local time (5pm in the UK) on Saturday. Seashore rangers and police performed CPR on the man after he was pulled from the water, the Cape Cod Times reported. An off-duty lifeguard told the newspaper the victim had injuries to his lower body and no pulse as rescuers tried to save him. Witness Joe Booth saw ""a giant eruption of water 15ft wide"". He told the Cape Cod Times: ""I saw a tail and a lot of thrashing. You could tell by the body language of the guys in the water something wasn't right."" Mr Booth said the attack victim and his friend were boogie-boarding when the attack happened. He said the man kicked at something behind him, and that there was flicker of a tail from the water. ""I was that guy on the beach screaming, 'Shark, shark!'"" said Mr Booth. ""It was like right out of that movie Jaws. This has turned into Amity Island real quick out here."" Police said the name of the victim is being withheld until his family has been informed. Newcomb Hollow Beach has been closed to swimmers. ""Today is just keeping everyone out of water,"" said Lt Hurley. ""There'll be a determination later about what the town wants to do with the beaches going forward."" A 61-year-old man from New York was seriously injured just five miles away last month, after punching a shark in the gills off Long Nook Beach near the town of Truro."

With time running out to secure a deal, Mr Gove said the onus was on the EU to compromise ""because we've shown flexibility"". ""A future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""But the Chequers approach is the right one for now because we have got to make sure that we respect that vote and take advantage of the opportunities of being outside the European Union."" Mrs May's Chequers plan has been widely criticised by both Conservative Remainers and Brexiteers, with Jacob Rees-Mogg describing it as ""absolute rubbish"" and former education secretary Justine Greening saying it was less popular than the poll tax. Under Chequers, Britain would continue to observe EU rules on goods, but decide most of its own rules around services and immigration. According to a Sky News poll, most Britons disapprove of it, while around 80 Tory MPs may be prepared to vote it down in the House of Commons. Mr Gove said the plan was not something he was entirely comfortable with but he had ""compromised"". ""I've been quite clear that some of the things that I argued for in the referendum passionately, as a result of Chequers I have to qualify one or two of my views,"" he said. ""I have to acknowledge the parliamentary arithmetic. ""I believe the critical thing is making sure we leave in good order with a deal which safeguards the referendum mandate."" Asked about the call for a second Brexit referendum from London mayor Sadiq Khan, Mr Gove said the suggestion was ""interesting and troubling"". Mr Khan's comments came only a day after shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry suggested Labour was likely to vote against any Brexit deal.  Responding to Mr Khan's suggestion, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis claimed Labour was ""only interested in frustrating"" Brexit. Labour frontbencher Barry Gardiner dismissed Mr Khan's suggestion, telling Sky News that holding another referendum ""would be to throw this government a lifeline"". Theresa May has described a second referendum as a ""great betrayal"" of democracy, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said it is not something his party is ""calling for""."

His firm gave more than £16,000 to the Conservatives last year under Mrs May's leadership, but in March this year they handed £25,000 to the Lib Dems as Mr Mullins hailed the party's anti-Brexit stance. Appearing at the Lib Dems' conference in Brighton on Sunday, Mr Mullins was scathing of the prime minister's handling of Britain's exit from the EU. ""Unfortunately we couldn't have a worse person trying to negotiate the future of our country,"" he told Sky News. ""It's probably one of the biggest political statements we're going to make, certainly in the last 40 years. ""We've got her down as running the country, I wouldn't trust her to run a bath."" Mr Mullins defected from supporting the Tories to backing the Lib Dems because they're ""the only political party that are prepared to stand up and say 'we're not happy with the way it's going'"" over Brexit, he explained. The businessman insisted he is ""undoubtedly"" making a long-term commitment to the Lib Dems, even though current leader Sir Vince Cable has said it is ""uncertain"" whether he will still be in charge by the end of next year as he plans his departure. Mr Mullins said: ""We've put our money where our mouth is and I stopped donating to the Conservatives. ""I've put money into this and I shall continue to support this party and, even when we have a new leader come on board, I'm going to continue to support it."" Before he goes, Sir Vince wants to alter Lib Dem rules to allow non-MPs to stand in future leadership elections. It had been speculated this would allow campaigners such as Gina Miller the opportunity to run for the party's leadership, although she has ruled out a bid. But Mr Mullins revealed he will be talking to the businesswoman - who rose to prominence by leading a legal challenge against the government's ability to trigger Article 50 without a vote in parliament - over his belief her leadership would put the Lib Dems ""in a serious title race for Number 10"". Mr Mullins also touted Innocent Drinks co-founder Richard Reed and current Lib Dem deputy Jo Swinson as future party leaders. As well as his confidence that the Lib Dems can help stop Brexit, Mr Mullins also claimed the Conservatives are now a different party to the one he first began supporting. ""They're just not interested in business people, they're not interested in apprenticeships,"" he said. ""They've been so occupied with Brexit and she [Mrs May] has come up with this stupid thing about 'no deal is better than a bad deal'. ""Well, anybody in business knows, any deal is better than no deal."" Mr Mullins also attacked Labour as ""clueless"" on both business and Brexit."

Ms McDonald accused Boris Johnson in particular of being ""deliberately provocative"" and ""grossly irresponsible"" about the peace process. She said: ""I think their statements make very clear their utter indifference to Ireland, their entire lack of appreciation of what happened on this island and their role in it, their utter ignorance in terms of the peace process. ""Their utterances, certainly in the case of Mr Johnson, have been provocative, one has to imagine deliberately provocative. ""Any notion that the Good Friday Agreement has served its purpose and should be put through the political shredder is grossly irresponsible,"" she added. Ms McDonald, who succeeded Gerry Adams as Sinn Fein president six months ago, believes Brexit, among other issues, will lead to a referendum on Irish unity. She said: ""Brexit, the changing demographic, the fact that the in-built permanent Unionist majority upon which partition was based and the northern state was founded is now gone. ""And above all, for our purposes, there is now a surge right across Ireland for social change, for modernity, for progress. ""That's a very positive sentiment that's not orange or green exclusively but that actually affords us a platform for a very necessary debate as to what Ireland looks like now and where we're going over the next five to 10 years,"" she added. Sinn Fein believes some Tories are deliberately ignoring the potential implications of a hard border. But Ms McDonald rejects any suggestion that her party is exaggerating the challenges to push their own unity agenda. She said: ""Brexit is not of our making. We didn't want Brexit. In fact, the people in the north of Ireland voted against Brexit. They voted to remain. ""Brexit is a very peculiarly British and English construct that we are now to have, according to the Tories, foisted upon us. ""They seem to think that they can say 'we are leaving' and then unilaterally coerce the north of Ireland out of the European Union and rupture and sunder the economy and social life on this island and they have absolutely no right to do that,"" she added."
2018-09-16,"Passports and driving licences no longer valid in Europe, mobile phone roaming charges legal again, satellite access restricted, impacts on seafaring, energy, data, and even family law.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180916213817/https://news.sky.com/story/no-deal-brexit-warnings-weigh-heavily-on-cabinet-11497077,"The implications of the latest slew of ""no-deal"" Brexit notices are wide-ranging and profound at home, work and on holiday. The job of the cabinet this morning was to sign off the plans to make a no-deal scenario ""not the end of the world"", as the PM has suggested. But then the governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, smuggled in and out of cabinet by the back door, gave a presentation on the effects of a no-deal Brexit on the economy. Although cabinet sources are adamant that Mr Carney was giving scenarios rather than predictions, the ""worst case"" no-deal scenario he sketched out meant a recession, a renewed slide in sterling and house prices falling by about a third over three years. What a moment in history that presentation would have been. Britain's foremost economic official briefing the cabinet that this brutal economic fall could be the result not of a financial crisis elsewhere, or of some other natural or manmade calamity, but a feasible result of the stated policy path of the government itself. The Brexit process is often surreal and always unprecedented, but that is quite the moment. My understanding is that this warning weighed heavily on those present. Even by the Project Fear sceptics in cabinet, Mr Carney was politely listened to. Privately, some suggested that this ""worst case scenario not a prediction"" was a ""little high"". But there can be little doubt it united this cabinet behind Chequers, even as it might divide further this leadership from some of their backbenchers. And this was a meeting at which some of those backbenchers had hoped for, and anticipated, cabinet resignations. Of course, most cabinet ministers are are well aware of the stakes, having gone through the arduous technical process of preparing the no-deal notices. Whereas macroeconomic projections have somewhat lost the lustre, the real practical implications of radical upheavals to systems underpinning transport, energy, trade and communications built up within European Union law are difficult to dismiss as Project Fear. It is just reality that a decision to go for no-deal is a decision to invalidate EU driving licences, only have third country access at EU nation's passport control, make legal data roaming charges, invalidate the automatic recognition of the standards of UK assembled cars in its biggest market, strip UK companies of access to certain EU satellite information systems and so on and so on. For many millions of voters, these inconveniences do not affect them, they do not believe them, and even if they did, would be insufficient to outweigh the freedom of departure from the EU. But not all who voted Leave voted for these consequences. If that wasn't enough, Emmanuel Macron's Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau sounded pretty uncompromising on the way in to meet the Brexit secretary when she said everyone would suffer, but the UK would suffer the most if there was no deal. Later, going much further into the no-deal impacts predicted by France - she suggested that not only would planes be grounded but also the Eurostar could stop functioning. This possibility was also mentioned at a no-deal cabinet meeting. It's not what they want, they say it's unlikely, but it is government policy to accept no-deal and all its consequences as a possible outcome in six months time. Business leaders say the notices show the cold reality of no-deal hitting the economy ""like a sledgehammer"", but the PM is reluctant herself to make this case in this way - she needs things to be just concerning enough for her backbenchers and the public to reject no-deal but neither her handling of it nor Brexit itself. Perhaps it might just be the moment when a public sceptical of so-called Project Fear began to acknowledge that the consequences of no-deal at least will be seen far and wide. Meanwhile in Brussels the originally intended audience for the no-deal plans - Juncker, Barnier and Tusk - are preparing the Salzburg summit that will take place in a week. The point of this all was to strengthen the PM's hand in negotiations. And yet as the talk and the preparations intensify, the chances of this outcome desired by none of the negotiators, seems to rise."

Wiltshire Police said the pair have been assessed at Salisbury District Hospital following concerns they had been ""exposed to an unknown substance"". ""We can now confirm that there is nothing to suggest that novichok is the substance,"" a police spokeswoman said. ""The major incident status has now been stood down. At this stage it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed and enquiries remain ongoing."" One of the two people who fell ill is Russian, Sky sources say. The restaurant, on the High Street in Salisbury, is a short walk from Queen Elizabeth Gardens, which was closed off after Dawn Sturgess was fatally poisoned by novichok at the end of June. The same nerve agent was used to target former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were found unresponsive on a bench in Salisbury after eating at a Zizzi restaurant about 0.2 miles from Prezzo. Shortly after police were called to Prezzo on Sunday evening, witnesses reported seeing police ""covering someone up"" with a blanket, the Salisbury Journal reported. A witness at a nearby Cafe Rouge restaurant said they saw police bagging something up in the street. Others said they had been locked in a nearby pub as a hazardous area response team and four ambulances were sent to Prezzo. Witness Sam Proudfoot, 16, said he saw a man ""in a full white body suit with a mask to his mouth going in and out of the back of the ambulance and the restaurant"". He told Sky News that everyone inside the restaurant had their details taken, and were told to stay within the cordoned area. Half a dozen police cars, an ambulance, two incident response units and two fire engines were at the scene, he added. Wiltshire Police said it received a call from the ambulance service at about 6.45pm following reports that a man and a woman had fallen ill. ""Both were taken to Salisbury District Hospital and were clinically assessed,"" a force spokeswoman said. ""We can now confirm that there is nothing to suggest that Novichok is the substance. Both people remain in hospital under observation."" A cordon remains in place at the Prezzo restaurant, the spokeswoman added."

The shadow international trade secretary told Sky News that holding another referendum ""would be to throw this government a lifeline"". He added that if the government could not get its Brexit deal through parliament, a general election should be held instead. First Minister of Wales Carywn Jones also admitted to Sky News there ""might be a time"" when he would call for a national vote on the EU exit plan - if a general election is called and it produces another hung parliament. The idea has been categorically ruled out by Downing Street, with Theresa May calling it a ""great betrayal"" of democracy. Jeremy Corbyn has also said it is not something Labour is ""calling for"" at the moment, and that the ""ship has sailed"" on remaining in the EU. But calls have been mounting over the last few months from both Labour and Conservative backbenchers."

A decade on from the 2008 financial crisis, which preceded the 2010-15 coalition government, Sir Vince attacked a lack of capital spending in the years since the global economic meltdown. Speaking to Sky News' political editor Faisal Islam during the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, Sir Vince was asked whether a link between austerity and Brexit - as highlighted by some academics - caused him regret. He replied: ""Yes it does. One of the aspects of austerity that did most harm was the massive cutback in public investment. ""I know that it's the emotive stuff around social security spending that gets people angry. ""But the thing that did harm was the big cutbacks in investment and that's what has caused many of these northern communities to continue to decay."" Sir Vince also criticised Whitehall controls on investment spending after being told by an audience member that voters opted to leave the EU because they were from ""decimated"" parts of the north of England. He said: ""There are parts of the north of England that are severely blighted. ""I come from the north of England and in my period of exile [when not an MP between 2015 to 2017] I used to go regularly to Blackpool for dancing competitions. ""And Blackpool in November is not a cheery place. You see some of the economic damage. But there are parts of the north of England which are doing well. It isn't a North-South issue. ""Let's remember that Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle voted to Remain. Many of the successful towns, often university towns, voted to Remain. ""And there are some northern towns which are showing real signs of renaissance in industrial terms, even though they voted to Leave."" Revealing that he will be speaking about how to regenerate areas of the country in his keynote conference speech on Tuesday, Sir Vince added: ""We've got this ridiculous policy, which I and some of my colleagues in the coalition spent five years fighting, where the Treasury will not allow capital investment beyond a certain, very limited, level."" Sir Vince wants voters to be given another referendum on whether to remain in the EU and used the event to give a firm commitment his party will vote against the prime minister's hoped-for Brexit plan in the House of Commons. He also warned another ""serious"" financial crisis could occur in the next 18 months. Earlier, Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson also offered a mea culpa over the party's time in coalition with the Tories. In her conference speech, Ms Swinson - who was a junior minister in the coalition government - told Lib Dem members: ""Negotiating with the Conservatives meant compromise and some of those compromises sucked. We should have done more."" She added: ""We were right to cut the deficit, but those who were already struggling paid too high a price. ""Let me be blunt, if we are to claim the successes of our time in government we need to own the failures of it too. We lost too many arguments. ""When they fought dirty, we were too nice. And austerity left behind people who liberals are in politics to protect."" Ms Swinson, who has hinted at a future bid to replace Sir Vince as Lib Dem leader, also described Brexit as ""a symptom, not a cause"" of a ""broken"" social contract."

President Donald Trump has issued a disaster declaration amid fears North Carolina will experience its most destructive bout of flooding in history. Some towns have endured more than two feet of rain and forecasters say that more than three feet of water could bring major flooding further inland in the coming days. A mother and her baby are among those who have been killed by Florence, which was initially categorised as a hurricane with 120mph winds. By Saturday morning the winds weakened to 50mph but the storm's slow speed means that communities in North Carolina are receiving a prolonged battering by torrential rain. The National Hurricane Center said as much as 40in (102cm) was expected on the southeastern coast of North Carolina and part of northeastern South Carolina. Southwestern Virginia is also expecting up to 10in (25cm). North Carolina's governor Roy Cooper said: ""I cannot overstate it: Floodwaters are rising, and if you aren't watching for them, you are risking your life."" He added: ""Know that water is rising fast everywhere, even in places that don't typically flood. ""This system is unloading an epic amount of rainfall: in some places, measured in feet, not inches."" Florence buckled buildings, deluged entire communities and knocked out power to more than 900,000 homes and businesses in its initial coastal onslaught. As of 5pm local time, Florence was centred about 60 miles west of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, as of 5pm (10pm BST) local time It was inching west at 2mph and its winds were down to 45mph. With half of the storm still out over the Atlantic, Florence continued to collect warm ocean water and dump it on land. The storm has been shaping up to be a two-part disaster, with the second, delayed stage triggered by rainwater working its way into rivers and streams. :: Amanda Walker in Wilmington - Florence's landfall like being under a power shower The flash-flooding could devastate communities and endanger dams, roads and bridges. Authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of up to 7,500 people living within a mile of a stretch of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, about 100 miles from the coast. The evacuation zone included part of the city of Fayetteville, population 200,000. Officials in nearby Harnett County urged residents of about 1,100 homes to clear out because the Lower Little River was rising towards record levels. One of the towns worst affected is New Bern, which sits between the Neuse and Trent rivers in North Carolina. The 18th century town, with a population of 30,000, has been badly flooded, with 4,200 homes damaged. More than 100 people were rescued and up to 75 more were awaiting rescue on Saturday morning, according to a town official. US correspondent Cordelia Lynch, who is in New Bern, said: ""This community in the weeks and months to come is up against a great deal of flooding. ""The sad thing is that this is a low income area - a lot of people just don't have insurance but they are too attached to their homes and families to leave."" Florence's death toll could rise as a number of deaths are being investigated to see if they were caused by the storm. A mother and baby were killed after a large tree fell on their home in Wilmington, while in Pender County a woman died of a heart attack after storm debris prevented paramedics from reaching her. In Lenoir County a 78-year-old man was electrocuted while trying to connect extension cords and another man died after being blown away by high winds while checking on his dogs. South Carolina recorded its first death from the storm, with officials saying a 61-year-old woman was killed when her car hit a tree that had fallen across a highway. Three died in one inland county, Duplin, because of water on roads and flash floods, the sheriff's office said. A husband and wife died in a house fire linked to the storm, officials said, and an 81-year-old man died after falling and hitting his head while packing to evacuate. Nearly 814,000 homes in North Carolina and 170,000 in South Carolina are without power. Across the two states there are some 30,000 people staying in emergency shelters."

Turkey is hostile to the YPG because of its links with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. Robinson, who faces more than seven years in jail, told Sky News he worked as a combat medic in Syria and ""didn't do any operations with the YPG"". ""I was only in Syria for a month,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I was only a combat medic. I helped treat injured civilians who'd been caught up in the fighting. ""'The rest of the time I was with the Peshmerga who are an internationally recognised army. ""I don't think I deserve to spend seven and a half years in prison for a crime I haven't committed. ""All I ever wanted to do was help people."" Robinson said he was arrested because someone had been stalking him. He said: ""A person that I didn't know, that has never met me, that was stalking me on Facebook and following me, sent an email to the police, making up all kinds of things, telling them that I was a terrorist, and all these sorts of things."" Robinson's interactions with the British government have been disappointing, he said. The Foreign Office ""doesn't seem very interested in my case"", he said, as he pleaded with the UK to ""help me - do something"". He added: ""When we've pushed the Foreign Office, they've basically said they haven't had any discussions."" At the beginning of Robinson's ""really hard ordeal"" he spent four months in solitary confinement in a ""high security prison"". ""'I was kept in solitary confinement 23 hours a day,"" he said. ""I was only allowed out for one hour a day to walk around in a small circle. ""I didn't really have any human interaction - I wasn't allowed to speak to or see my fiancee for the entire four months. ""I didn't even get to speak to my family for the first two-and-a-half months. And then it was only a 10-minute phone call once every two weeks."" Robinson said the case has left him ""emotionally, mentally and physically drained"" and that his mother has ""recently had a psychotic breakdown"". While he is being held on bail, the former British soldier cannot leave Turkey or get a visa - meaning he cannot work. However, he hopes the diplomatic ties between Britain and Turkey can help him. ""The relationship between Turkey and the UK is the best it's been for a long time,"" he said, ""and I really think they could use that influence to help me get out of this situation. ""I served my government. I served my queen and country. I don't think I deserve to be in this situation, and I think I deserve for my country to give me the help that I need."""

She said: ""No. ""I value my relationship and mental health too much for it. ""I will not be a candidate."" Ms Davidson added: ""On a human level, the idea that I would have a child in Edinburgh and then immediately go down to London four days a week and leave it up here is offensive, actually offensive to me."" In extracts from Ms Davidson's memoirs, printed in the newspaper, she tells how the suicide of a boy from her home village when she was 17 sent her into a ""tailspin"". She added: ""I started hurting myself: punching walls, cutting my stomach and arms with blades or broken glass, drinking far, far too much and becoming belligerent and angry, pushing people away."" She was diagnosed with clinical depression a year later but the medication gave her ""desperate, dark, terrible dreams"". Ms Davidson writes that she ""started have suicidal thoughts"". She said she is ""still frightened"" of going back to the ""psychological place I once inhabited"". The politician added that she turns to ""structure, exercise, forward momentum, measurable outcomes"" when she is feeling anxious. Ms Davidson and her partner Jen Wilson are expecting their first child in late autumn, after she found out in March that an IVF procedure had been successful.

Firefighters used ladders to rescue the 21 passengers trapped on the ride and paramedics were present to help them afterwards. One witness told the Liverpool Echo that the ride was shaking before it broke down, adding that they noticed ""a very large object fly off"" the attraction. Emergency services had to construct a tower from scaffolding to rescue the stranded passengers, while paramedics reportedly gave a child on board the ride an asthma nebulizer. Her mother told the Echo: ""I've never been more frightened as a parent as I am now. ""Sat here on my own whilst my child is up in the air and there's not a thing I can do.

Thomas, who went on to win the Channel 5 show, was accused of punching her in an episode on 30 August. Many viewers defended the Coronation Street actor as play-fighting and criticised Pallett for trivialising domestic abuse. The former Emmerdale actress, who slept in a spare bedroom after claiming she was uncomfortable sleeping in the same room as Thomas, decided to leave the house on 1 September. Thomas was later given a formal warning. In an interview with host Emma Willis two days later, Pallett apologised to Thomas for making a ""horrible mistake"" before saying she was the ""most hated girl in Britain"". Viewers voiced offence and concern at Pallett's claims and the way the situation was handled by the show. Ofcom will examine whether ""appropriate information"" was shown by Channel 5 which may have assisted ""in avoiding or minimising offence"" to viewers. An Ofcom spokeswoman said: ""We are investigating whether this programme broke our rules on offensive content."" The watchdog is also investigating the Loose Women panel's treatment of Kim Woodburn, after receiving 7,900 viewer complaints. The former How Clean Is Your House? presenter clashed with Coleen Nolan and later walked off the set in tears. Woodburn was invited on the panel show by ITV bosses for a ""reconciliation"" with Nolan after the women previously argued on an earlier series of Celebrity Big Brother. Viewers accused Nolan and other members of the panel, which included Linda Nolan, Janet Street-Porter and Linda Robson, of ""ganging up"" on Woodburn. A statement posted on Nolan's Twitter account on 6 September said she was taking a break after being subjected to a ""horrifying torrent of online abuse"". It also said the singer's words and actions had been misrepresented. An announcement from Coleen. (Tour Team x) pic.twitter.com/wi50RdMuws The news follows today's Ofcom ruling that ITV's Good Morning Britain (GMB) breached its broadcasting code when presenter Piers Morgan refused to read a council's response to a segment about a homeless SAS veteran, saying he couldn't ""be bothered"". Morgan was interviewing ex-soldier Bob Curry on 22 January about a petition calling on Hertfordshire County Council to give him social housing. Morgan, who called Curry ""a national hero"", refused to read the council's response, and told it to ""stick your statements and get action and get him a council home today"". The council said it was treated unfairly because its views were not represented. ITV argued it had contacted the council multiple times and been sent a generic statement, which it published online. Ofcom upheld the council's claim, stating that ""Mr Morgan's decision to dismiss the Council's statement outright and not read it, or to reflect in summary what it said in response, meant that at no point in this programme was the council's view reflected"". ""As a consequence, we considered that viewers were not provided with an opportunity to understand the council's position and that this had the clear potential to materially and adversely affect viewers' opinions of the council in a way that was unfair."" In a tweet, Morgan called the ruling ""ridiculous"", adding: ""Why should I read out bull**** self-serving statements from a council that failed to house a homeless SAS hero until we bullied them into doing it?"""

A new report, published by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) on Monday, attacked the prime minister's intent to sign up to a ""common rulebook"" with the EU after Brexit. Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debates Commission to oversee and organise election debates The 148-page document claims the Chequers plan would torpedo the government's ambition to sign a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US by scuppering Britain's hopes of a independent trade policy outside the EU. It calls for the government to scrap its promise not to begin trade talks with non-EU countries until a Brexit deal is agreed, with the IEA's analysis suggesting the start of negotiations with third countries would ""put pressure"" on Brussels. The launch of the IEA report was attended by former Brexit secretary David Davis, ex-Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, influential Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, and former Labour MP Gisela Stuart. Speaking at the IEA event in central London, Mr Davis claimed the prime minister is currently ""in a cul-de-sac"" over Brexit negotiations, after the EU rejected her Chequers plan at a summit in Salzburg, Austria, last week. The Chequers plan would see the UK retain common European rules for goods, but not for services. Revealing he agrees with ""90-odd per cent"" of the IEA plan, Mr Davis - who quit his Brexit role over Chequers - added he would still be a cabinet minister if the proposals were government policy. He also disclosed one of his last instructions to his former civil servants was to ""draft the legal text for a free trade plus arrangement"". Mr Davis explained: ""If you've got that to work from, the time-spinning, time-wasting activities of the European Commission - which we've seen lots of in the last two years - fail in the face of the need of the EU27 to have a deal and be able to recognise a deal that's in their interest."" Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Conservative MPs, agreed there is still time for the PM to change tack and back the IEA proposal, as he noted the Greek bailout was agreed with the EU ""over a weekend"". He praised the plan for ""looking at Britain's position not just in the European context but globally"", as he attacked dialogue around Brexit as being too focused on ""managing decline"". Noting how EU officials have already offered the UK ""the best trade deal they have done"", Mr Rees-Mogg backed a Brexit deal built upon the bloc's trade agreement with Canada. He said: ""If you want to call it 'Canada plus' or 'super Canada' or 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Canada', that is what is being aimed at and being offered."" Mr Rees-Mogg also claimed the IEA report ""solves"" the prime minister's Brexit troubles, adding: ""With her wisdom and insight, I think she will be thinking very carefully about adopting it."" Despite its criticisms of the Chequers plan, the IEA report states the government should keep ""all the agreed"" elements of the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU, such as a deal on citizens' rights, a transition period, and the UK's £39bn divorce bill. It adds the Irish border issue can be solved with ""necessary investment and co-operation mechanisms to enable formalities on trade… to be overseen away from the border"". Speaking at the launch, the report's co-author Shanker Singham, IEA director of international trade and competition, said: ""If we continue on the present course, Brexit will be a small damage limitation exercise which will weaken the UK, and be largely unnoticed by the rest of the world. ""However, if the UK were to adopt a bolder, more ambitious approach - one that sees us as a major player in global trade, one which takes our departure from the EU seriously but sees it as part of a much broader picture of taking a leading role on the world stage - then we can look forward to a brighter, more prosperous, free trading future for both the UK and the wider world."" He also denied the IEA were suggesting ""massive deregulation"" for the UK after Brexit, but instead chasing ""better regulation"". Downing Street rejected a Brexit deal based on the EU's agreement with Canada, with the prime minister's spokesman saying it would fail to deliver solutions for Northern Ireland. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson, who supports the People's Vote campaign for a fresh EU referendum, said the IEA report had ""laid bare"" the ""real agenda of the Brextremists"". ""They want to use Brexit as an excuse to slash and burn workers' rights, environmental protections and food safety standards,"" she said. ""They want to turn Britain into a bargain-basement economy so the Brexit elite can make a profit and strike grubby deals with the likes of Donald Trump."""
2018-09-21,Labour members have backed a move to make it easier to deselect sitting MPs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-conference-party-votes-to-make-it-easier-to-oust-sitting-mps-11507279,"Until now, MPs only faced an open re-selection contest if 50% of a constituency's local branches and affiliated unions voted for it. But delegates at the party's annual conference in Liverpool backed a proposal for that threshold to be reduced to 33%. A total of 65% of members and unions backed the move, with 34% voting against. Opponents say this is part of an effort to purge ""Blairites"" and other critics of leader Jeremy Corbyn from the party, while supporters of the change say it will help a new generation of Labour MPs emerge. Wendy Nichols, a National Executive Committee member who chaired the debate on Monday morning, appealed for delegates not to boo when the results were revealed. There was heckling after a separate vote on Sunday. ""It's a democratic party,"" she said. ""The results are done by us all so please refrain from booing today."" Several members expressed their discontent with the move, suggesting it did not go far enough. Many within the party support mandatory open selection contests for all MPs ahead of every election. Deputy leader Tom Watson told Sky News ahead of the vote that mandatory re-selection would be ""very destabilising for the party"". ""We are potentially close to a general election, maybe any day,"" he said. ""What we don't want is MPs having to defend their positions in their local areas when they could be campaigning in parliament for social policy that affects the many, not the few."" Delegates also backed changes to the rules covering leadership elections. While the 10% threshold for the number of nominations from fellow MPs a candidate must secure to get on the ballot paper has not changed, they must now also secure nominations from 5% of constituency parties or 5% of trade union members or affiliated organisations. A spokesman for Momentum, the left-wing activist group supportive of Mr Corbyn, said: ""While the Democracy Review has passed it is only a meagre set of reforms, falling well short of what the members want with many key proposals being watered down or blocked. ""However, it could have been much worse."" The group said it had helped deliver a ""crucial reform"" of the system for selecting parliamentary candidates and ""averted catastrophe"" over the leadership threshold. The spokesman added: ""Although it stops short of open selections, the changes to how parliamentary candidates are selected will give members far more say in who represents them and help open the door to a new generation of MPs. ""And while the change in the leadership rules is deeply disappointing, it is not the dramatic increase to the leadership threshold proposed earlier in the week which would have stopped a socialist candidate getting on the ballot in a future leadership contest."""
2018-09-21,An online petition supporting the Sky News Leaders' Debate campaign has gone live.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/petition-launched-for-permanent-leaders-tv-debates-11507025,"Sky News is pushing for the creation of an Independent Leaders' Debates Commission (LDC) to oversee and organise the debates. It's a move backed by Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, including Vince Cable and Jeremy Corbyn. Under the Sky News proposal, the LDC would set the format and the rules for the debate as well as outline the criteria for political party participation.   It would also steer negotiations between broadcasters and parties and ensure the audiences are objective. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is the latest senior MP to support the campaign. He said: ""I support it. I'll support the petition and I'll sign. It's exactly what we need. ""No leader should be afraid of debates, it happens in other countries. ""I don't know why Theresa May ran from it last time, it should definitely happen."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey is also supporting Sky News' campaign. She told Sky News: ""Many of our members would agree that certain outlets would favour one particular party or another, so it's important to make sure these leadership debates are fair and it's a good opportunity for people across Britain to hear about the policies of a particular party without the spin, without the rhetoric."" With Labour pressing the government to call a general election, many party members are backing the idea. One member at the Labour Conference said: ""I think it's something that should really be sorted. We've had people arguing about it for the last two elections."" Another added: ""It's healthy politicians have a platform to challenge each others' ideas in front of a wider public."" Conservatives, including former home secretary Amber Rudd and former equalities minister Nicky Morgan, have also supported the campaign. An online petition has been set up by Sky News so voters can support the campaign. It is calling for a change in election law to make party leaders take part in a televised debate. And it is proposing the establishment of an LDC to take the running of debates away from politicians and broadcasters. With enough signatures the petition will be considered for debate in parliament. The first televised leaders' debate took place in 2010. But they have not happened since, despite two further general elections taking place. Sky News has written to all the main parties asking for support. Editor-at-large Adam Boulton said: ""I think there is real enthusiasm behind the debate. I think the danger is complacency, yes of course they should happen, people think why wouldn't they happen. ""There's no doubt the Labour Party would love to see Jeremy Corbyn up against the leader of the Conservative party. With newspaper headlines saying we could have a general election this autumn, there really is no time to lose. ""It does need a wave of public support to convince the politicians to take the next step."""

It can start with either a phone call, an email or a pop-up message appearing on your computer, telling you there's something wrong with it or with your internet connection, and claiming that it needs to be fixed. The scammers will then demand payment to fix the issue, or they will trick victims into installing software on their computer which could allow the criminals to access personal and financial details. Action Fraud stated it received 22,609 reports of Computer Software Service fraud with a total of £21,365,360 being lost over the last financial year. According to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, men and women are equally susceptible to being targeted by the fraudsters, and victims are on average 63 years old. The bureau's figures show that people living in London and Bristol are most likely to fall victim too. Fraud became the most common type of crime in England and Wales in 2016 because of the increasing profits to be made through cyber fraud and computer misuse. Protection advice from Action Fraud and City of London Police will be issued on their social media channels to help people learn how to protect themselves. The forces are also encouraging businesses to warn customers that they will never be contacted in that way if any issues are detected. City of London Police's Lara Xenoudakis said: ""These fraudsters prey on vulnerable victims, doing everything they can to convince them there is something wrong with their computer. ""They use this as a way to gain immediate and in some cases multiple payments from the victim. ""During this campaign week, we are asking people to do everything they can to protect themselves from this type of fraud and stop fraudsters from thinking that this is an easy way to make money from unsuspecting victims."" Other officers are also contributing to the campaign.

2018-09-21,"New research commissioned by Sky News shows that the country is currently facing not one single housing crisis, but five types of crisis.
",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/line-18-my-house-of-horrors-puts-my-children-at-risk-11501495,"One of them is a quality crisis - for many homes, the big problem is neither supply nor demand but the state of the building. Our data showed Liverpool was the number one city for poor quality housing.  Cheryl Tomlinson, 27, found herself homeless and on Liverpool council's housing waiting list when she was six months pregnant.  Here the mother of two, tells Sky News the problems she's endured in the past five months: I used to have a flat in the city centre, but when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter it made sense to move in with my partner, and get out of the city. But sadly our relationship soon broke down and I found myself pregnant and homeless with a young toddler. I looked for private rental homes which would accept housing benefit, but I didn't fit their criteria because I couldn't get a guarantor. After speaking with the homeless team at the council, I was given a room in a Travelodge in town, ironically, on the street I had left so I didn't have to bring up my baby in the busy city centre. I was at the hotel for two weeks before I was given temporary accommodation by a charity for three months. The council ranked me as 'Band A' which meant I was able to apply for three houses each week from their list. Despite applying every week, I was told that I actually wasn't eligible for them after all. Instead I was told I was eligible for houses in rougher areas - although I'm not from Liverpool originally, I know the areas pretty well now. I was given three streets I could go to look around before I was offered a house. It was either that or face being kicked off the list with the council ending their responsibility for me. So I accepted a two-up two-down Victorian terrace house which is where I live now. But when I looked around it I was gutted to see there were no fixtures or fittings in place. The tiled flooring was cracked and broken - not safe for a toddler. I was told I'd have to sign the tenancy and move in straight away, because the rent had to be paid. So I was very grateful when the charity which maintained the temporary accommodation I was staying in told me I could stay with them a bit longer while the house was fixed. They said they couldn't let me move in while pregnant and with a small child. The charity even said they would help with any money problems later down the line because I would be late moving in. Flooring is classified as decorative so I had to take out a loan to pay for the floor to be replaced with laminate. It's really a house of horrors. I've had a broken extractor fan the whole time while I've been living here. We have had to deal with rats in the garden and fly tipped rubbish where the houses back onto each other. There's been mould in the house too. Then two months ago, the mains water pipe burst. It burst because it's made of plastic and the skirting board had been rubbing it. The housing association paid for the repair because it's structural, but I'm worried it could happen again. It only replaced the damaged part with copper, not the whole pipe, so I've no idea if the rest of it is safe. I've fought to have them replace the flooring that was damaged by the pipe, but even though I agreed to meet them halfway two months ago, I've heard nothing since. I also had to demand they come back to fix the skirting board because it was ripped and jagged from the work they did. My 17-month-old daughter could grab it and hurt herself - they would be liable for it. When I called the emergency line to have the mains repaired, they sent out a gas engineer not a plumber, as they needed to make sure they hit their target call out time, even though he wouldn't be able to do anything about it. I used to work on the emergency call lines in London, and I know what the spiel is. I just don't want to hear it anymore. Use our map to see how your local authority stacks up. Which housing crisis are you facing?"
2018-09-21,Two mini space rovers have landed on an asteroid and sent images back to Earth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/japans-hopping-space-rovers-land-on-asteroid-11507147,"Japan's space agency, JAXA, launched the rovers on the Hayabusa2, and they released from the craft on 21 September. The team behind the expedition faced a nervous two-day wait for the Minerva-II rovers to send back information, but on Sunday, they confirmed the rovers landed. A statement from JAXA read: ""The two rovers are in good condition and are transmitting images and data. Analysis of this information confirmed that at least one of the rovers is moving on the asteroid surface."" The rovers hop across the surface, because the gravity on the Ryugu asteroid makes it impossible for them to roll. Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa2 project manager said: ""I cannot find words to express how happy I am that we were able to realise mobile exploration on the surface of an asteroid. ""I am proud that Hayabusa2 was able to contribute to the creation of this technology for a new method of space exploration by surface movement on small bodies."" This is the first exploration of an asteroid by a rover. The two robots will capture colour images of the asteroid and measure temperatures before the agency sends a larger rover in October. Next month Hayabusa2 will deploy an impactor which will explode above the asteroid, to blast a crater into its surface. The probe will then collect fresh materials from inside the crater which have not been exposed to wind and radiation. Hayabusa2 launched in December 2014 and is due back to Earth in 2020. JAXA tried to launch a probe in 2005, but it failed to land on its target asteroid."
2018-09-21,There is the kernel of a good idea in John McDonnell's proposals to make any business employing more than 250 people to hand 10% of the company to their staff.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/labours-iof-share-plan-will-be-seen-as-theft-by-companies-11507375,"It is that it would widen share ownership. Wider share ownership is an unalloyed good thing. However, for many businesses, the shadow chancellor's proposals amount to little more than a confiscation of other people's property. Say you are an entrepreneur. You had a good idea for a business, you remortgaged your home to raise capital to set up the business when the bank wouldn't lend to you, you worked long hours into the night and the weekends, making heavy personal sacrifices, foregoing holidays, the kids birthday parties and other social events. There were weeks, even months, where you couldn't afford to pay yourself a proper salary. Your business is a success and you are able to take people on, provide them with jobs. You take the business onto the stock market and see a value attached to your life's work. Then, at the end of all that, Mr McDonnell wants you to hand over 10% of everything for which you have worked to an ""Inclusive Ownership Fund"" (IOF) without you receiving any compensation. It is hard to think of an idea better designed to kill entrepreneurship stone dead or to drive wealth creators, the people who take risks to build successful businesses and create jobs overseas. How would you like it if you were obliged to hand a 10% stake of your home, or your car, to someone else without compensation? That is how many entrepreneurs will feel about being made to give up a stake in their business without compensation. Ah, you may say, but what is wrong with a big, faceless FTSE-100 company, a Royal Dutch Shell or an HSBC, being obliged to deposit 10% of their shares in such a fund? The answer is because this would still represent confiscation by the state of other people's property. All of these companies are owned by their shareholders, in the main, members of occupational pension schemes and holders of insurance policies. These companies belong to them and, if you take away 10% of them and give it to someone else without compensation, that amounts to theft. Even if companies issue new shares to deposit into this IOF, existing shareholders would still see their stake in the business diluted, which amounts to the same thing. Worse still, many of the big battalions of the FTSE 100 or the FTSE 250 now have a significant proportion of shareholders on their register from overseas. Again, it is harder to think of a policy better constructed to drive away foreign investors from the UK. Many City investors are currently battling to stop Unilever, the third biggest company in the Footsie, relocating its head office to the Netherlands because the move will result in it being ejected from the index. That would force some investors to sell their shares in Unilever without receiving any kind of takeover premium. A lot more companies would contemplate similar actions if these scheme comes to pass. Think how you would feel if, for example, you had bought shares in one of America's tech titans, like Apple or Amazon, only for the US government to confiscate 10% of your shares? Or if you had invested in one of Germany's prestigious companies, like BMW or Adidas, only for the German government to insist 10% of your shares were given up without compensation. You would think twice about ever investing a penny in America or Germany again. Post-Brexit, the UK needs desperately to attract foreign investors, not risk repelling them. Then there's the way Mr McDonnell proposes to cream off some of the dividends paid by the shares in this IOF once every worker has received their £500-a-head entitlement from the pot. That looks very much like a backdoor increase in corporation tax. There's also the question of who would sit on the board of trustees of this Inclusive Ownership Fund or how powerful they would be to stop a future government from dipping into the fund to divert money from it to pet projects or to plug budget deficits. Another problem with these proposals is that they create an uneven playing field. Labour admits that unlisted companies would not be prone to this rule and neither would the UK subsidiaries of foreign companies: it would only apply to companies listed in the UK. These proposals could very well compel some companies to de-list from the stock market - depriving the public, potentially, of a lot of exciting investment opportunities and resulting in the exact opposite of the wider share ownership Mr McDonnell claims to seek. Quoted companies provide a return to their investors by giving them a share of profits. This is usually in the form of a dividend. However, if companies are forced to hand over 10% of their dividends to this IOF, you could see companies responding to these proposals by ceasing paying dividends, returning capital to shareholders instead via share buy-backs. The IOF would not raise the sums Mr McDonnell expects them to under such circumstances. There's a further wrinkle with these proposals. Companies list on the stock market to raise capital. Companies that are already listed issue new shares to investors if they need to raise more capital. In such fund-raising exercises, existing shareholders usually have the automatic right to buy some of the new shares being issued, so their stake is not diluted. Would the Inclusive Ownership Fund be allowed to take up its rights in such circumstances? And, if it did not, would it later demand more shares from the company once the IOF's shareholding had been diluted below 10%? Mr McDonnell isn't saying. Ironically, these proposals come just as Labour is proposing to re-nationalise a number of private sector businesses, including water companies and the Royal Mail. At present, workers in those companies are able to own shares in them - indeed, employees of Royal Mail currently own 12% of the business - but will lose that ability if Labour nationalises them. That is inconsistent with Mr McDonnell's claim that he wishes to see wider share ownership. It's worth remembering that most Royal Mail employees have spurned the opportunity to sell their shares they were awarded at privatisation but have held onto them. Besides, there already exists a very good way of enabling employees to buy shares in the company for which they work. It is called ""Save As You Earn"" (SAYE) or ""Sharesave"" and was introduced by Margaret Thatcher's government in 1980. Under SAYE, employees divert some of their earnings - before tax has been applied to them - into a regular savings scheme, which gives them the right or 'option' to buy a certain number of shares in the company for which they work at a set point in the future. Employers top up these savings with a cash bonus and the options in the shares are eventually exercised. Employees can pay between £50 and £250 per month into such schemes. SAYE has been highly successful in widening share ownership and tens of millions of British workers have benefited from participating in such schemes during the last 38 years. If Labour is sincere about widening share ownership, it could raise the monthly limit employees are allowed to save on a tax free basis from the existing £500, or it could reduce the minimum term of the contract from the current three years. Or, if it wanted to make it easier for people to buy shares, it could abolish Stamp Duty on share dealing. Currently, it is committed to introducing a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT), sometimes referred to as a 'Robin Hood Tax', which would actually have the impact of making it more expensive to buy shares. Wider share ownership is highly desirable. There are lots of ways to achieve that aim. Mr McDonnell's proposals actually risk achieving the opposite."

Despite the use of two epipens administered by her father, she was declared dead at a hospital in the French city later the same day. Shortly before boarding the plane Natasha had eaten an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette purchased from the main Pret a Manger shop in Terminal 5 at the west London airport. The bread contained sesame seeds which Natasha was allergic to - but were not listed on the ingredients. An inquest into her death will begin on Monday and will look at how one of the country's biggest food chains failed to list the seeds as an ingredient. Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, founder and chief executive of WOW Toys who was awarded an MBE in 2000, issued a joint statement with his wife Tanya, who also has a key role within the family run company. In the statement, Natasha's parents explained how two years on from her death, their daughter's holiday bag from the trip still sits unpacked in her room. The statement said: ""As a family now of three, my wife, son and I are still trying to adjust to life without our beloved girl. It’s a daily battle and the pain is indescribable. ""Everything we say and do is a reminder that she isn’t with us; her empty bedroom, school uniform hanging in her wardrobe, her holiday bag packed for her holiday in Nice has never been unpacked. ""We can't bear to.” They described their daughter as a girl with many friends at school ""who had a strong moral compass and often showed maturity beyond her years"". An aspiring lawyer and talented ice skater, Natasha, from Fulham in London, had her ""best ever"" summer planned. It included a week at a youth Christian Festival in Norfolk and a two-week family holiday in Greece, as well as the break to Nice with her best friend. ""You could not ask for a more wonderful daughter,"" her parents said in their tribute. ""She had a great sense of humour and was known for her contagious laughter - she could reduce a whole room to tears of laughter in minutes! ""She was also gentle, brave and loyal and showed great kindness and courage on many occasions."" More than 300 people attended her memorial service in December 2016 on what would have been her 16th birthday. During the inquest the coroner will hear evidence from both the Pret a Manger store manager on the date Natasha bought the baguette, and the head of safety and compliance at the UK-based sandwich shop chain, which has 500 stores worldwide and was sold in May this year for £1.5bn. The captain on the British Airways flight and the flight crew who witnessed Natasha’s collapse on 17 July 2016 will also give evidence. The Sunday Times reports that Pret was already improving the allergen information available to customers when it was made aware of the case by the coroner's office. ""We were deeply saddened to hear about Natasha’s tragic death, and our heartfelt thoughts are with her family,"" the chain told the paper. ""We take food allergies and how allergen information is provided extremely seriously. We will continue to do all that we can to assist the inquest."" All product shelf tickets in the chain now list allergens, and Pret's labelling is consistent with the regulatory requirements which apply to freshly-prepared handmade food. A BA spokesman said the company were sorry to hear of the young girl's death and that its thoughts were with the family."

The 39-year-old skipper injured his back badly and was unable to move after a storm rolled his boat 360 degrees during the Golden Globe Race on Friday. Both masts on his 36ft-long (11m) classic yacht, Thuriya, were taken down by the storm and were seen hanging over the vessel's side. Mr Tomy, who is also an Indian naval officer, had been coming third out of 18 participants before the severe storm and survived on cans of iced tea. Indian navy spokesman Captain DK Sharma told Sky News: ""He is conscious, he can talk, he's been rescued. ""He's been injured but he's in safe hands. He's been moved on a stretcher to the French fishing vessel Osiris."" Mr Tomy's boat has been floating about 1,900 miles south-west of Perth since the incident. He first issued a code red alert from his boat on Friday which said: ""ROLLED. DISMASTED. SEVERE BACK INJURY. CANNOT GET UP."" Organisers of the 30,000-mile race said the stricken sailor was ""as far from help as you could possibly be"". He was communicating with a Yellow Brick texting unit with a battery life of just days. A fellow Golden Globe competitor, Irish sailor Gregor McGuckin, was believed to be the best option to rescue Mr Tomy. His boat was also rolled 360 degrees by the storm and he was fixing his main mast to travel about 100 miles to get to his fellow sailor. REPORT JUST IN from JRCC they have him BRAVO!! OSIRIS AND ALL INVOLVED! They have Tomy Onboard and he is conscious and talking...FANTASTIC NEWS..WELL DONE ALL INVOLVED INCREDIBLE NEWS!!!!https://t.co/w0ykzwrfX3 Mr McGuckin was going to abandon his own boat and jump or swim across to provide him with ""immediate medical assistance"", race organiser Barry Pickthall said. Osiris was then going to pick up the two sailors in the next 16 hours. However, Osiris managed to get there first, guided by an Indian reconnaissance aircraft from the air. The Indian navy is now heading to Mr McGuckin to save him. Mr Tomy is one of India's top sailors and was invited to do the Golden Globe by British sailor Robin Knox-Johnston, who became the first person to sail single-handed non-stop around the world. His boat, Thuriya, is a replica of Mr Knox-Johnston's wooden boat. Mr Tomy took part in a round-the-world non-stop sailing race from Mumbai in 2012/13 and has received the Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award and the Kirti Chakra Award for courage."

West Mercia Police says it is still treating it as a missing person case. Police are working ""round the clock"" to locate the teenager, studying CCTV footage and evidence from members of the public before launching a criminal investigation.

The man, 38, had already been stopped by security staff. He was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm (a Taser) and was taken to a central London police station. The man, who was visiting the UK from the Netherlands, was questioned by police before he was released without further action. In a statement, the Met Police said: ""Officers were satisfied that his possession of the device - which was low-powered and part of a keyring - was a genuine error on his part, and that he posed no threat."" On its Twitter page, the Metropolitan Police said the incident was not terrorism-related. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The Queen is currently away from her official residence, taking a summer break at Balmoral Castle in Scotland."

By 2043 obesity is likely to cause more cancer cases than smoking. The conclusions were based on projections, and researchers stressed that there remain many uncertainties in predicting what will cause cancers in the future. As fewer people smoke and obesity rates increase, however, the gap will continue to close. With higher rates of obesity and fewer smokers among women than men, the narrowing is happening faster among women. Blog post: How we estimated when obesity might catch smoking as the top cause of cancer: https://t.co/UmTgnmth6A pic.twitter.com/7EyEF7dnMU The charity is now launching a campaign to raise awareness of the link between cancer and obesity, and to encourage a healthier lifestyle. It said only around one in seven people in the UK are aware of the link between obesity and cancer. ""The decline in smoking is a cause for celebration. It shows how decades of effort to raise awareness about the health risks plus strong political action including taxation, removing tobacco marketing and a ban on smoking in indoor public places, have paid off,"" said professor Linda Bauld, a prevention expert at the charity. ""But, just as there is still more to do to support people to quit smoking, we also need to act now to halt the tide of weight-related cancers and ensure this projection never becomes a reality."" Measures suggested following the research including a ban on junk food adverts before 9pm and restrictions on promotions of unhealthy food and drink. ""Obesity is the new smoking, one of the greatest public health challenges of our generation,"" a spokesperson for NHS England said. ""Expanding waistlines also mean a heavier burden for taxpayers which is why, as we draw up a long term plan for the NHS, we are exploring all options to help patients to help themselves and help the NHS."" In releasing the report, Cancer Research says it hopes to prevent the projected rise in obesity-related cancers becoming a reality - by taking cues from success in stopping smoking. In the first half of the 20th century it is believed that up to 80% of men smoked, but today around 17% of men are smokers."
2018-09-21,"John McDonnell has hailed Labour's plans to renationalise the water industry, telling the party's conference it is part of ""the greatest extension of economic democratic rights that this country has ever seen"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/john-mcdonnell-says-labours-renationalisation-plans-not-a-return-to-past-11507472,"The shadow chancellor told Labour's annual gathering in Liverpool that the policy would ""put this essential service back in the hands of local councils, workers and customers"". Mr McDonnell said the party's plans for sweeping nationalisation of industries like water, energy and rail would not be ""a return to the past"" but the catalyst for genuine change. Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debates Commission to oversee and organise election debates ""We don't want to take power away from faceless directors only to centralise it all in a Whitehall office, to swap one remote manager for another,"" he told delegates. He said the party was primed to implement a radical programme of nationalisation as soon as it entered Downing Street. Mr McDonnell told the hall Labour would ensure there would be ""unprecedented openness and transparency"" in how the water industry was managed, as well as announcing a ""large scale consultation"" on ""democracy in our public services"". Mr McDonnell said an industry shake-up would see it reorganised under new Regional Water Authorities (RWAs). These would include local councillors, worker representatives and representatives of community, consumer and environmental interests. He said executive and director level jobs would be re-advertised on ""dramatically reduced"" salaries and denounced the ""scandal"" of an industry which has paid out £18bn in dividends as bills rocketed by 40% in real terms. As for what would happen to shareholders in the existing private companies, Mr McDonnell said they would be compensated with bonds in a way that would be ""cost neutral"" for the taxpayer. However, the party has made clear that shareholders' payments could be cut if there is evidence of asset-stripping, pension fund deficits or state subsidies since privatisation - and compensation being forfeited altogether has not been ruled out. Mr McDonnell promised: ""We are ending the profiteering in dividends, vast executive salaries, and excessive interest payments. ""Surpluses will be reinvested in water infrastructure and staff, or used to reduce bills."" Mr McDonnell said a Public and Community Ownership Unit in the Treasury would take charge of the return of water, energy, rail and the Royal Mail to public ownership. The shadow chancellor also announced plans to make employees part-owners of their company if the firm employs more than 250 people, a policy the party claims could leave workers up to £500 a year better off. Mr McDonnell pledged to bring together institutions like churches, unions and pension funds as part of a concerted campaign to apply pressure to firms to stop avoiding taxes. The Conservatives said the employee ownership policy was ""yet another tax rise"" which could deter companies from taking on staff, while the Confederation of British Industry warned it would drive down investment. The business group also expressed concerns about Mr McDonnell's speech more generally, warning ""the fallout...would be a drop in living standards"". Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""From renationalisation to dilution of shares, Labour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business. ""Their policies would immediately reduce the value of shares owned by ordinary people by over 10% and hobble UK ambitions to compete on a global stage."" Mr McDonnell also said Labour was ready to fight and win an election, telling the Tories: ""Bring it on."" There was loud applause in the hall when he said: ""Whenever the general election comes, we are ready. ""Ready to campaign for victory, ready for government, ready to build the future. ""And ... we'll be proud to call that future socialism."" Labour's annual gathering has been dominated by calls for it to back a second Brexit referendum. Mr McDonnell sparked anger on Monday when he said such a vote would not include an option to stay in the EU, but rather give voters a say on the ""nature"" of a deal with Brussels. In his speech he made clear that his preference was for there to be an election to decide the issue, and added: ""We are keeping all the options open for democratic engagement."""

It came hours after shadow chancellor John McDonnell announced the only choices should be on the ""nature"" of a deal with Brussels. Emotional splits have emerged within Labour as it grapples with pressure to campaign for a ""people's vote"" on any negotiated settlement. Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debates Commission to oversee and organise election debates Kicking off Labour's annual conference in Liverpool on Monday, Mr McDonnell said any new referendum on Brexit should ""respect"" the 2016 result to leave. Asked by Sky News if the question to Leave or Remain should be revisited in a potential future vote, Mr McDonnell said: ""No - I think it'll be on the deal itself. ""If we're saying we respect the referendum, it'll be about the nature of the deal that the prime minister brings back or the one that we can negotiate."" Mr McDonnell was confident Labour could negotiate a good deal with Brussels by 29 March 2019, the date when Article 50 runs out and Britain leaves the European Union. The EU has suggested December is the cut-off date for negotiations, to allow enough time for a deal to be voted on by the 27 other countries' parliaments. Asked if Labour could negotiate a deal in six months, Mr McDonnell said: ""We think we can, we think we can negotiate a deal."" But he was contradicted that afternoon by Sir Keir. ""We weren't ruling options and nobody was ruling out Remain,"" he told journalists.

Labour MP David Lammy warned a choice without Remain on the ballot paper would amount to a ""farcical referendum on no deal or a bad deal"". ""It absolutely must include the right to remain in the EU,"" he added. In a fiery speech at a rally on the fringes of Labour's conference, the Walthamstow MP implores moderates not to leave the party. But Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell said he was against a referendum full stop. ""Not because I think we should take whatever is offered to us by the prime minister, but because I don't believe that spending more time arguing over a process will actually change the minds of the people who we need to come on board to vote to stay in the EU,"" he said. Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon, said he feared a second vote could further divide Britain. He said: ""One thing we know a referendum will not do, it will not reunite our country. ""It will entrench, it will polarise, it will consolidate those divisions and those differences."" Mr Kinnock added: ""We do have to take a long, hard look in the mirror before we commit to something that is going to sow the seeds of division. Len McCluskey and Mark Serwotka are accused of ""playing with fire"" by talking down the level of discrimination against Jews. ""It will make the 2016 referendum look like a walk in the park."" But Mr Kinnock said that if another referendum were to be held, it would be ""absurd"" for it not to contain the option of remaining in the EU. It came hours after Labour averted some members' calls for committing to campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. The party will prioritise getting a general election, but if unsuccessful will ""support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". Leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would be ""bound"" by a vote at Labour conference on whether the party should campaign for another referendum."
2018-09-21,"Thomas Cook has downgraded annual profit forecasts, saying hot weather hurt demand for bookings across its crucial summer season.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/thomas-cook-issues-hot-weather-profit-warning-11507170,"The holiday firm said ""tough"" trading in June and July had continued, with the ""unprecedented"" period of higher-than-average temperatures across Europe meaning it had, like rivals, been forced to discount late bookings heavily. As a result, the FTSE 250 firm warned that underlying operating profits for the year to September were now expected to come in at £280m. Its previous guidance was for £323m. Shares plunged by 28% in the wake of the announcement on Monday while rival TUI was one of the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down nearly 3%. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's chief executive, said: ""Summer 2018 has seen a return to popularity of destinations such as Turkey and Tunisia. ""However, it has also been marked by a prolonged period of hot weather across Europe. This meant many customers spent June and July enjoying the sunshine at home and put off booking their holidays abroad, leading to even tougher competition and higher than usual levels of discounting in the 'lates' market of August and September. ""Our recent trading performance is clearly disappointing. However, despite the recent challenges, we continue to make good strategic progress which positions us well to drive further performance improvement; this includes the launch of our Expedia alliance in the UK and Scandinavia, signing our first own-brand hotel in China and lining up a pipeline of 10 new Cook's Clubs in some of our key destinations for Summer 2019."" Thomas Cook reported that the warm temperatures had also had an impact on winter bookings at this stage. Egypt is among the destinations it has invested in though the country's efforts to boost tourism suffered a setback last month when a British couple died in mysterious circumstances while on a Thomas Cook break. The company has been supporting efforts to get to the bottom of how John and Susan Cooper, from Lancashire, died. A UK inquest was told last week about a ""musty smell"" in their room at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Thomas Cook said a greater focus on Turkey, Greece, Tunisia and Egypt had proved a strong point. It said overall group tour operator bookings were up 1%, while pricing was 3% higher than last year. Its statement continued: ""The slowdown in (UK) customer bookings during June and July extended into August, leading to higher than normal levels of promotional activity. ""This has exacerbated pressure on margins, on top of an already competitive market for Spanish holidays, as previously highlighted."" Thomas Cook is due to report its full-year results on 29 November. Commenting on the dramatic share price fall Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at markets.com, said: ""The manner of these large share price moves whenever a company misses its numbers appears increasingly excessive, although we must note that profit warnings rarely come alone. ""We really need to wait to see how summer 2019 looks now to get a clear idea of where the company stands."" Thomas Cook also announced separately that chief financial officer Bill Scott had decided to step down. The company said he would be replaced on 30 November, on an interim basis, by Sten Daugaard who is on the company's German board."
2018-09-21,"Sir Lenny George Henry, CBE, is a British stand-up comedian, actor, singer, writer, and TV presenter.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/arts-vital-for-a-childs-sense-of-inclusion-11506538,"For National Inclusion Week, which runs from 24-28 September, Sir Lenny writes about the importance of the creative arts to a child's upbringing and sense of inclusion, fondly remembering his first childhood trip to the theatre. I go to the theatre a lot now. I even get asked to support things like Children in the Arts, which is an initiative headed up by Prince Charles. I went the other day and it was a big media morning of talented individuals including Benedict Cumberbatch, Meera Syal, Myleene Klass and her kids, Lord Lloyd Webber, and the director general of the BBC - all talking about how important drama studies are in the school curriculum, while the government is doing its damnedest to cut the majority of funding and making school arts activity a self-selecting/self-paying extra curricular set of activities. It is to weep. And good people are saying good and sensible things about children and the arts - it just feels like no one really cares. And the problem is that the creative arts are a huge boost to the GDP of Great Britain. In January, the Guardian said the creative industries were ""worth £92bn to the UK economy"". ""The sector returns more golden eggs to the Treasury than the automotive, oil, gas, aerospace and life science industries combined, and for every £1 invested in subsidy the government gets £5 returned in taxes."" So why is the government cutting back on the creative arts in schools? Why this insistence on STEM (sciences, technology, engineering and maths), this rejection of the arts? The truth is, this was always going to happen. When I was at Blue Coat secondary modern there was little or no attempt to cultivate dramatic aspirations during the school day. Sure, we were tasked with reading aloud or taking part in an assembly; we even did a school concert the year I had successfully auditioned for New Faces. But the only drama I remember taking part in was when Mr Kipper (the English teacher) would have us in the hall for a double period and make us run around pretending to be characters we had seen on television or at the pictures. When we were kids, there were not many chances to pop into a performance of Hedda Gabler or the Doll's House. The fact is, theatre didn't play a massive part in my parents' lives. They spent every hour God gave putting food on the table and clothes on our backs. They were not also going to pop us in for a matinee of She Stoops To Conquer at the Wolverhampton Civic. They weren't made of money. So, no theatre. But one year, mum's factory subsidised a massive trip to the Birmingham Alexandra Theatre - suddenly, a whole bunch of kids and a parent and some teachers would be allowed to watch a pantomime. In our case it was Charlie Drake starring in Robinson Crusoe. It sounds odd now but this act of inclusion was powerful. Drake was one of the biggest stars on television at the time. He had hit records and was also the lead actor in a television show called The Worker, where he would torment the poor desk clerk at the labour exchange with the fateful words ""Where's Mr Whittaker?"" while dragging said clerk over the counter by his lapels. He shared top billing with a three piece called New World. They had recently had a hit with Tom Tom Turnaround and had won a talent show called Opportunity Knocks on several occasions. One of them had an Afro - bliss. Every second of the coach trip from Dudley to Birmingham was evocative and memorable. Mum made hard dough bread sandwiches with corned beef and fried onion. There was sweet bun and cheese and a boxed drink for afters. In my case, that was all devoured by the time we got to the roundabout by Dudley Zoo. The rest of the journey was spent with my head almost glued to the window as we watched the accompanying traffic aquaplaning through massive puddles on our way to Brum. This first trip to the theatre was important for me; I would see so many things that would stay with me for the rest of my life. The arrival and disgorging of passengers outside the theatre. The black clad staff who collected us from outside and led us towards the warmth of the foyer. The programmes and badges, and ice creams and pick-and-mix on sale in the foyer. Mum steering me away from the theatre's sweets and reminding me that she had Grays Herbal Tablets in her handbag. The yelling, screaming, crying and shouting as we were all expertly led upstairs into the cheaper portion of the theatre. The lights go down and BOOM, CRASH, BANG, WALLOP we're in the midst of a massive storm. There's a boat, a beleaguered ship's crew beset by the storm and then WHAMMO! the terrifying rumble of thunder as the ship is wrecked and the crew are hurled into the sea. I was hooked. Whatever happened next couldn't possibly top this opening - but strangely, Charlie, the New World, a ventriloquist, a man dressed as a woman (the dame?) and various others - made the whole thing strangely inescapable, irresistible, inclusive and fun. Huge fun. My point, and I do have one, is that access and inclusion are vital to a child's upbringing. We didn't have structured drama lessons at my school. If we had, I think each class would have been indelibly printed on my brain. Curricular arts and drama classes embody an organised principle amongst children: they learn how to organise, design, collaborate and participate on a level which creates a mode of thinking that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. :: End working class prejudice rather than focusing on social mobility Including working-class children in an arts-based curriculum ensures not just a new influx of artists, actors, dancers and directors - but also produces a more viable work force, imbued with a structured approach to life borne out of inclusion, participation and creativity. These things matter, whatever our leaders tell us as they point to the bottom line. The creative arts are much more than an easy-to-lose option in our children's school day - they should be immovable items, something cherished and valued by parents, teachers and employers alike. Inclusion matters and so, too, do the creative arts - let's not lose sight of that."
2018-09-21,The cabinet meeting on Monday is yet another crunch point for the Prime Minister and her Chequers compromise deal reached in July.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180924155636/https://news.sky.com/story/chucking-chequers-misses-the-point-of-brexit-hold-up-11507154,"It risks missing the point, however, in terms of what is actually holding up negotiations with the European Union. Whatever the temptation to force the PM to abandon Chequers, the core of which is to keep free and frictionless trade in goods and agriculture by maintaining common rules with the European Union, it is the Irish border problem that is the actual hold up over the next month. Sceptical members of the cabinet may well feel emboldened to persuade the PM to ""chuck Chequers"" by the fact that the EU27 so clearly and publicly told her that its key economic elements ""will not work"". Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debates Commission to oversee and organise election debates But the fight she needs to have right now after last week's Salzburg summit misjudgements is about the Irish border backstop arrangement. She had attempted to say to Irish leader Leo Varadkar that detailed UK plans on Ireland would not be ready until November. This is what prompted the EU27 over lunch last Thursday, led by President Macron of France to drop a plan to commit to a special deal-making Brexit summit in mid-November. That summit will now depend on Michel Barnier reporting back in three weeks' time to the EU27 at the October summit that substantial progress has been made on the commitments in relation to Ireland.   This was the really significant part of the PM's Number 10 podium statement last Friday. She gave an indication that the UK government would accept extra regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as long as they were approved by the Northern Ireland assembly. This plan was verbally communicated to Mr Varadkar in outline at last week's Salzburg breakfast meeting, but with nothing on paper. He in turn asked for detailed written plans. It appears as a result of last week's events they will now be forthcoming. Both sides are inching closer together on this thorny and controversial issue. The PM said there could be no customs or VAT checks, but there are existing small-scale checks in agriculture to maintain the integrity of all Ireland markets, for example cattle. The EU negotiators asked for and received data on how much ""East-West"" trade actually flows through Larne and Belfast. Team Barnier negotiating for EU27 and Ireland has evolved the backstop plans into not-published detailed proposals, and were disappointed that Number 10 rejected this in a pre-Salzburg briefing. Again this refers to the East-West - ie intra UK trade NOT North-South trade between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. On Customs and VAT - the EU is willing to look at barcodes and enforcement away from the border. Though UK negotiators say why not use the same technology North-South or even at Dover-Calais? The maintenance of product standards, the EU says, can also be done ""in the market"" by surveillance authorities, not by checks at the regulatory border. But for food and agriculture standards, there ""must be checks"" says one EU source appearing to mean what under EU law is referred to as a ""Border Inspection Post"" at entry points into Northern Ireland for food and agriculture from Great Britain. These would be on a much greater scale than exists currently.   The PM's red line appears to be that Northern Ireland must not remain aligned to the EU's customs territory, and so therefore will be a full part of new trade deals struck by the UK government. The EU say this was already agreed last December in the Joint Report, and the implication of the EU's approach to the backstop is if activated, that future UK trade deals with third countries would effectively be Great Britain only. Progress, a UK text, and agreement is required by the October summit to unlock a wider agreement in November. In many ways the future arrangements and Chequers plan can be fudged at that point. But to get there the initial challenge is not necessarily the cabinet. It is the DUP whose 12 MPs have kept the PM in office, and where its leader Arlene Foster has vowed in the currently suspended Northern Ireland Assembly to ""veto any attempt to undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK"". The wrinkle for the PM is that she, understandably wanted to try to sort out Northern Ireland at the same time as negotiating the future relationship. The closer the latter, the easier the former in terms of potential checks. But the reestablishment of a form of sequencing in the negotiations, a reflection of some fall in mutual trust complicates matters. The solution might be some sort of statement that the backstop will never be used. So while profound internal tensions over the Chequers plan that this cabinet signed off just two months ago exist, the more pressing issue for Number 10 is Northern Ireland. And it is perhaps no coincidence that a number of high-profile cabinet ministers harbouring leadership ambitions, have quietly made visits to DUP events in Belfast in recent months."

Sky News has asked writers from a diverse background to explain why the issue of inclusivity is important to them. Here, Dr Lisa McKenzie, author of Getting By: Estates, Class and Culture in Austerity Britain, looks at social mobility.  Social mobility has been a political concept that all parties feel they can get behind. It's a term that everyone can get behind - we all want more social mobility don't we? I would argue no. Social mobility means that a select few of working class people are able to transcend their class position if they can conform to a middle-class life and middle-class values. I have heard from academics, politicians and the general public that their ""class baggage"" must be left behind. ""Class baggage"" when dissected means family background, values, meaning and understandings of community and life experience. :: Creative arts vital for a child's sense of inclusion I argue class and the concept of social mobility is much more than educational attainment, wealth or earnings, but is also about culture, values, community and family. Let me explain. When you are walking down your high street you see a young lad coming in the opposite direction, hands in his tracksuit pockets, pulled right down beyond the elastic of his boxer shorts, cap pulled down you can barely see his face, and his hood is up. He's tugging at a thick leather lead with his Staffy on the other end seemingly trying to get away. What do you see and how are you reading those cultural markers of tracksuits, baseball caps and Staffordshire bull terriers? You are in a supermarket and you notice a bit of a commotion going on. A young girl with a baby in a pushchair is shouting at the security guard and is telling him to stop following her around the shop. She has her hair tied back in a tight pony tail, has a big puffa jacket on, big gold hooped earrings and her face - despite her young years - looks worn out. How are you reading this situation? These are two actual scenarios that has been recounted to me by respondents in my research, as examples of how they are ""class judged"". The young lad is taking his beloved dog to the vets. The young mother has finally snapped when for the third time that day she is being treated as someone not to be trusted in a shop. This is what class prejudice looks and behaves like every day. I call it death by one million acts of symbolic violence. We know and are aware of racial prejudice, gender bias, and discrimination based on religion, sexuality and disability - not that we are any nearer to reaching a point where people are treated equally and with respect despite their differences. Class prejudice goes unseen and unspoken. It behaves prejudicially as if it is ""natural"" that the lower orders do not have the same levels of intelligence as those from ""better"" homes. This doesn't just happen to working class people who are in ""their space"" working in the warehouses, the call centres, the supermarkets and cleaning the offices. This class-based prejudice happens on every level to those who are working class. I am a working-class academic. I have a PhD. I work at a university. You would think that I might have some protection of those ""as if in natural"" prejudices - after all social class is all about wealth, earnings, and job status isn't it? Social class is about all of those things but it is also about the cultural, social and symbolic connections we have. It is because I grew up on a council estate, had a baby has a teenager, left school at 16 with no qualifications and worked in a factory making tights for 10 years, that now as a working-class academic, I am viewed with suspicion. How did I get in? Did someone feel sorry for me? My grammar is corrected, so is my pronunciation of the French social theorists whose names I sometimes mis-pronounce. As a working-class woman ""out of my natural space"" I will also feel like a interloper, and to some extent be treated as one. The everyday prejudices that working-class people experience in every aspect of their lives, from the healthcare they receive to where and under what circumstances they are employed, runs deep in British society to the point that it is in fact invisible. It is hidden amongst the narrative of ""it's just what they are like"". Lastly what I want us to understand from those everyday class prejudices is that the term social mobility only adds and cements those prejudices as legitimate. I don't want any more social mobility. I want the working class to be free from prejudice and allowed to rise together."
