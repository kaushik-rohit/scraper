2018-08-05,Sir Patrick Stewart has announced he will be reprising the role of Starfleet officer Jean-Luc Picard.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180805230447/https://news.sky.com/story/sir-patrick-stewart-confirms-star-trek-return-as-jean-luc-picard-11461675,"Sir Patrick played Picard from 1987 through to 2002 and contributed significantly to the character's air of wisdom and brooding with his commanding presence as a Shakespearean actor. It is not yet clear in what form Jean-Luc Picard will be reprised, although there was a new series announced in June which will tell the story of the next chapter of Picard's life. Announcing his return to the role in a statement on Twitter, the actor wrote: ""I will always be very proud to have been a part of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but when we wrapped that final movie in the spring of 2002, I truly felt my time with Star Trek had run its natural course. ""It is, therefore, an unexpected but delightful surprise to find myself excited and invigorated to be returning to Jean-Luc Picard and to explore new dimensions within him. ""Seeking out new life for him, when I thought that life was over."" It is an unexpected but delightful surprise to find myself excited and invigorated to be returning to Jean-Luc Picard and to explore new dimensions within him.

In his latest tweet, Sir Patrick spoke about his connection with Picard. ""During these past years, it has been humbling to hear stories about how The Next Generation brought people comfort, saw them through difficult periods in their lives or how the example of Jean-Luc inspired so many to follow in his footsteps, pursuing science, exploration and leadership. ""I feel I'm ready to return to him for the same reason - to research and experience what comforting and reforming light he might shine on these often very dark times. ""I look forward to working with our brilliant creative team as we endeavour to bring a fresh, unexpected and pertinent story to life once more."""
2018-08-05,"International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said ""intransigence"" from the European Union is pushing Britain towards a no-deal Brexit.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180805230447/https://news.sky.com/story/eu-pushing-britain-towards-no-deal-brexit-says-liam-fox-11461723,"With less than eight months until Britain quits the bloc, the prominent Brexiteer put the odds of the UK leaving the EU without agreeing a deal over their future relationship at ""60-40"". Mr Fox said he believed the risk of a no-deal scenario had increased, pinning the blame on the European Commission and Brussels' chief negotiator Michel Barnier. ""I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal,"" he told the Sunday Times. ""We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic well-being of the people of Europe then it's a bureaucrats' Brexit - not a people's Brexit - (and) then there is only going to be one outcome."" It was up to the EU whether it wanted to put ""ideological purity"" ahead of the real economy, Mr Fox said. He said Mr Barnier had dismissed the UK's proposals in the Chequers plan thrashed out by Theresa May and the cabinet simply because ""we have never done it before"". The government has admitted its proposals are unprecedented, but Mr Fox said Mr Barnier's response ""makes the chance of no deal greater"". Mrs May held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, cutting short her holiday to visit his summer retreat. And ministers including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have also engaged in diplomatic activity in Europe in recent days as the government seeks to deal directly with individual governments in an effort to keep the Chequers plan alive. If Britain fails to agree the terms of its divorce with the EU and leaves without even a transition agreement to smooth its exit, it would revert to trading under World Trade Organisation rules in March 2019. On Friday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the chances of a no-deal Brexit had become ""uncomfortably high""."
2018-08-05,Do you remember where you were in March 2009?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180805230447/https://news.sky.com/story/do-you-remember-where-you-were-in-march-2009-11457415,"I do. I remember heading along to the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street as the financial crisis and recession raged, and witnessing the most dramatic change in interest rates in modern history as the Monetary Policy Committee slashed them to 0.5%. I remember just how tense the mood was inside the Bank. There was a sense that they had had to throw out the textbooks and begin again from first principles, as they tried to work out how the economy would function with near-zero rates. And as I remember it, no one there even dreamt that the cost of borrowing would have remained at or below those pre-crisis levels for as long as they did. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates above their crisis lows for the first time in nearly a decade. But now, at last, the period of crisis-era rates is coming to an end. The Bank has raised borrowing costs to 0.75%. It is not a big increase by any means. And it still leaves Bank rate well below ""normal"" levels (which these days are closer to 2.5% than 5%, according to the Bank). All the same, as the Bank took its decision today, the mood could hardly have been more different from those crisis days. There was a slightly surreal absence of drama in the air. Why? Mainly because this decision - highly symbolic as it might be - was actually unusually uncontroversial. Every one of the nine MPC members voted for it - the first time there has been unanimity for a rate increase in more than a decade. The move was widely anticipated in financial markets. And the Bank said that while it would take a tiny bit off economic growth, it was unlikely to leave a major dent in the economy. Many people within the economy fraternity have spent the past decade or so fretting about what higher interest rates would do to households. Now it has happened why is everyone so relaxed about it? In part, it is because that is precisely what the Bank and its governor, Mark Carney, had planned for. So much of their effort over the past few years, from forward guidance to speeches on this matter, has been aimed at trying to ready the country for the fact that borrowing costs would have to eventually return to normal. The message seems to have been received. On the surface, the statistics suggest that the country should be able to absorb the extra costs. For households which are net savers, the consequent increase in savings rates, after nearly a decade of near-zero returns, should come as an immense relief. There are more mortgage borrowers than ever before on fixed-rate products, which means they will not be immediately affected by the rate rise - though it will likely push up their mortgage costs when they come to renew. In short, no one seems to be panicking that this rate increase will cause profound damage. But there are some reasons for caution. First off, even though the majority of households are well placed to deal with these extra costs, there are small pockets of over-extended families for whom even a small increase in interest rates will mean the difference between being able to afford their mortgage and not. There will be some borrowers who have become so accustomed to rock-bottom interest rates that any increase will cause an unexpected financial jolt. More broadly, this is not your common-or-garden rate hike. Normally when the Bank increases the cost of borrowing it is because the economy is doing very well - growth is tearing away, threatening to take inflation with it. In this case, the economy is expected to grow by only 1.5% this year. And while unemployment is at record lows (indeed for the first time on record the Bank thinks the jobless rate will drop below 4% this year), wage growth is still well below its pre-crisis levels. The real reason the Bank is raising interest rates is that with unemployment low and productivity also very weak, the economy simply cannot grow much faster without generating a bit more inflation. Finally, for all the serenity at the Bank, there is a tacit acknowledgement that all its plans could be disrupted by Brexit. If there is no deal on Brexit and the economy faces a crunch next year, the Bank may be forced again to cut rates. If it does so, this increase may start to look at best like an insurance policy; at worst like a mistake. But these risks remain close to imponderable. In the meantime it is worth reflecting on an important moment in UK economic policy. For the first time since the crisis, the UK is starting to drag itself slowly towards monetary policy normality."
2018-08-05,The NHS has been warned it risks breaking the law if it does not offer transgender patients access to fertility services before they begin their transitioning treatment.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180805230447/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-threatened-with-legal-action-over-transgender-fertility-policy-11461896,"In a damning letter, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) threatened to take legal action against the health service over its ""outdated"" policy, which it said discriminated against the transgender community. The written correspondence - which is the first step towards a judicial review - told the NHS it should offer patients the chance to store their eggs or sperm so they are not left having to choose between essential medical treatment and being able to have their own biological children. The treatment they need - which can lead to a loss of fertility - is for gender dysphoria, which causes people to suffer discomfort or distress over a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. Individual clinical commissioning groups currently decide whether to allow eggs or sperm to be stored - and the EHRC claims that many choose not to for transgender patients. EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: ""Our laws and our values protect those who seek treatment for gender dysphoria. This means that where appropriate, treatment should be made available in order to ensure that access to health services is free of discrimination. ""A choice between treatment for gender dysphoria and the chance to start a family is not a real choice. ""We have asked NHS England to reflect on the true breadth of their statutory mandate and the impact on the transgender community of these outdated policies."" An NHS England spokesman has dismissed the outcry as a case of ""misplaced fire"" - and pointed the finger of blame towards health ministers. The spokesman said decisions taken on the commissioning of services were ""based on advice from an independently chaired panel of health executives and patient representatives, using a process set out in primary legislation"". But the NHS has been told it must recognise the impact such decisions could have on patients, most of whom start their treatment during their teenage years. One mother of a 14-year-old transgender boy - who did not want to be identified - told The Observer the idea of starting a family was far from the mind at that age. ""It isn't realistic to expect a child to want to be able to have their own children,"" she said. ""So it's up to the parents to say 'we need to preserve that option for them' so that at least then they have the choice."""

A body was discovered by police investigating her disappearance around midday on Saturday and is yet to be formally identified ahead of a post-mortem. A 32-year-old man, who was previously released on conditional bail, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Two other men, aged 28 and 60, have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender On Friday, Samantha's sister Gemma made a tearful appeal for anyone with information about the disappearance to come forward. She said: ""We miss you very much, we need you home where you belong. ""Samantha is a fantastic woman and friend, she's warm, friendly, loyal, kind and generous with a great sense of humour and whoever she is with will always make their times together fun. ""Samantha was determined to become a midwife from a young age and succeeded. ""All of Samantha's work friends describe her as an amazing midwife. She's caring harmless and gentle, she's selfless and would do anything for anyone before herself."" Images of Ms Eastwood's distinctive Radley purse, which is her only missing possession, have been released in the hope someone may have come across the item. Her bank cards have not been used. Police are investigating reports of screaming coming from Ms Eastwood's home in the hours after she was last seen. She was reported missing by colleagues when she didn't turn up for her shift on Friday evening at 7pm."

In an angry response, the US president tweeted: ""Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do."" He concluded the post by writing ""I like Mike"" - which appears to be a reference to former NBA star Michael Jordan. CNN anchor Don Lemon replied to Mr Trump's tweet, asking: ""Who's the real dummy? A man who puts kids in classrooms or one who puts kids in cages? #BeBest"". The CNN interview aired on Monday, after James opened his school for disadvantaged children in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. During the interview, James and Lemon toured the school and discussed sports, politics and race relations. Lemon asked James if he would consider running for president, to which the sports star said: ""Let's see first"". In a segment aired on CNN, James was asked if he would ever sit down with Mr Trump. ""I would never sit across from him,"" he said. Melania Trump also waded into the disagreement the next day, praising James for doing ""good things on behalf of our next generation"". Her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said: ""The First Lady encourages everyone to have an open dialogue about issues facing children today. ""As you know, Mrs Trump has travelled the country and world talking to children about their well-being, healthy living, and the importance of responsible online behaviour with her Be Best initiative. ""Her platform centres around visiting organisations, hospitals and schools, and she would be open to visiting the I Promise School in Akron."" Last year, Mr Trump rescinded an invitation for NBA champions Golden State Warriors to visit the White House after team captain Stephen Curry questioned the billionaire's presidency. Attacking Mr Trump, James later tweeted: ""U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!"" Despite this, there hasn't always been bad blood between Mr Trump and the three-time NBA champion. In 2013, Mr Trump tweeted: ""Lebron is a great player and a great guy!"""

It also features several tributes, with Michelle Bold describing Teya as a ""beautiful, feisty little whirlwind"". Cheshire Police are yet to name her and formal identification is still to take place, but her family have been informed. The force said they were being supported by specialist officers. One resident, who did not want to be named, said the area where the body was found was poorly maintained.

According to The Woodland Trust, the area is popular with schools, anglers and dog walkers, and was designated as a nature reserve in 2001."

The Metropolitan Police said: ""He was not carrying any identification and due to his poor state of health police are keen to trace his family as soon as possible."" He was wearing a camouflage T-shirt with ""Now or never, no regrets, past/present/future"" written on it. Scotland Yard added: ""He has two distinctive tattoos on his left hand and one on his lower right leg that are faded black in colour.""The tattoo on the leg appears to be ""tribal"", while the one on his hand resembles a dragon. The London Ambulance Service was alerted at around 7.20pm on the night of the rescue by reports of a man in the Thames, police said. He was rescued from the river by the RNLI with the help of passers-by and airlifted to hospital. Detective Sergeant Samantha Batchelor said: ""We have exhausted all our lines of enquiry to identify this man and we are hoping with the release of his image a friend or family member will be able to come forward to tell us who he is."" The picture showed a brown-haired man using breathing apparatus in a hospital bed. The man is described as a white male, dark in complexion, and of medium build.

In a Twitter post the group said the plan was to fly two drones loaded with C4 explosives over the presidential box but government snipers downed the drones before they could carry out their plan of assassinating the president and his wife. ""We have shown they are vulnerable, it was not achieved today but it is a matter of time,"" they warned. The group was formed by police helicopter pilot and actor Oscar Perez, who was shot dead in a shoot-out with six colleagues in January for protesting against the government. The protest involved throwing non-lethal stun grenades from a helicopter and firing blank cartridges near government buildings. Seven journalists from state television stations VIVOplay and TVVenezuela, who were filming Saturday's speech, were quickly taken away with their equipment, other journalists in the capital said. They were released about five hours after the incident. After the explosions, the Caracas fire service said there was a building on fire in central Caracas and firefighters near the scene have disputed the information minister's version of events. Three officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incident was actually a gas tank explosion inside a nearby apartment. Smoke could be seen coming out of a building window. Mr Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez after his death in 2013, plunging the country into severe economic crisis which has resulted in malnutrition, hyperinflation and mass emigration. Venezuela's once thriving socialist economy collapsed after oil prices plunged in 2014. Despite the desperate situation, Mr Maduro was recently elected to a new term in office."

The agent is said to have hacked into the dating profile of an RAF airwoman to fool several servicemen - and it is known to have been successful on at least one of them. In an internal memo obtained by the newspaper, the air force's principal security adviser warned about the risk of ""online social engineering"" and ""online reconnaissance against social media profiles"". The note said servicemen could be targeted by ""skilled and convincing operatives"" aiming to gather confidential information through ""friendship, sympathy and/or obligation"". While it is not known who was responsible, the memo notes that UK military policy and capabilities are ""significant targets of interest for hostile state and non-state actors"". The report said the Tinder sting took place just weeks after four of the F-35 jets arrived at RAF Marham in Norfolk from the US in early June, and Prince Charles was given the chance to sit in the cockpit himself during a recent visit. The RAF has strongly denied that the secrets apparently given up were to do with F-35 jets new aircraft. A spokesman said: ""No F-35 secrets have been stolen, as the (Mail on Sunday) headline inaccurately claims. No F-35 information of a sensitive or classified nature has been disclosed via a dating site. ""The member of RAF personnel involved is not even associated with the F-35 programme."""

2018-08-05,"Britain's shooting estates face losing millions of pounds because of a ""catastrophic"" shortage of grouse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180805230447/https://news.sky.com/story/grouse-shortage-to-cost-rural-economy-millions-11461716,"Ahead of the ""Glorious 12th"" (of August) - the start of the grouse shooting season - numbers of the bird have been heavily depleted by recent weather conditions on the moors, industry leaders told Sky News. They said that on some estates grouse stocks are at their lowest level in living memory. It has prompted widespread cancellations of shooting days on estates across Scotland and the north of England, at a hefty cost to the rural economy. Wilson Young, the owner of Eskdale Shooting Services, which organises grouse shoots, told Sky News: ""We're a relatively small industry but we are operating in industrial deserts. ""In the Scottish Borders I think we are the biggest employers in our area. This year it's pretty catastrophic."" Grouse numbers vary across different parts of the country. Their low numbers, generally, have been attributed to a number of factors, principally the extreme temperatures of a hard winter followed by a hot summer which have affected the quality of heather, their main source of food. Dr Adam Smith, Scotland director of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, told Sky News: ""We're just getting our grouse counts in, about three quarters of them are done and it's a pretty consistently low picture. ""We're seeing only about 90% of the adult birds that we saw in 2017 but, probably more importantly, we're only seeing about two thirds of the young birds that we saw in 2017 so it's a marked drop in production. ""It's the first time in a very long time that I've seen the combination of heather being freeze-dried, blasted almost, during the winter time and then baked dry during the summer. ""So, we've had extremely poor quality food up on the hills for the red grouse population particularly, which relies on that as a primary food source. ""Mums, the hens, were in a poor condition when they laid their eggs probably so we saw small clutch sizes and the chicks then struggled to find a consistent food source through the rest of the year."" The Glorious 12th is a lucrative fixture in the UK's rural calendar. This year it falls on a Sunday, so the grouse shooting season has been put back to Monday 13 August. The four-month grouse season attracts shooting parties from around the world. Grouse stocks are still being counted but, already, the shooting diary has been decimated. Kenneth Stephen, of the Scottish Gamekeeper's Association, told Sky News: ""Obviously, we're going to bring in less visitors this year so the trickle-down economics are not going to be what we were expecting. ""However, surveys last year showed that grouse estates bring in £23m a year, whether a grouse is shot or not, so that investment will remain."" The absence of grouse will be felt not just on the moors, but also on restaurant menus. Peter McKenna, who runs The Gannet restaurant in Glasgow, said: ""One of the best flavours in Scottish cuisine is grouse. ""It is completely unique, there's nothing else that tastes like it and, for me, it tastes like the Scottish countryside. ""It's quite disappointing this year not to be able to offer our guests a real true taste of Scotland."""

Staffordshire Police have now confirmed that the body is believed to be that of the 28-year-old, with formal identification and a post mortem to take place later. In a statement, her family asked for their privacy to be respected at ""this terrible time"". ""We would like to say thank you to all the people who followed Samantha's story and tried their best to help,"" they added.

Mr Watson admitted ""it sometimes feels like people have been calling for me to stand down from day one"", but added that he never saw it happening ""for standing up for people who are facing prejudice and hate"". On Saturday, he warned the party will ""disappear into a vortex of eternal shame and embarrassment"" unless it resolves its difficulties over anti-Semitism. He told The Observer that Labour should adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism in full - something Mr Corbyn is still refusing to do. And he suggested investigations into MPs Dame Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin be dropped. Dame Margaret called Mr Corbyn a ""racist"" and ""anti-Semitic"", while Mr Austin had a ""heated discussion"" with Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery, one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies. The comments sparked fury among Labour activists, who turned the hashtag #ResignWatson into a top trending topic on Twitter as they vented their anger and called for the deputy leader's resignation. Aaron Bastani, who runs left-wing website Novara Media, said: ""Tom Watson the political mastermind who thought leaking the Labour election manifesto would be the final blow in removing Corbyn. ""Does he ever actually talk about, you know, party policies?"" In response, Mr Watson tweeted: ""This is a lie. And damaging. Please remove it."" Later, Mr Bastani tweeted: ""I'm told by multiple sources that Tom Watson did interview attacking the leadership because he didn't get speaking slot he wanted at conference."" Former foreign secretary David Miliband offered Mr Watson his support, saying: ""Thank you ⁦Tom Watson for recognising the gravity of Labour's situation. ""Power reveals. In this case it has revealed myopia and sectarianism at the top, betraying Labour's history and failing the needs of the country."""
2018-08-05,Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has dramatically triggered a civil war at the top of the party by publicly declaring war on Jeremy Corbyn over anti-Semitism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180805230447/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-faces-eternal-shame-over-anti-semitism-deputy-leader-tom-watson-says-11461673,"Just 24 hours after the Labour leader attempted to calm the row which has raged for weeks, Mr Watson declared that Labour faces ""eternal shame"" over anti-Semitism. And the deputy leader openly put himself on collision course with Mr Corbyn by demanding that the party drop its investigations into Dame Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin. He also challenged Mr Corbyn's authority by calling on him to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism, a move backed by Labour MPs but resisted by the party's national executive. Mr Watson's declaration of war against Mr Corbyn and his left-wing supporters in the party came in a hard-hitting interview in The Observer which will delight many Labour MPs but incense party activists. He said: ""This is one of those moments when we have to take a long, hard look at ourselves, stand up for what is right and present the party as fit to lead the nation - or disappear into a vortex of eternal shame and embarrassment. ""I think it is very important that we all work to de-escalate this disagreement, and I think it starts with dropping the investigations into Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin. ""I have frequently had very difficult conversations with both Margaret and Ian but what I understand is that your critics are not your enemies. ""On an issue that is so dear to them, I think people are very, very concerned that these investigations should be dropped quickly."" On the need to adopt the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, Mr Watson said: ""We should deal with this swiftly and move on. We can't have this dragging on throughout the summer. ""I have made no secret of the fact that... we should adopt the full IHRA definition and should do it without delay."" Mr Watson hit out the day after Mr Corbyn acknowledged in an article for The Guardian: ""I do accept that there is a real problem that Labour is working to overcome."" He added: ""People who dish out anti-Semitic poison need to understand: You do not do it in my name. You are not my supporters and have no place in our movement."" Mr Watson's attack on Mr Corbyn also came just hours after Tom Harris, a former Labour MP and junior minister under Tony Blair, announced he was resigning from the Labour Party. By publicly backing Margaret Hodge, who is embroiled in a bitter disciplinary row with the Labour leadership after calling Mr Corbyn a ""racist"" and ""anti-Semitic"", Mr Watson is supporting the views of many Labour MPs. The politician seeks to address the storm of criticism aimed at him over failing to deal decisively with anti-Semitism in Labour He is also close friends with Mr Austin, who is MP for Dudley North next door to Mr Watson's West Bromwich East constituency, and like Mr Austin is a long-term ally of Gordon Brown. Mr Austin, who like Dame Margaret lost relatives in the Holocaust, is being investigated after complaining to Labour Party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery that the party under Mr Corbyn was becoming a ""sewer"" because of anti-Semitism. Mr Watson has already made public his loathing for Peter Willsman, the left-wing activist whose rant at a meeting of Labour's national executive on 17 July was recorded and published by the Jewish Chronicle last week. When the recording emerged, Mr Watson tweeted: ""For the avoidance of doubt: Peter Willsman is and always has been a loud mouthed bully. He disgusts me."""

Currently, would-be donors must indicate their intentions on the NHS organ donor register, or grieving families must make the decision if a patient's wish to donate is unknown. Jackie Doyle-Price, parliamentary under-secretary of state for mental health and inequalities, said: ""Organ donation saves lives. ""We believe that by making these changes, we can save as many as 700 more lives every year. ""But organ donation remains a gift. ""I want to encourage people who wish to give life in the event of their death to take the time to record their wishes and discuss it with their family."" The news has been welcomed by health charities, who say it will only be effective if it's part of a wider strategy to tackle to donor shortage. Some 411 people in the UK died on the transplant waiting list in 2017. Fiona Loud, policy director at Kidney Care UK, said: ""Patients are dying every day while they wait for a transplant, so we welcome the commitment to change our system so more lives can be transformed. We believe the soft opt-out is the right thing to do, but it is not the only thing to do. ""The change in the law must be accompanied by a comprehensive awareness and education programme, and we need to ensure there is capacity across the NHS so that these precious organs are not wasted."" Under-18s, people with limited mental capacity and others who have not lived in England for at least a year prior to their death will be exempt from the scheme. Those who do not wish to donate can record this on the NHS register either online, by phone or on an app to be released by the end of the year. A 12-month transition period will pave the way for the launch. The legislation, which was introduced in parliament in July 2017, will return to the House of Commons in the autumn."

Mr van Straubenzee, 30, was one of Harry's ushers at his wedding in Windsor on 19 May. Returning the favour, the groom asked Harry to be his best man on his big day. He became friends with Harry when they both attended Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire and is part of the ""Glosse Posse"" - the royal's close circle of friends from Gloucestershire. Harry and Meghan arrived at the church together, both wearing sunglasses as temperatures soared to 28C (82.4F). Also rumoured to be in attendance at the wedding was the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as William is also good friends with the van Straubenzee brothers. The groom's older brother Thomas is godfather to Princess Charlotte. Princess Eugenie was seen outside the church with her fiance Jack Brooksbank, who she is set to marry on 12 October. The Duchess of Sussex happily waved to the cameras camped outside the Surrey church, wearing a navy colour block pleated dress by Club Monaco with a navy fascinator. She was pictured chatting and smiling with some female guests before the bride arrived at the church, who waved to the waiting crowds and photographers in her wedding dress. Meghan, who is spending her first birthday as a member of the Royal Family, was reportedly whisked away by Harry to Botswana, Africa, for her birthday last year. She married the sixth-in-line to the throne during a ceremony watched by 13.1 million which was praised for combining tradition with modernity and diversity. Sir Elton John, who performed at the couple's reception, said: ""To have a black gospel choir, a multiracial bride, a black cellist, who was wonderful, a preacher - it felt like a party, and it felt like progress had been made."""
2018-08-05,"It's not known whether Warren East, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, has ever met Jes Staley or Ross McEwan, his opposite numbers at Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland respectively.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180805230447/https://news.sky.com/story/rolls-royce-puts-its-legal-wrangles-behind-it-11457541,"Yet he has more in common with the pair than meets the eye - and not just because the three men each publish their company's half year results this week. For, just as Messrs Staley and McEwan have spent the last few years restructuring their banks and dealing with litigation for past misconduct, so has Mr East. On becoming chief executive of one of Britain's premier manufacturing companies, just over three years ago, Mr East was immediately forced to grapple with legacy issues. These included reaching a settlement with the Serious Fraud Office, the US Justice Department and their Brazilian counterpart over accusations of paying bribes that went back several decades. Like his peers in the banking sector, he also had to take an axe to costs, with 4,600 job losses announced in June coming on top of a previous clear-out of management roles in 2016. And, like the banks, Mr East had to decide whether Rolls should pull out of some activities. Accordingly, he decided to refocus the company on the aerospace, defence and power sectors, offloading its loss-making commercial marine business last month for £500m and L'Orange, which provides injection technology to engine makers, for £610m in April. With those legacy issues now largely dealt with, it has felt in recent months as if Mr East and his colleagues can start looking to the future, which is borne out in today's figures. Yes, the company has reported a pre-tax loss of £1.3bn for the six months to the end of June, compared with a profit in the same period last year of £1.4bn. But that was entirely due to a one-off exceptional charge of £554m that relates to the cost of sorting out problems with Rolls' Trent 1000 engines between now and 2022. These problems have led to dozens of Boeing 787 Dreamliners being grounded while components are inspected and repaired where necessary. The Trent 1000 issue is undoubtedly serious. Mr East apologised today for the disruption to Rolls' customers. He said: ""If you are a customer who has a large fleet of Rolls-Royce-powered 787s, then there has been an unacceptable level of disruption. ""However, we are working very constructively with each and every one of those customers on a customer-by-customer, almost an engine-by-engine basis so that we have the situation with each customer's engine plotted out over the next 12 to 18 months. ""In spite of the disruption caused, our customers are being incredibly supportive and by working together we are minimising disruption for those customers."" He said Rolls had now passed the peak of grounding aircraft whose engines were being repaired and said long-term fixes required to the engines were being made. But the bigger picture is that genuine progress is being made at Rolls-Royce. The business grew in the first six months of the year by more than expected and the company said today that operating profits for the year will be better than previously indicated - which is why the shares are up strongly. Sales on an underlying basis, which strips out divisions like commercial marine that have been sold, were up 16% to £6.7bn while underlying operating profits rose by 183% to £146m. That reflects the fact that Rolls has ramped up engine production. Civil aerospace, the most important part of the business, saw large engine production up by 24%. The new Pearl 15 engine, for business jets, was also launched in the period while the Trent 7000 engine, showcased recently on the new Airbus A330neo at the Farnborough International Airshow, has also received certification. All in all, it means there are now 6,100 Rolls engines powering aircraft around the world, while the flying hours in which those engines are in use has also increased by 20%. That bodes well for future revenues for servicing those aircraft - the after-market is a key contributor to Rolls's cash flow - while Stephen Daintith, the chief financial officer, also noted with satisfaction that increasing numbers of customers are buying spare engines. The power systems division, which makes engines, also grew. So, too, did the defence division. Rolls is a supplier to the F35 fighter jet project and also is a member of 'Team Tempest', the new UK fighter jet project. The balance sheet has also been cleared up, with the group moving from having net debt of £305m at the end of 2017 to having net cash of £165m by the end of June, while the disposals already announced will bring in more than £1bn. Costs are also being taken out of the business. Functions that were previously carried out in each division are being brought together into an organisation called Group Business Services which, Mr East said, would be saving Rolls £400m a year by the end of the decade. Rolls has also established an 'Innovation Hub' - something a company that spends as much on research and development as it does perhaps should have done in the past. That means more thinking deeply about the future as Rolls aspires to become, in its words, 'the leading industrial technology company'. As Mr East put it: ""We have got a lot of things on our plates at the moment, in terms of restructuring, Trent 1000 and so on. But the future doesn't just happen - we have to make it happen…and we have an eye on the future."" To that end, Rolls is preparing for a world in which there is more electrification, it is doing more with digital and it is striving to modernise its production, for example, by using a new robot it has developed in partnership with Nottingham University. Investors love to see a business that is being led decisively and which is thinking about how it will grow in future. After an awful few years, it genuinely looks as if Rolls ticks both of those boxes."

She and her pilot Donald Campbell were supposed to rest forever in darkness on the bed of a lake in Cumbria's Lake District. But today Bluebird rose from the dead. Thanks to an audacious plan to find, raise and rebuild her she thrilled locals and tourists on the Isle of Bute in Scotland where she has been relaunched. To those old enough to remember the haunting images of the hydroplane flip over in the air and plunge into Coniston Water in 1967 the ""rebirth"" is a marvel almost beyond imagination. Bill Smith is the man who led the project to raise and reconstruct Bluebird. After years punctuated by hurdle after hurdle, he and his team of volunteers can savour the elation of seeing her in trials on Loch Fad. ""Now I'm excited!"" he told Sky News as he walked ashore from an observation boat. ""That worked! It was like a bullet from a gun."" Ted Walsh, the trials pilot who sat in the same seat in which Donald Campbell died, approached his historic task with apparent calm. He said: ""I try not to think of the history too much. I have to focus on the technical side. ""Of course I respect and honour the memory of Donald Campbell but the best way I can do that is to help make sure Bluebird performs as she should."" Sky News has tracked Bluebird's progress for more than fifteen years. As a boy I remember seeing the Coniston crash and as a reporter I have learned that you follow some stories - but others follow you. You couldn't forget them even if you wanted to and they become more than just stories. Once they're under your skin it's nigh on impossible to let them go. And I know now I never will. So imagine how Donald Campbell's daughter Gina felt watching from the shoreline of Loch Fad. The last time she saw Bluebird move at speed was on newsreel footage featuring the crash that killed her dad. Today she saw a spray of water reminiscent for a fleeting moment of that which enveloped the jetboat as she plunged beneath the surface in 1967. How great that she got to see Bluebird rise again in all her magnificent glory."

These included reaching a settlement with the Serious Fraud Office, the US Justice Department and their Brazilian counterpart over accusations of paying bribes that went back several decades. Like his peers in the banking sector, he also had to take an axe to costs, with 4,600 job losses announced in June coming on top of a previous clear-out of management roles in 2016. And, like the banks, Mr East had to decide whether Rolls should pull out of some activities. Accordingly, he decided to refocus the company on the aerospace, defence and power sectors, offloading its loss-making commercial marine business last month for £500m and L'Orange, which provides injection technology to engine makers, for £610m in April. With those legacy issues now largely dealt with, it has felt in recent months as if Mr East and his colleagues can start looking to the future, which is borne out in today's figures. Yes, the company has reported a pre-tax loss of £1.3bn for the six months to the end of June, compared with a profit in the same period last year of £1.4bn. But that was entirely due to a one-off exceptional charge of £554m that relates to the cost of sorting out problems with Rolls' Trent 1000 engines between now and 2022. These problems have led to dozens of Boeing 787 Dreamliners being grounded while components are inspected and repaired where necessary. The Trent 1000 issue is undoubtedly serious. Mr East apologised today for the disruption to Rolls' customers. He said: ""If you are a customer who has a large fleet of Rolls-Royce-powered 787s, then there has been an unacceptable level of disruption. ""However, we are working very constructively with each and every one of those customers on a customer-by-customer, almost an engine-by-engine basis so that we have the situation with each customer's engine plotted out over the next 12 to 18 months. ""In spite of the disruption caused, our customers are being incredibly supportive and by working together we are minimising disruption for those customers."" He said Rolls had now passed the peak of grounding aircraft whose engines were being repaired and said long-term fixes required to the engines were being made. But the bigger picture is that genuine progress is being made at Rolls-Royce. The business grew in the first six months of the year by more than expected and the company said today that operating profits for the year will be better than previously indicated - which is why the shares are up strongly. Sales on an underlying basis, which strips out divisions like commercial marine that have been sold, were up 16% to £6.7bn while underlying operating profits rose by 183% to £146m. That reflects the fact that Rolls has ramped up engine production. Civil aerospace, the most important part of the business, saw large engine production up by 24%. The new Pearl 15 engine, for business jets, was also launched in the period while the Trent 7000 engine, showcased recently on the new Airbus A330neo at the Farnborough International Airshow, has also received certification. All in all, it means there are now 6,100 Rolls engines powering aircraft around the world, while the flying hours in which those engines are in use has also increased by 20%. That bodes well for future revenues for servicing those aircraft - the after-market is a key contributor to Rolls's cash flow - while Stephen Daintith, the chief financial officer, also noted with satisfaction that increasing numbers of customers are buying spare engines. The power systems division, which makes engines, also grew. So, too, did the defence division. Rolls is a supplier to the F35 fighter jet project and also is a member of 'Team Tempest', the new UK fighter jet project. The balance sheet has also been cleared up, with the group moving from having net debt of £305m at the end of 2017 to having net cash of £165m by the end of June, while the disposals already announced will bring in more than £1bn. Costs are also being taken out of the business. Functions that were previously carried out in each division are being brought together into an organisation called Group Business Services which, Mr East said, would be saving Rolls £400m a year by the end of the decade. Rolls has also established an 'Innovation Hub' - something a company that spends as much on research and development as it does perhaps should have done in the past. That means more thinking deeply about the future as Rolls aspires to become, in its words, 'the leading industrial technology company'. As Mr East put it: ""We have got a lot of things on our plates at the moment, in terms of restructuring, Trent 1000 and so on. But the future doesn't just happen - we have to make it happen…and we have an eye on the future."" To that end, Rolls is preparing for a world in which there is more electrification, it is doing more with digital and it is striving to modernise its production, for example, by using a new robot it has developed in partnership with Nottingham University. Investors love to see a business that is being led decisively and which is thinking about how it will grow in future. After an awful few years, it genuinely looks as if Rolls ticks both of those boxes."

He told the BBC: ""Take the whip from him. Why not? He's not a super human being, he's a member of the party. ""The party chairman, the prime minister has the right to take the whip... that's the thing I'd like to see."" His comments come as Theresa May backs calls for Mr Johnson to apologise. But he has so far defied mounting calls for him to retract his comments. The prime minister said the remarks ""clearly caused offence"" as she told him to say sorry. Mrs May said: ""Some of the terms Boris used describing people's appearance obviously have offended. ""What's important is do we believe people should have the right to practise their religion and, in the case of women and the burka and niqab, to choose how they dress. ""I believe women should be able to choose how they dress."" A source close to the former foreign secretary told Sky News it was ""ridiculous"" his views were being ""attacked"". They said Britain must not ""fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on serious issues"". The source added: ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" The controversy began when Mr Johnson wrote a piece for the Daily Telegraph on Monday, in which he argued against following Denmark's lead in banning the burka. But he made several comparisons between the covering worn by some women, saying it made them look like a ""bank robber"" or a ""letter box"". Mr Johnson also revealed he would ""feel entitled"" to ask a woman wearing the burka to remove it if she came to his constituency office. He concluded: ""In Britain today there is only a tiny, tiny minority of women who wear these odd bits of headgear. ""One day, I am sure, they will go."" The comment sparked a backlash from senior Conservatives, including Brandon Lewis, the party's chairman. He revealed on Tuesday he had asked Mr Johnson to apologise. Baroness Warsi, the first Muslim cabinet minister and a former Tory party vice chair, also told Sky News that Mr Johnson was using the issue as a ""political football"" to ""increase his poll ratings"". ""I hope he will be disciplined but I'm not holding my breath.""Baroness Warsi responds to Boris Johnson comparing Muslim women in burkas to bank robbers.https://t.co/wzrV6QVWAY pic.twitter.com/sypJOVq2Ut She said: ""Mr Johnson is making yet another leadership bid, and he will say and do whatever needs to be said and done to make that as successful as he can. ""I hope he will be disciplined but I'm not holding my breath. ""Sadly this is not the first time that such comments have been made within my party."" Baroness Warsi added that when Conservative politicians made ""crass"" comments about British Muslims, it ""doesn't diminish their political status, it actually increases their political success"". Conservative MP Nadine Dories responded on Twitter: ""Any clothing a woman is forced to wear which hides both her beauty and her bruises should be banned."" She added: ""Boris didn't go far enough."""
2018-08-08,Do you remember where you were in March 2009?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/do-you-remember-where-you-were-in-march-2009-11457415,"I do. I remember heading along to the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street as the financial crisis and recession raged, and witnessing the most dramatic change in interest rates in modern history as the Monetary Policy Committee slashed them to 0.5%. I remember just how tense the mood was inside the Bank. There was a sense that they had had to throw out the textbooks and begin again from first principles, as they tried to work out how the economy would function with near-zero rates. And as I remember it, no one there even dreamt that the cost of borrowing would have remained at or below those pre-crisis levels for as long as they did. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates above their crisis lows for the first time in nearly a decade. But now, at last, the period of crisis-era rates is coming to an end. The Bank has raised borrowing costs to 0.75%. It is not a big increase by any means. And it still leaves Bank rate well below ""normal"" levels (which these days are closer to 2.5% than 5%, according to the Bank). All the same, as the Bank took its decision today, the mood could hardly have been more different from those crisis days. There was a slightly surreal absence of drama in the air. Why? Mainly because this decision - highly symbolic as it might be - was actually unusually uncontroversial. Every one of the nine MPC members voted for it - the first time there has been unanimity for a rate increase in more than a decade. The move was widely anticipated in financial markets. And the Bank said that while it would take a tiny bit off economic growth, it was unlikely to leave a major dent in the economy. Many people within the economy fraternity have spent the past decade or so fretting about what higher interest rates would do to households. Now it has happened why is everyone so relaxed about it? In part, it is because that is precisely what the Bank and its governor, Mark Carney, had planned for. So much of their effort over the past few years, from forward guidance to speeches on this matter, has been aimed at trying to ready the country for the fact that borrowing costs would have to eventually return to normal. The message seems to have been received. On the surface, the statistics suggest that the country should be able to absorb the extra costs. For households which are net savers, the consequent increase in savings rates, after nearly a decade of near-zero returns, should come as an immense relief. There are more mortgage borrowers than ever before on fixed-rate products, which means they will not be immediately affected by the rate rise - though it will likely push up their mortgage costs when they come to renew. In short, no one seems to be panicking that this rate increase will cause profound damage. But there are some reasons for caution. First off, even though the majority of households are well placed to deal with these extra costs, there are small pockets of over-extended families for whom even a small increase in interest rates will mean the difference between being able to afford their mortgage and not. There will be some borrowers who have become so accustomed to rock-bottom interest rates that any increase will cause an unexpected financial jolt. More broadly, this is not your common-or-garden rate hike. Normally when the Bank increases the cost of borrowing it is because the economy is doing very well - growth is tearing away, threatening to take inflation with it. In this case, the economy is expected to grow by only 1.5% this year. And while unemployment is at record lows (indeed for the first time on record the Bank thinks the jobless rate will drop below 4% this year), wage growth is still well below its pre-crisis levels. The real reason the Bank is raising interest rates is that with unemployment low and productivity also very weak, the economy simply cannot grow much faster without generating a bit more inflation. Finally, for all the serenity at the Bank, there is a tacit acknowledgement that all its plans could be disrupted by Brexit. If there is no deal on Brexit and the economy faces a crunch next year, the Bank may be forced again to cut rates. If it does so, this increase may start to look at best like an insurance policy; at worst like a mistake. But these risks remain close to imponderable. In the meantime it is worth reflecting on an important moment in UK economic policy. For the first time since the crisis, the UK is starting to drag itself slowly towards monetary policy normality."
2018-08-08,A petition that could force a sitting DUP MP to fight a by-election opens on Wednesday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/ian-paisley-recall-petition-opens-to-remove-north-antrim-mp-11465339,"Signatures can begin being collected from 9am to ""recall"" Ian Paisley. The North Antrim MP was suspended from parliament until mid-October for accepting undisclosed family holidays taken in 2013, funded by the Sri Lankan government. In 2014, he wrote to then-prime minister David Cameron to lobby against the UN setting up an investigation into alleged human rights abuses in the country. Constituents will now decide his future, by choosing whether to support a petition that would trigger a by-election. It is open for six weeks, from 8 August to 19 September. Three centres have opened - in Ballymoney, Ballymena and Ballycastle - for people on the electoral roll and aged 18 or over to add their signature. A total of 7,543 names are needed - 10% of the electorate - to oust him as MP. Mr Paisley has vowed to fight a by-election if one is called. He has previously apologised for an ""unintentional failure"" to register the hospitality - which he estimated was worth more than £50,000. But the parliamentary commissioner for standards said the cost could be ""significantly more"". It said the trips included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions. Recall petitions were created in March 2016, as part of a bid to improve the accountability of MPs. They are automatically triggered when an MP is convicted of a criminal offence, suspended from the Commons for 10 sitting days or convicted of giving false information about expenses. But if a general election is held within six months, they are scrapped. The Electoral Office of Northern Ireland has been accused of limiting the number of venues people can visit to sign the petition. Current laws allow for 10 centres to be set up. Sinn Fein Northern Ireland Assembly Member Philip McGuigan said only having three in such a rural constituency ""greatly reduces people's ability to reject Ian Paisley's disgraceful behaviour"". He added: ""Some people will have to travel up to 20-25 miles to vote in one of these three centres and those who work outside of the constituency won't have time to vote outside of working hours."" The Electoral Office rejects that criticism, having said previously that ""it would be reasonable to expect people to be able to reach these three venues""."
2018-08-08,Women who freeze their eggs to extend their fertility run the risk of spending a lot of money for a treatment with a small chance of success.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/there-are-no-guarantees-experts-warn-women-of-social-egg-freezing-risks-11464709,"So-called social egg freezing (SEF) can be used to put off childbearing or because a woman has not yet found a partner. But the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCog) has warned that egg freezing does not guarantee future live births and there are storage limits for how long eggs can be kept frozen, currently 10 years in the UK. Egg freezing is not available on the NHS apart from in certain circumstances, for example a woman undergoing medical treatment that may affect fertility. Rcog said the best time to freeze eggs was in a woman's early 20s, before the quality of the eggs and depleted, and ""certainly"" before the age of 37. Figures from Imperial College London and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital show that the proportion of frozen eggs which lead to a live birth among women under 36 was 8.2%. It said the figure fell even further - to 3.3% - when it came to women aged between 36 and 39. Of the 1,173 egg freezing cycles that took place in Britain in 2016, only 32% of patients were aged 35 or younger. ""The majority of women are taking measures to preserve their fertility too late, as a 'last-ditch' effort, instead of a planned and informed choice in their early to mid-30s,"" researchers said. ""Egg freezing is indirectly encouraging women to have children at an advanced maternal age, which carries with it significantly increased risk of medical complications in pregnancy. ""This is especially relevant to women freezing their eggs when they are already in their late 30s."" The report and comments from RCog form part of an ongoing debate in BJOG: An International Journal Of Obstetrics And Gynaecology as to whether egg freezing should be offered to women approaching their late 30s. Some experts argue that the treatment should be offered to women as they approach the end of their natural fertility cycle because they ""should not suffer involuntary childlessness because they have not yet found a partner"". Health professionals from Imperial College London and the Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health said: ""Although delaying childbearing to physiological extremes for social reasons is a reproductive gamble, some women have no alternative, e.g. single women approaching the end of their reproductive years,"" they said. ""Single women approaching their late 30s, who desire biologically related children in the future, should consider social egg freezing. ""Not only does it extend the window of opportunity to find a partner but it also retains the possibility of using a sperm donor as a last resort. ""Women should no longer be punished with childlessness for not finding a partner, nor should they feel pressured into a relationship because of their declining ovarian reserve. ""While it does not guarantee against involuntary childlessness, SEF extends the window of opportunity for single women to find a partner and offers them hope where their 'biological clock' would otherwise run out of time."""
2018-08-08,Ben Stokes has risen from a promising player to become an essential member of England's cricket team.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/ben-stokes-england-cricketers-career-and-life-11464265,"Benjamin Andrew Stokes was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, in June 1991 to rugby league international and coach Gerard ""Ged"" Stokes. The family moved to Cumbria when Ben was 12 years old after his father was appointed head coach at Workington Town Rugby League Club. Stokes played for Cockermouth Cricket Club where he excelled, with his coach saying he had never seen a 13-year-old bat so clearly. In 2009, aged 18, Ben started his professional cricket career at Durham where, on his debut and third ball, he took the wicket of top England batsman Mark Ramprakash - who is now England's batting coach. Following a very successful debut season he was selected to play in Australia during the 2010-11 Ashes for the England Performance Programme - now the Lions - which is the transition step from county to international cricket. Stokes made his senior England debut in 2011 but was out of action the next year due to injuries and lack of form. In 2012, then 21 years old, he was sent home from an England Lions tour for ignoring a team curfew. His son, Layton, was born that year and he got engaged to his girlfriend Clare Ratcliffe in 2013. He was selected for the England Ashes team in 2013 and played in four out of five tests, taking the wickets of captain Michael Clarke and top-scorer Steve Smith. In 2014 his daughter, Libby, was born. Stokes missed out on the 2015 World Cup after fracturing his hand while punching a locker during England's final match of their Caribbean tour in 2014. He was recalled to the England side to tour the West Indies later that year and then against New Zealand at Lord's before being selected for the 2015 Ashes and the Pakistan tour in the UAE. Stokes joined the Melbourne Renegades, replacing injured Jesse Ryder for the 2015 season. The cricketer went on tour with England to South Africa in 2015-16 where he hit a career-best score of 258 - the second fastest double century in test cricket history. Stokes then took part in the 2016 T20 World Cup, with England narrowly losing out to the West Indies in the final. In 2016 and 2017 Stokes played with England against Bangladesh, India and the West Indies. He was appointed vice-captain in February 2017 under Joe Root, and was bought by the Rising Pune Supergiants in the Indian Premier League for £1.7m a week later - justifying the fee by being named Most Valuable Player that year. His arrest outside Mbargo nightclub in Bristol in September last year came after a one-day Test against the West Indies in the city. Stokes was suspended and lost his New Balance sponsorship. The following month he married his long-term girlfriend and mother of his two children, Clare. He was reinstated for the 2017 South Africa Test then the Champions Trophy and a Test against the West Indies. Two days before his trial at Bristol Crown Court started on 6 August 2018, he helped England to victory against India, bowling star batsman Virat Kohli out. However, he will miss the second test against India at Lord's, which takes place during his trial. Coach Trevor Bayliss said England will need ""two or three guys to step up"" in Stokes' absence. The team will be hoping the trial is over quickly as Stokes needs to be in Nottingham by next Thursday to have two days training before the Third Test against India begins on 18 August."

Some 318 people - out of the 1,346 employed on the new high-speed railway - are earning at least £100,000 in salary and perks, according to a information given to The Times under the Freedom of Information Act. This number is an increase compared with the 155 who were paid six figures in 2015/16, the newspaper reported. Some 112 people are receiving more than £150,000 annually and 15 have pay packets topping £251,000. An HS2 Ltd spokeswoman said: ""In a highly technical project of the scale and complexity of HS2 it is necessary to employ the right level of expertise and knowledge to deliver the programme successfully. ""As the project moves increasingly towards construction, as does our need for highly technical support increase. ""HS2 Ltd is committed to controlling costs and take our responsibility to taxpayers money very seriously, and the programme remains on track and within our funding envelope."" The pay figures include salaries, bonuses and pension contributions. It was also reported that the company spent more than £600m on consultants in the most recent financial year, more than double the amount spent the previous year. The £55.7bn project has angered environmentalists who are worried about potential damage to the land, with other critics attacking the delays and ballooning cost of HS2. A government spokesman said: ""We are keeping a tough grip on costs and the HS2 project remains on budget at £55.7bn. ""As the future backbone of our national rail network, HS2 is vital for delivering better connections between our major cities with faster and more frequent services, acting as a catalyst for jobs, housing and economic growth. ""As this significant project moves towards construction, it is essential that HS2 Ltd continues to increase its workforce, attracting the world-class skills and expertise necessary to deliver the project successfully.""

Wayne Bath, Sabah Dulaj, Arthur Nutaj, Albert Letchford, Leonard Powell and Alfie Powell were all found guilty at the Old Bailey. At least 18 people were transported from near Calais to Dymchurch in Kent in dangerously overcrowded inflatable boats designed for six. The investigation was led by the UK's National Crime Agency, which carried out surveillance along with French authorities over four months from May 2016. On 11 May 2016, an inflatable boat called ""Rebel"" was found abandoned on Dymchurch Beach. It showed signs it had been used to ferry migrants, and contained personal belongings and vomit. Border Force officers attended the scene and were told by Bath, who claimed to own the vessel, that he had experienced engine difficulties while night fishing. An investigation was then launched by the NCA. Had the men not been stopped by a NCA-led surveillance operation, they would have been the first to have tried to run migrants across the world's busiest shipping route on jet skis. Later that month, French police carried out surveillance at Cran d'Escalles beach near Calais, where they witnessed a group of people appearing to signal to a boat. Headlights from a nearby car warned off the potential smuggling attempt while in Kent CCTV showed a group towing a boat to and from Dymchurch Beach. The NCA monitored the Kent group as they launched a new boat, the ""White Scanner"", into the sea to collect a group of 18 Albanian migrants. As the vessel returned to Kent it got into difficulties around five miles off the British coast, with migrants captured on helicopter CCTV bailing out water. The coastguard and Border Force rescued those on board. Richard Davis was on Border Force cutter Valiant during the rescue. ""It was quite rough and choppy seas and the exposure to a bitterly cold easterly wind was a concern to me as two of the migrants were suffering from hypothermia,"" he said. ""They seemed in a large amount of distress, there were a couple of minors on board between 16 and 18 and my priority was to save life at sea and that those migrants were taken on board Valiant safely and everyone taken into Dover and seek medical assistance."" At the same time the group had been planning a rescue attempt using another inflatable boat which was later found abandoned and the 4x4 towing it set on fire. In July 2016, the group obtained a larger vessel from Southampton. NCA officers bugged the boat, hearing evidence of the group planning another migrant run across the Channel. The men were arrested in August 2016 after planning to purchase a jet-ski to ferry migrants, a plan police described as ""beyond reckless."" NCA lead officer Mark McCormack told Sky News it was a high-value operation: ""The crime group themselves, they spent in the region of twelve to twelve and a half thousand pounds per vessel that they purchased. ""They then charged the migrants in the region of about £6,000 which is what we've been told by the migrants themselves to be transported over to the UK. ""So we can see from 18 migrants at £6,000 a time that's quite a lucrative business...so significant sums of money involved for the crime groups which is why they do it - making money and exploiting those individuals wanting to come to the UK."" The NCA has more than 250 active investigations into people smuggling into the UK - in what is industry worth up £6bn worldwide."

Those taken into custody on Wednesday morning have been described as ""men of violence"" by the Metropolitan Police, who targeted 15 addresses in the southeast and northwest of the city. Early-morning peace was shattered by shouts of ""police"" as 185 officers helped smash down a dozen doors in Lewisham, two in Southwark, and one in Wembley. In New Cross - where the bulk of the class A drugs seized were being supplied - a panicked suspect threw a quantity of the narcotics out of the window, only for them to be caught by a police officer. Among the drugs seized were cocaine and heroin, and officers also found what was thought to be a handgun wrapped in a sock. Some of those arrested are known to have been involved in violent crime in the past - and to have carried knives. Andy Furphy, temporary detective superintendent at the Met, said the raids were good news for London. ""The operation has gone very successfully, we found drugs at all 15 addresses we searched,"" he said. ""The men involved are men of violence, and drugs are intrinsically linked to violence. They are causing real harm and are the people we were after. ""I think this will significantly impact violent crime in this part of London."" Detectives are now focusing on whether any drugs had made it outside of the capital. The raids come just a few weeks after Sky News special investigation into London's gang culture."

2018-08-08,British Gas customers will see a price hike for the second time this year as the UK's biggest supplier of energy said bills would increase by £44 on average.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/british-gas-to-raise-gas-prices-for-35-million-customers-11465424,"Centrica, the owner of British Gas, blamed it on a 20% rise in the cost of buying wholesale gas. More than three million customers on a standard variable tariff (SVT) will be hit by a 3.8% increase on 1 October, taking the average bill for dual-fuel customers to £1205. Its 2.4 million customers on fixed-price contracts will be unaffected. In April, the firm announced its first rise for 2018 - an average 5.5% for SVT customers and those on a temporary tariff fixed-rate deal. ""We have today reluctantly announced plans for an increase in our Standard Variable Tariff (SVT),"" said Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer. ""We understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers' household bills. However, this reflects the sharp rise in wholesale energy costs. ""In response to rapidly rising wholesale market costs, since April a number of other energy supply companies have increased their SVT prices and Ofgem have also announced a second increase to the prepayment meter cap."" The company said it would contact customers affected to offer alternative deals. In the first six months of 2018, the energy group lost 1.4 million domestic customer accounts to rivals. There are more than 70 energy suppliers operating in the UK. The British Gas increase comes a day after the energy regulator increased its price cap on variable tariffs, as rising oil prices had fed through to wholesale gas prices. Ofgem said its safeguard tariff, which protects five million households from overcharging, would rise by £47 per year in October to £1,136. In a statement, Ofgem said: ""While we had to increase the level of the safeguard tariff yesterday due to higher wholesale prices, these households are still better off and can be confident that they are protected from unfair price rises. ""The way we set this safeguard tariff is open and transparent. We encourage British Gas to be as transparent with its own customers in explaining why they have chosen to increase customer bills rather than absorbing any extra costs themselves."" E.ON, SSE, Npower, EDF, ScottishPower and Bulb have all raised prices in recent months. Consumer groups have encouraged customers to switch suppliers to get a better deal. Henry de Zoete, co-founder of auto-switching service Look After My Bills, said: ""British Gas's second price rise in the space of just a few months is a disgrace and a slap in the face for families. ""Just a few days ago they announced a profit of £430m despite losing 270,000 customers. ""Clearly British Gas's strategy is to get as much money as possible out of their base of customers before the price cap comes in to force."" Consumer watchdog Which? has estimated that customers who do not seek out the best deals could end up overpaying by as much as £400 per year."
2018-08-08,An Indian sailor is preparing to return home after being stranded aboard a ship in a Norfolk port for 18 months.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/indian-sailor-stranded-on-ship-in-norfolk-for-18-months-to-fly-home-11465473,"Nikesh Rastogi, 43, has been living on the offshore supply vessel Malaviya Twenty, moored in Great Yarmouth, since February 2017. The captain has been stuck there with three crew after the ship's owners fell into liquidation - triggering a complex series of legal disputes regarding unpaid crew wages and port dues. Capt Rastogi said they have received no wages since last year, and feared they would not get paid if they left the ship because it would be ""considered a derelict which means anybody can take it over"". The ship has now been arrested, meaning the court can arrange its sale and use the money raised to pay those owed, after the crew's lawyers went to the Admiralty Marshal at the High Court last month. Capt Rastogi, from Mumbai, said he hopes to head back home - on a plane - with his crew within weeks, and eat ""lots of Indian food"". He said: ""It is like a weight being lifted because there was a point of no hope. ""There was a period where things were really bad mentally."" Lawyer Paul Haworth said a surveyor instructed by the court will value the ship and it should be sold by September. Paul Keenan, inspector for the International Transport Workers' Federation, said the ship could sell for £700,000 to £800,000. Mr Haworth said the money should be enough to pay everybody involved, including the Admiralty Marshal's costs, port dues, legal fees and the crew's unpaid wages. Mr Rastogi says he was contracted by an agency in February 2017 to head up a 13-strong replacement crew after the ship's owners fell into liquidation. All of the original crew returned to India last year and three new members joined him in September 2017 on six-month contracts. The captain said the agency withdrew in January after new contracts did not materialise - so he and his crewmates have not been paid for six months. He said he felt responsible for his crew, saying: ""You can't sit and mope over it, you just slide into the role."" They read books to keep busy, performed drills and did routine maintenance while keeping in touch with family via WhatsApp and looked out for ""markers for depression"". Capt Rastogi added: ""Your mind needs to be like a shark in that sense because if you stop then you sink and you start thinking about the situation and then there's no hope."" And ever hopeful, he said ""lightning doesn't strike twice"" so is keen to continue working at sea. Talking about returning home, he said: ""I think I'm going to have lots of Indian food. ""I'm going to start with curries from breakfast to dinner."""
2018-08-08,"Our ""formative years"" can play a strong role in our fears about crime - even decades later, researchers have claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/how-the-politicians-of-your-youth-affect-your-fears-about-crime-11465475,"The study showed that people generally fear crimes that were the focus of political debate during their youth, normally between the ages of 15 and 25. One of the researchers on the study, professor Stephen Farrall, said: ""The pronouncements that leading politicians make about crime can have a lasting impact on the crime fears of young adults. ""Political and popular debates about crime that are prevalent in one's youth appear to impact the fears those individuals report through adulthood and into middle age."" People who grew up during the leadership of Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) or John Major (1990-1997) generally showed the greatest worries about domestic burglary. The same generation lived through a dramatic rise in burglary rates during the 1980s. Those who grew up during the governments of Harold Wilson (1964-1970 and 1974-1976) or James Callaghan (1976-1979) expressed the greatest concerns about mugging and robbery. This was a key concern for politicians at the time, as well as being widely discussed in the media. Anti-social behaviour, such as vandalism, loitering teenagers and noisy neighbours, was the biggest concern for those who grew up during the Tony Blair (1997-2007) and Gordon Brown (2007-2010) governments. These problems and issues were heavily featured in the news and were significant in government, particularly with the introduction of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders as part of the Crime and Disorder Act of 1998. The research was a collaboration between the University of Sheffield, University of Southampton and Sciences Po, Paris."

Her body was discovered in woodland at Southampton Sports Centre at 7.45am the following day and police say she was stabbed to death. CCTV shows Lucy near to the sports centre outside a Tesco Express store half an hour after she left home. Police are urging people to check their dash cams or tracking apps to see if they were in the area at the time. Detective Superintendent Paul Barton said: ""Since leaving her house in Mansel Road East, we now know that Lucy was close to the sports centre just half an hour later. ""We need to know how she reached the Tesco Express and where she went next. ""Maybe you were driving or cycling past at that time and can remember something. You may even have dash cam or action camera footage. ""We're really hoping the CCTV footage will jog people's memories so that we can further build up a picture of Lucy's movements."" He added: ""You will see that Lucy was carrying her jacket at the time. It was a hot day, so you may have seen her wearing a white vest top. ""We're also asking runners or walkers to check their mapping apps for the period in question. ""They may realise they were close to the scene of the murder and have information that might be useful to our investigation."" The last time Lucy was seen she was wearing a distinctive black jacket with white sleeves, the logo for the band Falling in Reverse on the front and RADKE 01 in red on the back. She also wore a white vest top, camouflage leggings and black and white Jordan 23 trainers. Stephen-Alan Nicholson, 24, was arrested on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child and was released on police bail on 31 July. He was remanded in custody at Southampton Magistrates' Court after he was charged under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) for failing to provide his Facebook password to police. He will next appear at Southampton Crown Court on 31 August."
2018-08-08,The remains of an ancient civilisation have been discovered by archaeologists in Mexico.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/7000-year-old-maya-remains-found-in-mexico-11465153,"The bones are thought to be up to 7,000 years old, placing them at around the time when humans shifted from being hunters to a more sedentary lifestyle, the experts say. The three Maya skeletons were found in the Puyil cave, which is in the Tacotalpa municipality of Tabasco state, located in southern Mexico. One set is up to 7,000 years old, while the other two are thought to date back around 4,000 years. The remains are on display in Mexico City. Archaeologist Alberto Martos said: ""Seven thousand years old is what we've just placed it, which is the period of transition from being hunters to sedentarism. ""There were different groups during this time that used the caves, clearly it wasn't a domestic cave. ""In prehistoric times it was probably used for rituals and cemeteries so as to dispose of remains of people. ""For the Maya, it was a cave of ancestors. ""This cave was used by the Maya, they respected the remains that were already there and left their own remains inside."" The Maya were one of the most dominant civilisations in Mesoamerica and they built cities with elaborate ceremonial buildings and massive stone pyramids from what we now know as Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. They made advances in agriculture, mathematics and calendar-making, reaching the peak of their progress around the sixth century AD. But by 900AD, their stone cities were mostly abandoned and experts have not been able to determine exactly why. Theories include overpopulation, military conflict or a major environmental event, such as extreme drought. In January last year, a study used radiocarbon dating and data from ceramics and excavations to chart increases and decreases in population and building activity at the archaeological site of Ceibal in Guatemala during the Maya period. The study's lead author Takeshi Inomata said: ""It's not just a simple collapse, but there are waves of collapse. ""First there are smaller waves, tied to warfare and some political instability, then comes the major collapse, in which many centres got abandoned. ""Then there was some recovery in some places, then another collapse."""
2018-08-08,"Trading in Tesla shares was halted on Tuesday, after a tweet by chief executive Elon Musk sent shares soaring by more than 7%.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/tesla-share-trading-halted-after-musk-tweet-boost-11464730,"Shares in Tesla hit $367.25 after a message posted at 9.48am New York time on Mr Musk's verified Twitter account said: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" Nasdaq stock exchange halted trading in Tesla shares around 2.08pm local time. Mr Musk's statement came at a time when the electric car maker faces financial constraints, and barely a week after the company announced it had made its biggest net loss to date of $717.5m (£547.6m) during the second quarter ending in June. During the conference call accompanying the results, Mr Musk said he expected the company to avoid going back to the markets for capital and to be ""essentially self-funding on a go-forward basis"". At $420 per share, a deal would represent a 22.8% premium to Tesla's closing price on Monday, making it one of thebiggest deals to take a company private, with a price tag of about $72bn. When asked on Twitter whether he was serious, Musk replied: ""Yes....It saves a lot of headaches."" Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for clarification. But in a blog post by Musk on the Tesla website, he said: ""I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we're all trying to achieve. ""This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held."" The company had a market value of $58bn as of Monday's close. Musk owns nearly 20% of the company. Earlier in the day, the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had built an undisclosed stake of between 3% and 5% in Tesla. Mr Musk has been under intense pressure this year to prove he can deliver on his promise to turn his money-losing company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer. Last week Tesla said it had achieved its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of its second quarter in June, but burned through $739.5m (£565.2m) in cash during the period in order to do it. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows companies to use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter to announce key information in compliance with its ""fair disclosure"" rules, as long as investors are alerted about which social media outlets will be used to disclose such information. The Wall Street regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk's tweet. George Galliers, analyst at Evercore ISI said he believed the tweet was serious. He added: ""I can't believe this is something to bluff or make fun of. ""Given his historic frustration with short sellers, analysts and certain parts of the press, it is perhaps also not surprising that he has given consideration to taking the company private."" ""Details, structure, participants and how the valuation has been determined remain to be seen."""
2018-08-08,KFC and Kellogg's adverts have been banned for promoting junk food to children after one appeared on a phonebox near a school and the other during a cartoon.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/kfc-and-kelloggs-adverts-banned-for-promoting-junk-food-to-kids-11465378,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ads breached rules on promoting products that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) to children. A poster for KFC's Mars Krushems drink appeared in July on a telephone box a short distance from the entrance to a primary school. It was ""highly likely"" that its location meant it broke rules that no medium should be used to advertise HFSS products if more than 25% of its audience was under the age of 16, the ASA said. The watchdog also banned a television ad for Kellogg's Coco Pops Granola, which appeared in January between episodes of the Mr Bean cartoon. It agreed with Kellogg's argument that the granola was not an HFSS product, but said the branding was synonymous with the original Coco Pops and therefore had the effect of promoting a high-sugar cereal. The ban follows complaints from the Obesity Health Alliance that the ads were for HFSS products and directed at children. KFC admitted its ad was for an HFSS product but said its media agency had mistakenly placed it on the phonebox within 100m of the school. Adverts for some of the UK's most popular confectionery brands have been banned under rules designed to protect children from products high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS). A KFC spokesman said: ""This was a total mistake, and we're really sorry for it. ""It was the result of human error at one of our media agencies, which the ASA has accepted, and we made sure the advert was taken down as soon as we found out."" Kellogg's said: ""We are disappointed with this decision as we ensured throughout the advert that we were only promoting the Coco Pops Granola product, a cereal that can be advertised in children's airtime. ""It's particularly surprising when a ruling from the television regulator Ofcom published on Monday confirmed that an advert for the same product was not in breach of the advertising code."" Two McDonald's ads were cleared by the ASA because they did not break the rules. Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, said: ""The ruling on Coco Pops Granola provides an important precedent for junk food marketing. ""This ruling recognises that, even though the product shown is classified as 'healthier', the advert used all the same features as adverts for original Coco Pops cereal and therefore essentially promoted the less healthy product, which is not acceptable. ""We are very supportive of brands reformulating their products to reduce sugar and overall calories, but they must market them responsibly. ""This is just another example of the ever-evolving tricks brands use to get their products in front of children and why we need stronger, regulatory protection online and with a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV."" The government has proposed a 9pm watershed for advertising unhealthy products as part of its childhood obesity strategy."

Ms Eastwood's body was discovered in a rural area near Caverswall, Staffordshire, on Saturday - eight days after the 28-year-old went missing. Appearing from HMP Dovecote via video link, wearing a high-vis vest and a grey T-shirt, he spoke only to confirm his name, age and nationality and that he understood the proceedings. Stirling is the brother-in-law of Ms Eastwood's ex-fiance, John Peake, and is accused of murdering the midwife between 26 July and 5 August at Baddeley Green, Stoke. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin told the court the ongoing investigation into the midwife's death was ""complex"". The court heard Ms Eastwood had been found in a shallow grave, with masking tape around her face and eyes, and had been wrapped inside a single duvet cover. A preliminary post-mortem examination did not reveal any gunshot, stab or penetrating wounds, and further analysis of neck bones was due to be carried out, Judge Michael Challinor QC was also told. CCTV footage, telephone evidence and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) data are also set to form part of the evidence at trial. Defence barrister Samina Rasid made no application for bail and Stirling was not required to enter a plea. His trial date was provisionally set for 4 February next year, but the judge told him that the complexities of the case meant that date was unlikely to remain fixed. Two other men, aged 28 and 60, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, remain on conditional police bail while inquiries continue. Ms Eastwood's younger sister, Gemma, visited her sibling's home on Monday to take away some of the flowers and tributes left by NHS colleagues, neighbours and members of the public. A statement released by Staffordshire Police on the family's behalf said: ""We would like to say thank you to all the people who followed Samantha's story and tried their best to help."""

Beforehand, the BioSURE HIV Self Test was only available to buy online. It became the first legally approved self-testing kit in 2015, with a 99.7% accuracy rate. It uses a small amount of blood from a finger prick sample to detect the presence of HIV antibodies. Superdrug says making the kit more widely available will help eliminate an anxious wait, and could also help increase early diagnosis rates. HIV has become more manageable in recent years owing to developments in available treatments, but late diagnosis can have a devastating impact on health and life expectancy. Dr Pixie McKenna, a GP who serves as the retailer's health expert, said: ""Superdrug's move to encourage and empower patients to self-test for HIV is one further step forward in our fight against this disease. ""While there is no cure, early diagnosis is key in terms of management. ""Patients successfully managed on HIV treatments have normal life expectancy, but to know you need treatment you need to know your diagnosis."" Terrence Higgins Trust estimates there are 10,400 people in the UK who do not know that they are living with HIV. This means they are not on effective medication and could be passing the virus on. HIV is a virus which attacks the immune system and weakens the body's ability to fight diseases."

The couple are anxious to find a home quickly, with room for their four sons, before they start school. He told me: ""I don't really want to put them in a hotel because four boys in a hotel would be difficult! ""So once we get a house and my boys are in school, then hopefully it will get a lot easier to get in to a routine of living."" Has he had a chat with David Beckham about how to do that? ""No … I think Becks obviously has his other stuff off the pitch, his commercial stuff and different stuff like that."" He gives a self-deprecating laugh: ""I'd be happy going home and spending the time with my family."" Rooney is being paid something in the region of £46m for his multi-year deal, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league's history. But he has a real challenge on his hands. DC United is at the bottom of the table, Rooney is leading a very young squad, and expectations are high. He said: ""In America they want goals, they want attacking play all the time, it adds a bit to the excitement of the game. ""But sometimes they need someone on the pitch who can say 'calm down a little bit and see the game out' rather than just keep going and going. ""That happened to me with the older players, the likes of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, they knew the right times to see the game out or the right times to go and press."" He says he's enjoying the more open style of play here, despite recently suffering a broken nose, and laughs off the observations of sports writers who have suggested that the speed and accuracy of his passes sometimes seem to catch his teammates off guard. Are his team still trying to catch up with him? ""No, no. I bring a different quality to the team... other players do the same... it's a mixture really."" Rooney has said he is here to compete and win rather than coast to the end of his playing career. But off the pitch, Rooney has discovered an added bonus to US life. Here he can blend in with the tourists without being mobbed. His Instagram shows him out with Coleen and one of their sons enjoying some of the US capital's sights, almost unnoticed. He finds it a relief. ""I've had it in England since I was 16 and I'm sure if you speak to anyone I'm close with, family and friends, it's not something I particularly like. Here it's a bit more relaxed. ""It's good to spend time with the kids, not stopping all the time, having to do pictures and autographs all the time... and just give them the attention they need."" Can he see himself settling in the States? ""I don't know, I think it depends on my family and how they settle in. ""I've taken a lot of their time up over the years, so when I finish playing, if they want to stay I'll stay, if they want to go home, I'll go home."""

Fortunately it happened in the small village of Smisby where a series of strangers immediately rushed to his aid performing CPR while one ran a few hundred yards to the village hall to grab a defibrillator. Mr Thompson told Sky News: ""I actually stopped breathing I lost all output from my heart, my extremities had started turning blue and I had actually passed away at that stage."" The shock from the defibrillator though brought him back to life and meant that paramedics and then hospital staff in Derby could ensure he made a full recovery. Today the NHS, The British Heart Foundation and Microsoft have announced a partnership that will map all of the UK's defibrillators to try to ensure they are used in more ""out of hospital"" cardiac arrests. Currently defibrillators are used in just 3% of instances where people have heart attacks away from any medical care. Tens of thousands of the devices have been installed in workplaces, villages, transport hubs and other public spaces, but despite some efforts to list defibrillators there is still no comprehensive national database. The British Heart Foundation says the lack of such a network is significantly reducing people's chances of survival. Chief Executive of the charity Simon Gillespie said: ""Every minute without CPR or defibrillation reduces a person's chance of surviving a cardiac arrest by around 10 per cent. ""This innovative project will give every ambulance service immediate access to the location of defibrillators in their areas, so they can direct bystanders to their nearest life-saving device in the event of a cardiac arrest."" Mr Thompson welcomed the move and told Sky News: ""Anything that improves access to these things is good, without it I would not be talking to you today. ""It's thanks to the people of Smisby who stepped in and saved me that I can carry on being a husband, a dad and a grandad. ""I owe them my life."" Mr Thompson has now had two stents fitted and is back home and has even resumed exercising. In the coming months defibrillator owners or ""guardians"" will be invited to register their device online - starting in Scotland and the West Midlands - the network will then be rolled out across the UK. Chief Executive of West Midlands Ambulance Service Anthony Marsh said: ""It's absolutely critical that we are able to direct cardiac arrest bystanders to their nearest defibrillator. ""This gives patients the best possible chance of receiving early defibrillation if it's required prior to the ambulance services arrival, which is proven to save lives."""

Several people are in a critical condition in hospital. Health minister Silvia Pessah said the food appears to have contained organophosphates, a group of chemicals used in pesticides. Regional health director Jhon Tinco told a local radio station that the victims said they had eaten a meat dish and a fermented corn drink called chicha. Samples of the food and drink served at the funeral have been taken away for testing. The victims had to be evacuated from a rural hospital in Ayacucho, a southern region home to indigenous Quechua-speaking farmers. Radio Programs of Peru (RPP) said the funeral had been for local man Víctor Santos Cucho Atucsa and his grieving family had shared the meal with mourners afterwards. The mayor of San Jose de Ushua, Ivan Villagomez Llamoca was at the funeral and told the news outlet: ""The first dish was mote broth, the second dish was stewed meat with chilli."" Mr Llamoca said he had suffered from a headache after the meal and had gone to hospital to ""save myself"". Those who died were reported to be aged between 12 and 68. In 2013, 23 children in India's Bihar state died after eating food contaminated with the pesticide monocrotophos, which also belongs to the organophosphate family. Monocrotophos is extremely toxic for humans and birds and has been banned in most parts of the world, but it is still available in India. In 1999, 26 children died from food poisoning in Cusco, Peru. In this case, the foods had been stored next to supplies of parathion, a chemical insecticide now also banned in most countries."
2018-08-08,"For the first time in history, the summer transfer window will slam shut before the start of the new Premier League season.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180808115937/https://news.sky.com/story/transfer-deadline-day-why-the-big-summer-sale-comes-early-this-year-11465420,"It is a long-awaited change for most top clubs, who for years have complained that allowing the window to remain open after the season has begun is unsettling for players and managers alike. But the earlier closure could well rob the big day of some of its drama, with Wayne Rooney finally moving from Everton to Manchester United on 31 August after a summer of speculation back in 2004. That deadline also often forced clubs that had made a bad start to the campaign to do some late business, with Arsenal signing five players in the final days of the window after being trounced 8-2 by rivals Manchester United in August 2011. So, when is the new deadline? Clubs in the Premier League - as well teams across the three Sky Bet EFL divisions - have until 5pm on Thursday to finish their incoming business. If a deal is going close to the wire, a deal sheet can be submitted to give the parties involved an extra two hours to get all the documentation in order. The deadline has been set with the first game of the new season in mind, as Manchester United and Leicester City open the Premier League campaign live on Sky Sports on Friday night. But it is worth noting that the Sky Bet Championship, League One and League Two have all already got started, so those sides will still be able to sign players on loan and bring in free agents until the old deadline of 31 August. :: Sky Sports - Transfer Centre LIVE! Why has it changed? Sky sources understand that 14 of the 20 Premier League clubs voted to move the deadline forward. Top flight managers have complained about the uncertainty created by the late deadline, and the outgoing chief executive of the Premier League has admitted it had been cause for concern. Last year, England star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain appeared to have his mind elsewhere when he played for Arsenal in a humiliating 4-0 defeat to Liverpool just four days before the window shut. He ended up moving to Anfield on deadline day. Do European leagues do it differently? France, Germany and Spain will all be open for business until 31 August, although Italy will close two weeks earlier in time for the start of the new Serie A campaign. The later deadlines across the continent could end up putting a number of English clubs at a disadvantage. Real Madrid are widely expected to make a move for Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois - who is failing to turn up to training in a bid to force a move - and have three more weeks to do so. But Chelsea only have one more day to find a replacement, which they would likely be signing in advance of any sale of their Belgian number one. Newspapers are also full with reports about Manchester United's Paul Pogba - some suggest he could be on his way to Barcelona and that he has asked for a £200,000 a week pay rise to stay with United. :: Sky Sports News will have reporters following every Premier League club from 6am on Thursday, bringing you details of the transfers as they happen, as well as the moves in the pipeline. :: If you are away from your TV, you can keep up-to-date with it all via the Transfer Centre online at Sky News and Sky Sports News."

In a way it is racist. These words are very inflammatory. ""I believe they will cause problems with race relations and I believe it will encourage bigotry in this country.""

Lord Sheikh revealed he has written to Tory party chair Brandon Lewis to call for ""severe action"" to be taken against Mr Johnson, including potentially taking the whip away from him. The peer also said it was his view that there was an ""element"" of Islamphobia"" within the party. Former cabinet minister and Tory party chair Lord Pickles told Sky News the ""sensible thing"" for Mr Johnson to do would be to apologise for his ""language"".

And I say that as someone who has worked closely with him over a number of years."" Mr Lewis revealed on Tuesday that he had asked Mr Johnson to apologise, with Mrs May joining him later that day. The PM said the remarks - contained in Mr Johnson's weekly Daily Telegraph column - had ""clearly caused offence"". In the piece, Mr Johnson argued against following Denmark's lead in banning the burka. But he made several comparisons between the covering worn by some women, saying it made them look like a ""bank robber"" or a ""letter box"". Mr Johnson also revealed he would ""feel entitled"" to ask a woman wearing the burka to remove it if she came to his constituency office. He concluded: ""In Britain today there is only a tiny, tiny minority of women who wear these odd bits of headgear. ""One day, I am sure, they will go."""

All 10 injured people - ranging in age from ""late childhood to 50s"" - were sent to hospital, among them two children with ""pellet-type wounds"". One man was said to be in a serious but stable condition with leg injuries. Police say one person has left hospital after self-discharging, and the remaining nine people with pellet injuries are expected to leave hospital on Sunday. Armed and unarmed officers were on the scene ""within a minute"" after a series of ""bangs"" were reported at 2.25am in Claremont Road. On arriving at the scene, they discovered a crowd of several hundred people who had been at Manchester Caribbean Carnival, some of whom had been injured and needed first aid. Chief Superintendent Wasim Chaudhry described the situation as ""confusing"" and ""distressing"". The carnival had brought large groups of people to the area, with several after-parties understood to have taken place in Claremont Road. The event - which this year is celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Windrush generation - is going ahead as planned on Sunday. Festival organiser Mike Bisson called the shooting ""an isolated incident"" and said it had ""nothing to do with the carnival"". Chief Superintendent Chaudhry called the shooting ""a reckless act that could have had devastating consequences"". He added: ""Guns have no place on our streets and we want to assure you we are doing everything we can to find the person or people responsible."" Councillor Pat Karney highlighted the community spirit in the area, saying: ""It's an individual, an idiot, who was messing around with a firearm and you can't tar a whole community because of some idiotic behaviour."" He also said the man who had suffered a leg injury was understood to have broken his limb while ""attempting to flee the incident"". Claremont Road runs for about two miles through Moss Side. The area has numerous gang territories and has long had problems connected with drugs and gun violence. Footage reportedly showing the aftermath of the incident was posted on Twitter, with the caption: ""Shooting at Manchester Moss Side post carnival street party."" The dark video appears to show a panicked group of people being helped by police.

Detective Superintendent Debbie Dooley said: ""We currently have a number of people in hospital all being treated for different injuries but thankfully most do not appear to be life-threatening at this time. ""Officers are trying to establish exactly where this incident took place and who is responsible for such a dangerous attack."" Wayne Everett, a local DJ who attended the carnival, told Sky News: ""The atmosphere was nice, but it's Moss Side isn't it? You just don't know what can happen. It seemed like there was a general understanding over the last few years that everyone would just behave themselves."" Going on to describe Moss Side as ""a volatile area"", he said police should not have allowed the carnival to go ahead. He said: ""It's only a matter of time. You can't have thousands of youths in the area in the early hours of the morning just doing what they want. It's common sense. ""As someone from the area, I decided to come down and see this thing, because 10 people is a major thing in Manchester."" Officers and forensic experts are now on the scene. Superintendent Dooley said: ""The area is being searched and examined while we are also trying to speak to as many people as possible and are reviewing CCTV to get all the facts.""

2018-08-11,Sammy Woodhouse became a victim in the Rotherham sex-grooming scandal aged 14 and began working in lap dancing clubs four years later.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180812221432/https://news.sky.com/story/i-thought-lap-dancing-was-empowering-but-it-wasnt-11469167,"The campaigner wants to see the clubs shut down and is urging councils to investigate the industry and see what is happening for themselves. She tells Sky News it is ""horrendous"" how women working in the clubs are treated and claims many venues ignore criminality like prostitution, trafficking and drug-taking I started when I was about 18, I got into the industry while working as a model - I kind of fell into it. I wasn't pressured, I wasn't forced into it and it was entirely my choice. However, I was abused as a child and I left school with no qualifications, very low self-esteem, not much self-respect, and I kind of didn't see anything wrong with it at the time. I thought ""this is my choice, my body, I can do what I want with it"". I felt like I was in control of it and I felt like it was empowerment and when I look back now, I realise that's absolute nonsense. You take your clothes off and give a man an erection - that's not empowerment, that's not something little girls grow up and aspire to want to do. But I did it and it paid my bills. There were times when I made a lot of money, there were times when I didn't earn anything. The only people that win are the clubs. I did it for about nine years and what I noticed was a hell of a lot of the women that were dancers had been through something traumatic in their lives, they were abused as a child or had been through domestic violence and they were in that industry for reasons like my own - control, empowerment or just wanted to earn some easy money. Within the industry there's trafficking, prostitution, money laundering, fraud, drug and alcohol abuse and it's an industry that not many people know or understand. At the time, if you had said to me the girls were being exploited - I would not have had any idea what exploitation was. A lot of things that were exploitative, I would not have realised were happening. It's only now when I look back and I'm actually out of the industry that I feel very different and it's something that needs to be looked at so I'm calling on council officials to actually go in and find out for themselves how these clubs are actually being run. When they are going in they're finding these clubs are not safe at all, there is a lot of criminal activity going on and it's something that needs to be shut down once and for all. I've lost count how many times myself and other people were sexually assaulted - that happens on a nightly basis. What you're told is ""you're a lap dancer you've got to expect this"". No one should ever be expected to be touched, groped or assaulted. I know girls that have been drugged and raped. It's almost as if the clubs are grooming the girls to think that the people who work in these clubs are like a tight family network and that they care about the girls, that they're one big happy family. And it makes it really difficult for people to go against that and the moment they do, they're fired, they're shut down. Word will get round that they're a bad person to take on. I myself found it very difficult to take my clothes off and I did that with drink and I remember one night I tried it without drink and I sat in a corner and I couldn't speak to anyone. My boss walked over and slammed a bottle of wine on the table and he went ""drink that and earn me some money"". Some girls are drinking and taking drugs every night just to be able to do the job. It turned me against men, I viewed men as very weak and pathetic and I thought ""you're giving me all your money"". I could take an entire yearly earnings within an hour. I'm talking about very powerful people who go into strip clubs. When you have that control it makes you feel good but now I realise that's not empowerment, that's manipulation. At the time, girls might be getting a lot of compliments, it might make them feel great, they're earning money but that's very short-lived. The impact long-term on your mental health and self-esteem is really very damaging. Pimps are sending girls into the clubs to get the customers' numbers to gain punters - it's almost encouraging things. The simple fact is, the clubs don't want to raise the issues, the managers don't want to raise the issues and neither do the girls, because guess what? They're making money. For the girls, how you get treated is horrendous. Some clubs are better than others but there is no way a club can control the amount of criminal activity that's happening. The verbal abuse I have received for speaking out has been absolutely shocking. Some of the clubs don't even pay the girls what they've earned at the end of the night and they fine the lap dancers at every opportunity - for chewing gum or because the boss didn't like their outfit. They do it because they know a lot of girls don't declare they're actually working so there's nothing the girls can do - they have no rights. Essentially, they're selling women - we're in 2018 and people think it's alright to go buy a woman for whatever sexual need it is? Do we want little girls growing up to be a lifeline for lonely old men? It's exploitation. My message to women thinking about working in the industry and those who already are is - don't do it. You're worth so much more and I wish I had realised I was worth so much more and that I could go out there and do anything I put my mind to. There are plenty of ways you can earn good money without it being so damaging. I just want people to aspire to be better. I know you shouldn't have regrets but would I do it all over again? No, I would not."

The laws are being proposed by the government after 44-year-old mother-of-two Kim Briggs was knocked over and killed by a bicycle courier in February 2016. Ms Briggs was killed by Charlie Alliston, then 18, who was travelling at 18mph on a fixed-wheel bike with no front brakes. He was jailed for 18 months after being found guilty of the Victorian offence of causing bodily harm by ""wanton and furious driving"". :: Cyclist Charlie Alliston sentenced over fatal crash The legislation, originally drafted to deal with reckless handling of horses, was used because there was no cycling equivalent to the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. Ms Briggs' widower Matthew has been campaigning for the law change for almost a year. He told Sky News: ""Any working single parent will tell you it's tough. ""But getting the law changed is a positive legacy from this. The government has treated me very well, and this seems to have moved very swiftly. ""It has been a very important journey for me. ""A week after Kim died, the investigating officer told me there might be an element of wrongdoing, but then came the 'but', that he didn't know what to charge him (Alliston) with. ""That started an 18-month rollercoaster of the ins and outs and the CPS reports. ""What happened to Kim was rare, but it's not unique and I don't want another family to suffer a double whammy of grief and then go through this legal minefield."" However, the plans have been described by cycling campaigners as ""tinkering around the edges"" of road safety. Cycling UK, a national charity, claimed a ""full review of road traffic offences"" is required. Head of campaigns Duncan Dollimore said: ""We need a full review - something promised by the government in 2014 - because the way the justice system deals with mistakes, carelessness, recklessness and deliberately dangerous behaviour by all road users hasn't been fit for purpose for years."" The number of cases involving collisions between cyclists and pedestrians remains relatively low. In 2016, 448 pedestrians were killed on our roads, but only three of those cases involved bicycles. And in the last 10 years 99.4% of all pedestrian deaths involved a motor vehicle. The latest announcement also includes the introduction of national guidance for cycling and walking infrastructure and updating parts of the Highway Code to combat close passing of bicycles. Cycling and walking minister Jesse Norman said: ""All these measures are designed to support the continued growth of cycling and walking, with all the benefits they bring to our communities, economy, environment and society."""

""He was a giant in all that he achieved and he died surrounded by those he loved having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavour,"" she said in a statement. Born in Trinidad in 1932, Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul won a scholarship to read English at Oxford University and published his first novel, The Mystic Masseur, in 1957. He went on to write dozens of more books, many dealing with colonialism and its legacy, and Islamic fundamentalism. His 1961 novel, A House For Mr Biswas, is considered one of his most seminal works. It was based on the life of his father Seepersad, who was a reporter for the Trinidad Guardian. Naipaul won the 1971 Booker Prize for his novel In a Free State. In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature ""for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories"". Other honours awarded to him throughout his life included the Booker Prize in 1971, the David Cohen Literature Prize in 1993 and a knighthood from the Queen in 1990. Throughout his career he was outspoken, notably criticising the famous novel of E M Forster, A Passage To India, and Tony Blair, who he likened to a pirate at the head of a socialist revolution.

Indeed, at 0.4%, it's growing twice as fast as it was in the first quarter of the year. Fears that the weak growth in the spring would continue into the summer were clearly misplaced. And there's good news when you dig into some of the detail. Business investment is growing by 0.5%, which more than reverses the 0.4% decline in the first quarter. And the services sector which powers the economy had a good quarter. In fact, retail, which has had a torrid few years, actually had the strongest single quarter since 2004. That may be down to the World Cup or the good weather. Either way, it's a relief for those (and there are plenty of them out there today with the travails of House of Fraser) predicting continued strife on the high street. Ian King explains why the long-standing retailer got into difficulties. Now for the bad news. The manufacturing sector is back in recession for the first time since early 2016. True: it had a strong 2017, and there is something arbitrary about the definition of a recession (two successive quarters of contraction). But it is disappointing news nonetheless. Moreover, exports are weak - and the trade picture would look even weaker were it not for weak imports too. Consumer spending is also below expectations. It all adds up to an economy which is firing on perhaps half of its cylinders. Then again, perhaps that is a good result given the circumstances. No one knows what will happen with Brexit. Senior ministers think no deal is the most likely outcome (though not the chancellor). Given that level of uncertainty it's no surprise households and businesses are not spending at a rapid rate. Moreover, economic growth is starting to stutter in Europe as well. In short, nothing to panic about but not much to get excited about either."

But Mr Bridgen told the Sunday Express: ""If Boris is suspended it will be open warfare in the Conservative Party. ""If Theresa May dares engineer a leadership contest while Boris is suspended it will be World War Three."" His comments came as the Tories risked remaining engulfed in a row that is refusing to go away, despite the public appearing to reject any attempt to censure the Uxbridge MP. A ComRes survey for the Sunday Express found 53% opposed to punishing Mr Johnson, against 40% who said he should be disciplined. The poll also found that 60% of those who responded believed rights to free speech were being weakened, compared to just 5% who said they were stronger. It comes after a slim majority (48% to 45%) of people told a Sky Data poll it was not necessary for Mr Johnson to apologise. :: Was burka blunder a gaffe too far for accident-prone Boris Johnson? The ex-cabinet minister refused to comment as he arrived back in England from a holiday in Italy on Saturday night. Speculation is mounting that he will respond in the weekly column he writes for The Daily Telegraph, in which the initial controversial comments were printed last week. The Brexiteer is under fire for claiming Muslim women wearing face veils look like ""letterboxes"" and ""bank robbers"" as he argued against any ban on burkas or niqabs of the type that has been brought in by some EU countries. Conservative chair Brandon Lewis has instructed an independent panel to investigate Mr Johnson following complaints his comments breached the Tories' code of conduct. Fellow Leave campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed on Saturday that critics of Boris Johnson are jealous of his popularity and the investigation could be an attempt to undermine any future leadership bid. The ComRes poll found that Theresa May remained the preferred leader of the Conservatives among the public, by a margin of 26% to 24% opting for Boris Johnson, with 42% supporting ""neither"". Despite the threat of a split in the party over the issue, senior figures continued to speak out. Mr Johnson's own father Stanley Johnson, a former Conservative MEP, was among those to defend his son, but said he should have called for a burka ban. :: Burka ban in Denmark: The women facing fines for what they choose to wear He said: ""Yes, Boris used some colourful language. That's called 'freedom of speech' or it was in my day. ""As a matter of fact, I would have liked him to have gone a bit further. Surely, there are circumstances where a ban or appropriate restrictions would be in order."" David Wall, the secretary of the Midlands Industrial Council, the members of which give millions to the Conservatives every year, said the row was ""an argument over relatively nothing"", and said Mr Johnson should not be disciplined. But former close aide to David Cameron, Lord (Andrew) Cooper, accused Mr Johnson on Saturday of ""casual racism"" and ""courting of fascism"". ""He will advocate literally anything to play to the crowd of the moment. His career is a saga of moral emptiness and lies; pathetic, weak and needy; the opposite of strong,"" Lord Cooper said. And the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said on Saturday that Conservative MPs' support for Boris Johnson over his comments comparing Muslim women in burkas to bank robbers had ""shone a light on the underbelly of Islamophobia"" within the party. Far-right US activist Steve Bannon, who contacted Mr Johnson during a recent visit to Britain, advised his fellow EU opponent not to ""bow at the altar of political correctness"" by apologising."

Monsanto, which makes Roundup and Ranger Pro, has been ordered to pay $289m (£226m) to a dying groundsman who says the product contributed to his cancer. A San Francisco court was told how Dewayne Johnson has a terminal form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma which he claims developed after he worked as a pest control manager at a school. Mr Johnson used the two products while carrying out the duties of his job, his lawyers said. He sprayed large quantities from a 50-gallon tank attached to a truck and during gusty winds the product would cover his face, one of his lawyers, Brent Wisner, told the court. At one point, when a hose broke, the weedkiller covered his entire body. Mr Johnson read the label but said he was never warned the product could cause cancer, Mr Wisner said. In 2014, at the age of 42, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Roundup is widely available in British garden centres and is thought to be the most commonly used weedkiller in the world. It contains glyphosate, a herbicide that has been the subject of huge controversy in the EU where several countries have attempted to bring in a bloc-wide ban, despite the opposition of farmers. Monsanto, a subsidiary of German firm Bayer AG, has denied glyphosate is linked to cancer, saying hundreds of studies have found the product to be safe. Monsanto vice-president Scott Partridge told British consumers the firm's product was safe to use. He said: ""Roundup has been safe for four decades and will continue to be safe. There is no credible scientific evidence that demonstrates otherwise. ""It is completely and totally safe and the public should not be concerned about this verdict, it is one that we will work through the legal process to see if we can get the right result. The science is crystal clear."" Monsanto, which is facing up to 5,000 similar lawsuits across the US, said it would appeal against the verdict. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said on Twitter the verdict had ""huge implications for the food chain"". The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says glyphosate is safe when users follow directions on the label. But the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organisation, classed the chemical as a ""probable human carcinogen"" in 2015. California has also added glyphosate to its list of chemicals known to cause cancer. Several countries around the world have banned it, amid claims it impacts ecosystems. Another leading UK retailer, B&Q, told Sky News: ""We continually aim to manage our garden products responsibly and have a record of acting ahead of legislation where appropriate. We led the way in removing three pesticides in 2013 and neonicotinoids from our flowering plants in 2018. ""We offer alternatives to glyphosates and we are currently undertaking a broader review of all our garden products."""

It said ongoing engineering works in Liverpool, Greater Manchester and Lancashire had caused ""severe difficulties around the short-notice scheduling"" of train crews. Anyone whose journey is delayed by half an hour or more can apply for compensation, Northern said. A spokesman said: ""We are sorry that our customers continue to experience some disruption to their weekend services. ""We are advising anyone thinking of travelling on Sunday on these routes to plan their journey carefully."" In a letter to the rail operator's managing director, Baroness Beverley Hughes said: ""As you are no doubt aware the Mayor has had to write to you, the Secretary of State for Transport and Transport for the North on a number of occasions over the past several months, and has also written to the Prime Minister, regarding what has been a chaotic and unacceptable situation. ""It is disappointing that once again we are having to contact you directly regarding Northern's services failing to meet an adequate standard."" She asked for reassurances that services would run the following Sunday and questioned what urgent steps were being taken to address staff shortages. Northern cut nearly 170 services a day - 6% of the total - in early June after a new timetable introduced in May resulted in disruption for passengers. The operator reintroduced three quarters of the cancelled services last month but commuters have continued to experience problems on the network."

Read out by a family friend, it said: ""He was a faithful husband, loving son and a good friend. ""A childhood friend remarked that Beebo was loved by everyone because he was kind and gentle to each person he met. ""This is a complete shock to us. We are devastated by these events and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together, without him we would be hopeless. ""As the voice recordings show, Beebo's intent was not to harm anyone. He was right in saying that there are so many people who have loved him."" His family also thanked the authorities for being both ""helpful"" and ""respectful"". Mr Russell, a ground service employee with Horizon Air, has not been officially named by authorities but his family have revealed his identity. In a video posted on YouTube last December, Mr Russell shows luggage coming off and being loaded onto aircraft, and describes what the life of a ground service agent entails. ""That means I lift a lot of bags, like a lot of bags, so many bags,"" he says, adding, ""it allows me to do some pretty cool things, too."" There are then shots of trips he took, including flying over Alaskan fjords, visiting lavender fields in France, touring in Yucatan, Mexico, and attending a hurling match in Dublin, Ireland. Mr Russell told an air traffic controller he was ""just a broken man"" minutes before the empty 76-seater Horizon Air plane crashed in dense woodland on Ketron Island on Friday night. Witnesses filmed the passenger plane performing loops and being pursued by two F-15 military jets near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport before it went down. The sheriff's office said they believed the crash was caused by ""doing stunts in [the] air or lack of flying skills"". They said F-15 fighter jets were scrambled from Portland and ""made it within a few minutes of theft of plane"". One witness filmed the plane doing a large loop-the-loop, which they first thought was part of an air show rehearsal. John Waldron told CNN: ""I started to capture video, just because I thought it was, kind of bizarre... [The plane did] a complete loop... I couldn't believe he recovered."" Mr Waldron said the plane at its lowest point was no more than 100ft (30.5m) above the water. He said ""the pilot then pulled pretty much straight up and kind of at an angle"", adding he ""somehow he got it levelled back off and then made his way down toward the island"". As Mr Waldron was preparing to ""run and take cover"", he looked back and ""saw a bright, pinpoint area of flame"". Audio exchanges between an air traffic controller and the pilot, Mr Russell, have been released. In one, the controller can be heard telling the pilot: ""What we don't want to see is you get hurt or anyone else get hurt, so like I said, if you want to land, that's probably the best way to go."" The pilot - who is addressed as ""Rich"" in the recordings - says he's ""got a lot of people that care about me"" and that he was ""just a broken guy"". Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor described the incident as a ""joyride gone terribly wrong"", adding that the pilot ""did something foolish and may well have paid with his life"". Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air officials said they were still working closely with authorities to investigate what happened. ""Safety is our number one goal,"" Alaska Airlines CEO Mr Tilden said. ""Last night's event is going to push us to learn what we can from this tragedy so that we can ensure this does not happen again at Alaska Air Group or at any other airline."" :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

The second attempt on Sunday at 3.31am local time was a success. Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles blasted out in the control centre moments after the team burst into applause at the successful lift-off. The probe will get within 3.8 million miles (6 million kilometres) of the sun's surface after travelling at a record-breaking 430,000 mph. From Earth, it is 93 million miles to the sun (150 million kilometres), and the Parker probe will be within four percent of that distance. It will fly straight through the wispy edges of the corona, or outer solar atmosphere, that were visible during last August's total solar eclipse. ""Fly baby girl, fly!!"" project scientist Nicola Fox of Johns Hopkins University said in a tweet right before liftoff. She urged it to ""go touch the sun!"" A mission to get this close has been on NASA's books since 1958. However the technology to make the spacecraft small and light enough to travel at incredible speeds - while surviving the sun's punishing environment and the extreme changes in temperature - are only now possible. :: Probe will fly closer to the sun than any other man-made object Scientists have devised ways to ensure the automated and unmanned probe does not melt in the extreme heat and radiation. A revolutionary carbon heat shield will protect it, while the tried-but-true practice of using water inside the craft to cool it down is also being utilised. Sensors will make certain the heat shield faces the sun at the right times and it will correct itself if it ends up at the wrong angle. With a communication lag time of 16 minutes each way, the spacecraft must fend for itself at the sun. It will reach Venus in October and will have its first solar encounter in November. The probe will make 24 close approaches to the sun over seven years.

""All I can say is, 'Wow, here we go.' We're in for some learning over the next several years,"" said Dr Parker, who proposed the existence of solar wind - a steady, supersonic stream of particles blasting off the sun - 60 years ago. It is the first time NASA has named a spacecraft after someone still alive. The #ParkerSolarProbe is on a trajectory that will bring it closer to the Sun than any other object created by humanity. pic.twitter.com/uCjhnooVpC The $1.5bn (£1.17bn) project is designed to give scientists a better understanding of solar wind and geomagnetic storms that risk wreaking chaos on Earth by knocking out the power grid. These solar outbursts are poorly understood, but have the potential to wipe out power to millions of people. Experts say a worst-case scenario could cost up to two trillion dollars in the first year alone and take a decade to fully recover from. ""The Parker Solar Probe will help us do a much better job of predicting when a disturbance in the solar wind could hit Earth,"" said Justin Kasper, a project scientist and professor at the University of Michigan. Knowing more about the solar wind and space storms will also help protect future deep space explorers as they journey toward the Moon or Mars. It is said the data gathered by the car-sized probe will ""revolutionise"" our understanding of the star, which has a huge impact on Earth."

The US centennial commission has a similar appeal. There were 1,400 British bell ringers among the millions who lost their lives in the Great War and the hope is that 1,400 new ringers can be found. ""Its a wonderful sound that can go through every village, every town and every city,"" says Graham Nabb, who has been ringing bells for 54 years, and now teaches people how to do it. ""It's a wonderful way of remembering those that went to war and those that died. Bells are great messengers."" At St Mary the Virgin church in Pillerton Hersey, Mr Nabb's team of bell ringers are practising hard to be ready to join thousands of others on 11 November. On the ancient walls are the names of the men from this Warwickshire village who went to fight. Back then, men mainly rang church bells. But, with them on the front line, they were rarely heard. Across the UK, training is going well, but they still need more people. ""What we are finding is people are stepping forward in their communities today who have a direct or indirect connection to people from 100 years ago,"" says Christopher O' Mahoney, president of the Central Council of Church Bellringers. ""So far enquiries have been fantastic for this campaign, so many volunteers, male, female, old, young, short and tall, it doesn't matter, people are stepping forward to help with this amazing campaign."" Ryan Kirby, 16, who took up bell ringing three years ago, said: ""The hard part is trying to remember the methods used, the fun part is just ringing them."" Yvonne Kennedy, who took up bell ringing when she retired, thinks it helped with her fitness levels, and she finds it very sociable. ""I didn't find it easy to start with,"" she says, ""but perseverance and people around me helped so we actually learned to do it properly."" It can take about 10-15 hours of training to learn how to bell ring. On Armistice Day the aim is to strike a sombre tone in remembrance of the dead, moving to a more celebratory sound to mark the peace that now exists between former enemies."

But Stanley Johnson told Sky News that much of the criticism was ""synthetic indignation"" that had been ""whipped up"" by his opponents. The debate needed to move on from ""letterboxes and so on and so forth"", Mr Johnson added, because the ""real issue"" was whether it was ""appropriate to restrict the use of the burka or the niqab in certain circumstances"". ""I think we should all be grateful to Boris because he's put this issue on the table,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It's a matter of common sense. It seems to me, [that] if you're a doctor or a nurse, or a school teacher, if you're a female airline pilot for heaven's sake, there must be restrictions, and it seems to me absolutely right that we should use this occasion and look again at where we stand on this issue."" Asked whether he understood why his son's choice of language had caused offence, he said: ""I don't really believe this. ""I mean, I've seen a lot of synthetic indignation, I've seen a lot of politicians who might be opposed to Boris for other reasons, like you know they're Labour as opposed to Conservatives, or Remainers as opposed to Brexit, whipping it all up."" Mr Johnson also said his son's article ""didn't go far enough"", adding: ""I would have preferred Boris to say, look, the moment has come for a very serious debate about this."" Referring to an inquiry into his son's remarks, the former Conservative MEP said the ""hierarchy of the Tory party"" had ""collectively lost its senses"" by launching a preliminary investigation into the former foreign secretary, describing the process as a ""kangaroo court"". His comments echo criticisms made by Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who told Sky News the disciplinary process was ""unfair"" because both party chairman Brandon Lewis and Prime Minister Theresa May had criticised Mr Johnson before the investigation was launched. Mr Rees-Mogg went on to suggest the process was a bungled attempt to undermine Boris Johnson's future leadership ambitions. But writing in The Mail on Sunday, Theresa May's former de-facto deputy, Damian Green, defended the approach the party had taken. ""While I disagree that it amounted to a breach of party rules - it was an MP commenting on a current political issue, and if we can't do that, what are we for? - it was right for party chairman Brandon Lewis to ask for an apology,"" Mr Green wrote. ""At least Boris was right to also say in his column that banning the burka would be wrong. It is un-British to start telling women what they can and can't wear."" The former first secretary of state also warned Boris Johnson against pursuing what he described as the ""populist option"". ""I am particularly concerned by reports that President Trump's sacked adviser Steve Bannon is forming a Europe-wide far-right campaign group and has been in touch with Boris,"" he said. ""My fear now is that Boris is being turned into a martyr by the alt-right."" He added: ""Some commentators have urged him to go 'the full Trump'. ""They want him to be the frontman for this type of politics, shooting from the hip and always choosing the populist option. ""This would be a disaster, for him and the Conservative Party. The Conservatives must never give the impression we exclude any group of British citizens"". On Saturday, a former aide to David Cameron, Lord Andrew Cooper, accused Mr Johnson of ""casual racism"" and the ""courting of fascism"", while the Muslim Council of Britain said the fact that some Conservative MPs did not believe there was a need for Mr Johnson to make an apology had ""shone a light on the underbelly of Islamophobia"" within the party. That view was echoed by shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who wrote in the Sunday Mirror: ""Johnson's remarks and support form acolytes such as Andrew Bridgen, Nadine Dorries and Ben Bradley prove that intolerant opinion has a strong hold to this day in the Tory party."" Boris Johnson has yet to issue a formal response to the controversy, but a source close to the former foreign secretary has insisted he has no intention of apologising for the language used. The source also suggested Mr Johnson had received private messages of support from a number of ""senior Tory figures"", although it was unclear whether they included any members of the cabinet. Mr Johnson was seen arriving back at his Oxfordshire home on Saturday evening. His next column is expected to be published in The Daily Telegraph on Sunday evening. Asked whether he thought the former foreign secretary would return to the issue of the burka, his father Stanley said: ""I very much doubt if his column is going to focus on the burka. ""It's time we moved on from the burka to wider issues. I mean he might go down the road of Sharia courts, for example. ""I personally am very keen that we get a grip on the whole halal question."""

Her 18-month-old daughter and her mother were also dead - three generations of one family. The atrocity touched three nations - claiming the lives of three children from County Donegal in the Irish Republic and two Spanish tourists. For the first time in the history of the conflict, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams publicly condemned an act of violence. Within days of the bombing, a photograph emerged of a Spanish man with a child on his shoulders, pictured smiling beside a red car. The child had survived but the man was dead - killed by the bomb in the red car. To this day, questions remain about the level of intelligence police had in advance and about the standard of their subsequent investigation. There has only been one conviction but it was quashed on appeal. The case against another man facing 29 murder charges collapsed. In 2009, the families won a landmark £1.6 million civil action against four defendants but have never received a penny of it. So this year, like every year, they will gather in the memorial garden, still grieving their dead and still campaigning for justice. They describe it as ""an act of remembrance"" but Omagh is a town that could never forget."

He said: ""I don't think the full criminal justice deserts that these people should have will probably come their way. ""But if evidence emerges or if technology and science develops that means that we can exploit better the over 2,000 exhibits we have in this case then we'll do that. ""We'll do not just what's required of us but we will do it enthusiastically. It's the least the families and the relatives deserve."" The chief constable was speaking before a memorial service for the victims of the bombing, which happened on 15 August 1998. Twenty-nine people were killed, including a woman pregnant with twins, when the 500lb car bomb tore through Omagh just four months after the Good Friday Agreement had been signed. Inaccurate telephone warnings resulted in people being evacuated directly into the path of the blast. The death toll was the highest from a single incident in 30 years of violence. The atrocity touched three nations - claiming the lives of three children from County Donegal in the Irish Republic and two Spanish tourists. For the first time in the history of the conflict, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams publicly condemned an act of violence. There has only been one conviction but it was quashed on appeal. The case against another man facing 29 murder charges collapsed.   In 2009, the families won a landmark £1.6m civil action against four defendants but have never received a penny of it. The inter-denominational service took place in the town's memorial garden, and included songs and readings from choirs. One of those singing with the Omagh Community Youth Choir is Cara McGillion, the 17-year-old daughter of Donna Marie and Garry, who were left seriously injured in the attack. Michael Gallagher, whose son was one of the victims, paid tribute to all those killed during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Mr Gallagher said Northern Ireland was facing its greatest challenges ahead. He called on the political parties to seek agreement ""so that we can move forward"". ""Working alone we can achieve very little but in collaborative ventures we can achieve a great deal,"" he added. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was criticised for not attending the service, as was Secretary of State Karen Bradley."

Ryan Ali and Ryan Hale were both briefly knocked out and Ali suffered a fractured eye socket. Stokes claimed he was defending himself and that he intervened because Ali and Hale had been abusing two gay men. And the jury has agreed with him. Being found not guilty of affray will end any debate about Stokes' future with England, whereas a conviction would have put the ECB under pressure to impose a temporary or permanent ban. All of those involved had just left the Mbargo nightclub in the early hours of the morning. The trial lasted six days, but the affair has cast a shadow over the England cricket team for almost a year. On 24 September, England had beaten the West Indies in a one day match in Bristol and many of the team headed into the city centre for a celebratory night out. CCTV showed them arriving at the Mbargo nightclub, and they stayed for just over an hour before moving on elsewhere. But Stokes and teammate Alex Hales decided to return just after 2am. They were told by the doorman Andrew Cunningham that they were too late, the club was closing. The bouncer testified that Stokes became abusive and lingered in the doorway, mimicking the voices and mannerisms of two gay men who were leaving the club. A few minutes later a fight broke out. It was filmed by a student from his flat overlooking the scene who sold the video to The Sun. When it appeared in print and online, the England and Wales Cricket Board dropped Stokes from the squad to tour Australia. Mike Atherton, the former England captain who now writes for The Times and commentates for Sky Sports, says Stokes is the ""heartbeat of the side"" and a crucial member of the team. ""He's a wonderful cricketer. He's basically three cricketers in one,"" he said. ""A fantastic bowler, a batsman who plays in the top six, world class fielder around the bat and as a catcher. ""Those kind of cricketers don't come around very often, England have had a handful over the years. Botham, Flintoff and Stokes is certainly in that category."" Atherton says Stokes was hugely missed in Australia, where England were thrashed 4-0, and that the ECB's board of directors had disagreed over whether they should allow Stokes to play while under investigation for causing actual bodily harm. Stokes was eventually charged with affray, and because he was intending to plead not guilty, he was reinstated to the team. Just two days before the start of the trial he helped England beat India with a match-winning display of bowling. On the first morning of the trial, Judge Peter Blair rejected a late attempt by the prosecution to add a charge of causing actual bodily harm to Stokes' indictment. Barrister and legal commentator Jeremy Brier told Sky News that affray was ""the classic pub brawl charge"" where it is not clear exactly what happened and how injuries were caused, but the Crown must prove that members of the public would have feared for their own safety. Though the trial has been embarrassing, it could have been even worse for the ECB. The court saw video and was told how Hales had kicked Ryan Ali in the head while he was lying on the ground. Hales could also be heard telling the police officer who arrested Stokes that he had arrived after the fight had occurred. But although he was questioned under caution, Hales was not charged with an offence."

""Please have some consideration where you park the ambulance!"" the note said. ""This is not the first time."" East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust criticised the ""rude"" note and said the crew parked as ""considerately as possible"" in the early hours of the morning. Lee Brentnall, paramedic and ambulance operations manager for Leicestershire, said: ""It is so disappointing to see that a rude note has yet again been left on one of our ambulances. ""This upsets our dedicated ambulance crews when they are trying to help our patients and do their job. ""Leaving a note will not resolve the situation as we are unlikely to see it until we are leaving in the ambulance to take the patient to hospital or to go to our next job.""

Mr Brentnall added: ""Our crews are approachable. If you genuinely need to leave your house urgently and we are blocking your access, please come and knock on the door where the emergency is taking place. ""Sometimes we will be able to move the vehicle, for example if we are treating a patient but they do not need both of us there at the time.

In a statement, the group said the stunt on Crosby Beach was ""aimed at raising awareness of the potential threat to sex-based rights and women's rights"" posed by proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act. Depending on the outcome of a government consultation, the act may allow transgender people to achieve legal recognition without a medical diagnosis. Several European countries, including Ireland and Portugal, already allow transgender people to legally self-identify. Liverpool ReSisters claims changing the law in the UK would leave women vulnerable to violence due to a lack of female-only spaces, adding that it would ""open the doors for any and all male-bodied individuals to access female-only spaces just on his word alone"". Twelve local trans rights groups - including Big Love Sista and Liverpool Queer Collective - have condemned their stance and the sticker campaign, labelling it as transphobic. In a joint response posted on Instagram, the groups say ""there is no room for hate against trans people"" in the city, and that they ""condemn the behaviour, hate and transphobia of Liverpool ReSisters"". Their statement has been backed by Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson, who said his office would work with police to ensure the stickers were removed and identify those responsible. He tweeted: ""Liverpool takes #PRIDE in its diversity and history of fighting for equality for all, we love all our trans residents and all our LGBT community."" Other Twitter users have also criticised the sticker stunt, with one describing it as ""hate speech"" and another saying that it was ""nothing more than transphobia"". Merseyside Police have confirmed enquiries are being made over the campaign, which saw dozens of the 100 iron men statues plastered with offending stickers. The statues are spread across two miles of the coastline, reaching just over half a mile out to sea."

XPO operated depots in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, and Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, to handle all deliveries to House of Fraser customers' homes and stores. House of Fraser collapsed earlier this month and was bought from the administrator by Mike Ashley, the billionaire owner of Sports Direct and Newcastle United, for £90m. Mr Ashley has said he will not pay creditors for debts prior to his takeover. Alan Costello, GMB organiser, said: ""This is a massive blow to our members based at depots in Wellingbrough and Milton Keynes who have been left in limbo. ""It's time for Mike Ashley to show that his rescue plan for House of Fraser is not simply a plan to boost his bank balance at the expense of House of Fraser workers and our members."" Mulberry, another House of Fraser supplier, issued a profit warning on Monday, saying it would take a £3m hit to its profit because of the chain store's collapse. The luxury handbag maker is owned £2.4m. House of Fraser's administrators Ernst & Young (EY) said the store owed millions to its creditors before its collapse, with companies like Versace, Gucci and Prada among the big names out of pocket. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser in a ""pre-packaged administration"", which means he can drop certain liabilities through the insolvency process. Most of the money will be used by the administrators to pay banks and bondholders. Mr Ashley has said he will save around 47 of House of Fraser's 59 stores, and he plans to transform the retailer into the ""Harrods of the high street"".

2018-08-17,"One of the world's most successful businessmen, Richard Branson, has achieved extraordinary things in his career. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180821114911/https://news.sky.com/story/i-flunked-my-exams-but-still-made-it-big-richard-bransons-tips-for-success-11473547,"Despite leaving school at 16, the man behind Virgin has a net worth of $5bn (£3.9bn). Here he explains why you can achieve anything you want - even if you don't go to university. If you didn't get the grades you needed, try not to worry too much and know that you are not alone. I flunked my exams and left school at the age of 16. I didn't go to university and I can recall little of what was on the blackboard when I was a teenager - I am dyslexic and it was all a bit of a jumble to me. But there is much to be positive about. Exams don't measure skills like creating, delegating, reasoning, exploring, communicating and positively influencing - essential skills that the world needs. Dyslexics naturally excel at these ways of thinking, so we should value and celebrate this. I found school really difficult, but when I started a business I realised that actually dyslexia was my biggest strength. It has taught me to keep things simple, to rise above difficulties and to focus on what I'm good at. Looking back over my life, one of the most important lessons I have ever learned is to fail. And fail again. Only through failure do we ever learn anything new - and only once you learn to stop fearing failure do you really start to succeed. The key to success isn't your exam results, but the goals you set yourself. Think about what you're good at and what you enjoy. Pursue your passions doggedly and never stop trying new things. I set myself long-term goals and short-term goals and write them down. Don't make your goals about money or about what you can buy, but things that you can learn or things that interest you. You increase your value in all walks of life by expanding what you're capable of. It also gives you a real kick when you get to tick them off, and motivates you to keep going. It really saddens me that so many children get left behind by our education system - it's such a waste of untapped potential. I want to see education reimagined to support creative minds and alternative thinkers. I don't want children with dyslexia (or any other disability) to feel at a disadvantage because they think in a different way to other children - this is a talent that should be nurtured. I want to see possibilities explored and children having adventures. This is my main motivation for taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge in a few weeks' time. I've been training hard on the tennis court and cycling whenever I have the chance. We will be raising money for Big Change; a charity that helps set young people up to thrive in life, not just exams. Prevention is better than treating symptoms - it's easier to build stronger children than it is to fix broken adults. Unless we support innovation, change will not happen. I want to see every child supported and their talents nurtured. Whether you got the grades you wanted or not, if you do what you love and what you are naturally good at, it will take you far in life. It certainly has for me. And remember, the alphabet runs from A to Z, not A to C."

The closures were due to take place under a Company Voluntary Arrangement CVA - a controversial insolvency mechanism which has been deployed by retailers including Carpetright, Mothercare and New Look this year. But this plan fell by the wayside once the 169-year-old department chain store fell into administration. Within hours of the company entering administration, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley agreed a £90m cash buyout of the struggling chain. James Keany, at CBRE, the real estate services and investment firm which is advising Sports Direct on all property-related matters regarding HoF, said of the agreement to keep the Oxford Street store open: ""This deal only happened because all parties realised it was better to keep the store open and fully operational. ""It was a real case of landlord and tenant genuinely working together and at great speed. ""Everyone was sensible about the terms of the transaction."" It is the first deal to be agreed on a House of Fraser store since Sports Direct stepped in earlier this month. It is unclear how many of the other 30 stores which were in line for the axe will stay open. Mr Ashley pledged at the time that he would do his best ""to keep as many stores open as possible"" - adding it was his ambition ""to transform House of Fraser into the Harrods of the high street"". Michael Murray, Sports Direct's head of elevation, suggested the speed with which the deal was struck showed a commitment to turn around the House of Fraser business. He said: ""We said we would keep as many stores open as possible, and in less than a week we have saved the biggest store. ""Oxford Street was meant to close in January and now it's safe, which is great news for all parties. ""Everyone must remember it was a bust business and we need landlords, councils and brands to pull together to save House of Fraser on the high street."" Last week HoF's administrators Ernst & Young (EY) revealed the chain owed £484m to its creditors, including designers like Gucci, Armani and Diesel before its collapse. This includes £2.4m to luxury handbag maker Mulberry, which operates 21 House of Fraser concessions. It warned it was expecting to take a £3m hit to its profits after the collapse of the high street retailer. Mulberry shares fell by as much as 30% on Monday after the profit warning."

Some journeys are expected to take almost four times longer than normal as people embark on late summer getaways, with the sheer number of vehicles offering ""huge potential"" for congestion on major roads. Traffic information supplier Inrix predicts that the M5 between junctions four and one in the West Midlands will be the most delayed route, with typical travel times of 21 minutes to leap to upwards of an hour on Friday afternoon. Journeys could also reach the hour mark between junctions 22 and 25 of the M1 in the East Midlands on Saturday. Other stretches of road where jams are anticipated include the M20 from junction nine to junction three between 7.30am and 9.30am on Friday, the M6 from junction 28 to junction 32 between 12pm and 3pm on Friday, and the M5 from junction 22 to junction 20 between 2pm and 4.30pm on Saturday. RAC traffic spokesman Rod Dennis said the Almondsbury interchange in Bristol, where the M5 meets the M4, was ""the perfect recipe for a long wait on the motorway"". The likelihood of problems could be exacerbated should there be any delays in the planned completion or lifting of hundreds of miles of roadworks before the end of the week. Highways England is preparing to halt more than 300 miles of roadworks from motorways and major A roads from Friday morning, but any setbacks could cause misery for holidaymakers and commuters alike. Inrix is advising motorists to set off between 10am and 1pm on Friday to avoid a potential clash with people heading to work, but on other days they should leave as early or as late as possible."

They related to the former West Yorkshire Police chief inspector telling alleged lies about his involvement in the aftermath of Hillsborough and the culpability of fans. Sir Norman said his continued insistence he did nothing wrong had been ""vindicated"". Ninety-six people died in a crush at the Sheffield Wednesday stadium on April 15 1989 before an FA Cup semi-final. An inquest jury ruled in 2016 they were unlawfully killed. Sir Norman, 62, was at the game but was off duty, attending as a spectator. In the aftermath of the tragedy, he was tasked with finding material for police lawyers to present to the public inquiry, led by Lord Justice Taylor. He later applied for the job of chief constable in Merseyside - an appointment that caused controversy when it emerged he had not mentioned his work on Hillsborough in the application form. The four charges included accusations Sir Norman falsely described his role in the response as ""peripheral"" and that he lied about never having having tried to shift blame for the disaster ""on to the shoulders of Liverpool supporters"". He was also accused of two further claims of saying he never ""besmirched"" Liverpool fans and never offering any interpretation other than that the behaviour of Liverpool fans did not cause the disaster. Speaking outside Preston Crown Court, Sir Norman said nothing in his experience of the inquest or subsequent charges had ""done anything"" to diminish the sympathy he felt for Hillsborough victims and their families. ""I've been forced to deny strenuously that I have done anything wrong in the aftermath of the disaster and today's outcome vindicates that position,"" he said. ""Six years ago I was driven from the job that had been my vocation for 40 years. ""And some commentators who didn't really know anything about me or the facts, rushed to judgement and pre-determined my guilt. ""But something I learned early in my police service is that no injustice was ever satisfactorily resolved through being unjust."" Explaining the decision to stop criminal proceedings against him, CPS director of legal services Sue Hemming said there had been ""significant developments which have affected the available evidence"" since he was charged in June 2017. Two witnesses had changed their evidence and a third had died, she added. ""Our latest review of the evidence has concluded the collective impact of these developments means there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction,"" Ms Hemming said. ""I appreciate this news will be disappointing for the families and the CPS will meet with them in person to explain the decision."" Five other men, including Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield, are due to face trial for offences related to the disaster next year. Due to the ongoing cases, Ms Hemming said it was ""extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information which could in any way prejudice those proceedings""."

He was given a further three years on licence. The court heard that his first victim was 13 years old when he raped her in 2012. Ampadu raped his second victim, aged 12, in a park in Greenwich in 2015 after the pair were introduced by a male relative. He raped her on a further four occasions, including in a car park, and was also found guilty of sexually assaulting her.In October 2016, he raped a 15-year-old girl in the stairwell of a block of flats and at his home address. He filmed the second attack on his mobile phone.Ampadu used fear and intimidation to control all of his victims, police said. Detective Constable Amy Beautridge said: ""The three young victims in this case have shown immense courage and bravery; not only in coming forward to report these despicable crimes, but also in seeing the investigation through to court. ""Their actions have helped to ensure that a dangerous, sexual predator has been removed from the streets and that he is no longer in a position to harm other young girls. ""I hope today's sentence gives the victims some closure and that they are able to move forward with their lives."""
2018-08-17,"Households have fallen behind on essential bills like council tax and electricity by as much as £18bn, according to Citizens Advice, which says ""families are living in fear"" of bailiffs turning up.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180821114911/https://news.sky.com/story/families-living-in-fear-of-bailiffs-as-household-debt-level-hits-19bn-11478231,"The charity said it receives a call from someone with a bailiff-related issue every three minutes. It helped more than 690,000 people with household bill problems last year, and said missed bill payments had overtaken credit card troubles as the main issue faced by consumers. It found the biggest household debt is tax credit overpayments at £7.47bn, which needs to be repaid. This is followed by council tax (£2.84bn); benefit overpayments (£2.66bn); water bills £2.20bn); rent arrears (£1.42bn), electricity and gas (£1.09bn); telecoms (£630m) and fines, fixed penalties and compensation orders (£610m). The charity said an elderly couple who owed £700 in council tax are now afraid to open their front door after having a visit from bailiffs who were aggressive and threatened to call the police. In another case, a man receiving cancer treatment who had missed a £30 parking fine found bailiffs in his home removing his belongings. Citizens Advice wants tougher regulation and has called for a bailiff regulator ""to fix this broken system"". Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Families are living in fear of a visit from the bailiffs, and small missed bills can skyrocket through excessive enforcement fees."" The Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, said local authorities have a duty to collect taxes which fund essential services. A wide-ranging study by the City watchdog suggests those in the countryside are more satisfied with their financial circumstances. Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: ""Councils understand the pressures some households are under and will support people who are in financial difficulty wherever possible."" Russell Hamblin-Boone, chief executive of the Civil Enforcement Association, which represents bailiffs, said only 18% of the debt identified by Citizens Advice qualified for action by bailiffs. He said: ""A visit by an enforcement agent is always the last resort. ""Agents are highly trained and must follow a process set out in detailed regulations to ensure that they collect unpaid council tax and court fines fairly. ""We work closely with the voluntary sector and under the regulations people are sign posted to debt advice, which accounts for the increase in numbers. ""But if anyone has strong evidence of bad practice we will investigate."" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said it does not use bailiffs to collect tax credit overpayments. ""We understand people get very worried about debt,"" a spokesperson said. ""We do all we can to help by working with them to pay back debts over time. ""Our advice to anyone struggling with debt is to get in touch so we can help them. ""HMRC has safeguards in place to ensure that repayment of tax credits debt is affordable. ""For customers who do not have an ongoing tax credit award, HMRC makes payment arrangements so the debt can be reduced in a fair and manageable way."""

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the number of cases of the highly infectious disease are at their highest since 2010. France, Georgia, Greece, Italy, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine have had more than 1,000 cases each so far in 2018. But Ukraine has been the hardest hit, with more than 23,000 people affected. Public Health England (PHE) has issued a warning to people travelling to countries where there have been outbreaks to make sure they are up to date with their measles, bumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination before travel. The health body said that from 1 January to 13 August there were 828 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England and many have been linked to current outbreaks in Europe. Some 58% of confirmed cases have been among children aged 15 and younger who did not have the MMR vaccine when they were younger. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""We have seen a number of measles outbreaks in England which are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe. ""The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children. ""Anyone who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had two doses should contact their GP practice to catch up. ""We would encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks, heading to large gatherings such as festivals, or before starting university."" Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe, added: ""Following the decade's lowest number of cases in 2016, we are seeing a dramatic increase in infections and extended outbreaks. ""We call on all countries to immediately implement broad, context-appropriate measures to stop further spread of this disease."" Early signs of measles include cold-like symptoms, sore eyes that may be sensitive to light, fever and small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks. A few days later a blotchy red-brown rash will appear, usually starting on the head or neck."
2018-08-17,Jeremy Hunt will use his first speech as foreign secretary to call for further sanctions on Russia in response to the Salisbury novichok poisonings.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180821114911/https://news.sky.com/story/foreign-secretary-jeremy-hunt-to-call-for-more-sanctions-on-russia-11478080,"In a wide ranging address in Washington, he will say Vladimir Putin has made the world a more dangerous place and will warn of the dangers of a ""messy divorce"" from the EU. He will also criticise China for failing to help the West tackle Russia and highlight the role fake news plays in corroding faith in democracy. With regards to the diplomatic spat with Russia, caused by the novichok nerve agent attacks, he will say: ""Russia's aggressive and malign behaviour undermines the international order that keeps us safe. ""Of course we must engage with Moscow, but we must also be blunt: Russia's foreign policy under President Putin has made the world a more dangerous place. ""And today the United Kingdom asks its allies to go further by calling on the European Union to ensure its sanctions against Russia are comprehensive, and that we truly stand shoulder to shoulder with the US. ""That means calling out and responding to transgressions with one voice whenever and wherever they occur, from the streets of Salisbury to the fate of Crimea."" Last month President Trump accused Berlin of being a ""captive of the Russians"" because of its dependence on energy supplies from the east. Mr Hunt will also address Brexit by telling an audience at the US Institute of Peace that ""one of the biggest threats to European unity would be a chaotic no-deal Brexit"". ""Britain would, of course, find a way to prosper and we have faced many greater challenges in our history,"" he will add. ""But the risk of a messy divorce, as opposed to the friendship we seek, would be a fissure in relations between European allies that would take a generation to heal."" Mr Hunt will travel on to New York where he will address the United Nations Security Council on UK and US military co-operation in the fight against Islamic State."
2018-08-17,"Cities in the UK are facing a bed bug epidemic, experts have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180821114911/https://news.sky.com/story/british-cities-face-a-bed-bug-epidemic-experts-say-11478036,"There has been a ""vast increase"" in the number of reported infestations of the pest this summer, according to CCS pest control manager Karen Henningham. She echoed the concerns of other pest control experts, who have observed a steady increase in bed bugs since the 1990s and believe the summer heatwave may have caused a dramatic boost in their numbers this year. ""It's our number one treatment,"" she said. ""They're very hard to eradicate. All you need is one egg and they just multiply. They're very hard to kill."" Bed bugs thrive in warm, damp conditions, and they will happily live in clothes, sofas and furniture other than beds - meaning they can be picked up on public transport, planes or in other public places. Some believe a boom in low-cost travel may be responsible for a rise in recent years. For Max and Laura (not their real names), the appearance of tiny red bites in late July were the first sign of a problem. ""We ignored it for a bit,"" Max told Sky News. ""We thought it might be mosquitoes. Then we lifted up the mattress, and discovered all sorts of horrible things - big ones, eggs, small ones. It was really gross."" They took the bed apart and washed everything with boiling water, moving to an airbed in the living room. But, even after the mattress was treated with pest control measures, the creatures returned. The couple have now invested in a bug-proof mattress cover and are hopeful that the ""psychological torture"" could be at an end. But they're painfully aware of the steep cost of what they've come to call the ""war on bugs"". ""We're lucky enough to have the time and money to get pest control in and sort it out,"" Max said. ""If we didn't have that - and many people don't - we might just be stuck with them."" Ms Henningham said it is possible to fight bed bugs on a budget, suggesting those with concerns should wash fabrics at high temperatures, hoover beds, and remain vigilant for any sign of the creatures. They are born colourless, but turn a dark red brown as they fill with blood sucked from the human beings they live with. In many cases, however, only intensive professional procedures will completely eradicate the pests. ""A wooden headboard is a breeding ground. They can get into the floorboards,"" Ms Henningham said. ""We recently visited a property and it looked like someone had been shot - but it was the bugs that had been squashed."""

Staff could also be seen rubbing out information as it changed to update it with black and red marker pens. The screen failure is affecting both the North and South terminals at the airport. Gatwick Airport tweeted: ""We are sorry, but due to an IT issue our flight information is not displaying correctly. Please use the temporary flight boards in the departure lounges or listen for airline flight announcements. ""We are expecting to resolve the issue soon and apologise for the inconvenience."" There was frustration among some passengers who described walking to wrong gates or having their flights delayed. A Gatwick spokesperson said a ""handful of people had missed their flights"" as a result of the problem. August is one of the busiest periods of the year for the West Sussex airport as many families embark on summer holidays. A user by the name of @helenwalsh tweeted: ""Absolute carnage @Gatwick_Airport with no boards working and no staff with gate info."" @robfahey posted a photo of people waiting by a whiteboard and wrote: ""This tiny whiteboard is the only departures information in Gatwick Airport right now; every screen is offline. Utter chaos. This is a signature flourish at the end of a short trip that's been full of reminders of how badly the UK's infrastructure is crumbling."" Other passengers praised the efforts of staff members for trying to keep the flight schedule on track. The spokesperson told Sky News: ""Due to an ongoing issue with Vodafone, a provider of IT services for Gatwick, flight information is not being displayed correctly on the airport's digital screens and is currently being displayed manually in the terminals. ""Gatwick would like to apologise to any passengers affected and expects Vodafone to resolve the issue as soon as possible."""

She told him the meal, which is made of brown rice and red kidney beans with aubergine and bell peppers in a coconut ""jerk-style"" sauce, was ""not okay"". Oliver's statement said: ""I've worked with flavours and spices from all over the world my whole career, learning and drawing inspiration from different countries and cultures to give a fresh twist to the food we eat every day. ""When I named the rice my intention was only to show where my inspiration came from."" The row centres over whether Oliver's rice is really jerk, which is traditionally a blend of spices used to flavour meat. It originated in Jamaica but has many different versions. Ms Butler wrote on Twitter that she wondered if Mr Oliver ""knows what Jamaican jerk actually is"". ""It's not just a word you put before stuff to sell products,"" she said. ""Your jerk rice is not ok. This appropriation from Jamaica needs to stop."" :: Food sensitivities - which traditional dishes have proved divisive? Ms Butler said that Levi Roots, the Jamaican chef behind Reggae Reggae sauce, should ""do a masterclass"". Weighing into the row, Mr Roots said: ""I do think it was a mistake by his team."" Tory MP Neil O'Brien hit back, saying: ""If Jamie Oliver isn't allowed to make jerk chicken because it's cultural 'appropriation' she's going to go mad when she finds out about 'Jamie's Italy'."" Social media users are divided on the issue. Comedian and author Shappi Khorsandi said food was an ""emotional issue"" and that the word Persian is ""slapped on any old dish"". Seriously though...Food is an emotional issue. If Jamie Oliver brought out ‘Persian microwaveable baghali polo’ I’d combust. As it is I’ve seen the word ‘Persian’ slapped on any old dish with pomegranate in it. How Bangladeshis and Indians cope I do not know. https://t.co/8lSZSgjva7 For anyone who is unbothered about @jamieoliver and his Jerk rice let me tell you in Jamaica there is NO such thing as jerk rice only jerk pork or chicken. Others complained the row was ""ridiculous"" and said the term ""jerk"" actually comes from Latin America. You do realize the culinary term  “Jerk” is actually Latin American, and it means dried flesh. This Jamie Oliver row is ridiculous. People of different nationalities should be allowed to cook & explore dishes from various backgrounds it's how food progresses, it's how ideas are spread. Don't make this about race when it's literally about rice. #JamieOliver It comes after Malaysia's ex-prime minister entered a row over a chicken dish that was criticised on MasterChef for not being ""crispy"". Gregg Wallace, one of the show's judges, said the Malaysian-born contestant's chicken rendang curry was flawed. Malaysia's then prime minister Najib Razak hit back after a social media storm, tweeting a picture of the curry along with the words: ""Does anyone eat chicken rendang 'crispy'? #MalaysianFood""."

In a letter seen by The Times newspaper, the group's chief executive Chris Hopson said ""the entire supply chain of pharmaceuticals could be adversely affected"" in the event of a ""no deal"" or ""hard"" Brexit. He warns that ""public health and disease control coordination could also suffer"" and efforts to attract the ""European workforce on which the NHS relies could also be jeopardised"". The letter was sent on Friday to Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, and Ian Dalton, chief executive of NHS Improvement, The Times said. It has also been seen by officials at the Department of Health. Mr Hopson wrote that NHS trusts were being ""hampered"" in their work to plan for a ""no deal"" or ""hard"" Brexit because of ""the lack of visible and appropriate communication"". He called for ministers and NHS bodies to work out a national contingency plan, rather than expecting trusts to develop plans individually ""in a vacuum and have to reinvent the wheel 229 times"" - the number of NHS trusts in England. Poor national coordination could mean ""both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices"", Mr Hopson added. Last month Mr Stevens said ""extensive"" planning was taking place to prepare for a ""no deal"" Brexit, including ""around securing medicine supply and equipment"". International Trade Secretary Liam Fox admitted expressing fears of drug shortages in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit is not ""scaremongering"" and that there ""legitimate concerns"". However, he insisted government plans will ""mitigate those particular risks"" and ""we musn't overplay"" the issue. Speaking to Sky News, Dr Fox also warned the EU about the impact of achieving no divorce deal with the UK. He said: ""If the EU decides it wants to put the ideological purity of the bureaucracy of Brussels ahead of the wellbeing of the people of Europe, it will be a very big signal to the rest of the world about exactly where Europe is heading. ""There are some concerns about what does the EU27 look like without British influence."" Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is due to travel to Brussels on Tuesday for a further round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Raab said while he believed a deal was still ""by far the most likely outcome"" of the negotiations, a responsible government needed to set out the steps it was taking to mitigate the risks of no deal. An NHS spokesman said: ""Ensuring the NHS is prepared for every potential outcome of Brexit is a priority. ""Government leads on contingency planning for different scenarios and we are working with them on this and ensuring NHS voices are heard. ""We will be working with our colleagues and partners across the NHS to ensure plans are well progressed, and will provide the NHS with the support it needs."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are confident of reaching a deal with the EU that benefits patients and the NHS, but we are preparing for all situations, including in the unlikely event of no deal, so there is no disruption to patients."""

A damning report by Lord Kerslake found the fire service ""played no meaningful role"" in the aftermath of the explosion, describing the failure as ""extraordinary"" and ""incredible"". Firefighters attended the scene more than two hours after the attack - even though crews heard the blast and were stationed half a mile away. Speaking for the first time about the incident, Mr O'Reilly told The Irish News he will ""always regret"" that fire crews were not there within minutes of the attack. But he said the service was left in an ""information vacuum"" because Greater Manchester Police (GMP) did not follow ""proper protocols"" on how emergency services should work together during terror attacks. ""On the night in question, I believe the fire service should have been there,"" he said. ""We had worked very, very closely with our colleagues in the ambulance service to train our firefighters up. We had trained our staff up to respond to terrorist attacks. Twenty two people were killed in the suicide bombing after an Ariana Grande concert ""They weren't able to do that, simply because police didn't live up to their responsibilities of having a conversation with the fire service. If they did, we would have been there."" Mr O'Reilly said, amid reports of a possible ""active shooter"" at the scene, police did not liaise with fire and ambulance officials to help them assess the threat level and deploy crews accordingly. This led the fire service to hold back, he claimed, assembling at a distance in case of an escalating firearms attack. Mr O'Reilly - who retired earlier this year from his £155,000 post as chief fire officer - also criticised the Kerslake report's examination of the emergency response, saying it failed to properly question how police acted against guidelines. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device after an Ariana Grande concert on May 22 last year. The panel of experts who authored the Kerslake report stated they were not able to say whether earlier arrival of the fire service would have ""affected any casualty's survivability"". A GMP spokeswoman said: ""The criminal investigation into the terrible attack of 22nd May continues. ""In addition, the coronial process is now being presided over by retired High Court judge Sir John Saunders and consequently we cannot comment further at this time on matters which the inquest may wish to consider."""

She fell from an aft deck of the Norwegian Star cruise ship about 60 miles (95km) off Croatia's coast late on Saturday night. A Croatian rescue ship was scrambled and found her swimming not far from where Ms Longstaff was believed to have fallen. ""Luckily for her we saw her immediately because she raised and waved her hands when she saw us,"" said the vessel's captain Lovro Oreskovic. Mr Oreskovic added that she told the crew that she practices yoga and sang while floating to stay awake, but was exhausted when she was found. ""It is a real miracle that she is alive,"" Mr Oreskovic said. ""On the cruiser ship they thought she is not. It's obvious that she's very fit."" The 46-year-old, understood to be from Brighton, gave an interview to the Croatia news service HRT saying she felt ""very lucky"" to have survived.

Mr Oreskovic said she fell from the back of the Norwegian Star cruise ship that was sailing towards Venice, Italy, shortly before midnight on Sunday. The ship launched a search mission in the area of her fall, but could not find her. She was eventually rescued 10 hours later by the Croatian coast guard and taken to a hospital for a 24-hour examination. Hospital director Irena Hristic said Ms Longstaff has suffered stress but was in good health overall. ""The woman looks young, healthy and is a sports person,"" Ms Hristic said. ""She said she swam all the time and was conscious."" David Radas, a spokesman at Croatia's ministry of maritime affairs, said that by checking CCTV, rescuers knew the exact moment she fell in the water.

The circumstances of the incident are being investigated and the British embassy in Croatia has been informed. Dolores Brenko Skerjanc of the Croatian port authority said that the Adriatic Sea is warm in the summer and could have contributed to Ms Longstaff's survival. ""She spent a lot of time in the water, but the sea is now quite warm and the chances for survival are better,"" he told state broadcaster HRT."

One man in his late twenties, who had just been released following six weeks inside, said: ""The drugs are taking over the prison to be honest, because this seems like the staff that were here before didn't care and just let people do what they wanted."" He described the mood among inmates as: ""Fearful... there was a lot of people on my wing who just stayed behind their door 'cos they were scared to come out."" One family, who did not want to be fully identified due to fear of reprisals, said that their relative, known only as Mohammed, had been beaten twice over the weekend. His partner Aisha told Sky News she was ""traumatised"" after being told about videos that appeared on Facebook showing him being assaulted in a cell by a group of other inmates. ""It is so upsetting and we have tried to get answers from the prison as to if he is safe, how bad was he hurt, has he been attacked again, and nobody will tell us anything.

""Their bewilderment soon turned to horror when they realised the massive reptile was having a kip inside,"" the force said. ""The snake - a suspected albino corn snake - had been found slivering around in an alley off Dean Street in Newcastle city centre when it was spotted by a female passer-by. ""She and a friend were able to get it into the cardboard box before taking it to police as they did not know where else it could go."" The snake was named Sandra by staff at Newcastle city centre police station before it was collected by the RSCPA. :: Snake eats pigeon on east London street ""Hopefully the RSPCA can find out where it came from and return the snake to its owners,"" a police spokesman said. Corn snakes, which originate from America, are not venomous and use constriction to kill their wild prey, according to the RSPCA. They live for around 10 to 15 years and mice are their most common food."
2018-08-23,Labour raised a record amount for a political party last year by raking in nearly £56m in the space of 12 months.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180823043636/https://news.sky.com/story/labour-raise-record-56m-in-a-year-almost-10m-more-than-tories-11479124,"According to official figures, Jeremy Corbyn's party had an income of £55.79m in 2017, with the Conservatives raising almost £10m less at £45.95m. Both major parties spent slightly less than the amount they raised, with Labour having an expenditure of £54.34m and the Tories £44.87m. Labour's and the Conservative's income made up the majority of the total £125.32m raised by the ten parties who reported a gross income or total expenditure of more than £250,000. At last year's snap general election, which took place within the accounting period, the two biggest parties took more than 80% of the vote share. In 2017, 10 parties reported income or expenditure of more than £250,000 compared to 12 in 2016. In total, these 10 parties reported £125,332,064 income and £122,193,805 expenditure.Full details of the financial accounts published today are here:https://t.co/lOBptCxudj pic.twitter.com/S9g5rjpm1p Over the same period, the Liberal Democrats had an income of £9.71m, the SNP raised £5.8m, the Greens a total of £2.47m, while UKIP earned £1.74m. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein raised just over £1m and the DUP earned £510,362 in 2017. Labour's financial statement for 2017, published by the Electoral Commission on Wednesday, also revealed the party had 564,443 members at the end of December 2017, up from 543,654 the year before. This continues the large increase in membership under Mr Corbyn and allowed the party to earn £16.17m from its members in 2017, up from £14.39m over the previous 12 months. Donations counted for £18.26m of Labour's income in the period, which previous figures have shown was dominated by sums from trade unions. By contrast, the Tories earned just £835,000 from membership fees in 2017, a fall from £1.46m the year before. The party's income from legacy giving - at £1.67m in 2017, up from £301,000 in 2016 - was almost double the amount earned through membership fees. Tory insiders pointed to a large increase in the number of people joining the party centrally in 2016, as opposed to via their local constituency, as a reason for the fall in membership income in 2017. When a member joins the party centrally, the party owes a local association £20. This means the central party owed an unusual amount to local associations from 2016, which was offset in the Tories' 2017 membership income figures. Indeed, the Tories' income from membership fees in 2017 is more in line with earlier years than the 2016 figure. Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis recently revealed the party's membership now stands at 124,000. The Tories raised £34.25m from donations in 2017, up from £18.68m in 2016. Commenting on the figures published by the Electoral Commission, a Labour spokesperson said: ""Unlike the Tories who rely on a few super-rich donors to bankroll them, we're proud to be powered by small donations from hundreds of thousands of people across the country."""

Mr Corbyn spoke ahead of the government publishing the first batch of papers outlining contingency plans for such a scenario, after Prime Minister Theresa May ordered Whitehall to step up no deal preparations last month. Asked whether there were circumstances in which he would accept a no deal outcome, Mr Corbyn said on Wednesday: ""No deal would be a very, very bad for the whole country. ""We would not countenance a no deal Brexit because that would mean trade would then immediately move onto World Trade Organisation rules. ""That would mean our manufacturing industries would be hit very, very badly immediately. ""Our supply chain would be hit very, very badly - it would have a massive economic damage to this country. ""That's why, early on in this process, Labour called for a transition period. And, we would absolutely vote against that in Parliament."" On a visit to Scotland, where he met asylum families, Mr Corbyn accused the government of having ""wasted"" the more than two years since the Brexit vote by not negotiating with Brussels in an ""effective way"". He added: ""I would say get round the table, stop dreaming up fantasy arrangements with Donald Trump and realise that to protect jobs we have to trade with Europe. ""And we have to have both that sales opportunity and the ability, of course, to import from Europe, and give Europeans nationals living in Britain some peace of mind and some security. ""We've already got 100,000 vacancies across the NHS in the UK, many of those people should be working in our NHS."" On Tuesday, Mr Corbyn failed six times in a TV interview to say whether Britain would be better off outside the EU. Asked the same question on Wednesday, the Labour leader - who backed Remain in the EU referendum - said: ""It's a hypothetical question because we haven't reached that point yet. ""If we have a trade relationship with Europe, if we have a customs union with Europe, then we can make sure that people are as well, or better off, than they are now. ""But, it will be a Labour government that invests in the future of our people that will make people better off. ""It's a Labour government that will make people better off, not this chaos."" The Labour leader is under pressure from some of his MPs and party members to give his support to a second referendum on any final Brexit deal. Mr Corbyn, who will give a lecture on the media on Thursday, earlier agreed ""everyone believes in that principle of a straight answer to a straight question"". He used his trip to Glasgow to call for an end to the privatisation of asylum and refugee accommodation."

Delivering the Alternative MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival on Thursday, Mr Corbyn will express a wish to expand and empower public interest journalism, as well as to democratise the BBC. This will include the election of some BBC board members, the reduction or removal of the government's powers of appointment, as well as complete transparency about the diversity and make-up of the BBC workforce. Mr Corbyn will also propose putting the BBC on a permanent statutory footing to end government involvement through the renewal of the broadcaster's royal charter, along with the introduction of an additional digital licence fee payable by tech companies or internet providers. The Labour leader hopes this could reduce the cost of the existing licence fee for poorer households as well as help the BBC compete with companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook. Mr Corbyn will say: ""If we want an independent BBC, we should consider setting it free by placing it on a permanent statutory footing, with a new independent body setting the licence fee. ""The licence fee itself is another potential area for modernisation. ""In the digital age, we should consider whether a digital licence fee could be a fairer and more effective way to fund the BBC."" Despite praising the BBC as ""a great institution which rightly commands a special place in our country's story and national life"", Mr Corbyn will argue it needs to be made more accountable to the public and more representative of the UK. Criticising the proposal, Conservative Deputy Chairman James Cleverly said: ""Once again Labour are demonstrating they simply don't know how to handle the economy. ""Tech companies would just put up their prices and pass this Internet Tax straight on to families and businesses across the country - adding more pressure to weekly bills."" Among Mr Corbyn's other proposals will be strengthening Freedom of Information powers, by removing ministerial vetoes and including private companies delivering public services. Mr Corbyn also wants to boost local, investigative and public interest journalism through the granting of charitable status, creating an independent fund paid for by tech giants, and expanding a current BBC-government scheme. He will say: ""One solution to funding public interest media could be by tapping up the digital monopolies that profit from every search, share and like we make. ""Google and news publishers in France and Belgium were able to agree a settlement. ""If we can't do something similar here, but on a more ambitious scale, we'll need to look at the option of a windfall tax on the digital monopolies to create a public interest media fund."" Earlier this week, Mr Corbyn claimed his party is facing ""greater hostility from the mainstream media than we've probably ever had before"", while Labour has lodged a complaint with press regulator IPSO over coverage of his laying of a wreath at a Tunisian cemetery in 2014. Following previous allegations he was a Czech informant during the Cold War, Mr Corbyn issued a social media video in February in which he declared that ""change"" was ""coming"" to the UK media."

Today 16-year-olds across England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive their GCSE results. Those who sat their exams in England will have many of their tests marked under the 9-1 system, where 9 is the highest grade. This replaces the A*-G grades and is the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. Subject exams under the 9-1 scheme have also been made tougher. According to research by Cambridge Assessment, as few as 200 students could score a clean sweep of 9s in all of their GCSEs this year. Last year, one in five (20%) UK GCSE entries scored at least an A - or a 7 under the new system, while two thirds (66.3%) scored at least C - equivalent to a 4 under the new system. Ahead of results day, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said it had concerns about pupils performing at the lower end of the grading scale. ""The government's intention is that the new system provides greater differentiation between grades,"" Malcolm Trobe, ASCL general secretary, said. ""For example, it replaces A* and A with three grades, 7, 8 and 9. ""Our concern, however, is over those pupils at the other end of the scale who are taking exams which are harder than their predecessors and who have been told by the government that a grade 4 is a 'standard pass' and a grade 5 is a 'strong pass'. ""That is a very demoralising message to those who achieve grades 1, 2 and 3, and the new system does not work very well for them at all. ""These young people have completed demanding programmes of study and we need to find a better way to credit their achievements."" It is expected that grade boundaries could be lower this year for new GCSEs compared with the old system to make up for lower scores. Last year, when grades were awarded for the first time for the new maths GCSE, students sitting the higher tier maths course needed to score at least 18% on average to secure a grade 4, while on average, 52% was needed for a 7, and 79% for a grade 9. Exams regulator Ofqual has said it uses statistical processes to ensure that results are comparable year-on-year, and to ensure that students who are the first to take the new-style qualifications are not disadvantaged in any way. Grades for new-style English and maths GCSEs were awarded for the first time last summer. This year, 20 subjects will be awarded grades under the new system - with a 7 broadly equivalent to an A, and a 4 broadly equivalent to a C. Meanwhile, a poll found that more than two-thirds of teenagers are concerned about the new GCSE grading system. Some 69% of the 1,000 14 to 17-year-olds questioned, who are currently waiting for their GCSE results, said they are generally concerned about the new grading system. The survey commissioned by the National Citizen Service also found 65% do not feel the new system will represent their grades as well as it should. Just 4% of pupils polled expect to get mainly 9s - the highest grade."

The 29-year-old was helped to escape when two people armed with a knife and a gun confronted prison guards outside the hospital and fled with Walmsley in a gold Volvo. His recapture came when armed officers stopped a car in Harehills, Leeds, on Tuesday. Walmsley was serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years for murdering drugs gang rival Anthony Duffy in 2014. Mr Duffy was lured to an address in Aintree in May 2014 and repeatedly stabbed. A Merseyside Police spokesman said: ""Escaped prisoner Shaun Walmsley is back in custody following a proactive operation by officers from Merseyside Police and West Yorkshire Police earlier yesterday."" He has been charged with escape from lawful custody and will appear at Liverpool and Knowsley Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Walmsley featured on Sky News' ""One Day of Crime"" earlier this month.   A reward of £20,000 of Walmsley's own money was on offer for information leading to the apprehension of the prisoner and his return to jail. The money was seized following his arrest and murder conviction. It is not clear whether a member of the public came forward with information on his whereabouts. Officers were considering the possibility that Walmsley could be elsewhere in the UK or may have fled abroad so were working with police forces in Europe and the National Crime Agency. They described him as dangerous and asked the public not to approach him."

When the new system was rolled out last year, only GCSE maths, English literature and English language exams taken in England were marked using the new grades. This year, the following subjects will also be part of the 9-1 grading system: :: Ancient languages (classical Greek, Latin):: Art and design:: Biology:: Chemistry:: Citizenship studies:: Combined science (double award):: Computer science:: Dance:: Drama:: Food preparation and nutrition:: Geography:: History:: Modern foreign languages (French, German, Spanish):: Music:: Physics:: Physical education:: Religious studies More subjects will be added next summer and by 2020 all GCSEs will be graded from 9-1. Until 2020, depending on the GCSEs taken teenagers can receive a mix of lettered and numbered grades. The other countries in the UK have different exams systems and will continue to use the old grading system. :: What do the grades mean? The new grading system will score pupils from 1 to 9, with grade 9 being the highest mark and grade 1 the lowest. A pupil who scored a C previously would receive a 4 this year. What would have been a low A grade is now equivalent to a grade 7 and a high A would be a grade 8. To be awarded a level 9 is harder than getting an A* - think of it as an A**. According to one estimate, as few as 200 candidates could get straight grade 9s across all of their GCSEs this year. :: Why was the system introduced? The new grading system should create greater division between pupils' abilities as there are more grades to split them between. Under the old system there were eight categories (A* to G) whereas now there are nine. The new system was specifically created to allow for more differentiation among high achieving pupils, as those students who previously got As or A*s will now be split between three grades 7, 8 and 9. :: What to do if you've missed your grades It is possible to retake some of your GCSE exams in the autumn to try and increase your mark. November resit exams are only available in mathematics and English language, and only for pupils who were 16 or over on the preceding 31 August. All other exams, including resits for other subjects, will only take place in the summer. If you have missed your grades, some A-level or college course may still accept you if you're planning to re-sit your exams. But if you can't resit, you could take another course where you made the grades or apply to a different college as not all colleges will require the same grades. If your grades are unexpectedly low you can also request to see your exam papers and consider asking for the paper to be remarked."

An estimated 39,000 people living with diabetes will suffer a heart attack in 2035, a rise of 9,000 compared with 2015, according to the charity. Cases of angina and heart failure are also set to soar, it warned. Meanwhile, more than 50,000 people will have a stroke, a rise of 11,000, the charity said. Over the next 20 years the number of people with diabetes in England is set to increase from four million to five million. This increase is partly because of the rising number of those who are becoming obese. Obesity can increase cases of type 2 diabetes. Those with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. A rise in diabetes cases is therefore likely to increase in the number of potentially deadly heart and circulatory conditions. ""Today's figures point to an extremely worrying trend,"" said BHF chief executive Simon Gillespie. ""People with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases and the expected surge in type 2 diabetes cases by 2035 could put thousands more people at risk of a deadly heart attack or stroke. ""We can only reverse this trend by taking bold action to tackle obesity and inactivity, especially amongst young people."" Mr Gillespie called for further regulatory action to reduce sugar and fat content in food, and to curb junk food advertising directed at young children. ""The food industry is not acting quickly enough to re-formulate its products, despite mounting evidence of their impact on the nation's health,"" he said, adding that continued research in understanding diabetes is also needed. One diabetes patient, Sarah Miles, had to give up her nursing career after suffering a heart attack at the age of 38. The 43-year-old from Cheddar, Somerset, said: ""Living with diabetes is difficult, but to then have a heart attack was a total shock. The attack led to heart failure which has severely limited my quality of life."" She added: ""I've had to give up my nursing career, my social life and my family dynamic has totally changed forever."" Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""Everyone can make important lifestyle changes to reduce their risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. These include losing weight, quitting smoking, exercising regularly and cutting back on alcohol. ""I encourage having a free NHS Health Check, offered to 40-74 year olds, to help spot early warning signs of these preventable conditions and gives help and advice on lowering the risks."""
2018-08-23,A bike-sharing firm is threatening to pull out of Manchester due to an increase in theft and vandalism.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180823043636/https://news.sky.com/story/mobike-threatens-to-pull-out-of-manchester-because-of-theft-and-damage-11479477,"Mobike warned it will end its service in the city in ""weeks not months"" unless there is a reduction in people stealing and damaging its orange and grey vehicles. The Chinese company said 10% of its Manchester fleet was taken out of use in July alone, and warned that the figure is not ""sustainable"". The business's bike-sharing model allows customers to park the bicyle anywhere after using it, with the next customer picking it up from where the last one left it. Docking stations are not provided like those used in Transport for London's so-called Boris Bike scheme. Mobike customers create an account and unlock the vehicles with an app, with GPS technology showing where the nearest vehicle can be found. They then scan a QR code to release a lock. When the firm launched in Manchester in June 2017 cyclists could reportedly pedal the bikes wherever they liked for just 50p for half-an-hour. Some of the bikes ended up in the Peak District and Huddersfield. The company reportedly chose to up the price to 69p for half-an-hour in April because bikes kept being stolen or vandalised. Mobike has said it may make the ""tough decision"" to stop operating in the Manchester as ""we can't keep putting bikes in which disappear"". Fifty bikes were damaged and abandoned in the first few weeks after the scheme launched in June last year, but the problem has grown in recent months. Bikes are being thrown in waterways, set on fire or left hanging from railings, while others are having locks smashed off to enable people to keep them. Ofo, another bicycle hire firm, is experiencing similar problems in cities such as Sheffield and Cambridge. Mobike says it is ""actively pursuing civil prosecutions"" for theft and intentional damage. It also fines users £20 if they do not park bikes within the operating zone at the end of their ride. Mobike is urging members of the public to contact the company to report thefts and vandalism. Jan Van der Ven, Mobike's UK general manager, said: ""As a private business, we are only viable if our revenues cover our costs, and that is not possible with the current levels of bike loss in Manchester. ""For that reason, we have sat down with representatives from Manchester City Council, Greater Manchester Police and TfGM (Transport for Greater Manchester), and have agreed a range of measures to help protect our bikes."" Chris Boardman, Greater Manchester's cycling and walking commissioner, said the problems experienced by Mobike are ""not unique"" to the region, but warned that his plan to increase cycling is dependant on the existence of a hire scheme. Chief Superintendent Wasim Chaudhry of Greater Manchester Police said: ""Our officers are able to check the legitimate use of the Mobike system and we will investigate reports of suspected theft and vandalism just like we would if someone made a report about their own bike. ""We will always hold those we find breaking the law to account. We must all work together to keep our city safe and moving."""

With a decrease in temperature, there was an increase in blood pressure. The researchers suggested that turning up the thermostat may help manage hypertension. Blood pressure readings consist of two figures given together: :: Systolic pressure, the pressure when your heart pushes blood out :: Diastolic pressure, the pressure when your heart rests between beats The study found that every 1C decrease in indoor temperature was associated with rises of 0.48 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 0.45 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. According to the NHS, ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg Experts from University College London (UCL) looked at data from more than 4,600 adults. The survey has been published in the Journal of Hypertension. ""Our research has helped to explain the higher rates of hypertension, as well as potential increases in deaths from stroke and heart disease, in the winter months, suggesting indoor temperatures should be taken more seriously in diagnosis and treatment decisions, and in public health messages,"" said senior author Dr Stephen Jivraj of UCL's Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care. ""Among other diet and lifestyle changes people can make to reduce high blood pressure, our findings suggest that keeping homes a bit warmer could also be beneficial."" During bouts of particularly cold weather officials issue warnings to people whose health is particularly at risk, including young children, older people and those with heart or lung conditions.

2018-08-23,"Patients should treat their coughs and colds with honey and over-the-counter remedies before going to the doctor, health officials say.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180823043636/https://news.sky.com/story/tell-your-patients-they-just-need-honey-gps-told-11479711,"New draft guidance from Public Health England (PHE) and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is advising GPs not to offer antibiotics in most cases. Instead, they must encourage patients to use self-care products. The advice is part of a growing effort to tackle antibiotic resistance. Acute coughs are mostly caused by a cold or flu virus, or bronchitis, and will last for around three weeks, according to the guidance. Antibiotics make little difference to symptoms and can have side-effects - and unnecessary prescriptions reduce their effectiveness. Patients are instead advised to try honey or cough medicines containing pelargonium, guaifenesin or dextromethorphan, which have been shown to have some benefit for cough symptoms, before contacting their doctor. These ingredients are found in medicines sold in pharmacies, such as Beechams and Lemsip. Antibiotics may be necessary treat coughs in patients with pre-existing conditions such as lung disease, immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis, or those at risk of further complications, the guidance states. Dr Tessa Lewis, GP and chairwoman of the antimicrobial prescribing guidelines group, said: ""If someone has a runny nose, sore throat and cough, we would expect the cough to settle over two to three weeks and antibiotics are not needed. ""People can check their symptoms on NHS Choices or NHS Direct Wales or ask their pharmacist for advice. ""If the cough is getting worse rather than better, or the person feels very unwell or breathless, then they would need to contact their GP."" Dr Susan Hopkins, from PHE, said: ""Antibiotic resistance is a huge problem and we need to take action now to reduce antibiotic use. ""Taking antibiotics when you don't need them puts you and your family at risk of developing infections which in turn cannot be easily treated. ""These new guidelines will support GPs to reduce antibiotic prescriptions and we encourage patients to take their GPs advice about self-care."" A consultation on the draft guidance will close on 20 September."

The speech was called Coconut Oil and other Nutritional Errors. Dr Michels also said consumption of so-called superfoods was unnecessary because we already get enough nutrition from everyday foods like carrots, cherries and apricots. ""We are well and sufficiently supplied,"" she said, according to a translation of her German address. Coconut oil has had its profile boosted in recent years by health food advocates who claim it is healthier than other forms of fat. Some people even have a spoonful of it in their coffee or their smoothie because of the alleged health benefits. It has also replaced many oils used in cooking. People even feed it to their pets. However, Dr Michels isn't the only one to have bad things to say about coconut oil. Although not as strongly, other institutions have warned against over-consumption. The British Heart Foundation (BHF) says there is not enough good-quality research to provide a definitive answer as to whether coconut oil is better for you than other saturated fats. It says the healthier choice would be to opt for an unsaturated fat, such as vegetable oil or sunflower oil. Coconut oil is about 86% saturated fat - about a third more than butter, which is 52%. Excessive amounts of saturated fats in a diet increases cholesterol, which can lead to blocked arteries and heart disease. UK guidelines encourage people to swap saturated fats for unsaturated fats. BHF says you should swap butter, lard, ghee and coconut and palm oils with small amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as olive, rapeseed or sunflower oils and spreads."

The president's former ""fixer"" had previously been a staunch supporter of Mr Trump, saying he would ""take a bullet"" for the president. Mr Davis added that it was ""absolutely clear that Donald Trump committed a felony"" by ordering hush payments be made to two women ""so that his political election chances would not be harmed"" before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen told a court on Tuesday that he had paid off porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal in order to influence the 2016 US election campaign, at the direction of a ""candidate"". Mr Davis said his client ""was talking about Donald Trump"" and that he had ""directed and co-ordinated"" the payments. When asked in April if he knew about a $130,000 payment made to Ms Daniels, Mr Trump said no. Mr Davis told Sky News the president ""lied about"" committing the felony. He said he was unsure whether Cohen's information ""would be the smoking gun"" leading to impeachment, but said he didn't think a crime at ""this level of seriousness"" had been committed by a president before. The former lawyer's admission of hush money followed what a senior source called a ""bad day"" for the Trump administration. On Tuesday, former campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty of eight of 18 charges relating to financial crime, bank fraud and avoiding paying taxes to the tune of more than $16m (£12.4m). It was the first trial victory for special counsel Robert Mueller's team. If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen! Mr Trump said the Manafort case had nothing to do with the alleged 2016 collusion that Mr Mueller is probing and dismissed Michael Cohen's admissions. He tweeted: ""If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!"" The president went on: ""Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!"" On Wednesday, the White House said Mr Trump was ""not concerned at all"" by Cohen co-operating with FBI investigators."

Max Stainton, who was born with cerebral palsy, is supporting the campaign. He told us: ""The point is we're the same as you guys we just need some help."" SCOPE has published a report based on the polling of 2,000 working-age disabled adults which reveals how undervalued and disconnected from society many disabled people feel. It shows that 49% feel excluded from society. Two in five (41%) don't feel valued. Less than half - 42% - think the UK is a good place for disabled people. Mr Stainton trekked to Everest base camp on horseback. He said: ""The fact I felt like I had to do such an extreme slightly mental challenge just to prove myself to everyone around me tells you so much about societal perceptions of disability and the need to destroy those perceptions and challenge them and make them go away. ""I trekked to Everest to break this stereotypes and say to people 'I can do what my dreams are'."" Mr Stainton says there are lots of ways society can exclude people, such as transport and having dinner out. ""The tube network here in London. I might have to go a different way to my friends. ""Just getting into a restaurant that has stairs - what do I do then? So many little things can be changed easily. It's about raising awareness. ""I feel embarrassed because I don't want to inconvenience friends or colleagues but I want to participate in what they're doing."" He says it is a shame disabled people are excluded from society because they have ""so much to offer"". James Taylor, head of campaigns at SCOPE, said: ""We believe life in 2018 is just too tough if you're disabled and we believe that needs to change. ""Today we're calling on everyone whether you're an individual, an employer, a business, a government department, or an organisation to step up and demonstrate what you're doing for disabled people to make a difference for disability equality and really tackle some of these issues. ""Despite the fact we've had equality legislation for 20 years, and the equality act for the last eight years, I think what's clear is just how much is left to do and how equality legislation is one thing but changing minds is quite another - from tackling poor attitudes in the work place to increasing funding for social care so people can get out of the house."""

More than 30 handguns and a quantity of ammunition were found at the site, which has been cordoned off while investigations continue. Greg Akehurst, 29, of no fixed address, and Mark Kinman, 63, of Bramwell Mews, Hailsham, were both charged with possessing a firearm. Kyle Wood, 30, of Gratwicke Drive, Littlehampton, was charged with the same offence, as well as possessing ammunition. The three men were remanded in custody and will appear at Kingston Crown Court on 17 September. Rob Hickinbottom, head of the NCA firearms threat centre, said the firearms were at various stages of production and that searches have been carried out at other addresses, but would not say where. Police do not know how long the firearms have been being produced for or how much they were sold for.

Mr Raab is expected to say he is ""confident a good deal is within our sights, and that remains our top, and overriding, priority"" but in the event of no deal ""we must be ready to consider the alternative"". He will add: ""We have a duty, as a responsible government, to plan for every eventuality."" The advice notices on a no-deal situation will be released in batches over the next few weeks and are expected to cover areas such as aviation safety, civilian nuclear power, medical drugs, the rights of British citizens living in the EU, road haulage and fishing rights. Mr Raab will explain there are already planning talks between the Bank of England and the European Central Bank for a no-deal scenario and will call for discussions to begin on data protection and between port authorities. He will also insist that the UK will go it alone to ensure trade and transport still operate smoothly, no matter what the EU decides to do. He will say: ""Our overarching aim is to facilitate the smooth, continued, functioning of business, transport, infrastructure, research, aid programmes and funding streams. ""In some cases, it means taking unilateral action to maintain as much continuity as possible in the short term, in the event of no deal - irrespective of whether the EU reciprocates."" The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019. After meeting Mr Raab in Brussels on Tuesday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier revealed discussions ""are now entering the final stage"". ""We have agreed the EU and the UK will negotiate continuously from now on and Dominic and I will meet regularly to take stock and move the negotiations forward,"" he said. He also indicated recent talks had moved the EU and UK closer to an agreement on post-Brexit security and foreign policy co-operation, but signalled a deal on the future economic relationship remains elusive. Labour has dismissed the no-deal notices, with shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer again claiming that no deal would be ""catastrophic"". He said: ""A no-deal Brexit would be a complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain. These documents should not distract us from that. ""No deal would be catastrophic for people's jobs, the economy and for the border in Northern Ireland. It is irresponsible for anyone to casualise no deal."""

",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180823043636/https://news.sky.com/story/i-flunked-my-exams-but-still-made-it-big-richard-bransons-tips-for-success-11473547,"Despite leaving school at 16, the man behind Virgin has a net worth of $5bn (£3.9bn). Here he explains why you can achieve anything you want - even if you don't go to university. If you didn't get the grades you needed, try not to worry too much and know that you are not alone. I flunked my exams and left school at the age of 16. I didn't go to university and I can recall little of what was on the blackboard when I was a teenager - I am dyslexic and it was all a bit of a jumble to me. But there is much to be positive about. Exams don't measure skills like creating, delegating, reasoning, exploring, communicating and positively influencing - essential skills that the world needs. Dyslexics naturally excel at these ways of thinking, so we should value and celebrate this. I found school really difficult, but when I started a business I realised that actually dyslexia was my biggest strength. It has taught me to keep things simple, to rise above difficulties and to focus on what I'm good at. Looking back over my life, one of the most important lessons I have ever learned is to fail. And fail again. Only through failure do we ever learn anything new - and only once you learn to stop fearing failure do you really start to succeed. The key to success isn't your exam results, but the goals you set yourself. Think about what you're good at and what you enjoy. Pursue your passions doggedly and never stop trying new things. I set myself long-term goals and short-term goals and write them down. Don't make your goals about money or about what you can buy, but things that you can learn or things that interest you. You increase your value in all walks of life by expanding what you're capable of. It also gives you a real kick when you get to tick them off, and motivates you to keep going. It really saddens me that so many children get left behind by our education system - it's such a waste of untapped potential. I want to see education reimagined to support creative minds and alternative thinkers. I don't want children with dyslexia (or any other disability) to feel at a disadvantage because they think in a different way to other children - this is a talent that should be nurtured. I want to see possibilities explored and children having adventures. This is my main motivation for taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge in a few weeks' time. I've been training hard on the tennis court and cycling whenever I have the chance. We will be raising money for Big Change; a charity that helps set young people up to thrive in life, not just exams. Prevention is better than treating symptoms - it's easier to build stronger children than it is to fix broken adults. Unless we support innovation, change will not happen. I want to see every child supported and their talents nurtured. Whether you got the grades you wanted or not, if you do what you love and what you are naturally good at, it will take you far in life. It certainly has for me. And remember, the alphabet runs from A to Z, not A to C."

In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis confirmed that the candidate his client was referring to was Mr Trump. He said it was ""absolutely clear that Donald Trump committed a felony"" by ordering hush payments and that he had ""lied about it"". In a news conference that followed Cohen's revelations on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted that the president had done ""nothing wrong"". ""Just because Michael Cohen made a plea deal doesn't mean that that implicates the president on anything,"" she said. During the upcoming Fox & Friends interview, Ms Earhardt also asks Mr Trump if the press was the ""enemy of the people"". ""No, not at all, but the fake news is and the fake news is comprised of - it's a lot - it's a big chunk,"" he says. ""Somebody said what's the chunk. I said 80%."""
2018-08-27,A watercolour sketch by British sculptor Henry Moore has been identified among a hoard of Nazi art housed in Switzerland's Museum of Fine Art.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/henry-moore-watercolour-sketch-found-among-nazi-art-hoard-11483274,"The sketch was among 1,500 works found in Germany in 2012 that had belonged to art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt. He bought the piece after it was confiscated from a German museum in the 1930s after it was classified as ""degenerate art"" by Adolf Hitler. The sketch was discovered through the BBC One programme Fake Or Fortune? During the show a document was found that proved the museum from which Moore's sketch was taken had received it from Moore himself, proving that the piece was not looted. The sketch has been estimated to be worth up to £70,000 due to its rich and emotive history. It will be now be displayed in the museum in Bern. Moore, one of the most important British artists of the 20th century, is best known for producing semi-abstract bronze sculptures. His pieces are displayed publicly around the world including London's Kew Gardens and outside the Hebrew University of Jerusalem."
2018-08-27,"Wonga, the payday lender which was once one of Britain's fastest-growing consumer finance companies, is on the brink of collapse this weekend following a deluge of customer compensation claims.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/wonga-on-brink-of-collapse-after-customer-compensation-claims-deluge-11482720,"Sky News has learnt that the company has lined up Grant Thornton, the professional services firm, to act as administrator if its board decides in the coming weeks that it is unable to avoid becoming insolvent. Sources close to Wonga said that it could appoint Grant Thornton as soon as this week. The fall into administration would underscore Wonga's remarkable decline just five years after it harboured ambitions of pursuing a New York stock market listing that could have valued it more than $1bn and turned it into a British technology 'unicorn'. Wonga's decision to explore the appointment of administrators comes three weeks after Sky News revealed that the company had received an emergency £10m cash injection to keep it afloat. One insider said on Sunday that the cash call had prompted a fresh surge in compensation demands from claims management companies (CMCs). Executives from Wonga are understood to have been in detailed talks with the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, in the last few weeks to discuss the company's options. Their priority was said to be an outcome reflecting the needs of both customers and creditors, with a pre-pack administration process similar to that used recently by House of Fraser a possibility. That would involve a buyer acquiring some of Wonga's operations, potentially preserving a chunk of the company's 500-strong workforce. Grant Thornton is said to have been working with the payday lender, which is chaired by the former RSA Insurance boss Andy Haste, for several months. Wonga, which launched in 2007 and became a byword for sky-high interest rates on short-term loans, is owned by a collection of the venture capital industry's best-known names, including Balderton Capital, Accel Partners and 83North. It grew its loan book rapidly, using technology to tailor offers to customers, but ran into difficulty in 2014 when the FCA introduced a cap on the cost of short-term credit for consumers. The company's recent fundraising is understood to have taken place at a valuation of just $30m (£23m) prior to the injection of the new money - a stunning decline for a company that was hailed as one of the UK's leading financial technology prospects. Tara Kneafsey‎, Wonga's chief executive, informed fellow directors several months ago that an increase in the volume of complaints about loans made before new rules were introduced in 2014 had triggered a big rise in compensation payouts. Sky News previously reported that Ms Kneafsey had warned in late May that the company risked becoming insolvent without a capital injection. Wonga's cashflow had become so tight that its board has also been evaluating the sale of some of its assets, including its valuable Polish subsidiary. Ms Kneafsey is also said to have highlighted a pending decision by the Financial Ombudsman about the time limit for legacy complaints about irresponsible lending as another headache for Wonga. The new capital injection was made more complicated‎ by the requirement for Wonga's UK arm to provide cash to its parent company in June. Directors of the British division could have risked breaching their ‎legal duties if they had sanctioned the transfer of funds to an insolvent company. Wonga, which employs about 500 people, has been loss-making for the last few years after encountering a string of regulatory hurdles such as the City watchdog's cap on the cost of short-term loans. The company, which lost about £65m in 2016, had been targeting a return to profitability last year, although it is unclear whether that objective was met, with its 2017 results not expected to be published for several weeks. Wonga declined to expand upon a comment made earlier this month in which it said: ""Wonga continues to make progress against the transformation plan set out for the business. ""In recent months, however, the short-term credit industry has seen a marked increase in claims related to legacy loans, driven principally by claims management company activity. ""In line with this changing market environment, Wonga has seen a significant increase in claims related to loans taken out before the current management team joined the business in 2014. ""As a result, the team has raised £10m of new capital from existing shareholders, who remain fully supportive of management's plans for the business.‎"" Wonga, which raised its profile by sponsoring Newcastle United in a deal which ended two years ago, continues to trade in countries including South Africa and Spain. Its board had been targeting a return to profitability this year. It has been trying to improve its image by launching a flexible loan product as it seeks to diversify away from the short-term lending activity that sparked political and public controversy. The entire payday lending sector has been hit by the Financial Conduct Authority's price cap, with dozens of providers going bust since its introduction in 2014. In 2014, Wonga was ordered by the City watchdog to pay more than £2.6m in compensation to 45,000 customers who were sent letters purporting to be from law firms but which in fact did not exist."

Ross McLeod from the RNLI says people often forget how different swimming at sea can be compared to in the pool. ""Although we've had a good few months of warm weather, the water temperature around the coast of the UK and Ireland is on average no more than 15 degrees and this can cause something called cold water shock, which is a physiological response which happens when the temperature of your body cools down suddenly because of the water. It can cause you to gasp uncontrollably and really panic."" Swim England says nearly a third of pupils leave primary school without sufficient swimming skills, despite water safety and swimming being part of the national curriculum in England. The organisation is working with the government to improve the availability of swimming lessons for all schools. At the Hampton outdoor pool in London, Tom Kersey and his two sons, seven-year-old Zach and 12-year-old Cameron enjoy a family swim. Tom taught his children to swim at a young age. ""I think it's an essential life skill to be able to swim. If you're going to do any watersports or even if you're a general member of the public and accidentally fall into water like a canal or something you need to be able to swim to stay alive."" More than 250 people lost their lives in accidental drownings in the UK last year, according to the Water Incident Database. Last month a 17-year-old boy drowned while swimming in a disused quarry in Warwickshire - one of a number deaths during the recent heatwave. RNLI community safety partner Guy Addington says the sea can be unpredictable. ""Conditions can change quickly, so we recommend heading to a lifeguarded beach. If you find yourself in difficulty or needing help, then one of our friendly lifeguards will be there to help out and offer advice or assistance if you need it."""
2018-08-27,"One of the world's most successful businessmen, Richard Branson, has achieved extraordinary things in his career. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/i-flunked-my-exams-but-still-made-it-big-richard-bransons-tips-for-success-11473547,"Despite leaving school at 16, the man behind Virgin has a net worth of $5bn (£3.9bn). Here he explains why you can achieve anything you want - even if you don't go to university. If you didn't get the grades you needed, try not to worry too much and know that you are not alone. I flunked my exams and left school at the age of 16. I didn't go to university and I can recall little of what was on the blackboard when I was a teenager - I am dyslexic and it was all a bit of a jumble to me. But there is much to be positive about. Exams don't measure skills like creating, delegating, reasoning, exploring, communicating and positively influencing - essential skills that the world needs. Dyslexics naturally excel at these ways of thinking, so we should value and celebrate this. I found school really difficult, but when I started a business I realised that actually dyslexia was my biggest strength. It has taught me to keep things simple, to rise above difficulties and to focus on what I'm good at. Looking back over my life, one of the most important lessons I have ever learned is to fail. And fail again. Only through failure do we ever learn anything new - and only once you learn to stop fearing failure do you really start to succeed. The key to success isn't your exam results, but the goals you set yourself. Think about what you're good at and what you enjoy. Pursue your passions doggedly and never stop trying new things. I set myself long-term goals and short-term goals and write them down. Don't make your goals about money or about what you can buy, but things that you can learn or things that interest you. You increase your value in all walks of life by expanding what you're capable of. It also gives you a real kick when you get to tick them off, and motivates you to keep going. It really saddens me that so many children get left behind by our education system - it's such a waste of untapped potential. I want to see education reimagined to support creative minds and alternative thinkers. I don't want children with dyslexia (or any other disability) to feel at a disadvantage because they think in a different way to other children - this is a talent that should be nurtured. I want to see possibilities explored and children having adventures. This is my main motivation for taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge in a few weeks' time. I've been training hard on the tennis court and cycling whenever I have the chance. We will be raising money for Big Change; a charity that helps set young people up to thrive in life, not just exams. Prevention is better than treating symptoms - it's easier to build stronger children than it is to fix broken adults. Unless we support innovation, change will not happen. I want to see every child supported and their talents nurtured. Whether you got the grades you wanted or not, if you do what you love and what you are naturally good at, it will take you far in life. It certainly has for me. And remember, the alphabet runs from A to Z, not A to C."

Aimee Rampton, the coastguard operations controller, said: ""The helicopter located the bodies of the missing crew near the sunken fishing vessel wreckage. ""All units have now stood down. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the crew men."" Crew on the Pacific Princess lowered a ladder to the men after the captain responded to a distress flare in the North Sea, about 25 miles off the Norfolk coast. Passenger Teena Dowd said the captain made an announcement about the life raft at around 6.30pm and soon after the three men climbed up the side of the ship. At one point, one of the men fell into the water as he tried to scale the ladder and had to be pulled back into the emergency inflatable before trying again. Ms Dowd, from near Toronto, Canada, said: ""Originally they didn't think we were going to be able to rescue them. ""The captain announced we were just going to float next to them so they were blocked from the wind until the coastguard got here, but then they were able to get close enough that they were able to climb up our ship. ""We were on the very top deck, and people were just sort of holding their breath, everybody was anxious because we all, at the time, thought there was only three of them and everybody clapped when they came on the ship. ""But we didn't know until a while later, when the captain announced that there was actually two more and we were still searching for them."" After two hours of continuing to search, the cruise ship continued to Dover and the Coastguard remained, co-ordinating the hunt. A search and rescue helicopter from Humberside, RNLI lifeboats from Gorleston, an independent lifeboat from Caister and other vessels are involved in the search. Coastguard operations controller for the east coast Lee Duncan said: ""The crew of the sunken fishing vessel are all foreign nationals. ""We know that the three recovered men had been in the life raft for four hours before they were spotted by the cruise ship."" The Pacific Princess, owned by Princess Cruises, had been on a cruise around the British Isles at the time and was on its way back to Dover."

An official announcement is due this week, the paper added. Brussels has insisted that the UK cannot remain a full member of the Galileo system for security reasons following its departure from the EU. In May, the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) warned that ending the UK's close participation in the project ""will be to the detriment of Europe's prosperity and security and could result in delays and additional costs to the programme"". The UK wants to remain part of the multi-billion pound project after Brexit, in which it has already invested £1.4bn, for use across public and military communications. British military leaders are keen to be able to use Galileo's encrypted services as the US withholds the best global positioning system (GPS) service for itself, and the UK has led the development of Galileo's critical encryption software. The idea for a UK alternative to the EU system comes as the government begins to publish papers on the impact of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, raising fears for shoppers, farmers, businesses, NHS patients and UK expats. Ministers have begun to release the first batch of a series of ""technical notices"" on the UK's possible departure from the EU without a divorce agreement. Changes to VAT, card payment rises, and blood supply scares: the government sets out some of the possibilities being planned for It is possible that one of these papers will address the Galileo project, which originated in 1999 and is due to be completed in 2020, aiming to establish a European rival to the US-owned GPS system for satellite navigation. The Galileo project has been an area of dispute between Westminster and Brussels regarding the UK's proposed future relationship with the bloc. The government wants Galileo ""to be a core component of a future UK-EU security partnership"", with the paper in May suggesting the EU's stance risks breaching Brussels' commitment to ""strong cooperation"" on defence and security in Brexit negotiations. The UK is already developing receivers for military platforms that will incorporate Galileo's navigation system and being excluded from the project could harm continued the UK's continued defence collaboration with European countries, the government has warned. According to The Sunday Telegraph, the government will announce contracts for the UK's alternative within the next few days. The paper's sources said that the UK system would be ""far cheaper"" than the £9bn cost of the Galileo project because so much of the work had already been completed in the UK."

A source told the newspaper: ""He was aggressively pushing her down the corridor. ""Then he stopped and turned away and she started to follow him.

2018-08-27,A former Vatican official has claimed Pope Francis had known about allegations of sex abuse against a prominent cardinal in the US for years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/pope-in-ireland-francis-faces-call-to-resign-over-abuse-cover-up-claim-11483048,"As the pontiff ended his historic two-day visit to Ireland, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano called on him to quit over his response to the global scandal still enveloping the Church. Francis used a speech at Mass in Phoenix Park in Dublin on Sunday to ""ask forgiveness"" for abuses committed by ""members with roles of responsibility in the Church"", which allegedly includes American Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The 88-year-old resigned last month over claims of sexual abuse against a 16-year-old boy. Francis accepted McCarrick's resignation as cardinal last month, after an internal US investigation found that an accusation he had sexually abused a minor was credible. Archbishop Vigano has said he warned Francis about the allegations shortly after he became Pope in 2013. In an 11-page statement, the archbishop compared cover-ups of abuse within the Church to ""a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the Mafia"". ""Pope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church,"" Archbishop Vigano, a frequent critic of the Pope, wrote in the letter, which was carried by the National Catholic Register and several other conservative media outlets in the US and Italy. ""In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick's abuses and resign along with all of them,"" he said. The Vatican has not commented on the accusations, which include an assertion that other top officials were warned about McCarrick - one of the highest-ranking figures within the Church - as early as 2006. Archbishop Vigano - the papal envoy in Washington from 2011 to 2016 - timed the release of the bombshell letter to coincide with the second day of the World Meeting of Families in Ireland. Francis touched down in Ireland on Saturday morning for what was set to be a highly charged two-day trip - the first papal visit to the country since 1979. :: Pope Francis in Ireland: The ultimate guide The Catholic Church has been vilified in Ireland after 9,000 reported cases of child abuse by priests and Francis met survivors during his first day in Dublin, during which he reportedly compared the corruption to human excrement. He also made a speech at Dublin Castle in which he expressed his regret over historical abuse by Catholic priests in the country, and on Sunday he struck much the same tone. :: Pope's 'secret' to a happy marriage During a morning visit to Knock Shrine, where many Irish Catholics believe the Virgin Mary and other Saints were seen in the late 19th century, Francis described the issue of abuse in Ireland as an ""open wound"". And at Mass at Phoenix Park in the afternoon, the Pope requested a ""pardon"" for their crimes. :: Words are not enough on abuse, even swear words ""We ask forgiveness for the abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, of conscience, and sexual abuses perpetrated by members with roles of responsibility in the Church,"" he said. ""In a special way, we ask pardon for all the abuses committed in various types of institutions run by males or female religious, and by other members of the Church, and we ask for forgiveness for those cases of exploitation through manual work that so many young women and men were subjected to. ""We ask forgiveness."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar - who describes himself as a non-practising Catholic - also attended the Mass. Ahead of the gathering, he tweeted: ""Ireland is a different country to 39 years ago. But this visit has caused us to reflect more deeply on the relationship between Ireland the Church, brought to Ireland centuries ago."" On Saturday, during his welcome speech at Dublin Castle, Mr Varadkar was unafraid to refer to ""dark aspects"" of the history of the Church and condemned the abuse as ""stains on our state, our society and also the Church"". The number of people who turned out for the Phoenix Park event appeared to be well short of the expected 500,000. The crowds paled in comparison to the numbers that greeted Pope John Paul II in 1979, when more than 75% of the population flocked to see the pontiff. Francis attended a farewell ceremony at Dublin Airport before his departure for Rome."

The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has voiced fears the race could be affected in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, if the European Commission rejects UK efforts to keep the current ""streamlined"" process for transporting horses. Last week, the government revealed the first batch of papers detailing Whitehall plans for a no-deal exit, which raised fears for shoppers, farmers, businesses, NHS patients and UK expats. It comes as ministers step up preparations for leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement, which cabinet minister Liam Fox has estimated at a ""60-40"" chance. Changes to VAT, card payment rises, and blood supply scares: The government sets out some of the possibilities being planned for. Horseracing currently enjoys a tripartite agreement between Britain, Ireland and France, which allows free movement of horses between the countries. There are around 26,000 movements of thoroughbred horses each year between the three countries, according to the BHA. Despite being in place since the 1960s, the three-country agreement became enshrined in EU law when the UK and Ireland joined what was then the Common Market. There are now concerns it could fail to exist beyond Brexit, if the EU and Britain fail to negotiate a deal. The BHA's Ross Hamilton told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""If the position was that the UK government chose to immediately put up borders and tariffs, then it would make it extremely difficult for thoroughbreds to move. ""It would be only a month ahead of the Grand National in 2019, which would be quite an impact - a threat to potentially Irish horses participating in that race, Irish jockeys being able to compete in our races over here if it was a really hard no-deal Brexit."" The BHA has stressed the easy movement of horses is not just an ""economic"" issue, but also a matter of animal welfare. However, the organisation is reassured by the government's position, following talks with Whitehall departments since the 2016 Brexit vote. Mr Hamilton said: ""We've been engaging very closely with DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and DCMS [Department for Culture, Media and Sport] since even before the referendum took place, about what the implications would be. ""The UK government's position, based on what we've seen in some of the papers and what we may see in the coming weeks, is they will want to try to carry on with things, as far as possible, that they can beyond Brexit. ""The question will be - and this is a matter for our colleagues in Ireland and France to be representing to their own governments and the Commission - is whether the Commission chooses to reciprocate that."" He added next year's Grand National would be ""no different at all"" if the UK government ""does what it says it will and the EU reciprocates"". But, in the event the EU turns down UK efforts to maintain the status quo, Mr Hamilton said: ""I think there would be an issue about whether or not Irish trainers would be comfortable with taking their horses over to the UK, [or] if they were able to get them back into Ireland after the race. ""That would be a potential impact."" Yet, he stressed other major horseracing events such as Royal Ascot attract horses from many countries outside the EU as part of a ""hugely international sport"" and under ""established procedures"" for transporting horses. Mr Hamilton also stated he was not hearing too many concerns about the impact of Brexit on the sport as ""we have been proactive as an industry in communicating all of the different things and scenarios that will happen, and we are doing a lot of preparatory work as an industry that if that scenario will unfold we will put in a lot of measures"". On Sunday, Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney played down fears of a no-deal Brexit, describing it as ""very, very unlikely"". A Government spokesperson said: ""Our priority is for the movement of horses to continue with minimal delay and bureaucracy, whilst safeguarding welfare, biosecurity and disease control.""""We are also working with Ireland and France on developing new arrangements for after we leave the EU."""

While it is understood the 75-year-old is unlikely to lead the party into the next scheduled general election in 2022, those close to Sir Vince insist he would still be at the helm were an early vote called at any point next year. The Lib Dem leader came under fire last month after he missed a crunch Brexit vote in the House of Commons on amendments to the Customs Bill. The plans to change the party rules are said to have been inspired by Tom Pitfield, a former aide to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is currently advising the Lib Dem leader. Sir Vince approached members of the parliamentary party individually to discuss his proposal before MPs left Westminster for the summer break. A number are understood to have misgivings about the plans, but Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem MP who currently chairs the science and technology select committee, told Sky News he welcomed the proposals. ""When you have a small parliamentary party it inevitably limits the choice very considerably. You've got 12 people, some of whom won't have any interest in being leader, or seen in that light, so you end up with a very small field potentially. ""And there may be other dynamic people out there beyond the parliamentary party who could have a significant impact on the future of liberal progressive politics, so why exclude them?"" Reports of plans to change the Lib Dem leadership rules were first reported last month, leading to speculation that prominent anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller could be a potential future candidate. Currently the most likely contenders to run for the party leadership are deputy leader Jo Swinson, former minister and Home Affairs spokesperson Ed Davey and education spokesperson Layla Moran."
2018-08-27,Fans of Italian Serie A football club Genoa watched the first 43 minutes of their clash with Empoli in silence to honour the victims of the Morandi Bridge collapse. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/genoa-fc-fans-stay-silent-for-43-minutes-in-honour-of-bridge-collapse-victims-11483299,"In a mark of respect, they remained silent for one minute for each of the 43 victims of the bridge collapse on 14 August. It began with a minute's silence before kick-off followed by applause for relatives of the victims who were invited onto the pitch. As requested by Genoa fans, the silence continued after kick-off as only the shouts of the players echoed around the stadium. In a statement before the game, fans asked for ""a deafening silence of 43 minutes, one for each child, worker, student, father or mother who are no longer with us today"". At the end, they chanted ""Genova, Genova"", the Italian name of the city. Genoa won 2-1 with both their goals set up by captain Domenico Criscito. There were shouts of ""buffone"" - clown - and ""vergogna"" - shame on you - as former minister and current Democratic Party secretary Maurizio Martina and Italy's former defence minister Roberta Pinotti arrived at the state funeral. Criscito had entered the pitch before kick-off with Cesare Cerulli, the 11-year-old son of bridge collapse victim Andrea Cerulli. ""The first thought always goes to the tragedy,"" Genoa coach Davide Ballardini said. ""Then you train but every day you take a road or something else that reminds you of it. ""Our legs and heads were heavy."" Criscito and the other Genoa players wore T-shirts that read ""Genoa nel cuore"", Genoa in the heart, with a design featuring a heart in the middle of the bridge span. There was also a minute of silence observed and the Genoa teammates wore black ribbons on their shirts while the space usually reserved for sponsors was left blank. A huge banner hanging from the stadium's upper deck read: ""In silence for you, hurt 43 times in the heart. Get back on your feet proudly and become splendid again!"""

2018-08-27,The daughter of the British couple who died in an Egyptian hotel says something in their room killed them. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/couple-who-died-in-egypt-hotel-killed-by-something-in-their-room-says-daughter-11482934,"John and Susan Cooper, from Burnley, Lancashire, died on Tuesday morning while on holiday at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada with their daughter and her child. An inspection of the couple's hotel room revealed there were no toxic or harmful gas emissions or leaks, prosecutor Nabil Sadeq said. The deaths of the couple, aged 69 and 63, prompted tour operator Thomas Cook to evacuate 301 of its customers from the hotel as a ""precautionary measure"". The couple's daughter Kelly Ormerod, who had been on holiday with her parents and daughter, said she found them both seriously ill in their room. She said her daughter went to her grandparents' room after a meal they all had together the night before. Ms Ormerod said: ""My daughter said they could smell something that was a little bit funny, that wasn't right. ""All they did was spray a little bit of perfume to try to eliminate the smell."" When her parents failed to come down for breakfast the next day, Ms Ormerod went to their room. She said: ""As I opened the door, I could see that my dad was extremely ill and he was staggering back to the bed."" Her father said he felt ""really, really poorly"" while her mother was lying on the bed. Doctors were called and they attended to her father as a priority as his condition was worse. Ms Ormerod said: ""They tried basically to save his life and they couldn't - they did CPR on him but nothing could help him, nothing could save him. ""Mum had no idea what was going on - she was oblivious to what was actually happening because she was so poorly."" Her mother was taken to hospital where she died later. Ms Ormerod said: ""I don't think it was specifically an individual's fault for the deaths. ""I think when they went back to that room that evening there was something in that room that's actually killed them - whether they've inhaled something that poisoned them, I don't know. ""I can only have my opinion on what's gone on, but there's something that happened in that room that killed my parents."" :: Egypt hotel couple's deaths: What do we know? Ms Ormerod previously told Sky News she believed ""something suspicious"" had caused their deaths. Thomas Cook's chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, has told Sky News that the company had brought in experts to test water, food and air conditioning and the results of the tests should be known within ten days. ""We have no real evidence what caused the deaths, but what I can promise is at Thomas Cook we are doing everything to support the family and to support the Egyptian authorities... to get to the bottom of it and to get to the cause,"" he said. ""There is no evidence that it is a carbon monoxide poisoning. We have no evidence but I don't want to rule out anything before I really know the cause."" Mr Fankhauser continued: ""Twenty-four hours after the couple died we had we had our specialists... in the hotel. They took probes of the food, of the hygienic systems, of water, as well the air conditioning systems, and all those probes are now in Egypt. ""They are now examining and testing the probes and we support them in doing that, but that takes about 10 days."" A spokesman for the Steigenberger hotel said the company was carrying out its own investigation and would be doing everything possible to assist the authorities. Ms Ormerod, who is now back in the UK, told Sky News she has hired a local lawyer to find out what happened to her parents. At least 20 people have brought legal claims against the hotel over hygiene standards. Nick Harris, a lawyer who is representing the group, said his clients had reported becoming unwell after recent stays at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel. Mr Harris told Sky News complaints had been made over ""the food, the temperatures of the food, things like that"". He added: ""It seems to be the same complaints coming back time and time again."""
2018-08-27,"Several brands of vanilla ice cream have been found to contain no vanilla, no cream and no fresh milk, an investigation has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/vanilla-ice-creams-dont-contain-vanilla-11483350,"The key ingredients were absent from a number of supermarket and branded vanilla ice creams. One in five of the vanilla ice creams examined by Which? contained none of the three ingredients consumers might reasonably expect to find in them. Just half of the 24 ice creams in the survey contained all three ingredients - with the remaining 12 containing either some or none. Of the five products not containing any vanilla, cream or fresh milk, four were supermarket own brand products. They included Soft Scoop Vanilla Ice Cream from Asda, Morrisons and Tesco, and Ms Molly's, exclusively sold at Tesco - and the branded Wall's Soft Scoop Vanilla Ice Cream. Vanilla ice cream is traditionally made from fresh milk, cream, egg yolks, sugar and vanilla, However, Which? found a number of the products in its survey substituted cream and milk with partially reconstituted dried skimmed milk and in some cases whey protein, while vanilla was often replaced with a general flavouring. Extra non-dairy ingredients in some of the ice creams included palm oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and water. Up until 2015, a product labelled ice cream in the UK had to contain at least 5% dairy fat and 2.5% milk protein. However, the introduction of the Food Information Regulations meant the rules no longer applied. The removal of the criteria was to enable more flexibility with reformulation and product innovation, and has allowed for vegan products and reduced fat options to be sold as ice cream. Which? said the changes had allowed for new products to suit a broader range of tastes but had also allowed for cheaper ingredients to replace those used in traditional recipes. Currently only products labelled as dairy ice cream must contain at least 5% dairy fat, some protein from a dairy source and no vegetable fats. Which? said: ""Shoppers may be surprised to find out that the vanilla ice creams available to buy in supermarkets can vary wildly in terms of the ingredients they contain. ""For those looking for a more authentic ice cream or trying to avoid controversial ingredients such as palm oil, our advice is to check the ingredients list, and look for these three key ingredients - natural vanilla, dairy cream, and fresh milk."""

The opioid crisis is one of our top priorities at HHS, with a drumbeat of action on the full range of efforts where we can assist local communities. Today, I joined @POTUS & @FLOTUS in Ohio to learn how states and communities are responding to the challenge of opioid addiction. pic.twitter.com/NwxSoeNznA The stripes are white and red.

The President has colored his flag wrong. That is all. pic.twitter.com/wWXBgR9I6V One Twitter user wrote: ""You're hilarious if you don't think the president knows what a flag looks like. HES COLORING!!!!!! with children. If it was a horse and he colored it pink would people be upset he colored a horse not a REAL horse color???"" While another said: ""Maybe some kid asked him if a Flag could be other colors, then he proceeded to show them that life can be anything you want it to be. Then colored the flag another color to show them. Not everything is that deep. It's just a coloring page for kids in an elementary class."" However, others weren't as forgiving. One tweeter posted: ""That moron needs to go back to school."" Another said: ""His coloring is at Nursery School level though. Along with his civics knowledge."" ""Cmon it's not that easy as having a reminder attached to your clothing.... Oh. Didn't spot the lapel pin,"" said another. The president was in Ohio on a visit aimed at finding a way to tackle the worsening crisis of opioid addiction. Last year, Mr Trump declared America's use of opioids a national public health emergency, calling it ""the worst drug crisis in American history""."
2018-08-27,Dr Amy Kavanagh has launched the #JustAskDontGrab campaign to help change the way people interact with those with disabilities.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/blind-activist-wants-to-change-how-people-interact-with-those-with-disabilities-11481119,"She says that while people with disabilities often receive well-meaning offers of assistance, they're not always in the most helpful way. Navigating the world with a visual impairment presents a unique set of challenges. Sometimes I need a bit of help with everyday tasks, like crossing a road, going down the stairs or getting on the right bus. I rely on the kindness of strangers to help me live an independent life. However, sometimes the good intentions of the general public have unintended consequences. Almost daily I am pushed, pulled or grabbed without warning by strangers who are trying to help me. This sudden unexpected and unwanted touching is often frightening, disorientating and sometimes even dangerous. Imagine what it's like to be pulled into a road when you can't see the other side of the street or if the cars have stopped. Or pushed onto a train when you can't tell where the platform ends or the carriage begins. Yet, whenever I explain that being pushed or grabbed has scared me or disorientated me, people reply ""I was just trying to help!"". The more I talked about these experiences on social media, the more replies I got from other disabled people sharing their stories. Wheelchair users being pushed around like pieces of furniture, people who use crutches or canes are being unbalanced by enthusiastic strangers. I even heard from a guide dog owner who had his dog's lead pulled out of his hand! Each time, they were told that the person was just being kind, just trying to help. Yet frequently these incidents have resulted in damaged wheelchairs, caused pain or injuries, or sadly made someone too anxious to leave the house. I started the Just Ask Don't Grab campaign to explain how best to assist disabled people. It's very simple, there's one golden rule: just ask. If you see somebody and you think they might need help, don't jump in and grab them. Don't push them towards the train door or pull them across the road. Just ask if they need a hand, and that way you'll find out how you can best help them. By asking what assistance is required and listening to the response, you will be able to best help that person. They can tell you what they need, how to make sure they are safe and then you will have a positive experience helping them. People often say they are worried about offending someone if they offer help. I'm never offended by polite offers of help. Sometimes I decline offers of help, but it's not because I'm offended. Maintaining my independence is really important to me. I've been trained how to use my white cane so that I can navigate safely by myself. I might do something slower or differently to you but I want to do it myself. When I'm grabbed the person takes away my independence, they've presumed I am incapable and they've not given me a choice. It's frustrating as well as frightening. However, there are times when I am struggling. Like many disabled people I don't always feel confident enough to ask for help, and if someone offers a hand - it's fantastic. I know it takes a lot of bravery to go up to a total stranger and talk to them, but I've had some amazing conversations. The people that help me have often brightened my day and made a difficult situation so much better. Recent research from disability charity Sense found one in four disabled people feel lonely every day. Offering help not only means that you will make a task easier, but you may help a disabled person better connect to their community and feel more able to go out independently. So if you see somebody with a disability, and you think they might need some assistance, remember just ask and don't grab."

Police decried how ""another young life was senselessly lost due to violence"" as they called for witnesses to a possible altercation between two men or a group of males. Last week, Scotland Yard opened its 100th inquiry into a violent death this year. It has been claimed the rate of deadly attacks this year is the fastest in a decade, with the number of investigations having not reached 100 before October for the past ten years. In the latest incident, which takes the number of inquiries above 100, officers were called around 11.45pm on Saturday to reports of a man found unresponsive at the junction between Creek Road and Deptford Church Street.

It could see regulators approve it for prescription on the NHS. The drug is an appetite suppressant which is taken twice a day. It works by stimulating brain chemicals to induce a feeling of fullness. Researchers in the US experimented on 12,000 people who were either obese or overweight. Some were given the drug and some were given a placebo. Those who took the drug lost an average of nine pounds - 4kg - in just over three years. Further analysis showed no big differences in tests for heart valve damage. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told the Press Association: ""I think it is the thing everybody has been looking for. ""I think there will be several holy grails, but this is a holy grail and one which has been certainly at the back of the mind of a lot of specialists for a long time. ""But all of the other things apply - lifestyle change has got to be root and branch part of this."" The Food and Drug Administration, the US medicines watchdog, approved lorcaserin's use in some adults in 2012. The drug has been on sale there since 2013, where it costs between $220-$290 (£155-£225) a month. The study into its long-term effects was led by Dr Erin Bohula, a cardiovascular medicine expert at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. She said: ""Patients and their doctors have been nervous about using drugs to treat obesity and for good reason. There's history of these drugs having serious complications."" As well as heart problems, there are concerns some weight-loss drugs can lead to mental health problems. Tests for heart valve damage were done on 3,270 participants, but no significant differences in rates were identified. Suicidal thoughts or behaviour were reported in 21 people taking lorcaserin compared with 11 people given placebo; however, those taking the weight-loss drug had a history of depression."

2018-08-27,Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas wants helmets to be compulsory for cyclists - putting him at odds with leading cycling campaigners.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/cycle-helmets-should-be-compulsory-tour-de-france-champion-geraint-thomas-says-11482510,"The 32-year-old, who rode to glory with Team Sky last month, believes cyclists have ""no reason not to"" wear a helmet on UK roads. Unlike for motorcyclists or moped drivers, there is no compulsion in UK law for cyclists to wear a helmet while out on the roads, despite it being recommended under the Highway Code. Late last year, the government revealed it will look at the issue as part of a wider review into cycling safety, although cycling campaign groups oppose making helmets mandatory. In an interview with the Sunday Times magazine, Thomas spoke of the UK's recent cycling boom, which has coincided with British riders winning the Tour de France six times in the last seven years, including his own somewhat surprising success. He said: ""Things have improved a lot since 2008 and 2012, after the Olympics, when cycling really caught on. ""When I was a kid I was always being beeped and told to get off the effin' road. The problem is that cyclists and drivers see each other as enemies. ""A cyclist can get cut up by a car and the driver has been an idiot, but 10 minutes later that cyclist is jumping a red light. You've got to share the road. ""London is different. I've never ridden a bike in London, apart from in a race. I've watched from a taxi and it does seem a bit crazy. ""I would certainly make helmets compulsory. I always wear a helmet, I've put on a helmet more times than I've buckled a seatbelt. ""Helmets have come on a lot - well ventilated, not too hot, you don't look stupid - no reason not to."" However, Thomas's views contrast with those of fellow Olympic cycling gold medallist Chris Boardman. He told Thomas on Twitter: ""Exactly what I thought when I was a pro. It's an intuitive stance until you research levels of danger compared to other things we do helmet-less and crucially, the unintended consequences."" Boardman has previously stated making helmets compulsory ""isn't even in the top 10 things that will really keep people who want to cycle safe"". His mother, Carol, died of her injuries after being hit by a truck while out cycling in North Wales in July 2016. Boardman, who also wore the Tour de France yellow jersey during his career, has recently attacked the government for raising the issue of helmets as part of its cycling safety review, pointing to evidence that cycling use drops where helmets are required by law. He wrote in an article last year: ""In the UK 1 in 6 deaths - nearly 90,000 per year - is as a result of physical inactivity related disease including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. ""Clearly, any measure proven beyond doubt to reduce peoples likelihood to travel by bike, will almost certainly kill more people than it saves."" His stance is shared by Cycling UK, the national cycling charity. Wow! This was one question in an hour interview. It’s nothing I’ve ever thought about. So when asked I thought... I always wear one and I’d advise all children to wear them so🤷‍♂️ Didn’t realise people felt so passionately about helmets!! #thisaintacampaign #calmdown Following the publication of his interview and the significant reaction to his comments about helmets, Thomas insisted he was not actively campaigning for a change to the law. He posted on Twitter: ""Wow! This was one question in an hour interview. It's nothing I've ever thought about. So when asked I thought... I always wear one and I'd advise all children to wear them. ""Didn't realise people felt so passionately about helmets!! #thisaintacampaign #calmdown"" In 2016, 18,477 cyclists were hurt in reported road accidents, with 102 deaths and 3,397 seriously injured. Earlier this month, the government announced plans to consult on introducing a ""death by dangerous cycling"" offence following the high-profile death of mother-of-two Kim Briggs. But the Conservative Party were forced to apologise for a social media post that stated the ""most vulnerable road users"" need protection from ""dangerous cycling"". Ministers were also accused of focussing their time on the smaller proportion of people killed by cyclists, rather than conducting a full review of traffic offences."

Before going back to prison, she told her husband Richard Ratcliffe: ""How can I survive tonight with those tears of my baby, pouting and crying, and telling me she doesn't want me to go back?"" ""I couldn't bear her tears. Nothing is worse than her tears. I cannot forget her face"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 for ""plotting to overthrow the Iranian regime"" and was convicted last year despite her denials, with her family - from Hampstead, north London - campaigning to have her released permanently. Her lawyer had been hoping to come to an arrangement with prosecutors to extend her three-day release, but it has now emerged that those efforts have proved futile. According to Richard Ratcliffe, his wife went to see Iran's deputy prosecutor with her lawyer on Sunday morning and was told she would not need to return to jail immediately. Better yet, on her way back to where her family has been staying in Damavand, northeast of Tehran, the 40-year-old was told her extension had been approved. Ten minutes after arriving, however, Mr Ratcliffe said the family received another phone call from the prosecutor's office and were told she would have to be back in her cell by sunset because the necessary permit had not been signed off. She went back to the office - this time with Gabriella - and was told she would need to go back to jail for a few days until the key signature was received. In a heartfelt bid to have the decision reversed, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reportedly said: ""How can you take me away from my baby, when she needs me? ""I haven't done anything wrong - you just extended my cellmate's furlough, and she is serving a longer sentence for bigger crimes. You know I didn't do anything in the first place. ""I have spent two-and-a-half years in prison, and I haven't committed any crime."" She added: ""You can't send a small child her mummy, and then take her away again after three days. It is cruel. It is beyond cruel."" Despite the plea, the prosecutor's office has stood firm on its stance and Mr Ratcliffe - who was refused a visa to visit his wife and daughter - has confirmed that his wife is now back in her jail cell. He said the prospect of her being ""picked up in the middle of the night"" would prove ""even more traumatising"" for their young daughter. ""It's a cruel turn of events and it will be tough to go through,"" he told Sky News. He added: ""I still find it an extraordinary decision. I did not believe after all the effort it took to get out, it would only be for three days."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe bid an emotional farewell to her daughter before she went back to the prison, saying: ""How can I survive tonight - with those tears of my baby, pouting and crying, and telling me she doesn't want me to go back. ""She is adorable, and she is also kind and caring. I couldn't bear her tears. Nothing is worse than her tears. I cannot forget her face."" The British Embassy has been informed of the development, which comes just days after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt joined calls for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe to be released permanently. He said he had spoken the Iranian foreign minister on Friday ""but that clearly wasn't enough"". ""Looks like Iranian legal system is impervious to the simple fact at the heart of this: an innocent woman is desperate to be reunited with her family,"" he tweeted. The Free Nazanin campaign had said her temporary release came after ""positive meetings"" with Mr Hunt this month, who is considering providing her with diplomatic protection. Responding to the news she had returned to jail, her local MP Tulip Sadiq tweeted: ""Very sad to hear that Nazanin's extension was not granted, and she has been taken back into prison this evening. I will provide more of an update later."" Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said her return to jail was ""desperately disappointing"". Other prisoners released from the same prison for a few days are still out a month later - something the family had hoped would also happen to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We remain very concerned about all our dual nationals detained in Iran, and continue to make decisions in line with what we believe will produce the best outcomes in their cases. ""We do not think it is in the best interests of any of our dual national detainees to provide a running commentary on individual cases."""
2018-08-27,"As students across the UK open their results envelopes, we unpack what the GCSE grading system means.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180827075206/https://news.sky.com/story/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-gcse-grades-system-11479241,":: Which results will be affected? When the new system was rolled out last year, only GCSE maths, English literature and English language exams taken in England were marked using the new grades. This year, the following subjects will also be part of the 9-1 grading system: :: Ancient languages (classical Greek, Latin):: Art and design:: Biology:: Chemistry:: Citizenship studies:: Combined science (double award):: Computer science:: Dance:: Drama:: Food preparation and nutrition:: Geography:: History:: Modern foreign languages (French, German, Spanish):: Music:: Physics:: Physical education:: Religious studies More subjects will be added next summer and by 2020 all GCSEs will be graded from 9-1. Until 2020, depending on the GCSEs taken teenagers can receive a mix of lettered and numbered grades. The other countries in the UK have different exams systems and will continue to use the old grading system. :: What do the grades mean? The new grading system will score pupils from 1 to 9, with grade 9 being the highest mark and grade 1 the lowest. A pupil who scored a C previously would receive a 4 this year. What would have been a low A grade is now equivalent to a grade 7 and a high A would be a grade 8. To be awarded a level 9 is harder than getting an A* - think of it as an A**. According to one estimate, as few as 200 candidates could get straight grade 9s across all of their GCSEs this year. :: Why was the system introduced? The new grading system should create greater division between pupils' abilities as there are more grades to split them between. Under the old system there were eight categories (A* to G) whereas now there are nine. The new system was specifically created to allow for more differentiation among high achieving pupils, as those students who previously got As or A*s will now be split between three grades 7, 8 and 9. :: What to do if you've missed your grades It is possible to retake some of your GCSE exams in the autumn to try and increase your mark. November resit exams are only available in mathematics and English language, and only for pupils who were 16 or over on the preceding 31 August. All other exams, including resits for other subjects, will only take place in the summer. If you have missed your grades, some A-level or college course may still accept you if you're planning to re-sit your exams. But if you can't resit, you could take another course where you made the grades or apply to a different college as not all colleges will require the same grades. If your grades are unexpectedly low you can also request to see your exam papers and consider asking for the paper to be remarked."
