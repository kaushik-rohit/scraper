2018-04-01,Russia has accused Britain of flouting diplomatic convention by blocking access to poisoned spy Sergei Skripal and barring it from the investigation into a murdered Russian businessman.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/reputation-matters-russia-accuses-uk-of-blocking-its-right-to-see-poisoned-spy-and-his-daughter-11313498,"Hitting out at the Government, Russia's UK embassy tweeted a picture from zombie film 28 Days Later, complete with its biohazard logo. Its message said: ""28 days passed since the poisoning of Sergei & Yulia Skripal. UK hasn't complied with its obligation under the consular convention to provide access to the Russian citizens and the course of investigation."" 28 days passed since the poisoning of Sergei & Yulia Skripal. UK hasn’t complied with its obligation under the consular convention to provide access to the 🇷🇺 citizens and the course of investigation pic.twitter.com/0OKsilJvs2 Former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are still in hospital after being poisoned by deadly nerve agent novichok on 4 March. Russia has said it ""insists"" on seeing Ms Skripal after her condition dramatically improved. She is now understood to conscious and talking. The UK government - which claims the Russian state is behind the attempted murders - is looking into the legality of the request, and also considering ""the rights and wishes"" of the 33-year-old. Her father remains seriously ill and unresponsive. Reputation matters. After declining Russia access to Russian nationals in UK, why should @foreignoffice expect other countries to satisfy similar British requests? pic.twitter.com/athwace480 Another tweet by the embassy showed a picture of a golden key with the words: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". It added: ""Reputation matters. After declining Russia access to Russian nationals in UK, why should @foreignoffice expect other countries to satisfy similar British requests?"" As tit-for-tat expulsions continue, the first Russian diplomats to be kicked out of the US arrived back in Moscow on Sunday. America has expelled 60 Russians, joining many European countries who also asked diplomats to leave in solidarity with the UK. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the Kremlin had unleashed a ""tidal wave of smears, lies and mockery"" since the poisonings. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he called the attack ""illegal and contemptuous"" and said President Putin was using ""hybrid capabilities to subvert, undermine, and influence countries around the world"". Russia continues to strongly deny any involvement and has responded to the West by throwing out an equal number of diplomats. It has also published 14 questions about the investigation into the poisonings. They include asking ""what specific antidotes"" the Skripals had been given and if novichok had ever been ""researched, developed or produced in the UK"". International chemical weapons experts are studying samples from Salisbury to see if they agree with the UK view that Russia was to blame. Russia also tweeted on Sunday about murdered businessman Nikolai Glushkov, who was found dead in his London home last month. The embassy's tweet, which featured the 20mph speed limit sign, again protested over a lack of access to the case. It said: ""20 days passed since the murder of Nikolay Glushkov in London. UK hasn’t complied with its obligation under the consular convention to provide access to the course of investigation."" A post-mortem examination said the 68-year-old had died from ""compression to the neck"". Counter-terror officers are leading the investigation but have said there is nothing to suggest a link with the Salisbury case. Mr Glushkov, a retired financial director for Russian airline Aeroflot, was wanted over fraud allegations in his homeland. He was also a close friend of Vladimir Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, who died in 2013."
2018-04-01,North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his wife have turned out to see South Korean 'K-pop' acts at a rare concert in Pyongyang.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/kim-jong-un-claps-along-to-k-pop-at-north-korea-concert-11312998,"It was the first gig to feature South Korean artists in the North's capital for more than a decade and another sign of warming relations between the two countries. Around 150 people, including 11 musical acts, dancers, technicians and taekwondo experts travelled to the city for the show at East Pyongyang Grand Theatre. Popular girl group Red Velvet were on the bill, as well as singers Cho Yong-pil and Choi Jin-hee - known to have been favoured by Kim's late father. Mr Kim's watched the concert from a balcony with South Korean culture minister Do Jong-whan. He clapped his hands during the show, shook hands with the performers and posed for a group photo, South Korean media reported. South Korean K-pop - like most foreign influences - is usually supressed by the North, but makes its way in on smuggled USB sticks from China. A joint taekwondo demonstration, also featuring athletes from the North, will be held on Monday and there will be more musical performances on Tuesday. It comes ahead of a summit between the neighbours scheduled for 27 April. The countries also put out a joint ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics in Pyongchang, South Korea, in February. The closer diplomatic relations come after years of tension over the North's missile tests and its threats to attack the US. However, Mr Kim shocked many when South Korea politicians revealed recently that the North Korean leader had offered talks with President Trump. The details of that meeting are still to be announced, but it is expected before the end of May. Kim Jong Un has also just returned from a trip to China - his first overseas visit since he took power in 2011. He travelled by train - which is thought to have had bulletproof carriages - and held talks in Beijing with President Xi."
2018-04-01,Britain's youngest military wing was formed 100 years ago today. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/100-years-of-the-raf-how-britains-air-force-has-changed-11308647,"The Royal Air Force was formed after the First World War, authorised by King George V, to recognise the growing role of air power in warfare. It merged the aviation branches of the Army and the Navy. It was the world's first independent air force. Sophy Gardner is researching the politics of British air power for a PhD which is a collaboration between the University of Exeter and the RAF Museum. She served for 20 years in the RAF, leaving as a Wing Commander in 2011. She was deployed on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also spent a tour on aircraft carriers with the Royal Navy. The RAF was created on 1 April 1918, 100 years ago this weekend. Constructed in wartime from two branches of the older services, it faced an uncertain future after the November Armistice. A decade of arguments over its existence and purpose followed. Yet, in many ways, these attacks made the young air force stronger, forcing it to make its case and building a stronger sense of collective identity within the light blue service. The Women's Royal Air Force was also created on that same day. However, it survived only two years before being disbanded as part of post-war demobilisation in 1920. Women have stepped into the breech in both world wars, making a vital contribution, and today the RAF is the first of the British armed services to open every one of its roles to women. :: RAF turns 100: A century of guarding Britain's skies When women were allowed to apply to be pilots in the early 1990s, the RAF wasn't entirely ready for women aircrew - flying clothing wasn't specially designed for women and squadrons sometimes lacked facilities for women. That has, of course, changed now, although there can still be less awareness among girls and young women about the opportunities available to them in the RAF. In its early days, the priority was creating the foundations of the modern force and that started with training. The Royal Naval Air Station at Cranwell became RAF Cranwell, the focus of early RAF officer and flying training. RAF Halton became the home of technical training for ""boy"" apprentices. The apprenticeships, and the cadetships which were offered to the best apprentices to progress to officer training at Cranwell, were one of the first examples of a widespread effort to promote social mobility in the armed forces. Today, more and more of the RAF's entrants join with excellent qualifications, often educated to degree level. Of course, the technology has changed. Early aircraft had open cockpits and limited communications with the ground. By the end of the Second World War, the first jet engines had been developed and aircraft could carry large loads over long distances. By the early 2000s the first unmanned aircraft were being flown by RAF aircrew. One constant throughout the RAF's first 100 years has been that the people who support and operate the technology are its most important component, even if the work they do has changed with technology. In the early days carpenters were required to work on wooden aircraft - now the RAF offers apprenticeships for Cyberspace Communication Specialists. However, the spirit of the RAF remains the same and much of the early culture - language, nicknames, wing and squadron organisation - is still recognisable in the RAF of today. While the RAF is accused of being too young to have traditions (the joke is that it has habits instead), it is that spirit and a fascination with the air and flying that still unites the airwomen and men of the modern Royal Air Force and links them to their pioneering ancestors."
2018-04-01,Sky News has seen a file of documents given to the Home Office which the local MP claims demonstrates authorities in Telford are still failing to tackle child abuse.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/telford-authorities-still-failing-to-tackle-child-abuse-amid-grooming-investigation-11308688,"MP for Telford Lucy Allan says the evidence she's complied from victims and their families shows ""a failure to understand the nature of grooming"" by the local police and the Crown Prosecution Service. Last Monday, it was announced that the National Independent Inquiry into Child Exploitation will speak to victims in Telford as part of its Truth Project. It follows calls for a fresh examination of police and local authority failures in the town. As part of the bundle given to the Home Office, Sky News has seen a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service from 2016 telling a father in Telford they will not prosecute alleged offences against his daughter when she was aged 13 to 15 because she consented to the sex. It states: ""The defence that was put forward in this case was that she willingly met the suspect and had consensual sexual intercourse with him. ""Also at the time this took place the suspect held a reasonable belief that she was over the age of 16."" It goes on: ""In her statements to the police she was clear that although she may not have wanted sexual intercourse with the suspect, she agreed to do so."" Mrs Allan said: ""This is a grooming case. This is where a gang, a network is involved. There are multiple perpetrators. ""And to use that defence in that type of case suggests to me that people in authority are not fully understanding the nature of grooming and not fully understanding the way in which a young person of 13 or 14 does not have the capacity to consent in a situation like that."" A CPS spokesperson told Sky News: ""This case did not meet the evidential test as set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and hence we decided not to prosecute the suspect."" They say a review of the decision came to the same conclusion Recently, Telford's police chief said that the number and scale of girls sexually abused there had been ""sensationalised"". West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding ""significantly disputed"" claims that 1,000-plus children may have been groomed over four decades in the Shropshire town. In 2013, several men from Telford were jailed for organised child abuse offences, including Mubarak and Ahdel Ali, brothers convicted of sexual exploitation and trafficking children.However, a number of new alleged victims have emerged in Telford who say, even recently, that their cases are not being properly looked into. Sky News has learned of one case where it's claimed a child abuse incident was reported four times over several years before it was investigated. Referring to this case, West Mercia Police said: ""Both parties were spoken to and it was established both believed that each other were over the age of consent. ""Once it was established this was not the case, appropriate measures were put in place to safeguard the girl who was under the age of consenting."" But Mrs Allan told Sky News: ""I think it's really important in Telford that we open our eyes to this. That we don't just say that everything's alright because we're ticking the right boxes. It does a disservice to the victims. ""Until we understand what's happened and what's gone wrong, we won't be able to change the attitudes and the ethos that the young girls are to blame and indulging in promiscuous behaviour. We have to look at them as victims."""
2018-04-01,"A Chinese space station hurtling towards Earth is expected to re-enter the atmosphere between 11pm tonight and 5am tomorrow, a Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/crash-time-frame-narrowed-as-chinese-space-station-tiangong-1-falls-to-earth-11312982,"Only about 10% of the 8.5-tonne Tiangong-1 is likely to survive re-entry, meaning its descent poses only a small risk to people on the ground. Experts have been trying to narrow down the time frame amid speculation over when the unmanned craft will crash. The Aerospace Corp has predicted Tiangong-1 will re-enter the atmosphere seven hours either side of 2am on Easter Monday. The European Space Agency estimated earlier that the craft will arrive after 12.25am on Monday, but the agency has stressed that the time is ""highly variable"". The ESA's latest update on its blog states that they now predict the space station could land sometime between ""the night of April 1 to the early morning of April 2"". Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut, told Sky News: ""It's really hard to predict these things because many things influence the density of the atmosphere, and you know, how much grab it's going to have on the space craft as it comes down."" Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, tweeted this afternoon: ""OK Tiangong-1 fans, now we're cooking. ""The @SpaceTrackOrg TIP window is down to + - 3 hours, during which time Tiangong-1 makes 4 orbits of the Earth. ""We can start to narrow things down at last."" Tiangong-1 reentry window begins at 2200 UTC Sunday, extends till 0400 UTC Monday. Current orbit 151 x 159 km x 42.7 deg Mr McDowell tweeted that Tiangong-1 is expected to land between 11pm to 5am UK time. The space station is expected to land somewhere between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south of the equator, a range covering most of the United States, China, Africa, southern Europe, Australia and South America. But Mr McDowell's research has ruled out some of those locations. He tweeted: ""Sad news for my followers in North America, India, Europe and Australia: if the current prediction is correct, Tiangong will not be falling on you."" Sad news for my followers in North America, India, Europe and Australia: if the current prediction is correct, Tiangong will not be falling on you. Mr McDowell added in a separate post: ""However, those of you in South America, Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, China and New Guinea - or sailing the Pacific - should still pay attention."" Russia, Canada and northern Europe are all reported to be out of range. Mr McDowell has also pointed out that if part of the space station lands in your garden ""it's not yours, it's still China's"". Tiangong-1, which translates to ""Heavenly Palace 1"", was sent into orbit in 2011 for experiments as part of China's space programme. Worth posting more generally: If it lands in your garden, it's not yours, it's still China's. https://t.co/YcDYZxRkQH pic.twitter.com/FY8Mf8fgfh The space station was set to have a controlled re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, but the lab stopped working in March 2016. Tiangong-1 had not been occupied for three years, so there is no way of knowing for certain where it will land. Without being able to communicate with the space lab, controllers have no way of managing its descent. China has predicted most of its debris will fall in the ocean as it breaks up on descent."

The British heavyweight said after the fight that he would like negotiations for a bout with WBC champion Wilder to take place in private, adding he was ""not into the business of hype"". A match-up between Joshua and Wilder has been anticipated for some time, with the US fighter claiming he had ""declared war"" on Joshua earlier this year. Barry Hearn, chairman and founder of Joshua's promoters Matchroom, has revealed that negotiations to make the fight happen will start as soon as possible. ""It is a fight Anthony Joshua really wants and I think he wants it this year,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. Joshua has said he would like the bout to take place in the United Kingdom but Hearn is not ruling out the possibility of it happening in the United States if the terms are right.Matchroom view Joshua as a much bigger drawing card in the UK than Wilder is in the US. What a robbery... WOW‼️ @joeboxerparker great job Bro omg don’t apologize you did nothing wrong. True champion. @anthonyfjoshua, I ACCEPTED 100% P.S. Take AFRICA off your Arm. They’re warriors. You from UK brotha pic.twitter.com/09yv1bCqrq Hearn said: ""Anthony Joshua wants all the belts - that is the big card Deontay Wilder has got to play (but) commercially, Joshua is far bigger than Deontay Wilder.""I think Wilder would come over here because in the world we live in, in boxing, the couple of million dollars Wilder is getting for a fight is pretty small fry in comparison to the rewards that await him for a Joshua fight. ""Travelling is not usually a problem if the money is right.""But I still think in the long term, if Anthony sits down and thinks it through, he may come to the decision that to be a truly global sportstar he needs to go to America - not just for the money - but, in terms of the brand value of AJ, fighting in America is going to be on his horizon.""I wouldn't rule out AJ fighting in America despite his comments last night."" Don’t be with that bulls*** @eddiehearn pick up the phone Maine...#BombZquad pic.twitter.com/Rr4aewgKo4 Joshua was forced to go the distance for the first time on Saturday night, but was unanimously declared the winner as two judges scored him 118-110, while the other had him at 119-109. After his win, the heavyweight champion told Sky Sports: ""My strategy was to stick behind the jab. ""I was switched on and I was focused, Joseph Parker is a world champion I said this was about boxing finesse. ""What you can't forget is that I am the unified heavyweight champion of the world."" Both fighters had stepped into the ring at Cardiff's Principality Stadium undefeated and the win extends Joshua's perfect pro record to 21 victories from as many bouts. Joshua had won his previous 20 fights all by knockout but struggled to land clean shots on Parker. After the fight, American heavyweight Wilder tweeted that Joshua's victory had been a ""robbery"", and posted a video the following morning in which he claimed promoter Eddie Hearn was ignoring a phone call from him."

His is the first death of a serving member of the British armed forces in the fight against Islamic State. The roadside bomb in northern Syria also killed an American serviceman, and wounded five others. The US military did not confirm the location of the blast, but it came soon after one was reported in Manbij by a Syrian official. Manbij, an Arab-Kurdish mixed town close to the border with Turkey, is at risk of a Turkish military offensive. In a statement, the MoD confirmed ""with great sadness"" that Sgt Tonroe ""was tragically killed in action whilst on duty in the Middle East on the 29th March 2018"". After initial training he joined the parachute regiment as part of the sniper platoon and ""rapidly developed an array of competencies and combat experiences that were to lay the foundations of an outstanding career"". Sgt Tonroe's officer commanding (the commander of his sub-unit) said: ""If you had met Matt Tonroe, then you would have liked him. He bristled with the contentment of a life lived to its full. ""His bravery and talent as a solider, was matched by his compassion as a human being. He was an individual, with the courage to set his own course, and the perspective to see new possibilities at every turn. ""He was destined for great things in our unit; his leadership was both natural and apparently effortless. He is already missed. ""Without Matt, our company has lost some of its humour; some of its warmth; and some of its sheer opportunism. We will always remember him."" His commanding officer described Sgt Tonroe as ""a deeply intelligent man and one of life's characters"" The unnamed officer added: ""[Sgt Tonroe] had a steel core, served his country with pride and was a first class soldier, proven in combat, faced risk willingly and was ever ready for more. ""He thus died as he lived: daring and fearless in duty. We mourn his loss dearly, are proud to have known him and will honour him by continuing this fight."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Sergeant Matt Tonroe at this dreadful time. ""Sergeant Tonroe served his country with great distinction and it is clear from the tributes made by his colleagues that he was not only exceptionally dedicated and courageous but also a gifted and intelligent instructor who was respected by everyone he served with."" The MoD statement said that Sgt Tonroe was ""very much a family man, making every effort to see his beloved mum around numerous overseas deployments. ""He is survived by his mother Michelle, his brother Alex and girlfriend Olivia."" It is standard policy for the Ministry of Defence to neither confirm nor deny membership of the special forces"
2018-04-01,The wet weather seems to reflect the mood in the city of Salisbury in recent weeks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/salisbury-struggling-with-an-unwanted-fame-in-wake-of-nerve-agent-attack-11312286,"A city that has quickly grown tired and weary of being the focus of an international police investigation. It was four weeks ago today that the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were rushed to hospital after being exposed to the deadly nerve agent, novichok. That in itself was a rare occurrence, but the fact it happened in the sleepy city of Salisbury made the incident all the more frightening and mysterious. The Hollywood-style storyline has rocked the area. For the shops surrounding the police cordon, business is down 90%. A handful remain closed. Some locals will tell you that life goes on and there is nothing to fear, but for many it is simply not that easy. David Mayfield is a butcher with a pop up stall in The Maltings shopping centre, where the incident happened. He insists things are at breaking point. Mr Mayfield told Sky News: ""You're looking without exaggeration at a 60-70% loss minimum...The regulars can't even find us because they think Sainsbury's is closed. ""It's a farce it really is."" The council has now introduced free parking, which many admit has helped bring shoppers into the centre. ""Shops open"" signs are plastered all across the city. However, many are still anxious and too concerned to venture into town, despite Public Health England's warning that there is only a very low risk to the public. At the local market, stall holders insist things will only get back to normal once the media leave. There is certainly a sense that the international film and television crews have outstayed their welcome. But this is a news story that has captured the world's attention. The various twists and turns have barely been out of the headlines in the last month. One stall holder tells me that the tourist buses pass through Salisbury now. They don't stop. They head straight to Winchester. People don't want to get off. Outside the city's iconic cathedral, tourist Chris Justice, who's originally from the US, admits he had second thoughts about visiting. He told Sky News: ""Nerve agent and people don't mix very well, I guess, and so we were just thoughtful about whether we should be here or not."" On the outskirts of Salisbury, Easter weekend continues as normal. There are organised egg hunts, church services and a local point to point on Salisbury Plain. But you get a sense that some are genuinely worried about the impact the incident has had. Natalie Stevens, who has a two-year-old daughter, admits she doesn't feel safe venturing into town. She told Sky News: ""I am a bit uncomfortable about taking my daughter there because we don't know what the long term effects are. ""I don't want to go into Salisbury unless I actually have to. ""They keep saying there are no long term effects, but you can't help but worry when your kids are involved."" For all those with concerns, there are others who insist there is absolutely nothing to fear, but all seem to agree that Salisbury has suffered as a result of what happened. The city has always been best known for its cathedral and the ancient monument of Stonehenge. But around the world the name Salisbury is now associated with a chemical weapons attack and a diplomatic tit-for-tat. It is now known as the home of the former spy, Sergei Skripal. It will take time for the city to heal, for things to get back to normal. But Salisbury has already come a long way, when you consider how desolate the streets were just four weekends ago."

Road users can expect difficult driving conditions and a risk of localised flooding. Heavy rain is expected to affect parts of England and Wales on Sunday with the Met Office issuing yellow warnings, as up to 70mm is expected to fall in some areas. Buses and trains may be cancelled and spray flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and road closures. Yellow warnings for snow are in place from 3am on Monday morning through midnight, bringing a risk of road closures and power failures. Areas of north Pennines and Scottish borders over around 200m (650ft) look most at risk. Rural communities are at risk of being cut off, mainly across the northern Pennines and Scottish Borders. Power cuts could also occur, along with disruption to mobile phone coverage. More than 100 flood alerts and seven flood warnings were in place across England on Easter Sunday. Forecaster Helen Roberts said: ""The main risk is rain, we have a number of warnings out at the moment, including a fairly large rain warning covering most of the country. ""It is going to cause problems for people travelling on Monday - there will be a lot of surface water on roads. ""Further north there is a snow risk overnight on Sunday with snow and sleet across the moors of England and hills and mountains of wales."" The AA warned motorists to take extra care and said the Easter weekend is ""likely to be one of the busiest on the roads in recent years"". The UK has been hit by two cold snaps so far this year as two instalments of the Beast from the East brought unseasonably cold weather. Heavy snow last month caused motorists to get stuck for 17 or 18 hours as snow and high winds brought treacherous driving conditions. April sees an average of 2.3 snow days each year in the UK."

An extension to the deadline for applications in the last week has resulted in a surge of applications for the positions worth between £200 and £220 per month. Around nine million are thought to have applied in the last five days as Saturday's closing date approached. Around 26,000 assistant train driver jobs have been advertised along with nearly 63,000 other posts such as porters or metal workers. Candidates must be between 18 and 31, according to the 57-page application form, must undertake a written or online exam and must prove their identity to prevent fraud. India is currently facing an employment crisis and getting a job in the huge state-owned firm offers a guaranteed income. Many positions come with family accommodation. India's rail network - which manages 75,000 miles of track, employs 1.3 million people and carries 8.2 billion passengers a year - is undergoing a massive modernisation programme to bring it up to date. Much of the shape of the existing network dates from colonial times, which severely restricts train speeds and reliability. In 2013, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was campaigning for office, he promised to create 10 million new jobs in India. In the last hours before the deadline on Saturday, Mr Modi's BJP party tweeted that a further 20,000 jobs would be available as part of the recruitment round."

To mark the centenary, a breakfast reception was held at a building on the Strand, London - formerly Hotel Cecil which was the first headquarters of the RAF - where a printed message from the Queen was read out by aircraftsman Adam Wood. Aged 16 and from Aylesbury, he is one of the youngest members of the RAF. :: The Royal Air Force turns 100: A century of guarding Britain's skies The Queen wrote: ""The anniversary of the world's first independent Air Force is of great significance, and it is fitting to pay tribute to the tenacity, skill and sacrifice of the men and women who have served within its ranks over the last century, and who have defended our freedom gallantly. ""Through its enduring focus on professionalism, excellence and innovation, the Royal Air Force stands as a shining example of inspiration around the world today and for the next generation. ""May the glory and honour that all ranks have bestowed on the Royal Air Force light its pathway to the future guarding our skies and reaching for the stars."" The Queen ended the message with the Latin motto of the RAF, Per Ardua ad Astra, which translates to English as ""through adversity to the stars"". :: 100 years of the RAF: How Britain's air force has changed Air chief marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said that as the RAF enters its second century, the anniversary is a ""chance to reflect back on a first century of achievement, success, courage and sacrifice"". Asked what the message from the Queen means to the RAF, he said it is ""tremendously important"", highlighting how King George V also sent a message when the service was first formed. ""And now to have Her Majesty the Queen sending a message to her Royal Air Force and recognising what we have achieved in the past and also looking forward to the future, it is a tremendously significant moment for us,"" he said. Sunday's celebrations also included a service at St Clement Danes Church, in London, the RAF's Church, attended by veterans, serving RAF personnel and former Countdown presenter and honorary group captain, Carol Vorderman. Other events to mark the milestone included former pilots flying in Spitfires at Biggin Hill Airport. They included 96-year-old former pilot squadron leader Allan Scott, who was taken up as a passenger."

Teasing that he had ""twice as much work to do"", Donnelly introduced actor Stephen Merchant as the show's announcer following a performance by Paloma Faith. Later in the show he quipped he'd have to look conclude the programme himself, saying: ""I'll have to do it myself, like everything else this week."" Just a little photo to prove that we don’t just wing it, there is actually a script! #SaturdayNightTakeaway pic.twitter.com/1pTOJsEUtP Before kicking off a game that required knowledge of current affairs, Donnelly asked the contestant if she had watched the news this week. She said no, to which Donnelly replied: ""For some of us it's been unavoidable."" Early on in the show, Donnelly showed audiences the soon-to-be closed studio he, McPartlin and Cat Deeley presented a children's TV programme in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Before the programme, Saturday Night Takeaway's Twitter account posted a picture of the evening's script that only featured Donnelly's name.

The 42-year-old is due to appear in court on Wednesday over a road traffic collision on 18 March. The crash involved two other cars and resulted in a child in one of the vehicles being taken to hospital as a precaution. The child is believed to be a three-year-old girl. Others involved were treated at the scene for minor injuries. ITV suspended Saturday Night Takeaway for a week as result of the police investigation. McPartlin's publicist said the star would be taking time out from his TV commitments. Donnelly said in a statement that part of the motivation to air the last two episodes was to ""honour"" a promise made to take ""hundreds of deserving winners to Florida"" for the series finale."

As a result, the Government has announced a Children's Funeral Fund which will pay for the costs of children's burials and cremations in England, which can exceed £3,000. This will bring England in line with Wales on the issue. The move will see every local authority waiving burial and cremation fees for children and the Government paying the bill.

The first question asks: ""Why has Russia been denied consular access to the two Russian nationals, Sergei and Yulia Skripal, that have become crime victims in the British territory?"" The embassy also repeatedly queries France's ""involvement"" in the investigation and asks if novichok - the nerve agent the UK says was used in the attack - could have been ""researched, developed or produced in the UK"". Russia, which rejects UK accusations of orchestrating the poisoning, had previously released a list of 27 questions about the case, including queries about the condition of the two victims. The UK Foreign Office said on Saturday it was considering a request from Russia to see Ms Skripal, and that the ""rights and wishes of Yulia"" will be taken into account as well as international laws. Ms Skripal's condition is improving after she spent three weeks in a critical condition. Her father remains critical but stable. Russia has insisted on the right to see the 33-year-old after it emerged she was improving rapidly. An FCO spokeswoman said: ""We are considering requests for consular access in line with our obligations under international and domestic law, including the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal."" The UK has expelled 23 Russian diplomats in the wake of the poisoning of Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter. A number of other countries followed suit, including America, Canada, Australia and more than a dozen EU nations. The first plane carrying Russian diplomats expelled from the US landed in Moscow on Sunday. The full list of questions from Russia to the UK: 1. Why has Russia been denied consular access to the two Russian nationals, Sergei and Yulia Skripal, that have become crime victims in the British territory? 2. What specific antidotes were administered to Mr and Ms Skripal, and in which form? How were those antidotes available for the medical staff on the site of the incident? 3. On what grounds has France been involved in technical cooperation with regard to the investigation of an incident in which Russian nationals had suffered? 4. Has the United Kingdom informed the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) of France's involvement in the investigation? 5. How is France relevant to the incident with two Russian nationals in the UK? 6. What British procedural rules allow a foreign state to be involved in a domestic investigation? 7. What evidence has been passed to France for studying and/or for a French investigation? 8. Were French experts present when biological material was taken from Mr and Ms Skripal? 9. Have French experts studied biological material taken from Mr and Ms Skripal, and at which laboratories? 10. Does the UK possess the results of the French investigation? 11. Have the results of the French investigation been passed to the OPCW Technical Secretariat? 12. On the basis of which characteristics (""markers"") has it been ascertained that the substance used in Salisbury ""originated from Russia""? 13. Does the UK possess reference samples of the military-grade poisonous substance that British representatives identify as ""Novichok""? 14. Has the substance identified by British representatives as ""Novichok"" or analogous substances been researched, developed or produced in the UK?"

The biblical text ended with the lines: ""I have seen the business that God has given to the sons of men to be busy with. ""He has made everything beautiful in its time; also he has put eternity into man's mind."" Professor Hawking's children, Tim, Robert and Lucy, were among those at the service, along with celebrities including model Lily Cole, Queen guitarist Brian May and comedian Dara O Briain, who made a documentary about the physicist. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and playwright Alan Bennett were on the guest list, while Astronomer Royal Martin Rees also spoke during the service. Professor Hawking died peacefully in his sleep earlier this month aged 76. Prior to the funeral, hundreds of people lined the streets around the University Church of St Mary the Great, near to Gonville and Caius College where Prof Hawking was a fellow for 52 years. The watching crowd broke into spontaneous applause as Professor Hawking's coffin, topped with white ""Universe"" lilies and white ""Polar Star"" roses and carried by porters from the University of Cambridge, was taken into the church. The church bell had tolled 76 times, once for each year of the physicist's life, as the hearse arrived outside the church, while the colleges' flags flew at half mast in his honour. The Gonville and Caius College choir sang Beyond The Night Sky, a song the college commissioned as a gift for Professor Hawking for his 75th birthday last year. Its lyrics include quotes from A Brief History of Time, which especially pleased Professor Hawking, who said of the song: ""It takes us all on a mental journey around the universe."" The physicist, born in Oxford in 1942, was 21 years old when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 1963 and given just two years to live. He was forced into a wheelchair by the debilitating disease, and, as his condition worsened, had to resort to speaking through a voice synthesizer and communicating by moving his eyebrows. Undaunted, he went on to study cosmology at Cambridge and became one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Albert Einstein. His 1988 book A Brief History Of Time sold 10m copies and was translated into 35 languages. Prof Hawking's ashes will be interred close to the remains of Sir Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey in June."

He has donated about £1.5m to Labour since 2003 - but Sir David claimed the party he had supported ""no longer exists"". Labour's current leadership had in effect ""supported and endorsed"" acts of anti-Semitism, Sir David told The Observer. ""As one of the former leading political and financial supporters of the Labour Party, of which I was a member for so many decades, I no longer feel any affinity with, or connection to, what it seems to have become,"" he said. ""I have watched with dismay and foreboding the manner in which the leadership has, in my view, over the last two years, conducted itself."" Sir David said the party had ""failed to expel many of those who have engaged in the grossest derogatory fantasies about Jewish/Zionist conspiracies - and Jewish characterisations and accusations which conjure up the very kind of antisemitic attacks that led to such unbearable consequences for innocent millions in the past"". ""So there no longer exists a party which even pretends to maintain and promote the principles and the integrity of what always was, to me, the Labour party,"" he added. ""On the contrary, I have been witnessing, since Mr Corbyn became leader, a philosophical and a political policy which espouses, in nearly every respect, the very antithesis of the great party under whose reputation, and under whose flag, it now seeks to fly and where so many other Jews were once so proud to stand."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said there is a ""need to do better"" within the party, but promised Jewish people he is their ""ally"" in the fight against anti-Semitism. Meanwhile, The Sunday Times reports 12 senior members of staff working for Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell were in social media groups that contained anti-Semitic and violent comments. The newspaper looked into 20 of the biggest pro-Corbyn groups on Facebook, with around 400,000 members, and found attacks on Jewish people, including Holocaust denial. According to its report, more than 2,000 racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist, violent and abusive messages were uncovered by working with whistleblowers who were able to gain access to the restricted membership groups. A Labour source said the sites regularly received hundreds of postings every day, most of which were perfectly innocent messages about party policies or events. The source added that many of the staff concerned were either no longer active on Facebook or were unaware they were members of the groups and had not seen the content highlighted by the paper. ""These groups are not run by the Labour Party or officially connected to the party in any way,"" a party spokesman said. ""The Labour Party is committed to challenging and campaigning against anti-Semitism in all its forms. ""These are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action taken."" It comes after Corbyn ally Christine Shawcroft resigned from her senior post on the party's National Executive Committee, having already quit as chairwoman of Labour's disputes panel after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a candidate accused of Holocaust denial."

2018-04-01,The British microchip developer Imagination Technologies has hired a semiconductor industry veteran as its new chief executive following last year's‎ £550m Chinese-backed takeover.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/british-chipmaker-imagination-hires-veteran-li-as-ceo-11312494,"Sky News has learnt that the company, which was forced to put itself up for sale after losing Apple as a customer, will announce this week that Leo Li is taking the helm. Mr Li, who chairs the Global Semiconductor Alliance, will replace Andrew Heath, who was appointed just two years ago to spearhead a turnaround of the business. The new boss has held senior roles at other major players in the sector, including as CEO of Spreadtrum Communications and co-president of Tsinghua Unigroup. His experience of fast-growing Asian markets is expected to be valuable to Imagination, which is increasing its exposure to China through new licensing deals and design agreements. Based in Hertfordshire, Imagination employs more than 900 people, more than 80% of whom are qualified design engineers. The company, which was bought by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners last autumn, describes itself as one of the world's three most important silicon intellectual property companies. It specialises in making low-power consumption chips which are in increasing demand from the automotive, mobile communications and home electronics industries. According to Imagination, more than 10bn units containing its technology have been produced globally, with the massive demand anticipated from the Internet of Things (IoT) likely to fuel the growth of advanced semiconductor producers. The company ran into difficulty last year, however, when Apple said it would no longer use Imagination's technology in its new products, sending its London-listed shares plummeting. Imagination put itself up for sale, attracting interest from several parties, including Canyon Bridge, ‎which has promised to fund the company's growth into fields such as virtual reality and IoT. Canyon Bridge's takeover came in the wake of the much larger sale of chip designer ARM Holdings to Japan's Softbank. That deal, just days after Theresa May became Prime Minister, sparked renewed debate about foreign takeovers of British technology leaders, and resulted in a series of binding undertakings on jobs and R&D being made by the new o‎wners. ‎The purchase of Imagination did not prompt Government intervention, despite calls from some corners of Westminster and industry for greater protection for the UK's knowledge base. Similar concerns have arisen‎ during the £8bn battle for control of GKN, the engineering group which succumbed to a hostile bid from Melrose Industries on Thursday. Canyon Bridge, which was blocked from making a US purchase similar to ‎Imagination by President Trump's administration, has made several commitments to the British company's presence in its home market. The appointment of Mr Li is the latest chapter in Imagination's history, coming three decades after the company was founded as a producer of PC technology called VideoLogic in 1985. It developed graphics technology for Sega gaming consoles and went on to develop Pure, the digital radio brand which was eventually sold off when Imagination found itself in financial trouble. Mr Heath is expected to attract offers from other major companies in the industry having returned Imagination to profitability before overseeing its sale. A spokesman for Imagination declined to comment on Sunday."
2018-04-01,"The daughter of a British aid worker who was executed by Islamic State has said his alleged killers should be ""left to rot in Guantanamo Bay"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180402010457/https://news.sky.com/story/is-beatles-pair-hit-out-at-losing-uk-citizenship-11310174,"Bethany Haines has been angered by claims from Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh that they will not get a fair trial after being stripped of their UK citizenship. The jihadists, who are accused of being part of a death squad nicknamed ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents, slammed the Government's ""illegal"" decision in an interview on Saturday. Mrs Haines' father David was killed by the IS cell and said Kotey and Elsheikh had shown ""no remorse"". She added: ""As for them saying they have been stripped of rights, well when they held my father for 18 months with his family not knowing whether he was dead or alive, they stripped him of his rights. ""In my opinion they should be given an orange jumpsuit and stripped of all the things they hold dear and left to rot in Guantanamo Bay."" The IS cell also killed American journalist James Foley in 2014. His mother Diane said: ""They deserve to be held in solitary confinement for the rest of their lives and held accountable for the pain they've inflicted."" Kotey and Elsheikh spoke to the Associated Press while being held captive in northern Syria after they were captured in early January in eastern Syria by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The pair used the interview to hit out at the ""audacity"" of the UK Government for its decision to strip them of their British citizenship in February. Although it was widely reported, officials have not confirmed or denied it was the case. ""The Beatles"" IS cell is believed to have captured, tortured and killed hostages, including aid workers and journalists. The group included Mohammed Emwazi - dubbed ""Jihadi John"" - who died in a 2015 drone strike in Raqqa. The pair have not admitted to being involved in any hostage-takings or beheadings and said the allegations against them were media ""propaganda"". However they did speak of their membership of Islamic State. Kotey, from west London, said the killing of western hostages in Syria was ""regrettable"" and could have been avoided, adding that many people within IS would have disagreed with the killings. He said there was ""probably more benefit"" in those captured being used as political prisoners. ""I didn't see the benefit in executing them,"" he said, before blaming Western governments for failing to negotiate and noting that some hostages were released for ransoms. The cell is believed to have kept more than 20 Westerners hostage, and tortured and killed American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers in 2014 and 2015. As well as David Haines and James Foley, their victims included American journalist Steven Sotloff, US humanitarian worker Peter Kassig, and UK aid worker Alan Henning. Elsheikh, from west London, travelled to Syria in 2012, initially to join an al Qaeda branch before moving to IS, according to US State Department documents, which said he ""earned a reputation for waterboarding"". They also claim Kotey served as a guard for the IS cell and was ""likely engaged in the group's executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods"". The men criticised the media over the ""Beatles"" allegations and said the claims were concocted as a pretext to kill them with drone strikes. ""No fair trial, when I am 'the Beatle' in the media. No fair trial,"" Elsheikh said, who added the loss of their citizenship meant they were now open to ""rendition and torture"". He said: ""Being taken to any foreign land and treated in anyway and having nobody to vouch for you. ""When you have these two guys who don't even have any citizenship... if we just disappear one day, where is my mum going to go and say where is my son?"" The capture of Kotey and Elsheikh has since sparked a debate about where they should be tried. The US has called for the home countries of foreign jihadis to take their nationals back for trial. However, the UK Government has signalled the pair should not be allowed back into the country. Haras Rafiq, chief executive of the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think thank, told Sky News: ""The Government is well within its rights to take away their citizenship. ""They both have nationalities from other countries, and as consistent with other crimes that other people have committed, the home secretary has taken away citizenships before without leaving people stateless. ""If you look at what they're actually saying about fair trial, and the fact that they claim Britain has the audacity to take away their citizenship, this stinks to me like a PR stunt."" Associated Press reporter Andrea Rosa, who interviewed the pair, told Sky News: ""It was a bit confrontational I would say at the beginning, they would not speak or even answer our questions at the beginning."" He added: ""Because I felt that they were like afraid of something, of an interrogation, they looked at us more as if we were like interrogators rather than journalists."" Mr Rosa continued: ""But eventually it was all good and I think they were kind of also probably happy to be out of the prison for a while."" When asked if he questioned the pair about the horrific crimes are they accused of, Mr Rosa replied: ""We asked those sorts of questions of course but they would not comment on anything like that. ""They wouldn't comment on anything related to their role or job in Islamic State. ""They didn't deny being part of Islamic State. ""But they labelled most of the allegations as media propaganda."""

Many of the dozens of Labour MPs who attended a Jewish protest rally in Parliament Square a week ago are now facing calls for their deselection from left-wing activists in their constituencies. :: Top donor quits Labour over anti-Semitism row In its highly-significant statement, Momentum said it ""acknowledges the anger, upset and despair within the British Jewish community at the numerous cases of anti-Semitism in the Labour party"". The group also said it was disappointed in the party's ""failure to date to deal with them in a sufficiently decisive, swift and transparent manner"". And equally importantly, the statement went on: ""Accusations of anti-Semitism should not and cannot be dismissed simply as right-wing smears nor as the result of conspiracies. ""Current examples of anti-Semitism within the Labour party are not only a problem of a few, extreme 'bad apples', but also of unconscious bias, which manifests itself in varied, nuanced and subtle ways and is more widespread in the Labour party than many of us had understood even a few months ago."" :: Corbyn tells Jewish community: I'm your ally Momentum also said while Mr Corbyn's opponents were ""opportunistically using this issue as a way to undermine his leadership"", this did not reduce the need to challenge anti-Semitism. During a day of local election campaigning in the West Midlands, Mr Corbyn - likely aware of the helpful Momentum statement - said he would not tolerate any anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. He told Channel 4 News: ""There is genuine concern and we are dealing with that concern... by investigating every case that is brought to our attention. ""If the person has committed an anti-Semitic act, in any way, then they are suspended and usually expelled from the party as a result of that. ""We are not tolerating anti-Semitism in any form in the Labour Party."" Mr Corbyn said the first task of Labour's new general secretary, Jennie Formby, when she takes up her post this week will be to appoint an in-house lawyer to ensure that procedures for dealing with allegations of anti-Semitism are ""absolutely strong and watertight"". Earlier, a Jewish member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, Rhea Wolfson, said she was frustrated at the pace of action on anti-Semitism. And new NEC member Eddie Izzard - who replaced Momentum activist Christine Shawcroft, who quit on Saturday - told The Mirror: ""We must make amends and repair the damage with the Jewish community as Jeremy Corbyn has promised to do."""
2018-04-02,GCHQ intelligence officers Ben and Sunny spoke exclusively to Sky News Defence Correspondent Alistair Bunkall about the threats facing the UK and their efforts to stop them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180403014356/https://news.sky.com/story/islamic-state-has-raised-the-bar-in-its-threat-to-the-uk-gchq-11313568,"AB: What does an analyst do? Ben: An analyst will do anything that is required to try and find an individual target, as long as they operate within the law. On a day-to-day basis, that can involve working with partners, that can involve working with our customers in London, that can involve doing the high-end analysis, to actually try and find our targets and do that work. AB: You talk about partners and customers - it sounds a bit like a supermarket. Who are your partners and who are your customers? Ben: Partners would be some of our US counterparts. For example the NSA is a partner that we obviously work quite closely with. Then there's obviously other UK intelligence agencies - MI6 and MI5. Our customers would be anyone in Whitehall really. :: Inside GCHQ: How to catch a terrorist AB: Islamic State are well known for their capabilities technologically and their use of the internet in order to propagate their message. As an analyst at GCHQ, what sort of challenge has IS presented you that you hadn't already seen from terrorists like al Qaeda, for example? Ben: They are a very advanced adversary in that regard, as you allude to. But there are a number of other technological challenges that we as an organisation face. We always have done - that is the history of GCHQ and our forerunners at Bletchley Park. There's been a huge amount of technological change that we've had to keep abreast of, so yes, Daesh have pushed the bar and raised the bar in terms of some of the technology that they've used and the ways in which they've used it. But the next adversary will do something else that's different and its keeping pace of that which is always the challenge we face. AB: Is most of your work looking at individuals who are in the Middle East and North Africa, or are you also looking at individuals in the UK who connect with others in the Middle East? Ben: My primary role is looking at individuals in the region. There are other people in the organisation who look at others who are potentially coming back to the UK and pose threats to the UK. AB: Do you run the risk of ever making it personal? Do you follow targets, do you investigate targets, and get to know them, their habits, perhaps even their family lives? Sunny: That can happen. It really does depend on the targets but also our level of access. What is it that we are actually following somebody for? What level of detail do we need? We won't try to find out everything about everyone, every single aspect about something, if we've already got what we need. But it can happen. You get to know your targets pretty well. AB: Given your focus on the Middle East and North Africa, what is your role when a terror attack happens in this country that has connections to that part of the world? Ben: The first thing is understanding exactly what the situation is - what has happened and what do we know? So actually getting that ground truth. Fact-finding is the first thing we will always do. From there, it is understanding exactly how that has happened and where have we potentially missed something in particular, or have we missed something in particular? Were we expected to know a particular case had happened in a certain way? From there it's very much a case of piecing back that track and trying to put that breadcrumb trail back together to work out exactly what happened and who in the individual countries in question were involved in that. Does that then give clues about others involved who we could then pick up to potentially stop other things happening at other times? AB: When you hear of a major terrorist attack, what immediately goes through your mind? Ben: Obviously there is a huge amount of thought to those involved. That's always the first thing when something happens: 'Okay this is real, there are individuals who are affected by this.' That re-doubles our efforts to actually keep trying, keep working, let's keep finding these individuals to stop them doing what they're trying to do to harm the UK. More often than not we are working in Cheltenham, and that's something we're trying to track our targets and understand their motives. When an attack happens, or a real world event does happen, that really brings it home, that actually this is the importance of this job, this is why we're doing it. And then when you see the follow on successes of things we have stopped, it brings a huge amount of joy and it really makes working for this organisation worthwhile. Sunny: I think there's a really well understood purpose. Everybody knows what they're in the office to do. Everyone shares the same common goal. I think the biggest feeling in the office is one of wanting to go after the targets and find out who's involved. Is there another threat that we need to know about? And are we pursuing somebody that we need to pick up or question? It's basically one of purpose really. AB: What is your role in the hours and days after an attack? How can you bring value to the role and help keep Britain safe? Sunny: We're always working really closely with MI5 and MI6. The desks will be taking a really good understanding and a good picture of what's happened and the questions that we need to answer. We'll jointly agree what questions need to be answered and then we'll have to determine how do we go about actually answering those. What targets do we need to pursue to be able to answer those questions? And then it's a matter of basically divvying that up, volunteering to say I want to go for that one, and then running the operation from here. Then that close joint working with MI5 and MI6 and always making sure that everything we do is to answer those questions. AB: Is it exhilarating? Sunny: It can be. It can be tiring. But, when you have a team of strong analysts and a lot of the people I work with I'm lucky enough to say they're my friends as well. And when you're working together on a common objective going after targets that everybody knows why we're going after them, it's actually hugely rewarding so even though you're tired your pushing each other. AB: Although Daesh (Islamic State) has lost large swathes of its territory in recent months, they exist as an organisation still, and an ideology. As an analyst for that part of the world how would you assess the current state of IS and any threat they might still pose to this country? Ben: I think for me, the key thing to note, is the focus on Daesh. You can eradicate one threat but there will be another threat around the corner. So for me, as an analyst, it's trying to understand 'OK what has happened and what else is going to come along next that we need to be worried about?' It's only a few years ago our focus was heavily on AQ, we've now moved to Daesh. What is going to be the next threat? What else is going to come along? So we need to be mindful of the wide set of threats that potentially going to harm UK interests. AB: What is going to be the next threat? Ben: Good question. We'll see and we'll be there when it comes."

As a result, the Government has announced a Children's Funeral Fund which will pay for the costs of children's burials and cremations in England, which can exceed £3,000. This will bring England in line with Wales on the issue. The move will see every local authority waiving burial and cremation fees for children and the Government paying the bill. Ms Harris told Sky News it was a ""bittersweet victory but a victory nonetheless"". We've done it!

I'm inside GCHQ, the UK's cyber intelligence agency - more relevant than ever today, with the advance of technology and growing threats. I'm being put through a surveillance operation by a GCHQ analyst, Louise. This has never been shown in public before. The amount of data is overwhelming - phone logs, text messages, emails, internet history. Within that, there is more - who called whom, from where, when, for how long? :: Islamic State has 'raised the bar' in its threat to the UK - GCHQ The evidence is in front of me, somewhere, but the sheer amount of information is dizzying. Most of the data is irrelevant, not useful or even helpful. The trick is to work out which bit is worth pursuing and avoid the red herrings. Spot the patterns, or identify the unusual or unexplained event. ""Usually you would try to identify individual targets. You'd have one person looking at some call data, and someone else looking at internet traffic,"" explains Louise. Phone records would typically cover a two week period so intelligence officers are not being too intrusive and looking at more data than they need to. A warrant to listen to calls or read messages must be signed by a Cabinet minister and a judge. ""We have to weigh up how much we expect to get that is more sensitive in nature,"" Louise says. ""Also whether there is any intelligence value. Once we actually have access to that content, if we find we've accessed something we shouldn't have done then we have to report that."" By listening to calls, reading emails and using partner agencies like MI5 to follow targets on foot, analysts can get to know every little detail about targets' lives. I ask another intelligence officer, Sunny, if they ever get too close. ""That can happen that can happen,"" Sunny replies. ""It really does depend on the targets but also our level of access. What is it that we actually following somebody for? ""What level of detail do we need? We won't try to find out everything about everyone, every single aspect about something, if we've already got what we need. ""But it can happen. You get to know your targets pretty well.""

""Everybody knows what they're in the office to do. Everyone shares the same common goal. I think the biggest feeling in the office is one of wanting to go after the targets and find out who's involved. ""Is there another threat that we need to know about? And are we pursuing somebody that we need to pick up or question? It's basically one of purpose really."" The threat facing the UK has changed - in the early 2000s it came from al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen - recently it has been Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. A third officer I speak to, Ben, specialises in the Middle East and North Africa. Terrorist attacks against the UK in recent years have had links to that region. ""When an attack does happen, that really brings it home that this is the importance of the job, and this is why we do it,"" Ben says. ""The first thing is understanding exactly what the situation is - so what has happened and what do we know, so actually getting that ground truth.

2018-04-02,"Teachers are warning of a child poverty crisis, with an increasing number of pupils coming to school without clean clothes and showing signs of malnourishment.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180403014356/https://news.sky.com/story/malnourished-pupils-taking-school-food-home-11313620,"Presenting the results of a survey of National Education Union (NEU) members, one primary school head from Cumbria described how some of her pupils had grey skin and poor hair and nails, and would even fill their pockets with food from school meals. ""They're not sure if they're going to get another meal that day… In some establishments I would imagine that would be called stealing, but in ours it's called survival,"" she said. Of the 900 teachers and education professionals who responded to the survey, carried out in conjunction with the Child Poverty Action Group, 87% believed child poverty was having a significant impact on pupils' learning, with 60% saying the situation has worsened since 2015. The testimonies of head teachers speaking at the NEU conference in Brighton included descriptions of children wearing uniforms at weekends due to not having alternative clothes, staff having to club together to buy a child a bed, and schools having to provide food banks and washing machines on site. Howard Payne, from a primary school in Portsmouth, said he had decided to keep his school open during the recent snow period to ensure children did not miss their one hot meal of the day. Jane Jenkins, from a Cardiff primary school, said ensuring children were fed was now as much of a priority as exam pass rates. ""It is really tough. When people are asking you about standards and 'why is your school not higher in the league tables', often that is very much a secondary consideration for us these days,"" she said. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: ""The level of child poverty teachers and school staff are witnessing on a daily basis is having a dreadful effect on the life chances and education of far too many children and young people. ""Support services for families who are struggling are being vastly reduced or cut to the bone. We can and must do better as a society. Our Government cannot continue to preside over such inequality and misery."" Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""Teachers see the heartbreaking reality of rising child poverty every day in their classrooms and dinner halls. ""We must listen to what they are telling us. With nine children in every classroom of 30 now falling below the official poverty line, it is time to ensure all families have enough to live on, and to rebuild the safety net for struggling parents. A vital first step is to lift the freeze on children's benefits so that they keep up with the rising cost of living."" Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said it was a ""terrible state of affairs"". ""We have a growing poverty crisis in our schools with destitution amongst so many pupils,"" she tweeted, adding: ""Tories are failing our children, this cannot continue."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We continue to support the country's most disadvantaged children through free school meals, the £2.5bn funding given to schools through the Pupil Premium to support their education and the recently announced £26m investment to kick-start or improve breakfast clubs in at least 1,700 schools."""

It added: ""Reputation matters. After declining Russia access to Russian nationals in UK, why should @foreignoffice expect other countries to satisfy similar British requests?"" As tit-for-tat expulsions continue, the first Russian diplomats to be kicked out of the US arrived back in Moscow on Sunday. America has expelled 60 Russians, joining many European countries who also asked diplomats to leave in solidarity with the UK. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the Kremlin had unleashed a ""tidal wave of smears, lies and mockery"" since the poisonings. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he called the attack ""illegal and contemptuous"" and said President Putin was using ""hybrid capabilities to subvert, undermine, and influence countries around the world"". Russia continues to strongly deny any involvement and has responded to the West by throwing out an equal number of diplomats. It has also published 14 questions about the investigation into the poisonings. They include asking ""what specific antidotes"" the Skripals had been given and if novichok had ever been ""researched, developed or produced in the UK"". International chemical weapons experts are studying samples from Salisbury to see if they agree with the UK view that Russia was to blame. Russia also tweeted on Sunday about murdered businessman Nikolai Glushkov, who was found dead in his London home last month. The embassy's tweet, which featured the 20mph speed limit sign, again protested over a lack of access to the case. It said: ""20 days passed since the murder of Nikolay Glushkov in London. UK hasn’t complied with its obligation under the consular convention to provide access to the course of investigation."" A post-mortem examination said the 68-year-old had died from ""compression to the neck"". Counter-terror officers are leading the investigation but have said there is nothing to suggest a link with the Salisbury case. Mr Glushkov, a retired financial director for Russian airline Aeroflot, was wanted over fraud allegations in his homeland. He was also a close friend of Vladimir Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, who died in 2013."

2018-04-02,Britain's youngest military wing was formed 100 years ago today. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180403014356/https://news.sky.com/story/100-years-of-the-raf-how-britains-air-force-has-changed-11308647,"The Royal Air Force was formed after the First World War, authorised by King George V, to recognise the growing role of air power in warfare. It merged the aviation branches of the Army and the Navy. It was the world's first independent air force. Sophy Gardner is researching the politics of British air power for a PhD which is a collaboration between the University of Exeter and the RAF Museum. She served for 20 years in the RAF, leaving as a Wing Commander in 2011. She was deployed on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also spent a tour on aircraft carriers with the Royal Navy. The RAF was created on 1 April 1918, 100 years ago this weekend. Constructed in wartime from two branches of the older services, it faced an uncertain future after the November Armistice. A decade of arguments over its existence and purpose followed. Yet, in many ways, these attacks made the young air force stronger, forcing it to make its case and building a stronger sense of collective identity within the light blue service. The Women's Royal Air Force was also created on that same day. However, it survived only two years before being disbanded as part of post-war demobilisation in 1920. Women have stepped into the breech in both world wars, making a vital contribution, and today the RAF is the first of the British armed services to open every one of its roles to women. :: RAF turns 100: A century of guarding Britain's skies When women were allowed to apply to be pilots in the early 1990s, the RAF wasn't entirely ready for women aircrew - flying clothing wasn't specially designed for women and squadrons sometimes lacked facilities for women. That has, of course, changed now, although there can still be less awareness among girls and young women about the opportunities available to them in the RAF. In its early days, the priority was creating the foundations of the modern force and that started with training. The Royal Naval Air Station at Cranwell became RAF Cranwell, the focus of early RAF officer and flying training. RAF Halton became the home of technical training for ""boy"" apprentices. The apprenticeships, and the cadetships which were offered to the best apprentices to progress to officer training at Cranwell, were one of the first examples of a widespread effort to promote social mobility in the armed forces. Today, more and more of the RAF's entrants join with excellent qualifications, often educated to degree level. Of course, the technology has changed. Early aircraft had open cockpits and limited communications with the ground. By the end of the Second World War, the first jet engines had been developed and aircraft could carry large loads over long distances. By the early 2000s the first unmanned aircraft were being flown by RAF aircrew. One constant throughout the RAF's first 100 years has been that the people who support and operate the technology are its most important component, even if the work they do has changed with technology. In the early days carpenters were required to work on wooden aircraft - now the RAF offers apprenticeships for Cyberspace Communication Specialists. However, the spirit of the RAF remains the same and much of the early culture - language, nicknames, wing and squadron organisation - is still recognisable in the RAF of today. While the RAF is accused of being too young to have traditions (the joke is that it has habits instead), it is that spirit and a fascination with the air and flying that still unites the airwomen and men of the modern Royal Air Force and links them to their pioneering ancestors."

The British heavyweight said after the fight that he would like negotiations for a bout with WBC champion Wilder to take place in private, adding he was ""not into the business of hype"". A match-up between Joshua and Wilder has been anticipated for some time, with the US fighter claiming he had ""declared war"" on Joshua earlier this year. Barry Hearn, chairman and founder of Joshua's promoters Matchroom, has revealed that negotiations to make the fight happen will start as soon as possible. ""It is a fight Anthony Joshua really wants and I think he wants it this year,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. Joshua has said he would like the bout to take place in the United Kingdom but Hearn is not ruling out the possibility of it happening in the United States if the terms are right.Matchroom view Joshua as a much bigger drawing card in the UK than Wilder is in the US. What a robbery... WOW‼️ @joeboxerparker great job Bro omg don’t apologize you did nothing wrong. True champion. @anthonyfjoshua, I ACCEPTED 100% P.S. Take AFRICA off your Arm. They’re warriors. You from UK brotha pic.twitter.com/09yv1bCqrq Hearn said: ""Anthony Joshua wants all the belts - that is the big card Deontay Wilder has got to play (but) commercially, Joshua is far bigger than Deontay Wilder.""I think Wilder would come over here because in the world we live in, in boxing, the couple of million dollars Wilder is getting for a fight is pretty small fry in comparison to the rewards that await him for a Joshua fight. ""Travelling is not usually a problem if the money is right.""But I still think in the long term, if Anthony sits down and thinks it through, he may come to the decision that to be a truly global sportstar he needs to go to America - not just for the money - but, in terms of the brand value of AJ, fighting in America is going to be on his horizon.""I wouldn't rule out AJ fighting in America despite his comments last night."" Don’t be with that bulls*** @eddiehearn pick up the phone Maine...#BombZquad pic.twitter.com/Rr4aewgKo4 Joshua was forced to go the distance for the first time on Saturday night, but was unanimously declared the winner as two judges scored him 118-110, while the other had him at 119-109. After his win, the heavyweight champion told Sky Sports: ""My strategy was to stick behind the jab. ""I was switched on and I was focused, Joseph Parker is a world champion I said this was about boxing finesse. ""What you can't forget is that I am the unified heavyweight champion of the world."" Both fighters had stepped into the ring at Cardiff's Principality Stadium undefeated and the win extends Joshua's perfect pro record to 21 victories from as many bouts. Joshua had won his previous 20 fights all by knockout but struggled to land clean shots on Parker. After the fight, American heavyweight Wilder tweeted that Joshua's victory had been a ""robbery"", and posted a video the following morning in which he claimed promoter Eddie Hearn was ignoring a phone call from him."

Police said they believe the car was stopped by the side of the road before accelerating to as fast as 90mph over the cliff. Greg Baarts, Acting Assistant Chief of the California Highway Patrol northern division, said data from the SUV coupled with a lack of skid marks on the road showed the event was not an accident. He said it was ""pure acceleration all the way"". The 100ft (31 metre) drop killed parents Jennifer Jean Hart and Sarah Margaret Hart, both 38, and their children Markis Hart, 19; Jeremiah Hart, 14, and Abigail Hart, 14. Three other siblings: Hannah Hart, 16, Devonte Hart, 15, and Sierra Hart, 12, have not been found. The family gained attention after Devonte Hart was photographed during a 2014 protest in Portland, Oregon, following a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the shooting of a black man in Ferguson, Missouri. Devonte, holding a ""Free Hugs"" sign, stood crying. A Portland officer saw his sign and asked if he could have a hug, and the emotional teenager embraced him in a picture that was widely shared. Officials searched the family home and did not find a suicide note. The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services has said it was investigating the family for potential child neglect or abuse. It is not clear when the accident happened, but the wreckage was discovered by a passing motorist on 26 March, three days after the state opened the investigation. The state department said neighbours complained the children were being deprived of food."

But their governments did not have time to arrange details before the US expelled 60 Russian diplomats following the Salisbury poisoning, they revealed. Moscow's ambassador to the US Yuri Ushakov made the claims on Monday, adding he hoped for a ""serious and constructive dialogue"" between the two countries. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Mr Trump invited Mr Putin to Washington during the call. But she stressed the White House was among ""a number of potential venues"" discussed as a location for the bilat. She cited an announcement hours after the phone call on 20 March, that said the two leaders had discussed meeting in person. Ms Huckabee Sanders told reporters: ""As the President himself confirmed on March 20, hours after his last call with President Putin, the two had discussed a bilateral meeting in the 'not-too-distant future' at a number of potential venues, including the White House."" Some politicians from Mr Trump's Republican party had criticised him for making the congratulatory call to Mr Putin. Senator John McCain said at the time: ""An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections. ""And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election."" While Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said that calling Mr Putin ""wouldn't have been high on my list"". Mr Trump defended his decision on Twitter, saying President Barack Obama did the same in 2012. He wrote on Twitter: ""The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing."" During the call, Mr Trump did not raise Russia's suspected involvement in the poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain, which happened two weeks earlier. The UK has blamed Russia for the attack, claims that Moscow denies."

She is suing the hospital after being punched ""several"" times in the head, with the lawsuit saying the hospital failed to take appropriate measures to monitor the man who is believed to have mental health issues. Her lawyer said the man, named as John Deliz, 57, admitted in a Detroit court he had escaped from a ""group home"" - for those with complex health needs - and had not been taking his medication for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. ""Instead of giving him mental treatment, they put him back in the patient pool, thereby giving way to his attack,"" Majed Moughni said. ""No person should ever have to enter into a hospital emergency room with one injury and exit with two."" It was a racially motivated attack, the lawsuit claims. The Detroit News said the victim is seeking nearly $25,000 (£17,799) in damages. Deliz has been remanded in custody until his next court appearance in May."

To mark the centenary, a breakfast reception was held at a building on the Strand, London - formerly Hotel Cecil which was the first headquarters of the RAF - where a printed message from the Queen was read out by aircraftsman Adam Wood. Aged 16 and from Aylesbury, he is one of the youngest members of the RAF. :: The Royal Air Force turns 100: A century of guarding Britain's skies The Queen wrote: ""The anniversary of the world's first independent Air Force is of great significance, and it is fitting to pay tribute to the tenacity, skill and sacrifice of the men and women who have served within its ranks over the last century, and who have defended our freedom gallantly. ""Through its enduring focus on professionalism, excellence and innovation, the Royal Air Force stands as a shining example of inspiration around the world today and for the next generation. ""May the glory and honour that all ranks have bestowed on the Royal Air Force light its pathway to the future guarding our skies and reaching for the stars."" The Queen ended the message with the Latin motto of the RAF, Per Ardua ad Astra, which translates to English as ""through adversity to the stars"". :: 100 years of the RAF: How Britain's air force has changed Air chief marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said that as the RAF enters its second century, the anniversary is a ""chance to reflect back on a first century of achievement, success, courage and sacrifice"". Asked what the message from the Queen means to the RAF, he said it is ""tremendously important"", highlighting how King George V also sent a message when the service was first formed. ""And now to have Her Majesty the Queen sending a message to her Royal Air Force and recognising what we have achieved in the past and also looking forward to the future, it is a tremendously significant moment for us,"" he said. Sunday's celebrations also included a service at St Clement Danes Church, in London, the RAF's Church, attended by veterans, serving RAF personnel and former Countdown presenter and honorary group captain, Carol Vorderman. Other events to mark the milestone included former pilots flying in Spitfires at Biggin Hill Airport. They included 96-year-old former pilot squadron leader Allan Scott, who was taken up as a passenger."

They said the former wife of the late Nelson Mandela had been ""in and out of hospital since the start of the year"". In a statement, her family said: ""Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was one of the greatest icons of the struggle against apartheid. She fought valiantly against the apartheid state and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country. ""Her activism and resistance to apartheid landed her in jail on numerous occasions‚ eventually causing her banishment to the small town of Brandfort in the then Orange Free State. :: Nelson Mandela's love affair with Winnie ""She kept the memory of her imprisoned husband Nelson Mandela alive during his years on Robben Island and helped give the Struggle for justice in South Africa one its most recognisable faces.

Although she suffered with bad health this year, she still attended her church's Good Friday service, and campaigned with ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa during a voter registration drive last month. Tributes have been paid across the world following Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's death, while South African politicians have been arriving at her Soweto home to pay their respects. Retired South African archbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu led the tributes, saying said she was ""a defining symbol of the struggle against apartheid"". ""She refused to be bowed by the imprisonment of her husband, the perpetual harassment of her family by security forces, detentions, bannings and banishment,"" he said. ""Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists.""

Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was married to Nelson Mandela for nearly four decades until 1996. He spent much of their marriage in prison, and she campaigned tirelessly for his release, eventually securing on 11 February 1990. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was convicted in 1991 of killing an activist named Stompie Seipei who was found near her home with his throat cut. She was sentenced to six years in prison, but it was reduced on appeal. The couple separated in 1992, and he sacked her from his cabinet three years later after allegations of corruption. She took her new surname, Madikizela-Mandela, after their divorce. She built her own role as a grassroots activist, completing university at a time when very few black women in South Africa did so, and was politicised by her work as a social worker in a Johannesburg hospital. Despite controversy and convictions, she was able to rehabilitate her political career, winning a seat in the 2009 elections. She once accused her former husband of agreeing to a ""bad deal for the blacks"" but was a regular visitor to his bedside and even with him when he died. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and Mr Mandela had two daughters. British actor Idris Elba tweeted: ""Rest in peace Mama Winnie. My heart is heavy right now. You lived a full and important life contributing to the liberation of a nation by force and ACTUAL ACTIVISM. You will never be forgotten."" Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr, an American civil rights figure, tweeted: ""In the darkest hours of the struggle to free South Africa, with Nelson Mandela in prison, the face of hope and courage was Winnie Mandela. May she forever rest in power."" British singer Estelle tweeted: ""She lived for everyone, fought for lives and empowered along the way. RIP to a revolutionary, Winnie Mandela!"""

Paramedics battled to save the teenager but she was pronounced dead at the scene in Chalgrove Road at 10.43pm. In another incident, a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot injuries in Walthamstow, east London. Police and London Ambulance Service were called to reports of gun fire in Markhouse Road at around 10pm. The boy was taken to an east London hospital where he remains in a critical condition, police said. A second boy, believed to be 17 years old, is also being treated for stab injuries but his condition is unknown. Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy said on Twitter there had been a ""serious incident involving (a) shooting and stabbing"", adding it was ""very distressing"". Walthamstow - can confirm tonight we have had another serious incident involving shooting and stabbing. Appreciate this is very distressing- I will share more information as and when have it from official sources as only want to share what is confirmed. No arrests have been in connection with either incident. It follows a spike in violence in London in recent weeks which saw more murders committed in the capital in February and March than there were in New York. Before Monday's violence, the Metropolitan Police had investigated 46 murders in London in 2018. The force said there were eight murder inquiries launched in January, 15 in February, 22 in March and another on 1 April. This compared to 11 killings in New York in February and 21 in March, according to figures released by the New York Police Department. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick recently blamed social media for the soaring rate of knife crime in the UK, saying trivial disputes could escalate into violence ""within minutes"" when rivals set out to goad each other on the internet."
2018-04-02,"More than a third of teachers know schoolchildren who have been sexually harassed by other pupils, a survey has revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180403014356/https://news.sky.com/story/schoolchildren-are-being-sexually-harassed-by-other-pupils-teachers-warn-11313543,"The poll of more than 1,300 teachers found 39% were aware of children who had been victims, while 86% said they had dealt with pupils sharing sexual messages or images with each other. Cases included boys forcing girls to share inappropriate photographs of themselves and students having their faces photo-shopped on to pornographic images, the NASUWT teachers' union warned. The findings come after figures revealed earlier this year that children as young as 10 have fallen victim to ""upskirting"" - the act of taking photographs under dresses without consent. Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse has tabled a parliamentary bill that would make it a criminal offence to take a photo up a person's skirt without their permission. Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, said teachers had never before had to deal with ""such a complex range of pupil welfare issues as they do today"". ""The pressure on teachers and headteachers is enormous and is putting at risk their own mental and physical health and wellbeing,"" he said. ""These challenges are compounded by cuts to school staffing and to external specialist support. ""The Government must bear responsibility for the position in which schools find themselves. It is a betrayal of staff and pupils to continue to expect schools alone to deal with all of these issues."" The NASUWT poll also found infant schoolchildren were showing signs of mental health issues such as anxiety, panic attacks and depression. Around one in seven teachers (14%) who knew students facing suspected mental health issues said the pupils were aged between four and seven. More than a quarter (27%) said they were aged seven to 11. In one case, a teacher described an eight-year-old pupil who climbed on the roof and said they wanted to kill themselves A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Harassment or bullying of any kind is completely unacceptable and abhorrent in any setting, especially schools. ""All schools should be safe places for pupils to learn and teachers to teach. ""To support schools, we have recently published new advice, specifically on child on child sexual violence and sexual harassment, and are making Relationships Education compulsory in all primary schools and Relationships and Sex education compulsory in all secondary schools."""

In a news conference on Monday, Mr Lavrov accused western countries of ""playing children's games"" and hinted of the possibility of Britain being behind Mr Skripal's poisoning. ""There are other explanations besides those put forward by our Western colleagues who declare that it can only be the Russians who are responsible,"" he said. ""Experts say that it could be highly advantageous to the British security services as well, who are well known for their capacity to act with a licence to kill. ""It could also be advantageous to the British government, who clearly find themselves in a difficult situation, having failed to fulfil their promises to voters over Brexit. ""In times of cold war there were some rules, but now Britain and the United States had dropped all propriety."" Former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are still in hospital after being poisoned by deadly nerve agent novichok on 4 March. Russia has said it ""insists"" on seeing Ms Skripal after her condition dramatically improved. She is now understood to be conscious and talking. The UK government - which claims the Russian state is behind the attempted murders - is looking into the legality of the request and also considering ""the rights and wishes"" of the 33-year-old. Mr Skripal remains seriously ill and unresponsive. Earlier on Monday, the Russian embassy accused Britain of flouting diplomatic convention by blocking access to the poisoned spy and barring it from the investigation into a murdered Russian businessman. Hitting out at the Government, Russia's UK embassy tweeted a picture from zombie film 28 Days Later, complete with its biohazard logo. 28 days passed since the poisoning of Sergei & Yulia Skripal.

UK hasn't complied with its obligation under the consular convention to provide access to the Russian citizens and the course of investigation."" As tit-for-tat expulsions continue, the first Russian diplomats to be kicked out of the US arrived back in Moscow on Sunday. America has expelled 60 Russians, joining many European countries which also asked diplomats to leave in solidarity with the UK. Russia continues to strongly deny any involvement and has responded to the West by throwing out an equal number of diplomats. It has also published 14 questions about the investigation into the poisonings."

The service is being started at the behest of volunteer rescue team, the Cave Rescue Organisation, which is frequently forced to come to the aid of walkers suffering after climbing the three peaks, Pen-y-ghent, Whernside and Ingleborough. The group, which helps those in difficulties both below and above ground in the western Yorkshire Dales, picked Sulber, one of its problem spots where two major rights of way cross each other, as the place to pick up anyone needing help.

It was four weeks ago today that the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were rushed to hospital after being exposed to the deadly nerve agent, novichok. That in itself was a rare occurrence, but the fact it happened in the sleepy city of Salisbury made the incident all the more frightening and mysterious. The Hollywood-style storyline has rocked the area. For the shops surrounding the police cordon, business is down 90%. A handful remain closed. Some locals will tell you that life goes on and there is nothing to fear, but for many it is simply not that easy. David Mayfield is a butcher with a pop up stall in The Maltings shopping centre, where the incident happened. He insists things are at breaking point. Mr Mayfield told Sky News: ""You're looking without exaggeration at a 60-70% loss minimum...The regulars can't even find us because they think Sainsbury's is closed. ""It's a farce it really is."" The council has now introduced free parking, which many admit has helped bring shoppers into the centre. ""Shops open"" signs are plastered all across the city. However, many are still anxious and too concerned to venture into town, despite Public Health England's warning that there is only a very low risk to the public. At the local market, stall holders insist things will only get back to normal once the media leave. There is certainly a sense that the international film and television crews have outstayed their welcome. But this is a news story that has captured the world's attention. The various twists and turns have barely been out of the headlines in the last month. One stall holder tells me that the tourist buses pass through Salisbury now. They don't stop. They head straight to Winchester. People don't want to get off. Outside the city's iconic cathedral, tourist Chris Justice, who's originally from the US, admits he had second thoughts about visiting. He told Sky News: ""Nerve agent and people don't mix very well, I guess, and so we were just thoughtful about whether we should be here or not."" On the outskirts of Salisbury, Easter weekend continues as normal. There are organised egg hunts, church services and a local point to point on Salisbury Plain. But you get a sense that some are genuinely worried about the impact the incident has had. Natalie Stevens, who has a two-year-old daughter, admits she doesn't feel safe venturing into town. She told Sky News: ""I am a bit uncomfortable about taking my daughter there because we don't know what the long term effects are. ""I don't want to go into Salisbury unless I actually have to. ""They keep saying there are no long term effects, but you can't help but worry when your kids are involved."" For all those with concerns, there are others who insist there is absolutely nothing to fear, but all seem to agree that Salisbury has suffered as a result of what happened. The city has always been best known for its cathedral and the ancient monument of Stonehenge. But around the world the name Salisbury is now associated with a chemical weapons attack and a diplomatic tit-for-tat. It is now known as the home of the former spy, Sergei Skripal. It will take time for the city to heal, for things to get back to normal. But Salisbury has already come a long way, when you consider how desolate the streets were just four weekends ago."

Papers are being prepared for his extradition back to the UK, the force said. A £10,000 reward was made available for information leading to his detention. John Pordage, 34, died after being shot in the chest outside a petrol station in Chelmsford in the early hours of 5 August.

""That is what the outside can do, and we are grateful for people's care."" He says she has been suffering panic attacks in her sleep in recent weeks. Speaking to Sky News at a rally to support his wife, he said: ""We want to find out what the Government thinks her rights are. She is being held because of something the Government hasn't done. ""It is important to establish what obligations it thinks it has."" The Free Nazanin campaign says it is a question of whether Boris Johnson has ""given up"" on his promise to bring her home. Mr Ratcliffe hopes to meet with Mr Johnson soon. He claims she is being held because of a debt that has not been paid. The campaign's supporters held an event in north London to mark the second anniversary and asked people to leave jokes for Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe to draw strength from and to remind her there is colour in the world. Tulip Siddiq, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, said: ""In November the Foreign Secretary promised to 'leave no stone unturned'. But since his trip to Tehran, he has been missing in action. ""Nazanin does not have the luxury of time, and Boris Johnson must act before her situation gets worse. ""If he can't deliver on this, then it is time that the Prime Minister stepped in."" In response to Mr Ratcliffe a spokesperson for the FCO said: ""On the second anniversary of Nazanin's arrest we continue to approach her case, and all of our British-Iranian consular cases, in a way that we judge is most likely to secure the outcome we all want. ""Therefore we will not be providing a running commentary on every twist and turn."""

2018-04-02,Alison Saunders - the head of the Crown Prosecution Service - is to stand down after five years in the role.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180403014356/https://news.sky.com/story/chief-prosecutor-alison-saunders-to-stand-down-11313603,"Her tenure as director of public prosecutions (DPP) has been marred by a series of controversies, most recently over the collapse of several rape trials due to evidence not being disclosed. The disclosure failings led to a review of every rape case in the country. The Government has sought to play down reports that it refused to renew Ms Saunders' contract. A qualified barrister, Ms Saunders was previously the chief crown prosecutor for CPS London. In a statement, Attorney General Jeremy Wright said: ""I want to thank Alison personally for her service, not only as DPP but as an accomplished CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) prosecutor whose successful record includes the prosecution of Stephen Lawrence's killers. ""I have no doubt that she'll be greatly missed within the organisation."" A spokesman for Mr Wright told the Daily Telegraph that Ms Saunders had been ""appointed for a five-year term which ends in October 2018"" and she ""did not ask for an extension to her contract"". The press notification announcing her departure also pointed out that just one of her predecessors had remained in post for longer than five years. Ms Saunders will leave the CPS in October, and will be joining the multinational law firm Linklaters. Calling it a ""tremendous privilege"" to have been the first DPP to be appointed from within the CPS, Ms Saunders said her priority over the next six months was ""to keep driving improvements in how we work, with a sharp focus on casework quality"". She added: ""Key to that will be working alongside the police and other partners to find long-term solutions to the disclosure issues that exist throughout the entire criminal justice system."" Following the announcement, Ms Saunders told Radio 4: ""It was my decision to leave"". Responding to suggestions that she was leaving her post because the Government had refused to renew her contract, she went on: ""DPPs serve a term of five years. I was clear that five years was a good term to serve and I have already decided what I will be doing when I leave in October."""
2018-04-03,"The UK will introduce one of the world's toughest bans on ivory sales in a bid to protect elephants for future generations, the Environment Secretary has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180404022653/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-introduce-tough-ban-on-ivory-sales-to-protect-elephants-11314833,"Michael Gove confirmed robust measures will be brought into force covering ivory items of all ages, with limited exemptions, to tackle the ""abhorrent"" trade. It comes after a public consultation on the issue, in which 88% of the 70,000 responses backed a ban. Those found guilty of breaching the ban face a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or up to five years in jail. Exemptions will include items made before 1947 that are less than 10% ivory and musical instruments with an ivory content of less than 20% made prior to 1975. Rare and important items, which are at least 100 years old, will be assessed by specialist institutions before exemption permits are issued, the Government said. Mr Gove said: ""Ivory should never be seen as a commodity for financial gain or a status symbol, so we will introduce one of the world's toughest bans on ivory sales to protect elephants for future generations. ""The ban on ivory sales we will bring into law will reaffirm the UK's global leadership on this critical issue, demonstrating our belief that the abhorrent ivory trade should become a thing of the past."" Wildlife campaigners believe around 20,000 elephants a year are being slaughtered for their ivory, and that reducing global demand for their tusks is an important part of ending the carnage. The Duke of Cambridge, who is patron of the conservation charity Tusk, has previously called for an end to the ivory trade, saying the material is a ""symbol of destruction, not of luxury"". Tusk's chief executive Charlie Mayhew welcomed the ""tough legislation"" and said the ""narrowly defined exemptions are pragmatic"". ""The ban will ensure there is no value for modern day ivory and the tusks of recently poached elephants cannot enter the UK market,"" he said. WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said the ban makes the UK a ""global leader in tackling this bloody trade"" and called for ""global action"" to stop the poaching of the ""majestic"" elephant. Currently, the US federal ban exempts all items older than 100 years as well as items with up to 50% ivory content. The Chinese ban exempts ivory ""relics"", without setting a date before which these must have been produced. The UK Government said the ban will build on existing work to tackle poaching and the illegal ivory trade. This includes British military personnel training African park rangers in poacher interception techniques in key African countries, and Border Force officers sharing their expertise in identifying smuggled ivory with worldwide counterparts."

Another child who also attended Little Learners nursery and preschool in Galgate was taken to hospital with symptoms but has been discharged. All children and staff at the preschool, which caters for children from birth up to four, have been offered antibiotics as a precaution and the child who was in hospital is recovering, Public Health England (PHE) said. Hector's mother Charlotte and father Lee described their son as a ""gorgeous, cheeky, happy boy"". Meningitis B is caused by a meningococcal infection which is uncommon but can be fatal or cause life-changing disabilities. It most commonly affects children under the age of one, and can also cause septicaemia. PHE has sent its ""deepest sympathies"" to the family of the child who has died. Hector's parents released a statement warning others of the symptoms. They said: ""Hector was perfect in every way, our absolute world, our sunshine, our very best friend. ""Hector became very poorly very fast from contracting meningococcal septicaemia, Hector's symptoms of sickness and a temperature only presented 12 hours before we sadly lost the love of our lives. ""We urge all parents to be vigilant and any signs or symptoms that point towards meningitis being a possibility please please seek urgent medical advice, don't delay."" Grainne Nixon, health protection nurse consultant for PHE North West, said: ""We understand that there will be concern among parents and staff at the nursery, and we'd like to assure parents that the risk of another case arising in the nursery is very low. ""Meningococcal disease does not spread very easily. ""As a precaution, all children and staff at the nursery have been offered antibiotics to reduce the chance of them carrying the bacteria which causes the disease."" She added that the disease is uncommon but parents should be aware of the symptoms which include a fever, headache, rapid breathing, drowsiness, shivering, vomiting and cold feed and hands. It can also cause a rash which does not fade when a glass is pressed against the skin. Anybody who is concerned about these symptoms should seek medical advice immediately or call NHS 111, Ms Nixon urged. In 2015, the UK was the first country in the world to introduce the MenB vaccine - called Bexsero - into the routine NHS childhood immunisation programme. Babies are given three injections until they are a year old, which is expected to protect children until they are about four years old. The disease is rare in children over the age of four. In the past 20 years between 500 and 1,700 people every year - mainly babies and young children - have suffered from meningitis B. Around one in 10 die from the infection and many who survive suffer from disabilities such as amputation, brain damage and epilepsy, NHS data shows."

His stinging assessment has led to ridicule on social media, with people pointing out that the chicken in a rendang curry should never be crispy. Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak tweeted a picture of the curry along with the words: ""Does anyone eat chicken rendang 'crispy'? #MalaysianFood”. The dish is popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and southern Thailand. A wave of rebuttals from people in Southeast Asia has put the MasterChef judges firmly in their place.

They were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Counter Terrorism Policing North East reassured local residents any loud bangs they may have heard on Tuesday morning were officers securing entry to the properties. The force described the arrests as ""pre-planned and part of a proactive, intelligence-led investigation"". However the men, both from Dewsbury, were not detained in connection with an ongoing investigation into malicious communications. Last month, the force announced a ""full and thorough investigation"" into UK-wide reports of letters seeking ""to cause fear and offence among our Muslim communities"". Some letters were reported to be promoting a ""Punish A Muslim Day"" on 3 April, with the letter offering rewards on attacks on Muslims ranging from ""10 points for verbal abuse, 50 points for throwing acid and 1,000 points for bombing a mosque to 2,500 points for nuking Mecca"". Labour MPs were among the recipients of such letters. On Tuesday's searches in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire Police superintendent Marianne Huison said: ""I understand our local communities will have concerns about this morning's police activity but I want to offer my reassurance that we will continue to serve and protect the public of West Yorkshire. ""We work very closely with our colleagues in CT Policing North East and with local partners and we will ensure we maintain these strong links in order to provide a high level of service and delivery to everyone in our community. ""Public safety is our utmost concern."" Anyone with concerns is asked to contact their local neighbourhood policing team on 101."

But the ""strong performance"" was upset by ""extremely poor weather in February and March"" which led to airport closures and flight cancellations across the UK and near continent, the airline said. ""This particularly affected Flybe as all our flying is within this area,"" it added. Flybe had to cancel 994 flights due to bad weather during its fourth quarter, well up from the 372 in the same quarter last year. ""As a result, we anticipate this to have an impact of around £4m from lost revenue and additional care and assistance costs on cancelled and delayed flights,"" it said. ""Coming so late in the financial year means that this added loss will be reflected in our full-year financial results."" Commenting on the airline's future plans, Flybe chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener added: ""The drive to reduce costs is continuing, given added impetus by the rise in fuel prices and lower value of sterling. ""Despite these headwinds, the foundations are being put in place to strengthen the business and we remain confident that our strategy will continue to improve performance as we go into the new financial year."" Flybe announced last June that it had racked up almost £20m in losses in the previous year after embarking on ambitious expansion plans. In October, the airline said it had incurred higher than expected costs in the first half of its financial year after a review of aircraft maintenance."

We all go thru the sludge/s*** and depression never discriminates. ""Took me a long time to realise it but the key is to not be afraid to open up. Especially us dudes have a tendency to keep it in. You're not alone."" In the interview, Johnson told the story of how his mother Ata tried to kill herself in front of him after the two were evicted from their house. ""She got out of the car on Interstate 65 in Nashville and walked into oncoming traffic,"" he said. ""Big rigs and cars were swerving out of the way. I grabbed her and pulled her back on the gravel shoulder of the road. ""What's crazy about that suicide attempt is that to this day, she has no recollection of it whatsoever. Probably best she doesn't."" His own battle with depression began a few years later, when his dream of becoming a professional American football player in Canada was shattered after he suffered several injuries. ""That was my absolute worst time,"" Johnson said, adding his girlfriend broke up with him shortly after. ""I reached a point where I didn't want to do a thing or go anywhere. I was crying constantly."" But Johnson, who over the last decade evolved from a professional wrestler to Hollywood's highest-paid star, said he found strength to overcome his pain over fears of becoming suicidal like his mother. ""We both healed but we've always got to do our best to pay attention when other people are in pain,"" he said. ""We have to help them through it and remind them they are not alone."""

2018-04-03,Scientists from Porton Down have not been able to establish where the novichok nerve agent used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal was made. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180404022653/https://news.sky.com/story/porton-down-experts-unable-to-identify-precise-source-of-novichok-that-poisoned-spy-11315387,"Gary Aitkenhead, chief executive of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down, told Sky News they were not yet able to prove it was made in Russia. He said: ""We were able to identify it as novichok, to identify that it was military-grade nerve agent. ""We have not identified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific info to Government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions you have come to."" He said establishing its origin required ""other inputs"", some of them intelligence-based, that the Government has access to. Mr Aitkenhead added: ""It is our job to provide the scientific evidence of what this particular nerve agent is, we identified that it is from this particular family and that it is a military grade, but it is not our job to say where it was manufactured."" However, he confirmed the substance required ""extremely sophisticated methods to create, something only in the capabilities of a state actor"". He said there was no known antidote to novichok. Porton Down's boss would not comment on whether the lab had developed or keeps stocks of novichok, but dismissed suggestions the substance used to poison the Skripals had come from Porton Down. ""There is no way anything like that could have come from us or left the four walls of our facility,"" said Mr Aitkenhead. The Foreign Office responded that they still believed Russia was behind the attack because of the wider ""intelligence picture"". A spokesperson said: ""We have been clear from the very beginning that our world leading experts at Porton Down identified the substance used in Salisbury as a novichok, a military grade nerve agent. ""This is only one part of the intelligence picture. ""As the Prime Minister has set out in a number of statements to the Commons since 12 March, this includes our knowledge that within the last decade, Russia has investigated ways of delivering nerve agents - probably for assassination - and as part of this programme has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks. ""Russia's record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations; and our assessment that Russia views former intelligence officers as targets. ""It is our assessment that Russia was responsible for this brazen and reckless act and, as the international community agrees, there is no other plausible explanation."" The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory also responded to Mr Aitkenhead's comments, writing in a series of posts on Twitter: ""Our experts have precisely identified the nerve agent as a novichok. ""It is not, and has never been, our responsibility to confirm the source of the agent. ""This chemical identity of the nerve agent is one of four factors used by the Government to attribute the use of chemical weapons in Salisbury to Russia. ""The Government's assessment has been clear from the start. Our chemical analysis is a key part of the Government's assessment, and this has not changed."" It comes as the chemical weapons watchdog said it would hold a special meeting on Wednesday into the UK Government's claim that Russia was behind the attack. The OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) said its executive council would meet in the morning in The Hague. In a letter, Russia's ambassador to the OPCW, Alexander Shulgin, asked for the meeting to discuss Britain's allegations ""in a confidential sitting"". Russian President Vladimir Putin has also called for a ""thorough inquiry"" into the incident. OPCW experts have taken samples from Salisbury to try to verify the nerve agent used and its origin. Former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned four weeks ago in Salisbury. Russia has been pushing hard for access to the pair, saying it ""insists"" on seeing them. Ms Skripal's condition improved significantly last week and she is now said to be conscious and talking. Her father, however, remains unresponsive and critical. The UK Government has said it is looking into the legality of Moscow's request and also considering ""the rights and wishes"" of the 33-year-old. The diplomatic row has led to more than 100 diplomats being expelled from the UK, Russia, the US and Europe, and the war of words shows no signs of dying down. Moscow's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said on Tuesday that the poisonings may have been set up by the UK to justify an increase in military spending. In comments reported by Russian news agencies, Mr Grushko said the attempted murders could have been ""arranged by Britain"" because ""they need a major enemy"". His boss, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, floated another possible motive on Monday: that the UK could have carried out the poisonings to distract from Brexit. A retired Russian lieutenant general has also warned of a doomsday scenario and suggested the situation could escalate into the ""last war in the history of mankind"". Evgeny Buzhinsky, who leads security think tank the PIR Center, told the BBC's Today programme he was ""afraid that it will end up in a very, very bad outcome"". Asked to clarify, he said: ""A real war, worse than a cold war is a real war, it will be the last war in the history of mankind."" Mr Buzhinsky said the West was ""cornering Russia and to corner Russia is a very dangerous thing"". When asked if there was any realistic possibility of triggering war, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We need to respond in a proportionate way to this aggressive behaviour from Russia and that's what we're doing."""

There has been a failure of the Enhanced Tactical Flow Management System.  Contingency procedures are being put in place which will have the effect of reducing the capacity of the European network by approximately 10%.  Further information will be provided as soon as possible. We very much regret the inconvenience caused to passengers across Europe today however safety is our number 1 priority at all times. We are working hard to ensure the network returns to normal operations over the coming hours. About 10% of flights will have to be cancelled, the Brussels-based organisation said. Airlines have been asked to refile any flight plans for flights which have yet to take-off. Brussels Airport said it is only allowing 10 flights an hour to depart due to the failure. Amsterdam's Schipol Airport said some flights may be delayed, with passengers asked to check online before leaving for the airport. Due to the @Eurocontrol system failure departures are now limited to 10/hour at #brusselsairport. We're now assessing the impact for the next few hours and we'll keep you up-to-date. https://t.co/ENMaLwktqg A spokeswoman for London Heathrow said the airport is not expecting to have any delays due to the failure and it is ""business as normal"". Eurocontrol covers 41 states across Europe and has agreements with countries in northern Africa, the Middle East and central Asia to ensure air traffic flows safely and as smoothly as possible. The failure comes a day before air-traffic control procedures in south-east England are overhauled as they switch from a 20th Century system using paper strips to an electronic tool. Heathrow and Gatwick Airports have been given permission to allow 10 extra flights each to fly in after 11.30am and before 6am for 10 days to ensure there are no spikes in air traffic so controllers can adjust to the new system.

Paramedics battled to save the teenager but she was pronounced dead in Chalgrove Road, a residential street near Northumberland Park station, at 10.43pm. In another incident, a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot injuries in Walthamstow, east London. Police and London Ambulance Service were called to reports of gun fire in Markhouse Road at about 10pm. The boy was taken to an east London hospital where he remains in a critical condition, police said. A second boy, aged 15, is also being treated for stab injuries but his condition is unknown. Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy said on Twitter there had been a ""serious incident involving (a) shooting and stabbing"", adding it was ""very distressing"". A police spokeswoman said it was too early to say if the attacks were linked and no arrests have been made. It follows a spike in violence in London in recent weeks which saw more murders committed in the capital in February and March than there were in New York. Before Monday's violence, the Metropolitan Police had investigated 46 murders in London in 2018, including 31 fatal stabbings. The force said there were eight murder inquiries launched in January, 15 in February, 22 in March and another on 1 April. This compared to 11 killings in New York in February and 21 in March, according to figures released by the New York Police Department. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick recently blamed social media for the soaring rate of knife crime in the UK, saying trivial disputes could escalate into violence ""within minutes"" when rivals set out to goad each other on the internet."

Gary Aitkenhead, chief executive of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down, told Sky News they had not been able to establish where the novichok nerve agent used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal was made. :: Condition of spy's daughter Yulia Skripal 'improving rapidly' Speaking in Ankara after talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Putin claimed novichok could be made in 20 nations. Given the lack of precise information about the nerve agent's origin, he lamented ""the speed at which the anti-Russian campaign has been launched"", adding that it ""causes bewilderment"". Russia has vehemently denied accusations from Britain that it was behind the poisoning. :: Salisbury poisoning: Russia issues list of 14 questions for UK Russia's embassy in the UK said it ""understood from the very start"" that Whitehall statements on the nerve agent having been produced in Russia were ""a bluff"".

""This only proves that all political declarations on the Russian origin of the crime are nothing but assumptions not stemming from objective facts or the course of the investigation."" The embassy claimed that novichok may be present in the UK: ""We have also noted that, like in his earlier interview, Mr Aitkenhead is not denying that the lab had developed or keeps stocks of the agent they call 'novichok', although, of course, he would not admit it,"" it added. Mr Aitkenhead told Sky News that establishing the nerve agent's origin required ""other inputs"", some of them intelligence-based, that the Government has access to. It was ""not our job to say where it was manufactured"", he added. Nevertheless, he said novichok required ""extremely sophisticated methods to create, something only in the capabilities of a state actor"". There is no known antidote to novichok, he said."

I'm inside GCHQ, the UK's cyber intelligence agency - more relevant than ever today, with the advance of technology and growing threats. I'm being put through a surveillance operation by a GCHQ analyst, Louise. This has never been shown in public before. The amount of data is overwhelming - phone logs, text messages, emails, internet history. Within that, there is more - who called whom, from where, when, for how long? :: Islamic State has 'raised the bar' in its threat to the UK - GCHQ The evidence is in front of me, somewhere, but the sheer amount of information is dizzying. Most of the data is irrelevant, not useful or even helpful. The trick is to work out which bit is worth pursuing and avoid the red herrings. Spot the patterns, or identify the unusual or unexplained event. ""Usually you would try to identify individual targets. You'd have one person looking at some call data, and someone else looking at internet traffic,"" explains Louise. Phone records would typically cover a two week period so intelligence officers are not being too intrusive and looking at more data than they need to. A warrant to listen to calls or read messages must be signed by a Cabinet minister and a judge. ""We have to weigh up how much we expect to get that is more sensitive in nature,"" Louise says. ""Also whether there is any intelligence value. Once we actually have access to that content, if we find we've accessed something we shouldn't have done then we have to report that."" By listening to calls, reading emails and using partner agencies like MI5 to follow targets on foot, analysts can get to know every little detail about targets' lives. I ask another intelligence officer, Sunny, if they ever get too close. ""That can happen that can happen,"" Sunny replies. ""It really does depend on the targets but also our level of access. What is it that we actually following somebody for? ""What level of detail do we need? We won't try to find out everything about everyone, every single aspect about something, if we've already got what we need. ""But it can happen. You get to know your targets pretty well."" When an attack happens, as it did five times last year, GCHQ works with MI5 and MI6 to find out who was behind it. ""I think there's a really well understood purpose,"" explains Sunny. ""Everybody knows what they're in the office to do. Everyone shares the same common goal. I think the biggest feeling in the office is one of wanting to go after the targets and find out who's involved. ""Is there another threat that we need to know about? And are we pursuing somebody that we need to pick up or question? It's basically one of purpose really."" The threat facing the UK has changed - in the early 2000s it came from al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen - recently it has been Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. A third officer I speak to, Ben, specialises in the Middle East and North Africa. Terrorist attacks against the UK in recent years have had links to that region. ""When an attack does happen, that really brings it home that this is the importance of the job, and this is why we do it,"" Ben says. ""The first thing is understanding exactly what the situation is - so what has happened and what do we know, so actually getting that ground truth. ""So actually fact-finding is the first thing we will always do. From there it is understanding exactly how that has happened and where have we potentially missed something in particular, or have we missed something in particular? ""Were we expected to know a particular case had happened in a certain way? From there it's very much a case of piecing back that track and trying to put that breadcrumb trail back together to work out exactly what happened and who in the individual countries in question were involved in that. ""Does that then give clues about others involved who we could then pick up to potentially stop other things happening at other times?"" ""You can eradicate one threat, there will be another threat around the corner."""
2018-04-03,"London has experienced a spike in stabbings and shootings, but is the rate per 100,000 people any worse than other UK regions?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180404022653/https://news.sky.com/story/in-context-just-how-bad-is-londons-murder-rate-11315585,"Sky News has identified that in the first quarter of this year, 45 people have been killed in London. A shocking figure and one that is prompting headlines along the lines of ""London Murder Rate Overtakes New York"". It is true to say that this spike in violent crime in the capital has led to more murders committed in the city in February and March than there were in New York - but context is important. :: London's year of horror so far: The victims Firstly, New York's homicide rate has been declining steadily since a horrendous period in the 1990s when more than 2,000 people were killed each year. Last year, the NYPD investigated 290 homicides. Perhaps the best way to look at these figures is per 100,000 population. On that metric, New York has the lowest rate per 100,000 of any of the United States' five largest cities. :: Teenager dies in mother's arms after shooting Using Office for National Statistics figures for homicide - both murder and manslaughter - in each British constabulary area (Sept 2016 - Sept 2017), we can see that London has a rate of 1.45 homicides per 100,000 people. This is around the same as Leicestershire (1.5), West Yorkshire (1.45) and Derbyshire (1.6). There are plenty of places with a worse rate and some may surprise you. The worst is Greater Manchester where 61 deaths led to a rate of around 2.44 homicides per 100,000 people. There were 12 homicides in Glasgow last year leading to a rate of about two per 100,000 and West Midlands Police recorded 44 homicides, giving the area a rate of about 1.76. Even North Wales Police, who recorded 13 homicides, has a higher rate than London at about 1.88. All of this, of course, does not detract from problems the capital faces. If the current rate of homicides continues at the pace we have seen so far, there could be as many as 180 people killed on the streets this year. The bigger picture is that about 750 people were killed either by murder or manslaughter in the UK last year. Here is the breakdown: :: England: 641 homicides (Sep 2016 - Sept 2017):: Wales: 32 homicides (Sep 2016 - Sep 2017):: Northern Ireland: 15 homicides (Jan 2017- Jan 2018):: Scotland: 64 homicides (Oct 2016 - Oct 2017)"

It is understood he missed an annual Maundy Service in Windsor on Thursday because of the same issue. The day before, however, he was spotted driving in Windsor Great Park, leading to speculation that the problem was not particularly serious. He also reportedly pulled out of an official engagement with the Queen and Duke of York at Windsor Castle last month. :: Prince Philip 'asks if bearded man is a terrorist' Asked about any potential concerns, orthopaedic surgeon Scarlett McNally said ""any operation and any anaesthetic carries some risk"". But she added: ""What is most important is someone's fitness, as in their heart and lung fitness, how much exercise they do and how well nourished they are. ""That's more important than someone's chronological age."" Anaesthetics and physiotherapy will be carefully planned ahead of surgery, she added. While he does still attend events with the Queen on occasion, the Prince stepped down from public duties last summer. When the announcement was made, Buckingham Palace said the decision had not been taken on health grounds. :: The Queen and Prince Philip: 70 years of Royal marriage The Prince has been in good health for most of his life and only began to suffer a series of scares when he was 87: :: 2008: Philip was admitted to hospital for a chest infection and was discharged three days later. :: 2011: Two days before Christmas, Philip was taken to hospital from Sandringham with chest pains. He had surgery and was discharged four days later. :: 2012: During the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations Philip was taken to hospital with a bladder infection and discharged five days later. Two months later the infection recurred and he was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. :: 2013: Philip had an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital. :: 2014: Philip appeared in public with a bandaged right hand after a ""minor procedure"". :: 2017: The Prince was taken to hospital with an infection."
2018-04-03,Scientists have discovered dozens of giant dinosaur footprints in Scotland dating back 170 million years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180404022653/https://news.sky.com/story/170-million-year-old-dinosaur-footprints-discovered-on-isle-of-skye-11314975,"The series of footprints, considered to be globally important because they are rare evidence of the Middle Jurassic period, were made in a muddy lagoon off the north-east coast of the Isle of Skye. They were made by long-necked sauropods and theropods, dinosaurs which stood up to two metres tall and were related to Brontosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex respectively. About 50 footprints were discovered at Brothers' Point, a headland on Skye's Trotternish peninsula. The largest was 70cm (27.5in) across, left by a sauropod, while the largest theropod track was around 50cm (19.6in). Tidal conditions made studying the footprints difficult, but researchers were able to identify two distinct trackways in addition to many individual footprints. Using drones to create a map of the site, the scientists also created 3D pictures using a pair of cameras and customised software. This technology allowed the scientists to figure out the track outline, as well as the shape and orientation of the toes and presence of claws. The work of the team at the University of Edinburgh, Staffin Museum and Chinese Academy of Sciences was published in the Scottish Journal of Geology. The team was led by Paige dePolo, who began it while an inaugural student in palaeontology and geobiology at the University of Edinburgh. Ms dePolo said: ""This tracksite is the second discovery of sauropod footprints on Skye. ""It was found in rocks that were slightly older than those previously found at Duntulm on the island and demonstrates the presence of sauropods in this part of the world through a longer timescale than previously known. ""This site is a useful building block for us to continue fleshing out a picture of what dinosaurs were like on Skye in the Middle Jurassic."" Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who led the field team, said: ""The more we look on the Isle of Skye, the more dinosaur footprints we find. ""This new site records two different types of dinosaurs - long-necked cousins of Brontosaurus and sharp-toothed cousins of T rex - hanging around a shallow lagoon, back when Scotland was much warmer and dinosaurs were beginning their march to global dominance."" It is the second set of dinosaur footprints found on Skye, with the first being discovered in 2015."

A High Court judge ruled that Alder Hey Children's Hospital can stop life support treatment for the little boy, against the wishes of his parents, after doctors said continuing it was ""unkind, unfair and inhumane"". Mr Evans has said doctors want to switch Aflie's ventilator off as early as Friday. In a message on Twitter, Pope Francis said: ""It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.

They hope that specialists at the Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital will be able to pinpoint what is wrong with the youngster. The couple had asked judges at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to intervene after losing legal fights in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. But a spokesman for the ECHR said judges had declared the application inadmissible and found no appearance of any human rights violation. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Alfie's father Tom claimed his son's condition had improved since having a form of medication reduced. ""We are begging the hospital to continue this process to give us and Alfie the chance to see if he wakes up or improves,"" he wrote. The Pope has previously expressed support for Charlie Gard, who was also at the centre of a life support battle."

Janet McDonald, prosecuting, claimed the woman had been passed between the men ""as if she were a chattel"". It was the Crown's case, she said, that Putland had ""no respect"" for the woman, and was ""a man fuelled by drink who took what he wanted"". The offence is alleged to have taken place at Lloyd's home in Cardiff after a night out in July 2015. After Lloyd and Putland went to a nightclub in the city, Lloyd took the woman home and had sex with her. Jurors were told that after Lloyd left the room, the complainant could hear him talking to Putland outside the door. ""The defendant then came to the bedroom, sat on the bed, took off his socks...the complainant was concerned,"" Ms McDonald said. ""She texted her friend asking for help, fearing that something was about to happen."" Ms McDonald said Putland then started kissing the woman, who said: ""You can't pass me around."" Ms McDonald added: ""She turned away from him. She told him she didn't want sex. She was crying. She made it clear that she did not want sex. ""It was clear in the circumstances to her she could not turn to Ieuan Lloyd for help. ""He passed her on to his friend as if she were a chattel."" Some of the woman's friends went to the house after receiving calls or help, Ms McDonald said, and saw Lloyd naked at the top of the stairs and the complainant behind him, crying. The jury were told the woman and her friends left in a taxi and despite seeing a forensic doctor two days later did not report the matter to police until November 2016, because she did not want her mother to know what had happened. Putland, from Dinedor, near Hereford, was interviewed by police and had difficulty remembering what had happened, the court was told. ""He did remember (the woman) and having what he said was consensual sex with her,"" Ms McDonald said. ""He agreed it was after she had sex with Ieuan Lloyd... he recalls he noticed she was upset about something (saying) 'I feel I have been passed around, I don't really want to be here'."" Putland told officers he walked the girl to the door straight away and she left. The trial continues."

The number of flights allowed to land at the airports will be reduced as staff gain confidence in using the new system in a live environment. A spokesperson told Sky News that ""months of planning have gone into making this whole process safe and predictable"". However, arrivals at Heathrow will be limited to 80% of maximum capacity for 10 days from Wednesday - with average delays of 20 minutes expected. For the following 10 days, the airport will be limited to 90% of its maximum capacity. The NATS spokesperson added: ""Travellers could be delayed by around 20 minutes on flights bound for Heathrow and Gatwick. ""There may also be minor delays into Stansted, Luton and London City. It will mainly affect arrivals at the two airports, although some take-offs may also be delayed."" People living under flight paths will also be affected as NATS has requested permission to land some planes ""slightly earlier and slightly later than usual"", reducing the overnight respite from aircraft noise. NATS said the introduction of the digital system is an important step in the modernisation of how the UK's airspace is managed.

2018-04-04,"The Foreign Office has admitted deleting a Twitter post that claimed UK experts had ""made clear"" the nerve agent used in Salisbury was ""produced in Russia"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180405025632/https://news.sky.com/story/foreign-office-deletes-tweet-claiming-salisbury-nerve-agent-made-in-russia-11316445,"On 22 March, the Foreign Office's Twitter account claimed ""analysis by world-leading experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down made clear that this was a military-grade novichok nerve agent produced in Russia"". The tweet added the Government's Porton Down facility is accredited with international watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and a ""designated laboratory"". :: Four factors that led UK to blame Russia over spy attack Although a cached version of the Twitter post is still available on the internet, the original tweet has been deleted. It comes after the head of the Porton Down laboratory told Sky News on Tuesday they were not yet able to prove the nerve agent used to poison ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was made in Russia. The UK Government have blamed Moscow for the Salisbury attack, prompting an increasingly bitter diplomatic rift with the Kremlin. After it emerged on Wednesday that the tweet had been deleted, the Foreign Office said the post was removed because it ""did not accurately report"" the words of Laurie Bristow, the UK's ambassador to Russia, which the tweet was supposed to be quoting. However, the Russian government seized on the revelation of the tweet's deletion to restate its claim the Salisbury attack is being used to ""vilify"" Moscow. Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency: ""Based on what was expressed before those reports and what is being voiced and published on social networks by official UK representatives after this report, I draw the conclusion that there are no illusions, they had designated the guilty party from the start and they will not give up this policy. ""We will see the further development of this scenario in the near future contrary to logic, contrary to common sense, because totally different tasks are being set and all this case is being played out in order to completely vilify Russia geopolitically; this is an attempt to isolate Russia and so forth rather than to find out what really happened to Sergei Skripal and his daughter."" The Russian embassy in the UK also asked why the Foreign Office post had been removed. The now-deleted tweet was posted two days after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in an interview with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, claimed staff at Porton Down were ""absolutely categorical"" and told him there was ""no doubt"" the source of the nerve agent was Russia. The Foreign Office insisted Mr Johnson's comments and what Porton Down have said recently is ""fully consistent"" with UK Government's position throughout the fallout from the Salisbury attack. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been criticised for his own response to the Salisbury attack, told Mr Johnson he has ""serious questions to answer"". He said: ""There clearly was a huge inconsistency in that the Foreign Secretary had made a statement, the Foreign Office put out a tweet in support of what he's said. ""Porton Down then said they couldn't and wouldn't identify where it had come from, so they then deleted the tweet. ""Where does that leave the Foreign Secretary? Egg on his face for the statement he made on German television."" The Foreign Office highlighted how a full transcript of Dr Bristow's briefing to international diplomats on 22 March has been available online since the day it was delivered. They said the briefing was ""tweeted in real time"" by the UK embassy's Twitter account and had been ""amplified"" by the Foreign Office account to ""explain what happened in Salisbury to as wide an audience as possible"". A spokesperson said: ""One of the tweets was truncated and did not accurately report our Ambassador's words. We have removed this tweet. ""None of this changes the fact that it is our assessment that Russia was responsible for this brazen and reckless act and, as the international community agrees, there is no other plausible explanation. ""No other country has a combination of the capability, the intent, and the motive to carry out such an act."" The questions over the Foreign Office tweet came as discussions of the Salisbury poisoning at an extraordinary meeting of the OPCW further heightened tensions between London and the Kremlin. Ahmet Uzumcu, the director-general of the OPCW, used the meeting to announce he expects to receive the results of his organisation's own independent analysis of samples from Salisbury by early next week. Including analysis of biological samples from the Skripals and police officer Nick Bailey, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, the results will then be sent to the UK Government. Speaking on a visit to Turkey, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is waiting for the moment when ""common sense comes out victorious and international relations stop receiving the damage that we are witnessing right now""."

It is estimated that the NHS in England is short of around 40,000 nurses. Janet Davies, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, said: ""The continued failure of ministers to get a grip on the nurse-training situation will jeopardise care for patients. ""The Government may have agreed to increase starting salaries for nurses but, in isolation, that will not be enough to bring in the tens of thousands more we need.

Overall UCAS reported a fall of 11,000 in the number of people applying for higher education courses. It said this was due to there being 18,000 fewer 18 year-olds in the UK and a decrease in applications for mature student places.

The consumer group examined more than 500 of the most popular fridges and freezers on the market and found that backing material on 45% of them was made of unsafe plastic which posed a potential fire risk. All the appliances investigated pass the current British Standard which involves putting a hot wire through a sample of the fridge or freezer backing material and seeing if it catches alight. Which applied a more stringent test and found those with plastic backings were not able to prevent a flame reaching flammable insulation used in fridges for more than 30 seconds. Those with metal or aluminium laminate backings provided protection for five minutes. Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith said: ""People will rightly be outraged to learn that manufacturers and retailers are selling potentially unsafe products that could be putting their lives at risk. ""If manufacturers and retailers fail to act and leave plastic-backed fridges, freezers or fridge-freezers on sale, the Office for Product Safety and Standards must step in and take action.""

Now Mr Joyce has been granted a posthumous pardon by Irish President Michael D Higgins, the first for a case predating the foundation of the Irish state. President Higgins described it as a ""shameful episode in Ireland and Britain's history"" and the pardon would ""correct the historical record"". Named after the remote Galway community in which they took place, the brutal Maamtrasna murders made headlines around the world. In August 1882 a family was attacked in their home. By the end of the assaults five of the six family members were dead, the youngest 14, the eldest 80. Mr Joyce, whose Irish name was Maolra Seoighe, was related to some of the family members, but there were always doubts about his guilt and the way he was convicted. Apart from the the statements from the guilty men that he played no part in the killings, Joyce's trial was held in English, a language the Gaelic speaker did not understand. There were also questions about the reliability of alleged eyewitnesses, who were later paid off at the insistence of the then lord lieutenant of Ireland, but it was not enough to save Mr Joyce from the gallows. In 2015 a report into the case was commissioned by the Irish Government which concluded that he had been wrongly convicted."

There were 617,000 admissions to English NHS hospitals in 2016/17 where obesity was recorded as either a primary or secondary diagnosis - up from 525,000 in 2015/16. About two thirds (66%) of these patients were women. Admissions where obesity was the main factor rose by 8% during the same period, from 9,929 to 10,705 - and almost three in four of these patients (72%) were female. Approximately 6,700 weight loss surgeries including stomach stapling, gastric bypasses and gastric band maintenance were carried out in 2016/17 - 77% of them on women. More than a quarter (26%) of adults are obese, the figures showed, with 2% of men and 4% of women classed as ""morbidly obese"" - meaning they have a body mass index (BMI) score above 40. About 30% of women are overweight and 27% are obese, according to the health service's data watchdog, while two in five men (40%) are overweight and 26% are obese. The report also found obesity varies by region, and was generally more prevalent in northern England and the Midlands than in southern areas. Wirral, Southampton and Slough were shown to have the highest admission rates, while Telford and Wrekin as well as Redcar and Cleveland were said to have the highest rates of weight loss surgery. The watchdog also provided data on physical activity levels and diet, with 21% of men and 25% of women classed as inactive. The proportion of children meeting the recommended levels of physical exercise increased from 21% in 2012 to 23% in 2015 for boys, and from 16% to 20% during the same period for girls. Figures also showed more than a quarter (26%) of adults consumed five portions of fruit and vegetables a day in 2016 - with women slightly outperforming men. Only 16% of children aged five to 15 were doing the same, a fall from 23% in 2014. Professor Louis Levy, head of nutrition science for Public Health England, said: ""These figures show obesity and its associated health risks remain a significant challenge across England. ""We're working with industry to make food healthier, we've produced guidance for councils on planning healthier towns and we're delivering campaigns encouraging people to choose healthier food and lead healthier lives. ""It's taken many years for levels of obesity to reach this point and change will not happen overnight."""

In 2013, more than 12,000 people aged over-21 applied for a midwifery course in England, but in 2017 just 6,700 applied - a decrease of 45%.

The woman said after she had sex with Putland's friend Ieuan Lloyd in his bedroom, Mr Lloyd left the room and started talking to Putland. Putland, 24, then came in and sat on the bed and started taking off his shoes, she said in a video-recorded interview played at Cardif Crown Court. She said: ""When he started taking off his clothes that's when I texted my friend saying 'help something might happen'. Ieuan closed the door and he left me and Otto."" The woman said she was lying on the bed wearing a skirt and top but no underwear, and that it was pitch black in the room. She said: ""He lay on top of me and that's when I was saying 'you can't pass me around' and he said 'we're not passing you around'. ""I told him I didn't want to have sex with him and he continued trying to kiss me."" The woman said Putland then removed his boxer shorts and she put her hands between her legs to cover her genitals. She said: ""He said 'do you want me to put a condom on?' So he went and grabbed one and put one on."" Jurors heard Putland then said it was fine, they did not have to have sex and could just kiss. ""So I moved my hand but I was still crying and just kept turning my head away from him,"" said the woman. ""After I removed my hand he just put it in but he said to me 'don't worry, it's just the tip'. ""I used my arms to keep him at a distance and push him away.""

Ms McDonald said the woman saw a forensic doctor two days later but did not report the matter to police until November 2016, initially saying she did not want her mother to know what had happened. The woman said she was ""really drunk"", but she knew what she was doing. Cross-examining her, defence barrister Christopher Rees said she told the doctor in 2015 she had drunk half a litre of Malibu and vodka and lemonade. Mr Rees said: ""There were gaps in your memory when you gave the account to the police 18 months later."" The woman replied: ""I can remember most of the night, it is just the one part I can't remember anything of at all"" - what happened after she came out of the bathroom. Mr Rees asked why she had not got up and left when Putland came into the room. The woman said: ""I froze. I am not sure... I wasn't thinking straight. I wasn't sure exactly what was going to happen at that time."" Putland, of Dinedor, near Hereford, denies one count of rape. The trial continues."

2018-04-05,Is crime rising up the political agenda?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/crime-is-rising-up-the-agenda-ahead-of-bellwether-local-elections-11318332,"With vital local elections in the key political battleground of London just four weeks away, it undoubtedly is. Suddenly, with the murder rate in the capital overtaking that of New York in February and March, violent crime is big news again. :: London's year of horror so far - the victims The past week has seen a spate of horrific shootings and stabbings and now a pensioner held on suspicion of murdering an armed burglar in his home. It has been claimed violent crime in the capital is spiralling out of control and that politicians and police have no effective strategy for tackling gang-related killings. Conservative politicians are blaming London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, for failing to get a grip and are also claiming he went ""missing in action"". The Labour Mayor blames Tory cuts, claiming London has lost £700m from its policing budget in the past seven years. ""The increase in violent crime has been happening since 2014 across the country"" says @SadiqKhan. Sky News questions the London Mayor about what he's been doing about it in the capital pic.twitter.com/JQaVhYdVH6 The former Labour home secretary David Blunkett blames Theresa May for changing the stop and search laws when she was Home Secretary. And the Labour MP Stella Creasy is furious with the PM for making a secret local election campaign visit to Waltham Forest, where recent gang and knife crime took place, but not visiting the scene or meeting victims. The latest violent crime figures are shocking: the number of killings in London alone so far this year has this week risen to over 50, significantly just as the 3 May local elections are looming. The Tories are already tipped to suffer heavy losses in London. Jewels in their local government crown such as Westminster and Wandsworth are under threat from Labour. Until now, the Conservatives have insisted the elections in the 32 London boroughs - where Remainers outnumber Leave voters - are about ""bins not Brexit"". But suddenly Tory MPs and local government politicians are targeting Mr Khan, until now regarded as a major vote-winner for Labour in the capital, and making crime an issue. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford and Woodfood Green, has led his party's attack on the Mayor, declaring: ""He is missing in action."" Mr Duncan Smith told Sky News: ""The problem with London right now - and this is where the Mayor should step in - it's for the Mayor now to get a much more centralised control and coordination. ""You need all local authorities to do the exact same thing at the same time with the police working alongside them. That would be successful in reducing gang violence."" After days of silence, the Mayor hit back, telling one interviewer: ""As the father of two teenagers daughters I worry as a dad, and that's why we have to make sure we grapple with this problem - but I can't solve it by myself."" Lord Blunkett, who was a tough, no-nonsense home secretary under Tony Blair from 2001 until 2004, blamed the Prime Minister personally in a Daily Mail article. ""The figures speak for themselves,"" he wrote. ""Since 2014 - when Theresa May (who was then Home Secretary) ruled that stop-and-search can be used only when police feel a crime 'will' take place, rather than 'might' - knife crime has risen dramatically. ""While searches on the streets have been reduced by about two-thirds, knife offences have soared to their worst levels in a decade."" But it's not just Mrs May's past actions that have angered Labour MPs. They're livid that she chose to spend her first day back after her walking holiday on Tory campaigning close to some of the worst violent crimes. ""Great to have @theresa_may out canvassing this morning in #WalthamForest in advance of the local elections on 3 May!"" tweeted E17 Conservatives, along with a photo of the PM with Tory canvassers. Great to have @theresa_may out canvassing this morning in #WalthamForest in advance of the local elections on 3 May! #VoteConservative #TeamTory #ToryCanvass @ToryCanvass pic.twitter.com/MeHIqtFKoC That prompted Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, to tweet: ""If you can come to our borough looking for votes as you did today @theresa_may the least you can do is hear our call for help to tackle the violent crime we are experiencing."" Another tweet from the E17 Conservatives showed a photo of the PM campaigning alongside local government candidates and the same Mr Duncan Smith. It's probably fair to say that both Mr Khan and Mrs May - on holiday in Wales - were missing in action earlier this week during the spate of killings and were caught off guard by the scale of the horrific violence. But there will be no hiding place for either of them - or indeed other senior politicians - over the next few weeks, as crime once again becomes one of voters' top concerns in the run-up to the elections."
2018-04-05,An 18-year-old man stabbed to death in Hackney on Wednesday night was Facebook friends with a teenage girl killed in London earlier this week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/latest-teenager-killed-in-london-stabbing-named-as-israel-ogunsola-11317717,"Israel Ogunsola is said to have approached police suffering from knife wounds shortly before 8pm on Wednesday following the attack. Officers rushed to his aid in Link Street, in the east London borough. Paramedics and staff from the London Air Ambulance attempted to save his life but he was pronounced dead at the scene less than half an hour later. Two 17-year-olds have arrested on suspicion of murdering Mr Ogunsola. It has emerged the victim was Facebook friends with Tanesha Melbourne, a 17-year-old who was shot in a drive-by shooting on Monday in Tottenham. Just 30 minutes later, 16-year-old Amaan Shakoor was shot in the face in Walthamstow. A spate of knife and gun deaths has prompted fears London's murder rate for 2018 will surge above that for last year. The teenager's father Dele Ogunsola said his son had been training to become a computer programmer and was ""thoughtful"" and ""joyous"". He has demanded the ""bloodshed must stop"", saying Israel was just cycling to meet friends when he was attacked. He told the Evening Standard: ""London's streets are so dangerous. Young people are being slaughtered every day. If it means bringing back more stop and search, then so be it. ""We have to tackle this problem and the Government needs to do more."" Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick has pledged to use ""Al Capone"" tactics to curb the rise in murders and knife crime in the capital. She said a new task force of 120 officers would focus on the most violent gang members and individuals to take them off London's streets ""for any crime"". US gangster Al Capone was jailed for tax evasion in the 1930s when traditional law enforcement methods failed. :: London's year of horror so far: Victims in the first 14 weeks of 2018:: In context: Just how bad is London's murder rate? Mr Ogunsola is one of 51 people identified by Sky News to have been suspected of being deliberately killed in London so far in 2018. Stabbings in the capital are at their highest rate since 2010/2011. The latest was in the area of Billet Road, Walthamstow, at around 12.50pm on Thursday when a man in his 20s was taken to hospital with knife wounds. His injuries that are not thought to be life-threatening. Labour's MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy, hit out at Prime Minister Theresa May in a post on Twitter for ""coming to our borough looking for votes"" and not ""hearing our call for help to tackle the violent crime"". If you can come to our borough looking for votes as you did today @theresa_may the least you can do is hear our call for help to tackle the violent crime we are experiencing- one day later and this letter to your ministers needs updating. We need resources! #EnoughIsEnough pic.twitter.com/T8QquUMajQ The latest victim to be killed was a man in his 50s who died outside a Betfred bookmakers in Upper Clapton Road, Clapton, following a suspected fight. A police spokeswoman said the Met Police began a murder investigation into the death on Thursday morning. A statement said at this stage there have been no arrests. The number of suspected murders in London since the start of the year has prompted a political row over what should be done about it. Meanwhile, a pensioner arrested over the death of an intruder stabbed to death in his home in Hither Green, southeast London, has been bailed."
2018-04-05,Five-time world darts champion Eric Bristow has died at the age of 60.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/darts-legend-eric-bristow-dies-aged-60-11318263,"Bristow was at the Premier League Darts event at Liverpool's Echo Arena when he suffered a heart attack. Fans at the Echo Arena burst into a rendition of ""There's only one Eric Bristow"" after being told he had died. Bristow, who was born in east London and was known as the Crafty Cockney, has been called a ""tremendous player and a huge character"" who was ""honest and straightforward"". One of darts' first superstar players, he won his five titles as a player in the British Darts Organisation, dominating the sport between 1980 and 1986. During his career, he also won five world masters titles. Bristow was one of the founder players when the PDC was formed in 1993 as some of the sport's leading stars broke away from the British Darts Organisation. The 60-year-old was inducted into the PDC hall of fame in 2005 alongside close rival John Lowe. And since retiring from competition at the end of 2007, he remained a popular figure on the exhibition circuit. PDC chairman Barry Hearn said: ""Eric will always be a legend in the world of darts and British sport. ""He was a tremendous player and a huge character and even after his retirement fans would travel for miles to meet him and see him play. ""Eric was never afraid of controversy, but he spoke as he found and was honest and straightforward which is what people admired about him. ""The PDC, and the sport of darts, will miss him."" Keith Deller, the 1983 world champion - who beat Bristow in that final - said at Premier League fixture in Liverpool: ""I'm devastated, me and Eric were together all the time. ""What he's done for our game, tonight, if it wasn't for Eric, no one would be here tonight."" He added: ""It is a massive loss to our sport. He said what he thought and it was his honest opinion. Everyone loved Eric for that."" Meanwhile, former world champion John Lowe said he had ""lost a part of my life tonight"". Bristow, who also worked as a TV pundit for Sky Sports, was awarded the MBE for his services to sport in 1989. He also appeared on ITV's jungle reality TV show I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here in 2012."
2018-04-05,A firefighter on shift on the night of the Manchester Arena bombing has spoken of his frustrations at waiting for permission for his crew to attend.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/manchester-firefighter-we-were-pleading-to-be-deployed-on-night-of-terror-attack-11317805,"Manchester's fire service took more than two hours to respond to the bomb attack, an independent panel report found. Police, arena staff and even the military were on the scene within minutes, but the fire service did not respond until after midnight. The bomb went off just after 10.30pm. Here, one of the firefighters anonymously tells Sky News what happened on the night of the attack, and gives details of what was going on in the fire station while they were waiting for the call.  On the terrible night in question I was on duty at one of Manchester's city centre stations. At roughly 10.40pm we got called to the RVP (Philips park fire station) which was located about three miles from Manchester Central fire station. Once the proceeding fire engines (4) for the initial call gathered at the RVP it became clear there was a major incident developing. One crew member from an appliance said his wife is a paramedic and she was going to the arena, and that sadly there were fatalities. Some crew members put Sky News on TV and we were watching it all unfold while waiting to be sent and waiting for our specialist teams and officers to arrive. There was utter confusion and shock as to why we were not being called out. Some time later when they did arrive it was quite clear that key information wasn't being passed to us and that they were not listening to what we were telling them. But we knew at this point we needed to go and help people. After what seemed like a decade, we were told to mount the fire engines because we were going to the forward command RVP which was Manchester Central fire station. Upon arrival all we could see was paramedic vehicles everywhere. They were flying in and out of the station going to help the injured. Paramedics as far as Birmingham were deployed to Manchester to help. All this was unfolding while we were pleading with officers to deploy us. I counted four different occasions we were told to get all of our first aid equipment ready because we were going to be deployed, but then told to de-rig because officers had changed their minds. This was a terror attack, our country was under attack once again and we were just standing around. I have been asked the question that if we were deployed sooner would more lives have been saved? That's very difficult to answer. But I have to say no. But I do believe that if we were deployed at the right time that injured people would have had medical assistance sooner. I do believe we should have gone straight away to help and all the firefighters on duty that night in the city feel the same way. We were pleading for a high-ranking officer to just deploy us. The city needed us, not us standing around doing nothing. Listening to the Kerslake review has been mentally challenging, not just for me but for the whole fire service. It has brought back every feeling of guilt, anger and the feeling of the public thinking we have let them down. But it has gone through every detail of what happened that night and this has been a tremendous effort to find the root cause of our non-attendance - well, late attendance. Since the arrival of our Mayor, Manchester fire service has been through some very tough times. Bad incidents, upper management leaving (the chief), who should be ashamed. Reading his open letter, it is nice for him to say that firefighters shouldn't feel guilt or blame, but that is easier said than done. I don't blame myself, I blame the upper management who didn't deploy us, the people who get paid to make these decisions. And the people who should have made these decisions have now been promoted to a higher rank. The culture of this fire service has had a blame approach over the years. Firefighters being constantly put under pressure by upper management, always under scrutiny and always being audited. We have done a lot more than other fire services to help the people of Manchester over the past few years. We trialled a scheme where we get called out to people who have stopped breathing. This trial was only meant to last for six months but lasted 18 months. But we did it without causing any issues, because that is what we do. We help people. There is a lot of work needed to change Manchester fire service and the Kerslake review has highlighted some of these, but the Mayor and the deputy mayor have listened to their firefighters and are putting things right gradually. Our new interim chief has been a credit to the service. She has listened to the views of her workforce, listened to the public and has answered all of the hard questions that the media has put in front of her. She has done this with dignity and passion. The person that should be there answering the hard questions shouldn't be her, it should be our old chief who has made a mockery of this fire service. I personally would like to thank her for the way she has dealt with things and the difficult times, but there is a long way to go. We have been lied to before from previous chiefs and this trust has been blown. But with that in mind everyone needs a chance and from the things she has said, the deputy mayor has said and the Mayor himself, I believe if they stick to their word then the people of Manchester will have a fire service they can rely upon when they need help. I pray that such an event like the 22 May 2017 never happens again, but if it did, Manchester fire service will attend and help. The night of the Manchester Arena attack will always be in the mind of every firefighter in Manchester. But I have high hopes for this broken service to be repaired with the right people in charge - people who don't lie to us and people who listen to what the service needs. It hit rock bottom, but I believe we now have the right people to change the view of its staff, but more importantly the view of the people of Manchester, who we let down. But we will never let them down again. Any firefighter looking for help and support can contact the Save The UK Fire Service forum."
2018-04-05,Bollywood superstar Salman Khan has been jailed for five years for killing an endangered species of antelope in a wildlife preserve two decades ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/bollywood-actor-salman-khan-found-guilty-of-killing-rare-antelope-11317344,"The 52-year-old actor, who was at the hearing in Jodhpur, in Rajasthan state, was also handed a 10,000 rupee (£109) fine as he was led into custody. Chief Judicial Magistrate Dev Kumar Khatri reportedly described the star as an ""habitual offender"" as he was sentenced. Khan was driven away amid chaotic scenes outside court and is expected to start serving his sentence at a local prison. ""A warrant has been issued in his name and he will be sent to Central Jail,"" said Prosecutor Mahipal Bishnoi. Indian media reports suggest it could take days for Khan's legal team to apply for bail and appeal the conviction over the 20-year-old case which threatens to derail his illustrious career. Four other stars - Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Tabu and Neelam - were also accused in the case related to the illegal hunting of blackbucks in 1998, but were acquitted due to a lack of evidence. The incident happened in the village of Kankani, near Jodhpur, in western India, when the cast had gathered to shoot Indian family drama ""Hum Saath Saath Hain"". They were in the jeep that Salman Khan was believed to be driving during the hunt. A member of the Bishnoi community, a religious sect which opposes the killing of animals, claimed to have witnessed the shooting. Indian TV footage showed people cheering and applauding the court sentence. Khan has denied the allegations throughout, with his lawyers arguing the blackbucks died of natural causes such as overeating, and that there was no evidence to suggest they had been shot. He had been sentenced to prison terms of between one and five years for convictions in related cases which he was later acquitted of following successful appeals. Hundreds of police officers were deployed outside the court on Thursday to keep back fans who had turned up to catch a glimpse of the much-revered celebrity. He arrived for the proceedings wearing a black shirt and dark sunglasses in a white SUV, flanked by security. Mr Bishnoi had earlier told reporters that Khan's legal team had argued for a light sentence for the offence, which carries a maximum prison term of six years. ""They are praying for probation, they are emphasising on the minimum sentence,"" he said. It is not the first time Khan - who has cultivated an image as a Bollywood ""bad boy"" - has been in trouble with the law. In 2015, Bombay High Court overturned his conviction in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which he was accused of running over a group of people sleeping on a pavement, killing one. The government of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, has challenged his acquittal in the Supreme Court. Khan also caused outrage in 2016 when he compared training sessions for a film to rape."
2018-04-05,"The UK faces a greater threat form a North Korean cyberattack than a nuclear missile, according to a Defence Committee report.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/north-korean-hackers-not-nukes-threaten-uk-the-most-report-11317442,"MPs have asked whether North Korea is ""rash or rational"" as part of their inquiry into the country's nuclear capabilities and its cyber arsenal. They reported that the UK is unlikely to be targeted by a missile strike from the country - although Pyongyang may soon develop this capability. Instead, the UK is far more likely to suffer from ""reckless cyberattacks. North Korea has been conducting its nuclear weapons programme for over a quarter of a century, the MPs said, and was capable of reprocessing weapons-grade plutonium by the early 1990s. NHS computer systems were crippled last year after being infected by the WannaCry ransomware worm that had been developed by North Korea. The MPs said that North Korea rapidly developed its cyber capability since the early 1990s and that this capability had ""crept up"" on the UK following a high-profile attack on Sony in 2014. North Korea currently has sophisticated organisations conducting cyber operations on its behalf, with an estimated 6,800 staff involved in its hacking teams. Nigel Inkster, the former director of operations and intelligence for MI6, told the committee that one of the North Korean cyber units had an operational base in a hotel in China. Mr Inkster said that ""its activities must be known to the Chinese, given the bandwidth required and the close monitoring of web usage by the Chinese government"", according to the committee. The MPs added that the UK might be able to provide significant offensive cyber capability in response to North Korea, but as such tools had never yet been tested it wasn't clear what effect it would have. Additional investment in the UK's cyber defences was required, said the MPs, and this needed to be sourced from outside of the existing defence budget. They added that the lack of skilled staff is a concern for the UK's cyber capability development - echoing a worry the UK cyber security community has voiced for years. Last October, Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""We can be as sure as possible - I can't obviously go into the detailed intelligence but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role."" The minister commented after the National Audit Office (NAO) warned the Government and NHS to ""get their act together"" to prevent future attacks. An NAO report found computers at one third of health trusts across England were infected, along with computers at almost 600 GP surgeries. The Defence Committee chairman Julian Lewis said the threats posed by North Korea were ""typical of the new and intensifying dangers confronting the UK"". He added: ""There is cross-party consensus that we need to invest much more than the NATO minimum of 2% of GDP. ""A target nearer 3% is essential to fill existing holes in the defence budget and counter re-emerging state-based threats from Russia and North Korea."" The report - called Rash Or Rational? North Korea And The Threat It Poses - has been published ahead of a possible summit in May between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un."

The usually nocturnal creatures have been seen standing on their hind legs, baring their teeth and then falling over backwards. Photographer Robert Coggeshall said he was playing with his dogs outside his home last week when one of the raccoons approached them. ""He would stand up on his hind legs, which I've never seen a raccoon do before, and he would show his teeth and then he would fall over backward and go into almost a comatose condition,"" Mr Coggeshall told the news agency WKBN. That raccoon, along with 14 others that police responded to, have been euthanised. Local officials say the animals were likely suffering from distemper - a viral disease that causes coughing, tremors, seizures and leads raccoons to lose their fear of humans. The disease can be contracted by dogs, so owners are being advised to get their pets vaccinated. Authorities are asking residents to report raccoons behaving unusually to their local police station."

Surgeons sat on opposite sides of the da Vinci Xi robotic console as they performed the procedures. The technology enabled them to see the affected area in close detail using 3D magnified images. The ""arms"" of the robot allowed the team to make tiny movements without the ""all natural human tremor"", while the hands can rotate 360 degrees. Surgeon Shahnawaz Rasheed, who led the operation with Marielle Nobbenhuis, said: ""The precision of surgery, we think, is much higher. ""Because of that, the impact on the patient should be less. ""So we can do the same operation in terms of the removal of the cancer, but have less of a trauma to the patient."" Ms Lockton was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in September and had a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat a large tumour in her bowel. The NHS patient was able to return home just days after the procedure, which offered a less invasive option to open surgery. ""I can't believe how quickly I have been able to come out of hospital and it's lovely to be home,"" she said. ""I think the real healing will happen now."" The Royal Marsden Hospital has the largest programme of robotic surgery for cancer in the UK and the technology is particularly useful to access hard-to-reach tumours."

Franklyn Addo, a youth worker, journalist and rapper from Hackney, explains that the violence is nothing new and neither are the problems he believes cause it: I'm distressed that it's taken the deaths of so many people in London for the issue of violence to become so widely discussed in the public domain. I'm encouraged though, that the concerns of people from communities such as my own which have been affected by violence for many years now are finally being considered more widely, and hopeful that the conversation might lead to effective solutions. While the death toll has indeed risen rapidly this year, and I myself feel a particular helplessness, my experience is that such violence is not new - it's just again considered newsworthy. Being from Hackney, which was before recent regeneration infamous for poverty and crime, I've been personally affected by violence since I can remember. When I was just 11 for example, I was shaken by the death of Robert Levy who was stabbed outside of Hackney Town Hall as he tried to stop a fight. I've felt since then a scary sense of the fragility of life and the spontaneity and aggressiveness with which it can be taken. :: London's year of horror so far A familiar sorrow descended when Jamal Mason Blair was accidentally killed in a similar circumstance in 2009, and I lamented the abnormality of a society in which a 13-year-old might come to commit such a crime. There are many more cases I could mention here. My experience is that simply increasing stop and search and placing more police on the streets won't resolve this longstanding issue. The problem persists despite such measures being previously taken. We need to radically reshape our understanding of violence as being just a criminal issue, to promote and, crucially, to fund a more holistic approach involving healthcare, education and community groups - all of these have a stake in and feel the effects of violence. Apart from the fact that stop and search has relatively little yield, the amount of talk about apprehending street-level perpetrators is peculiar to me when yet much less is done about detecting the root source of weapons like guns and preventing their dissemination. What's more is that stop and search nor indeed any other police operation cannot deal with the factors compelling young people to carry weapons in the first instance. Knives are universally available, and even in their absence, many other mundane items can easily be weaponised. :: In context: Just how bad is London's murder rate? The conversation about the potential causes of this all could be endless; I believe there are many which are inextricably linked. I once read a quote from Danny Dorling in relation to poverty, which I often use to summarise the issue: ""No one rationally chooses to live on the miserliness of sickness benefits because they see it as a good living"". Similarly, the young people I've met don't consider being involved in violence as great fun: it's not always as lucrative as people imagine; the risk of apprehension by authorities and even of death if attacked is psychologically taxing. It only makes sense to me then, that if we would provide young people with a viable alternatives, i.e. guidance and support through mentorship as opposed to underfunding youth services; respectable job opportunities with real earning potential rather than erecting boundaries into employment; giving young people a genuine stake in their societies, and a life without the fear of being attacked, then we would see much less of the tragedy we've been seeing for too long now."
2018-04-05,A police male voice choir has been forced to change its name and disassociate itself from its force because of its refusal to allow women to join.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/un-pc-male-choir-forced-to-cut-ties-with-derbyshire-police-11317636,"Derbyshire Constabulary Male Voice Choir has been singing and helping raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity since 1956. But the 62-year-old choir, which is now entirely civilian, has been pulled over by Chief Constable Peter Goodman because its name is not politically correct. He said: ""We are an equal opportunities employer and we are committed to having an organisation where there are no enclaves where people from different backgrounds cannot go. ""We need to represent our communities in every aspect of our public presence. ""Having a male voice choir representing the organisation is incompatible with this, especially as there are no members of the choir who are employed by or who volunteer with us. ""I wish them all the very best for the future."" Members said they felt they had ""become victims to political correctness"", and were ""saddened"" that it had not been possible to find a solution which would have allowed the relationship between the force and the choir to continue. Mr Goodman's suggestion that it become a mixed voice group was rejected because of ""the logistics and difficulties of undertaking such a transformation"". Instead, the group is looking for a new venue to rehearse in - and from June, it will be renamed the Derbyshire Community Male Voice Choir. Gone too will be the police uniforms that members have worn for performances - originally worn by police officers in the 1960s to 1980s - which will be replaced with new costumes ""to create a more contemporary image"". Erm ..... are they male?  Do they have voices? Are they a choir? If so then male voice choir is both factually and politically correct. This type of PC madness doesn't help the police's reputation! Chairman Kevin Griffiths said: ""We fully understand the rationale behind Mr Goodman's decision, however after considering the logistics and difficulties of undertaking such a transformation we felt unable to accept his invitation. ""We are very good at what we do, and to undertake such a change would have required the recruitment of up to 50 new female members with a host of associated costs. ""We felt that to attempt such a change would have destroyed the choir and felt it was better to sever our association with the constabulary and continue the good work we do under a new name."" Was there some rule that prevented the police setting up, say, a Sweet Adelines choir? Would they really have shut down an all-women choir as discriminatory? The move has caused a storm on social media, with Twitter users describing it as ""ridiculous"" and ""shameful"", with some questioning whether the same stance would have been taken if it had been an all-female group. One wrote: ""Erm ..... are they male? Do they have voices? Are they a choir? If so then male voice choir is both factually and politically correct. This type of PC madness doesn't help the police's reputation!"" Another said: ""Was there some rule that prevented the police setting up, say, a Sweet Adelines choir? Would they really have shut down an all-women choir as discriminatory?"" In April 2016, the choir was awarded the Chief Constable's Commendation for its charitable fundraising. In addition to singing in a male voice choir, many members also belong to a number of local mixed voice choirs and enjoy both forms of ensemble."

Tulisa said she collaborated on an original version with will.i.am's producers Jean Baptiste and Jef Martens - reportedly as a demo - and had planned for it to be included in her album The Female Boss. It is believed Tulisa became annoyed when the song was taken from her and given to Britney, especially as she had co-written it, and a long legal battle began. Scream And Shout was Britney's first UK number one for almost a decade. Tulisa's representatives argued the former N-Dubz star and X Factor judge should be included in the song's credits and also receive royalties. Her publicist has been quoted as saying a musicologist report found Tulisa's vocals were mixed into will.i.am and Britney's track. It is reported that all the money made from the track was frozen in 2012 when she launched her lawsuit. Following her reported victory, all the money can be released and Tulisa will get 10% of everything the track has made in its lifetime. And the singer will also be named as a songwriter on the hit song. Sky News has connected Tulisa's representatives for comment."

Watt, 62, had been sacked from his job at North Lanarkshire's Monklands Hospital following a disciplinary hearing and around the same period his marriage broke down, the High Court in Glasgow heard. In what judge Lady Stacey described as an ""assassination list"", he compiled names and addresses of some colleagues involved in the disciplinary process. The former consultant, who also carried out shooting practice, maintained it was only a way to make himself feel better but the judge said the jury rejected this when they found him guilty in March. Defence QC John Scott asked the judge to take Watt's age and near 30 years of public service with the NHS into account. Mr Scott said he could not minimise the seriousness of the charges, but added ""Dr Watt is an unusual person to find himself in the dock at the High Court"". Passing sentence, Lady Stacey said: ""I entirely accept you have served the community in the past. It is sad to see a man who has held the positions you have in this situation."" She added: ""Nothing has been said that explains why you acquired a stock of weapons and ammunition. ""You are a well-educated and intelligent man and must appreciate the law in this country around firearms is strict. These are lethal weapons. ""The jury found you had them with intent to endanger life. I take the view you represent a danger to members of the public."" The judge gave Watt an extended sentence with 12 years in prison and a further three years of supervision. A Serious Crime Prevention Order will restrict his internet use, travel and NHS visits for five years after his release from jail."
2018-04-05,Stock markets are recovering some value as hopes grow that the two largest economies in the world will avert a damaging trade war.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/ftse-100-in-42bn-surge-as-trump-trade-war-fears-seen-as-overblown-11317752,"Over the past few weeks the US - followed by China - has fired their first salvoes in a dispute that has rattled investors globally and helped whisk values from record highs. The focus has been largely concentrated on the two countries since President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium products - exempting the EU and many other nations, at least for now. Mr Trump's protectionist agenda is aimed at saving US jobs and closing what he sees as a $504bn trade gap with China and deficits with other major economies. His proposed measures also include tackling alleged intellectual property theft by Beijing - though fears of reprisals have hit already-pressured tech stocks. China has responded by threatening to target US agriculture as part of its own measures and has raised objections with the World Trade Organisation to the planned imposition of $50bn in tariffs over the technology issue. But market analysts said a softening of the diplomatic language had helped take the pressure off risk-prone stocks late on Wednesday in the US, and on Thursday more widely. The FTSE 100 - which hit levels not seen since 2016 last month and is 7% down in the year to date - closed 2.4% higher at 7199 in a shift upwards aided by a stronger dollar. It meant just over £42bn of previously lost value was recovered during the session, with the index's biggest tech stock Micro Focus topping the gainers. There were similar wins across Europe while US markets built on the late gains of the previous day with tech shares, such as Facebook, and financial and retail stocks up strongly. Traders cited a response to Mr Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, saying the White House was involved in a ""negotiation"" with China rather than a trade war. The Fake News Washington Post, Amazon’s “chief lobbyist,” has another (of many) phony headlines, “Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties.” WRONG! Should read, “Trump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties, Will End Barriers And Massive  I.P. Theft.” Typically bad reporting! Mr Trump, however, continued to maintain the pressure on Beijing via his Twitter account. In response to reporting of China's planned retaliation, he wrote: ""The Fake News Washington Post, Amazon's ""chief lobbyist,"" has another (of many) phony headlines, 'Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties'. ""WRONG! Should read, ""Trump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties, Will End Barriers And Massive I.P. Theft.' Typically bad reporting!"""

2018-04-05,Liverpool FC has been charged by UEFA after its fans pelted Manchester City's team bus with missiles.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/liverpool-fc-charged-after-man-city-bus-attack-11317759,"Fans were seen throwing a number of objects - including flares, cans and at least one bottle - as City's bus made its way into Anfield for the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday evening. Footage showed the bus engulfed in red smoke after the missiles were let off about an hour before kick-off. The vehicle was reportedly so badly damaged that City called for another for the journey home. Liverpool won the game 3-0 and will play Man City in the second leg of the tie next week. UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings at its headquarters in Switzerland on Thursday afternoon and charged Liverpool with acts of damage and crowd disturbances. European football's governing body also charged Liverpool after objects were thrown and fireworks set off inside the ground during the game. UEFA's disciplinary body will not hear the case until 31 May - after the Champions League final - meaning any sanctions would only apply next season. In a statement released just after the match, Liverpool said it condemned the ""damage inflicted"" on the bus ""in the strongest possible terms"". ""We apologise unreservedly to Pep Guardiola, his players, staff and officials caught up in the incident,"" it added. ""The behaviour of a number of individuals was completely unacceptable and the club will co-operate fully with the authorities to identify those responsible. ""The priority now is to establish the facts and offer Manchester City whatever support is necessary."""
2018-04-05,"A tax on sugary soft drinks has come into force, with the Treasury having slashed its forecast for the revenue it will raise.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180406032640/https://news.sky.com/story/tax-on-sugary-soft-drinks-comes-into-force-to-combat-child-obesity-11317978,"The Soft Drinks Industry Levy, announced by former chancellor George Osborne in 2016, was originally expected to raise £520m in its first year, with the money to be spent on school sport. That figure has now been revised down to £275m after major manufacturers cut the amount of sugar in popular brands to avoid the tax. The levy will see drinks containing five grams of sugar per 100ml taxed at 18p per litre, and those with more than eight grams per 100ml taxed at 24p per litre. The Treasury says the levy will reduce childhood obesity by encouraging manufacturers to cut the sugar content of their products, or to sell smaller amounts. Major brands, including the manufacturers of Lucozade-Ribena and IRN-BRU, responded by cutting the sugar content of their main products and in some cases replacing them with sweeteners. Coca-Cola has also cut the sugar in a number of its brands, but is not altering its Classic Coke recipe, meaning a can could cost around 10p more. Around 60% of the UK population is overweight, with approximately one in-four people obese, and sugary soft drinks account for around 20% of the sugar consumed by children. Public health bodies say the tax will help tackle levels of obesity, particularly in children. ""We hope it will have two impacts,"" Deborah Shipton of NHS Health Scotland told Sky News. ""One, there will be reformulation, meaning there is less sugar added to drinks, and where there isn't we know that price matters, and that it will reduce the amount of cheap sugary food that is around."" In Scotland the reformulation of IRN-BRU has been controversial. Manufacturers AG Barr cut the amount of sugar from the equivalent of eight teaspoons per can to four, but a petition opposing the change has attracted more than 50,000 signatures. Ryan Allen, who launched the petition, said: ""I think they have sold their brand short and they should have had the backbone to stick with the recipe. It's been made for 117 years and it is part of our heritage."" AG Barr says the majority of its customers support the change. ""The vast majority of our drinkers want to consume less sugar so that's what we're now offering,"" a spokesperson said. ""IRN-BRU remains a sugary drink as the sugar in a can was reduced from 8.5 teaspoons to 4. A can of IRN-BRU produced previously had just under 140 calories and today has around 65 calories."" Coca-Cola said brands including Fanta, Sprite, Dr Pepper and Lilt will not be subject to the tax after being reformulated. A spokesperson said: ""Coca-Cola Classic is one of the few brands that will be subject to the new tax as we have decided not to change the recipe. ""Consumers tell us not to change it and we believe they should be able to choose a Coca-Cola Classic if that's the drink they want."" Public Health England welcomed the tax, citing new figures which it says show that a child has a rotten tooth removed every 10 minutes in England. Evidence of the effectiveness of sugar taxes elsewhere in the world is mixed. Mexico saw an initial reduction in the amount of sweet drinks sold when it introduced a levy, but estimates of the long-term impact of the tax are based on projections of sales had it not been introduced. There are concerns too that a ""pleasure tax"" on sugar will disproportionately affect the poorest people. Public health officials point out that deprivation is a factor in the prevalence of obesity, with the least well-off most likely to be overweight."

Mr Khan said on Twitter: ""I'm angered and heartbroken by the number of violent deaths on our streets this week - and this year.

Ms Mtumwa and Tanesha were two of the seven who have been killed since last Friday, prompting fears this year's murder rate could well outstrip that of 2017. Mr Lammy said he believes that the billions to be made in the drug market are responsible for inter gang conflict and violence. ""Buying cocaine is easier than ordering a pizza on Deliveroo. And I'm hearing nothing from the Government about what they're going to do about organised crime and serious gangsters who control this market,"" he added. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who is MP for Hackney, also called for more government action over the rise in killings in London. She told Sky News: ""We need more police officers on the street. Here in Hackney, we have lost one in four of our police officers since 2010. ""We also need to look at what they've successfully done in Glasgow, which was the knife crime capital of the country. ""They have taken a public health approach, which means working with schools, with mental health facilities, with social workers, with youth work, to have a real chance of a solution and the remarkable thing is in Glasgow, since adopting this approach, last year they had no deaths from knife crime."" A statement from the Home Office said: ""The UK has some of the toughest gun laws in the world and we are determined to keep it that way. ""We have already consulted on new laws on offensive and dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in private. ""Our new Serious Violence Strategy will put a stronger focus on steering young people away from violence whilst continuing to ensure the strongest possible law enforcement response. ""As part of the strategy we have already announced new funding of up to £1m for the Home Office Community Fund which will be provided to help communities tackle knife crime and have launched a new advertising campaign to reduce knife crime among young people.""

Three teenagers were taken to hospital and one male was arrested on suspicion of murder following an attack in Grove Road, Mile End, shortly after 6pm, with two of the victims - both aged 15 - left in a serious but stable condition. The other youth - a 16-year-old boy - was treated for minor injuries and then arrested for conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. :: Crime rising up the agenda ahead of bellwether local elections Another male teenager was taken to hospital after being stabbed in Ealing Broadway at around 7.05pm, and the 13-year-old boy was attacked in Gainsborough Avenue, near Little Ilford Park, just before the hour. His condition was described as serious but stable by officers, who arrested three young boys on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Earlier on Thursday, at around 5.30pm, a 15-year-old boy was found stabbed in East India Dock Road in Poplar.

Mr Ogunsola was Facebook friends with one of those, Tanesha Melbourne, a 17-year-old who was shot in a drive-by shooting in Tottenham on Monday. Just 30 minutes later, 16-year-old Amaan Shakoor was shot in the face in Walthamstow. :: 'More police won't stop spate of killings' Protesters and community leaders gathered at Hackney Central station on Thursday, not far from where Mr Ogunsola died, with organisers Guiding A New Generation (GANG) using a communal microphone to plead for an end to the violence.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has continued to attack the Government in light of the rising rate of violence. He has blamed ""the level of cuts"" made to policing in the city, claiming that £700m of funding had been lost from the police budget since 2011. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick has pledged to use ""Al Capone"" tactics in a bid to curb the number of murders and knife attacks in the capital. She said a new task force of 120 officers would focus on the most violent gang members and individuals to take them off London's streets ""for any crime"".

She said: ""I am grateful for the interest in me and for the many messages of goodwill that I have received. ""I have many people to thank for my recovery and would especially like to mention the people of Salisbury that came to my aid when my father and I were incapacitated. ""Further than that, I would like to thank the staff at Salisbury District Hospital for their care and professionalism. ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" In the statement, Ms Skripal made no mention of the condition of her father Sergei. The Skripals have been treated at Salisbury District Hospital since being found collapsed on a public bench on 4 March. The UK Government blames Russia for the use of military-grade novichok in the attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Mr Skripal and his daughter. Moscow has denied the accusations. The Russian Ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, told journalists on Thursday he was ""really happy"" about the news of Ms Skripal's condition and expressed hope her father would also recover. He added he was ""quite sure"" Ms Skripal would return to her job and apartment in Moscow, but it would be the ""choice"" of Mr Skripal whether or not he returns to Russia. The 66-year-old was sentenced to 13 years in a Russian jail in 2006 after being accused of acting as a double agent for Britain. The former intelligence officer was part of a spy swap with the US in 2010, after which he flew to the UK and settled in Salisbury. ""From the point of the Russian state, Russia has no problems with him,"" Mr Yakovenko said. ""Because, you know, he was sentenced, he spent several years in a prison and then he's like any other citizens, he's clear, that's it. ""So, for us, they [the Skripals] are just Russian citizens."" The Foreign Office revealed Ms Skripal has so far rejected the Russian embassy's offer of consular help. A spokesperson said: ""We are pleased that Yulia's condition has improved and pay tribute to the medical staff who have been treating her and Mr Skripal since they were attacked. ""We have conveyed to Ms Skripal the Russian embassy's offer of consular assistance. ""Ms Skripal is now able to choose if and when to take up this offer, but to date she has not done so."" Ms Skripal's statement came after Russian state TV aired what it said was a phone conversation between Ms Skripal and her cousin Viktoria Skripal, which it said it obtained from the latter. Ms Skripal was quoted as having told the cousin: ""Everything is fine, everything is fixable, everyone is getting better."" Asked about her father, Ms Skripal was said to have added: ""Everything is fine, he is resting, sleeping. Everyone's health is fine."" Ms Skripal was also reported to have claimed she would soon be discharging herself from hospital. On Thursday evening, a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York will discuss the Salisbury poisoning amid a deepening diplomatic rift between Moscow and London."

She compared Moscow's demand to be included in the investigation of Sergei and Yulia Skripal's poisoning to ""an arsonist trying to investigate his own fire"". The meeting on Thursday night was called by Russia, with its UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzya seeking to capitalise on days of confusion over the attempted murders. He opened the session by asking why viewers of the British TV programme Midsomer Murders would believe Russia chose ""the most risky and dangerous method"" to kill two of its citizens. ""They all know hundreds of very clever ways of killing someone,"" he declared. Mr Nebenzya then praised the chief executive of Porton Down, who told Sky News on Tuesday that scientists had not yet discovered the ""precise source"" of the nerve agent used in Wiltshire last month. ""He did not pay tribute to the guesswork put forward by British security services,"" the ambassador said, adding that the novichok substance identified ""is obviously not copyrighted by Russia"". Turning the heat up, Mr Nebenzya told Britain it was ""playing with fire"" - and warned: ""You'll be sorry."" He then likened the media to a ""psychotropic substance"" and the Western coalition that expelled diplomats to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. Mr Nebenzya's argument focused on asking questions, insisting that Russia only wanted ""to get to the bottom of the story"". He concluded: ""The investigation is far from being over, in fact it has only just begun."" :: Analysis - Four factors that led UK to blame Russia Hitting back, Ms Pierce said British accusations ""stand up to any scrutiny"". She defended Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, saying there was ""no contradiction"" in saying Porton Down officials had ""no doubt"" when asked why he was sure the nerve agent originated in Moscow. ""The Foreign Secretary was making clear Porton Down is sure the nerve agent was a novichok,"" she said. ""The threats to the chemical weapons convention, in Syria, in Malaysia and now the UK, place a very serious challenge to the non-proliferation regime that this organisation has constructed in response to the terrible events of the past. ""Russia is playing fast and loose with the institutions that protect us."" US ambassador Kelley Currie followed up by attacking Russia's comparison of Western states to Goebbels, saying it was ""not a tactic appropriate for this body"". She also accused Mr Nebenzya of ""using this chamber to undermine the truth"". The emergency session came hours after Yulia Skripal issued her first statement on the attack, saying her ""strength is growing daily""."
2018-04-08,"Barclays is preparing to kick off the hunt for a successor to chairman John McFarlane, paving the ‎way for the third change at the top of Britain's second-largest bank since 2012.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180409003114/https://news.sky.com/story/barclays-to-begin-hunt-for-chairman-mcfarlanes-successor-11320368,"Sky News has learnt that Crawford Gillies, Barclays' senior independent director, is expected to instruct headhunters shortly to conduct a wide s‎earch for its next chairman. Mr McFarlane is expected to step down at the bank's annual meeting next year, although the timetable remains fluid and could be extended, according to people close to the bank. Among the leading candidates to replace him will be Sir Gerry Grimstone, who has announced his intention to step down as Standard Life Aberdeen's chairman next year. Sir Gerry, who was appointed deputy chairman and senior independent director in 2016, recently relinquished those roles, instead becoming chairman of its non-ring-fenced bank. He also remains a non-executive director of Barclays' main board, but handing the SID role to Mr Gillies effectively confirms his interest in succeeding Mr McFarlane. The search will come at an important time for Barclays, which has just become the first UK lender to formally separate its retail operations from its ‎investment banking unit under reforms which come into effect next year. The bank has made vital progress in casting aside legacy millstones in recent weeks, announcing last month a $2bn (£1.4bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. However, it continues to face uncertainty over the future of Jes Staley, its chief executive, who remains the subject of an investigation by the City and banking regulators over his treatment of a whistleblower in 2016. People close to Barclays believe a verdict, which is expected to result in some form of sanctions being imposed, will be announced within weeks of its annual general meeting on May 1. Clarity over the future of Mr Staley will come as a relief to Barclays' board and its investors, many of whom have questioned his continued commitment ‎to its capital-hungry investment bank. The outcome of the watchdogs' probe could affect the timetable for recruiting Mr McFarlane's successor, according to insiders. Other legal hurdles to the group's revival remain in the form of Serious Fraud Office charges against Barclays' holding company and its main operating subsidiary, in relation to the emergency fundraisings which helped it avoid a state bailout in 2008. ‎Mr McFarlane has also had to contend with the appearance on Barclays' share register of Edward Bramson, an American activist investor, who disclosed a 5.2% stake last month. Sherborne, Mr Bramson's investment vehicle, has yet to inform the bank of its intentions, but other investors believe he will seek a more radical shake-up than the one being pursued by the current board. At its annual results, Barclays said it ‎would hike its dividend for 2018, and pledged to return surplus capital more rapidly to investors. Mr McF‎arlane became non-executive chairman of Barclays in April 2015, having been recruited the previous year from Aviva, the FTSE-100 insurer. He soon stepped into an executive role after ousting Antony Jenkins, Mr Staley's predecessor as chief executive. Mr McFarlane replaced Sir David Walker, the banking veteran who was appointed to help repair Barclays' fractured relationships with shareholders and regulators. If 2018 is to be his final year as Barclays' chairman, the Scot, who also chairs TheCityUK l‎obbying group, will be anxious to see rapid progress in delivering improved shareholder returns. Soon after taking over in 2015, he pledged to oversee a doubling of the bank's share price‎. At the time, the shares stood at about 260p, but since then they have continued to retreat, closing on Friday at 209.55p. Barclays declined to comment this weekend."

However, the EU has said the ""evidence points toward yet another chemical attack"". Nine countries have now called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the reports: the UK, France, the US, Poland, Netherlands, Sweden, Kuwait, Peru and Cote d'Ivore. A meeting will take place on Monday. The allegations have been denied by the Syrian government and Russia, with the latter separately calling for a Security Council meeting over ""threats to international peace and security"". Syrian media accused anti-Assad fighters in Douma of making ""chemical attack fabrications"", and added that allegations of toxic gas use are an ""unconvincing broken record"". Iran has branded the allegations as a ""conspiracy"" against Syrian President Bashar al Assad, and warned that any US military intervention would ""certainly complicate the situation"" in Syria and the wider region. The country's official IRNA news agency said the alleged attack had been condemned by the foreign ministry, which said in a statement: ""Such allegations and accusations by the Americans and certain Western countries signal a new conspiracy against the Syrian government and people, and a pretext for military action."" It continued: ""With the Syrian army having the upper hand on the ground against the armed terrorists, it would not be rational for it to use chemical weapons."" Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price... ....to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification.

The Assad regime & its backers MUST END their barbaric behavior. As POTUS said, big price to pay for those responsible! Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the allegations of a chlorine gas attack in the rebel holdout as ""deeply disturbing"" and called for an immediate investigation by inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. ""It is truly horrific to think that many of the victims were reportedly families seeking refuge from airstrikes in underground shelters,"" he said. ""Despite Russia's promise in 2013 to ensure Syria would abandon all of its chemical weapons, international investigators mandated by the UN Security Council have found the Assad regime responsible for using poison gas in at least four separate attacks since 2014."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The horrific deaths and injuries in Douma point to a chemical attack which must be fully investigated by the UN and those responsible held to account. ""The need to restart real negotiations for peace and a political settlement in Syria could not be more urgent."" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said ""there must be a day of reckoning for those responsible"". The EU has called on Russia and Iran as ""supporters of the regime"" to use their influence with Damascus to prevent a similar attack. France's foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has said his country will ""do its duty"" in relation to the allegations. His country has repeatedly warned that evidence of such attacks in Syria would serve as a ""red line"" prompting French strikes. Last year, the UN was among those blaming Syrian government forces for a deadly sarin gas attack on the opposition-held village of Khan Sheikhun in which at least 100 people died. That attack prompted the US to launch several dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base, which President Trump said was meant to ""prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly weapons"". Responding to the latest allegations, the Russian foreign ministry warned: ""The goal of these false speculations, which are not substantiated by any facts, is to cover up terrorists and irreconcilable radical opposition, which opposes political settlement, and to simultaneously try to justify potential external military strikes. ""It is necessary to once again caution that military intervention under false and fabricated pretexts in Syria, where the Russian servicemen stay at the request of the legitimate government, is absolutely unacceptable and may trigger the gravest consequences."" British MP Johnny Mercer, who has previously claimed it was ""the biggest foreign policy mistake of the decade"" not to take military action in Syria, tweeted: ""Look at the consequences of inaction."""

""He told me I was just getting a picture taken. ""I'm just in shock."" Anderson gained the approval of Jones' father Jeff, a former England international and her head coach with the Mystics, before his on-court proposal. He chose the Commonwealth Games as the ideal venue for a proposal as both players get to represent their country on the world stage at the same event. Anderson said: ""We both worked so hard for this opportunity to be here. ""Basketball is a very big part of our relationship so it just made sense to do it here.""

2018-04-08,A rising star in the Conservative Party has apologised after she admitted she hacked a Labour MP's website and altered its content.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180409003114/https://news.sky.com/story/tory-vice-chair-kemi-badenoch-admits-hacking-labour-mps-website-11323056,"Kemi Badenoch, the hotly tipped MP for Saffron Walden, made the confession in a video obtained by The Mail On Sunday. Asked what is the naughtiest she's ever done, the 38-year-old replied: ""About 10 years ago I hacked into a Labour MP's website and I changed all the stuff in there to say nice things about Tories."" Mrs Badenoch did not name the Labour MP in question. Under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, unauthorised access to computer material can result in two years' imprisonment and/or a fine. Mrs Badenoch said: ""This was a foolish prank over a decade ago, for which I apologise."" Mustafa Al-Bassam, a PhD researcher at University College London's computer science department, revealed he had submitted a crime report to the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime. He posted on Twitter: ""I hope they do take this matter seriously, and apply the law equally to Tory MPs as they do to hacktivists who have gone to jail for less."" Mr Al-Bassam also speculated the Labour MP in question could be the party's former deputy leader Harriet Harman. In 2008, it was reported Ms Harman's personal website was hacked and updated with a post apparently announcing her defection to the Conservative Party. Another hacked post called for Londoners to support Boris Johnson's bid to become Mayor of London. Mrs Badenoch, a former London Assembly member, was elected an MP at last year's snap general election. She has since been appointed Tory vice-chair with responsibility for selecting candidates for the 2022 election. Mrs Badenoch was also given the honour of introducing Theresa May at last year's Conservative Party conference. On Friday night, she was guest speaker at the annual dinner of the Prime Minister's constituency party."
2018-04-08,"When people buy their own homes they believe they will own their house - but for many leasehold homeowners, the true owner of their home is a faceless company which can sell on their stake without their knowledge or consent. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180409003114/https://news.sky.com/story/rip-off-leasehold-reforms-dont-go-far-enough-say-campaigners-11322160,"Jo Derbyshire bought her home near Bolton, Greater Manchester, eight years ago. She was aware she was buying a leasehold and knew the ground rent of £300 year would double every 10 years. The mother-of-two planned to buy the freehold, priced at £5,000, as soon as she had the money. But a year later the property developer sold it to an offshore investment company which repriced it at £50,000. She says: ""It's a huge amount of stress and worry and I don't really know if I'm a homeowner anymore. ""When I first bought this house with the leasehold, my understanding was that I owned the house but I didn't own the land. Whereas I've found out that legally I'm effectively just a tenant and I'm paying a huge mortgage for the privilege of having the right to live in this property for the terms of the lease but I don't actually feel like I own it."" Ms Derbyshire is now stuck with a doubling ground rent which will cost almost £10,000 a year after 50 years of ownership. This sort of practice has been labelled the PPI of the housing industry. While Scotland has abolished leaseholds, there are more than 4 million people like Ms Derbyshire in England, trapped in lease agreements and worried about their home ownership. Around 100,000 homebuyers are thought to be in contracts with spiralling ground rents, paying around £4bn in service charges. The Government says it is ""unacceptable for homebuyers to be exploited through unnecessary leaseholds, unjustifiable charges and onerous ground rent terms"". And the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has announced new measures ""to cut out these unfair and abusive practices"". Among the Government's new proposals is a ban on the sale of new properties as leaseholds, but that doesn't help the thousands of people trapped in existing rip-off leases like Ms Derbyshire. And many are calling on the Government to do more, sooner. Sebastian O'Kelly of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership says: ""My appeal is to the MPs on the Communities Select Committee to call in these housebuilders, the chief executives who are on ridiculous remuneration packages, one getting a bonus of £120m for example, and call in the chief executives of the ground rent funds. ""So far as we can identify them of course, the ones based offshore might be a bit more tricky, but call them in and give them the Phillip Green treatment. These people hold the destiny of millions of people's lives in their hands and they've seriously disadvantaged them with these rip-off leases."" For Ms Derbyshire she has little option but to stay in the house she's bought, feeling like a tenant, campaigning for change. ""It's a real David and Goliath fight where we've got all these developers who are making, let's face it, obscene profits from building houses and selling freeholds against us hardworking families and we're trying as hard as we can to make change happen,"" she says. The Government's leasehold reforms are expected to come into force in 2019."

She has claimed the UK has ""something to hide"". In a statement, the Russian Embassy accused the Foreign Office of failing to answer questions over why her application had been rejected. A Home Office spokesman had said her application ""did not comply with the Immigration Rules"", an explanation the embassy has dismissed as ""disappointing"" and ""politically motivated"". :: 'Miracle' recovery: How the Skripals survived the novichok attack The latest bid by Moscow to shape the narrative surrounding the novichok attack came after Viktoria made a direct appeal to Prime Minister Theresa May to allow her to see her family. She told Sky News: ""The main thing I would like now is to see them personally and be able to tell our grandfather truthfully about his son's and granddaughter's health, but my visa was rejected. ""The whole world is now talking about an unprecedented political scandal, but real people are at the epicentre of this scandal. This is our family, which really needs to be together now. ""If Yulia sees this, I want her to see we love her and will always wait for her. I will fight for her till the end. If I can't do it here, I will go to the United Nations, and if I can't do it this way, I will walk, I will hitchhike across the border illegally."" Her comments were dismissed by a former British ambassador to Russia as part of an ""absurdist"" and ""cunning"" attempt by the Kremlin to influence public perception of the ongoing dispute between the two countries. Sir Andrew Wood added: ""The Russians haven't been helpful in any way and we wouldn't expect them to."" The embassy previously questioned why Britain had not been more forthcoming about the fate of Mr Skripal's pets, which were revealed to have died after a request was made to make public what had happened to them. Earlier on Saturday, Britain accused Russia of ""pursuing a diversionary tactic"" after the country's London embassy requested a meeting with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to discuss the poisonings. The request came just a day after former spy Mr Skripal was revealed to be ""responding well to treatment"".

Mr Osborn-Brooks, 78, was arrested on suspicion of murder and released on bail, but on Friday the Metropolitan Police told him no further action will be taken. Following consultations with the Crown Prosecution Service, the force said it had informed Vincent's family of the development and explained to them the reasons why no charges will be brought. Detective chief inspector Simon Harding said: ""This is a tragic case for all of those involved. ""As expected with any incident where someone has lost their life, my officers carried out a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the death. ""We have approached the CPS for early investigative advice, as required under the guidance. We have received and considered that advice, and, at present - on the evidence available - we will not seek a charging decision. ""Therefore, no further action will be taken against the man."" The arrest sparked outcry from neighbours and an online fundraising campaign raised hundreds of pounds for Mr Osborn-Brooks in just a few hours. Addressing the controversy, Mr Harding said: ""Whilst there might be various forms of debate about which processes should be used in cases such as this, it was important that the resident was interviewed by officers under the appropriate legislation of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act; not only for the integrity of our investigation but also so that his personal and legal rights were protected. ""There will be an inquest in due course which will further review the circumstances into Mr Vincent's death in a public forum."" Vincent's family and friends have paid tribute to him on social media, with one post stating he will ""never be forgotten"". In January, Kent Police sought the 37-year-old over a distraction burglary in which jewellery and valuables were stolen from a man in his 70s. During the break-in on Wednesday, two men entered Mr Osborn-Brooks' home on South Park Crescent in Hither Green, south east London. Police said one of the suspects was armed with a screwdriver and forced the homeowner into his kitchen, while the other man went upstairs. It is believed a struggle took place between one of the men and the homeowner and the intruder was stabbed in the upper body, but it is not clear what object inflicted the fatal blow. Police say both intruders attempted to escape, but Vincent collapsed in nearby Further Green Road. According to witnesses, an accomplice attempted to drag him towards a van but eventually fled. Vincent was taken by ambulance to a central London hospital where he died at 3.37am. The second man has not been found and is still being hunted by police."

The medical relief group also claimed an ""explosive barrel"" attack on Douma hospital and its surrounding area had prevented ambulances from reaching victims. There has been no independent verification of the allegations of a chlorine gas attack, and they have been denied by the Syrian government and Russia. An offensive that began in February has seen the Syrian government recapture nearly all of eastern Ghouta from rebels, leaving just Douma in the hands of insurgent group Jaish al Islam. The area has been dubbed ""hell on earth"" and subjected to relentless military force, with 1,600 civilians and tens of thousands more displaced according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Thousands of fighters from another group, Failaq al Rahman, finished pulling out of areas of eastern Ghouta along with tens of thousands of civilians last week, after reaching a deal with the government. Saturday's alleged attack was widely condemned by international observers, with Britain and the US calling for an ""immediate response by the international community"" if the claims are proven. The United Nations Security Council is likely to meet on Monday to discuss the incident, following a request by the United States, Britain, France, Peru and others. Russia has also called for a Monday meeting of the Council, citing ""international threats to peace and security"". The US State Department said it would use ""all efforts available"" to hold ""those who use chemical weapons"" to account, in a statement that referenced the deadly sarin gas attack by the Assad regime on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017. ""Russia, with its unwavering support for the regime, ultimately bears responsibility for these brutal attacks, targeting of countless civilians, and the suffocation of Syria's most vulnerable communities with chemical weapons,"" it added. The Foreign Office said the reports, if proven, showed ""Assad's brutality against innocent civilians"" and disregard for international norms. Evidence for past chemical weapons use by the Syrian government has been widely documented, with a joint inquiry by the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons finding it responsible for the Khan Sheikhoun sarin attack. The inquiry had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015, and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas."

The bus, carrying the Humboldt Broncos to a play-off game against the Nipawin Hawks, had 29 people on board, including the driver, when it crashed at about 5pm local time (midnight in the UK) on Highway 35. Hundreds of people including National Hockey League (NHL) players attended the vigil at the Elgar Petersen Arena, home of the Humboldt Broncos club at the centreof one of the worst disasters to hit Canada's sporting community. ""Were here behind you. We will be here for you,"" Rob Muench, mayor of the small farming town of Humboldt in Saskatchewan province, told the gathering. ""We will get through this."" In a message released on Sunday evening, the Queen said: ""Prince Philip and I were saddened to hear word of the crash involving the Humboldt Broncos hockey team. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost so much, with their families and with all Canadians who grieve with them at this difficult time."" My big little brother, Darcy. The tears just keep coming... pic.twitter.com/HyhpQ4PIhe In other tributes, the tearful head of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League Bill Chow said: ""The worst nightmare has happened."" On Twitter, @DebbieJayneC said her brother, Broncos head coach Darcey Haugan, ""didn't make it"". Broncos captain Logan Schatz, 20, was also killed alongside teammates Adam Herold, 16, Jaxon Joseph, 20, Xavier Labelle, 18, Logan Hunter, 18, and Stephen Wack, 21. Tyler Bieber, a local radio announcer, was also among the victims. Jaxon Joseph was described as having a ""positive energy"". His former coach Blaine Neufeld said: ""Something particular about Jaxon was that he had a particular smile. He lit up the room. ""His positivity, his excitement, his energy, his work ethic, brought a positive energy and experience to the guys."" Paul McAvoy, who used to play alongside him at Surrey Eagles, said: ""He made a tremendous impact, not only on the ice, as a person in the locker room."" Adam Herold's former manager John Smith said he was ""one of the finest young men I had the pleasure of managing"". He added: ""The world lost a fine upstanding young man."" The president of Logan Hunter's former club, Kevin Porter, said he had a ""great sense of humour, always had a smile on his face"". Aerial footage from the scene showed the bus on its side, its roof peeled back and its front end destroyed. The truck was also on its side nearby, with its cargo scattered across the road. Derek Patter, Greyson Cameron and Nick Shumlanski were among those hurt. Another player, Ryan Straschnitzki, suffered a severe back injury, said his father Tom Straschnitzki. ""He's alive and breathing, and from what we know he has a broken back, and as of now, can't feel anything from his waist down. ""I think he's still in shock, still asking how everyone is and who perished and who didn't."" A GoFundMe page to raise money for families affected by the crash had raised £1.5m just 24 hours after it was created. ""An entire country is in shock and mourning,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. ""This is every parent's worst nightmare. No one should ever have to see their child leave to play the sport they love and never come back."" Police said the truck driver was detained but later released. Officers added it was too early to say what the cause of the crash was."

He was taken to an east London hospital for treatment and the woman was taken into custody. The attack came at the end of a day in which 300 extra officers were on patrol across the capital as part of the Met's response to a spate of stabbings and shootings, with 51 people thought to have been murdered in London so far this year. Extra officers will also be deployed on Sunday, but Met commissioner Cressida Dick has denied that the capital is facing a ""crisis"". ""We will be using every tactic we know in the coming weeks and months to bear down on knife crime and to reduce the number of homicides,"" she told Sky News. ""We need to reduce the number, particularly the number of young people, who are dying in street attacks.""

The 37-year-old said in an interview with The Mail On Sunday: ""Within six months my hair started to fall out in clumps. ""Then I started sleeping more and more - eventually 22 hours a day. ""I couldn't move from bed because my muscles were aching. ""I lost balance, I was always freezing cold and my brain fog meant I couldn't remember anything."" Spearritt revealed she visited a private doctor the following summer. ""He said I was anxious and depressed, and prescribed a maximum dose of Prozac,"" she said. The former pop star was also prescribed the anti-anxiety and epilepsy drug Pregablin ahead of an S Club 7 reunion tour in 2015. Spearritt said it only masked her symptoms enough to get through the performances. ""Doctors didn't listen,"" she said. ""I felt like I was dying. I could barely walk."" By the end of 2015, she said she had spent £100,000 on doctors treating her symptoms. The star, who appeared in EastEnders in December 2017 and in a charity boxing match for Sport Relief in March 2018, later spoke to a US-based doctor who has been removing breast implants in women for more than 20 years. He advised Spearritt to have hers removed too, she said. The former pop star had the operation in April 2016 and said she felt ""60% better almost instantly"". She added: ""I always suspected it deep down, but to hear a doctor finally give me an answer was the best feeling."" Spearritt said she felt ""stupid and embarrassed that she'd done this to herself"", and continued: ""My temperature rose up to normal and my fever disappeared, as did the fatigue and anxiety."" She said she does not want to ""scaremonger"" but warned women considering the procedure to ""read up on the potential dangers and read stories like mine"". She added: ""Actually, yeah - just don't get breast implants."""

Among those now planning their outfits for the big day next month are Kimberley Watkin and Adam Hughes, who have been working to transform a disused space under Carlisle train station into a first-class community venue. They recall what it was like when the mysterious ""Hogwarts-style"" letter came through the letter box. What is a typical response to being invited to a wedding? Well, that all depends on the couple tying the knot. Chances are they are friends or family. If so, you'll probably be excited, probably a little proud to have received an invite. But, what if the invite came from someone else? What if the wedding you had been invited to was the most publicised and anticipated union of the year, of perhaps the second half of the decade? What if you had been invited to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? Well... we have. :: Royal Wedding: The Ultimate Guide Yes, we are two of the 1,200 young people that the Royal couple has invited to celebrate their wedding. And to add to the long list of rhetorical questions above, how does it feel? In a word, complicated. A mix of thrilled, excited, humbled, proud and nervous. When we received our invite, a mysterious, Hogwarts-style letter, complete with a dignified crest, we were baffled and awe-struck. As a naturally sceptical couple we had two main questions about this honour. Firstly, why us? Out of the many, many, hordes of people desperate to attend the Royal wedding, why were we chosen? Well, we didn’t need to look far to figure that out. After re-reading the invitation, many times, we discovered that the invite recognises the ""strength of our contribution to the local community"" and our community project Carlisle Undercroft. Carlisle Undercroft is in the process of becoming a registered charity, and offers the Carlisle community an affordable and inclusive arts venue in the heart of the city. Located in a site of forgotten historical significance, the Undercroft is situated underneath Carlisle train station. Currently awaiting major renovation, it is hoped that the venue will be open in 2019 as a home for community art and shared cultural experiences. Though the Carlisle Undercroft project has become well known in the North West region, largely as a result of crowd funding campaigns and local press, we had no idea that our project had attracted the attention of those with Royal wedding invite power. ​Our second, and perhaps most pressing question: what now? How do we prepare? Travel, overnight accommodation and clothes all need to be planned. We set to solving this question quickly after receiving the invite. Luckily, Kimberley works for Virgin Trains - travel sorted. Equally as lucky, Kimberley’s uncle lives not too far from Windsor - accommodation sorted. So far preparation has been quite a one-sided effort. But there is no ""luckily"" for our wardrobe. Top hat? Fascinator in the shape of a plume? A dandy dicky? What to wear is our final consideration before we can officially be prepared. A decision of this nature will take time and research. With most of our questions answered, we have begun to absorb the weight of this moment. We balance our Carlisle Undercroft work with jobs, postgraduate study and recently looking for our first home. We are a determined couple who fill our days with work and grit. Looking forward to attending the Royal Wedding is remarkable and truly humbling. That our work on the Carlisle Undercroft project has been recognised in this way is overwhelming. We are proud and grateful to those who have helped make our community project possible, including Virgin Trains, whose support has been essential to the project's success. We are so grateful for this honour and we welcome any and all outfit advice."

He met us in an area of south London where the gang that he used to lead is still active. He said: ""You see people die, you see people bleed. That's abnormal. You're not meant to be out here just bleeding. But I've seen people bleed and die."" :: London's year of horror so far: The victims:: Tanesha Melbourne-Blake: Man arrested over Tottenham murder In a week which has seen teenagers as young as 13 stabbed, he described how many young gang members are attracted by the perceived glamour and believe carrying a weapon is essential. ""It's as important as life or death. It's as important as staying alive or dying today, and I'll keep saying, it's about a mind-set."" The number of stabbings in the capital has reached its highest rate since 2010/11 - with more than 50 murders in 2018 so far. The Metropolitan Police held an emergency meeting on Friday with community leaders and families of victims to discuss the recent spate of attacks. Among those attending was Nicola Calica-Myall - whose son was stabbed more 30 times. ""It's everyone's concern right now. The knives are not going to differentiate your age, your gender, how much money you make, it's everybody's problem."" In many areas it is falling on the local community, charities and groups to help steer young people away from violence and into activities which could lead to a better life. Reprezent Radio in south London trains 400 young people in studio and communication skills every year. Scully, 24, is one of their DJs. He said: ""One of the problems with young people of all ages and from all places is we have a lot of energy and a lot of intention but nowhere to make a mark and put that forward."" And while Scully hones with skills in the studio, Reprezent has 3,000 other young people on the waiting list, meaning many won't get the help. The number of violent deaths this year has meant the Met has had to draft in other forces to help investigate. The former gang member says as the numbers rise, so does the anger: ""Those murders have affected so many people - each single murder - it could be their friends or family that wants to be the revenger. ""It's only going to breed pain and that pain causes a chain reaction."""

Thousands packed out the Blackpool Opera House on Saturday to watch the final episode of Car Share, as well as an unscripted special, and Kay was there to make a short speech thanking them for their support. Many of those in attendance shared their excitement on social media, with the unscripted edition described by one as ""pure genius"". Neil Hailwood said it was ""amazing"" and that he had ""never laughed as much ever"", while Fi Beau said it was a ""total joy"". It was the third and final special screening held this week before the finale airs on TV in May, with the second series of the BAFTA-winning show having ended on an emotional cliffhanger. Kay's character, John, had failed to reciprocate the advances of colleague Kayleigh (Sian Gibson), and fans were then left devastated when Kay announced he wanted to ""go out on top"" rather than make a third series. But he later announced the special finale and unscripted episode, both of which were filmed last year, before he cancelled his nationwide tour. It was to be his first live tour in eight years, and he said the decision to cancel it was ""not taken lightly"". He added: ""I'm sure you'll understand my family must always come first.""

Aboriginal elder Roy Gibson explained how certain leaves can provide relief from mosquito bites, before showing the prince a handmade hunting boomerang. Charles later sat down for a discussion on sustainable forestry at the world heritage-listed forest on the northeast coast of Queensland. He had earlier attended a Sunday church service and met a woman who made headlines when she gave him a kiss 40 years ago.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd is also expected to challenge social media companies to do more to crack down on gang-related content. The different measures all fit into the Government's serious violence strategy, which will launch on Monday. :: Woman held after stabbing outside London station It comes after a surge in violent crime, particularly fatal stabbings, in London in recent months. National figures show police in England and Wales recorded a rise of a fifth in knife and gun crime in the year to September. The Offensive Weapons Bill will be introduced within weeks and will also make it a criminal offence to possess a corrosive substance in public without good reason. In addition, there will be a minimum custodial sentence for those convicted of a second offence of possession. :: 'You see people die, you see people bleed' The Home Secretary said: ""I see no good reason why any young person should be carrying a corrosive substance in the street. ""So I am also announcing that we will consult on extending stop and search powers to include acid. ""Stop and search is a vital policing tool and officers will always have the Government's full support to use these powers properly."" :: Tackling London's violent crime surge Rachel Keaton, from the National Police Chiefs Council, is the lead on corrosive substances. She said: ""We have seen an increase in violence. We've heard a lot about that recently, and individuals who are prepared to use violence are looking for whatever method they can. ""This at the moment is an area which is less regulated than others, such as knife crime, and we have seen an increase in the carrying of acid and the use of it in attack. ""It does have incredibly harmful effects on people."" :: Crime is rising up the agenda ahead of bellwether local elections Andreas Christopheros was attacked with acid on his doorstep in a case of mistaken identity in 2014. He told Sky News the new Government legislation does not go far enough, with most acid attacks being committed by over-18s. ""I have been pushing for some time now for a decanting legislation where it would become an offence to decant acid from its original well-labelled bottle into any other receptacle,"" he said. ""Therefore if you are caught on the stop and search powers you should automatically face jail time. That is a deterrent for people carrying acid. ""The situation we are in now where you can be caught twice and still you can get out of it if you have good reason - that doesn't add up. You don't need to carry acid."" :: Government 'cannot bury head in the sand' amid crime surge He continued: ""I don't believe that an age restriction is a big enough deterrent. ""I would still stand by the fact that sentencing is the ultimate deterrent. Anyone who crosses that line should be facing life with a minimum term of 20 years."" Other measures the Home Office is planning to introduce include stopping knives being sent to residential addresses when bought online, banning the possession of a knife on a further education premises, banning rapid-firing rifles, and updating the definitions of a flick-knife to reflect changing weapon designs. The serious violence strategy will also look at how social media can drive crime and look at preventative action, such as banning violent gang content, with Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick having warned that trivial online disputes can escalate ""within minutes"".

In an assault on the Kremlin's efforts to ""bury awkward facts beneath an avalanche of lies and disinformation"", Mr Johnson suggested the Labour leader ""has joined this effort"". Meanwhile, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid claimed Mr Corbyn ""has let the British people down"". Writing in The Sunday Times, Mr Johnson said: ""There is only one thing that gives the Kremlin succour and lends false credibility to its propaganda onslaught, and that is when politicians from the targeted countries join in the effort - whether wittingly or not - to create doubt where there is none and sow confusion where there is clarity. ""Sadly, I am driven to the conclusion that Jeremy Corbyn has joined this effort. Even now he cannot bring himself unequivocally to say that the Russian state was responsible. ""Every time he allows himself to speak freely on the subject he reverts to his comfort zone, his infantile leftist background of sympathy for any country, any movement, however unappealing, that is hostile to Britain."" Last week, Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn clashed after the head of the Porton Down laboratory, which analysed the nerve agent the Skripals were exposed to, told Sky News his scientists have not yet been able to prove where the military-grade novichok was made. The Labour leader claimed this left the Foreign Secretary with ""serious questions to answer"" after Mr Johnson had previously used an interview with German TV to claim staff at Porton Down were ""absolutely categorical"" and told him there was ""no doubt"" the source of the nerve agent was Russia. However, the Foreign Office insisted Mr Johnson was making clear that Porton Down were sure it was a novichok. In his newspaper article, the Foreign Secretary added: ""I am trying to resist the conclusion that Jeremy Corbyn is scrabbling around for some theory, any theory, that might exculpate the Kremlin. But I am finding it increasingly difficult."" Mr Johnson also claimed Russia has launched a ""pre-emptive campaign"" to discredit the pending verdict of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international watchdog, over the Salisbury attack. He likened Russia's demand to join the OPCW investigation to ""a suspected drunk driver demanding the right to use his own breathalyser"". Meanwhile, speaking on the Andrew Marr show, Mr Javid also joined the attack on Mr Corbyn as he spoke of ""misinformation and lies"" from Moscow. ""There's no doubt when it comes up against this issue with Russia that we're having, this very serious issue, Jeremy Corbyn has let the British people down,"" he said. With news the Skripals are no longer in a critical condition as they continue to be treated in Salisbury District Hospital, Mr Javid said it will be an ""important moment"" when they can give more detail on the incident. He added Russia has ""every right"" to ask for access to the Skripals in hospital, but added: ""I wouldn't be surprised if the Skripals don't want to meet the Russian authorities."" Responding to Mr Johnson's attack on the Labour leader, a party spokesman said: ""Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly said the evidence points to Russia being responsible, directly or indirectly, and that the Russian authorities must be held to account on the basis of evidence. ""Boris Johnson has made a fool of himself and undermined the Government by seriously misrepresenting what he was told by Porton Down chemical weapons experts. ""These ridiculous insults won't distract attention from the fact that he has clearly misled the public over vital issues of national security."""

The average loss represents an increase of more than a quarter on 2016, with most scams taking place during the summer and December, and related to airline tickets and accommodation bookings. Almost half of those affected said the fraud had a significant impact on their health or financial well-being, with some 575 victims claiming they were left in need of medical treatment or at risk of bankruptcy. Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents, said: ""The cost to them is not just financial. This crime causes very real disappointment and emotional distress."" Another spike is expected this summer, especially around sporting events like the World Cup, as fraudsters target peak holiday periods when it is harder for prospective tourists to find bargains. They catch people out through what Action Fraud have warned are ""increasingly sophisticated tricks"", including setting up fake websites, hacking into legitimate accounts, and posting bogus adverts online. Tony Neate, from Get Safe Online, advised: ""It can be quite tempting to get lured in by the offer of a cut-price flight or a deal on accommodation when you are caught up in the excitement of booking a holiday. ""Small steps can stop you getting caught out by a holiday scam, such as researching the company you are booking through, especially ones that aren't mainstream operators.

Police received a call at approximately 1.30pm on Sunday about two males - aged 38 and 42 - who were unresponsive at a semi-detached house. Metropolitan Police detectives are currently treating the deaths as ""unexplained"". The occupants of the rented multi-occupancy house are thought to have moved in just weeks ago. London Fire Brigade said units rushed to the scene. ""Two adult males, one adult female, one male child and one male infant have also been treated on site for carbon monoxide poisoning and taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service,"" a spokesperson said. A neighbour, who thought the victims were from eastern Europe, said: ""It's really shocking, very sad, the loss of life. It doesn't matter how it happens, but it's really sad."" The man went on: ""It's a rented property. I know the owner, I've met him. ""He was renovating just after Christmas. I don't know what they did inside, but I think they did carpets, painting."" The windows of the house were left open on Sunday evening. Another neighbour said the group had moved in three or four weeks ago: ""They are fairly new. As far as I know they're very quiet. ""They have only been here a short period of time, they have been very quiet. ""I have never spoken to them, they kept themselves to themselves.""

2018-04-08,The Justice Secretary has admitted responsibility for a decision which almost led to the release of black cab rapist John Worboys.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180409003114/https://news.sky.com/story/black-cab-rapist-john-worboys-near-release-is-my-responsibility-entirely-says-justice-secretary-11322589,"David Gauke decided not to challenge the Parole Board's decision to allow the serial sex attacker to walk free from jail after he had served 10 years in prison. There was widespread criticism when it emerged the panel had decided Worboys was safe to be freed - a move which was successfully blocked by two of his victims last month. Three High Court judges upheld the legal challenge by the women and ordered the Parole Board to reconsider its decision. Judges said the panel ""should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending"" and examined how ""the limited way... he has described his offending may undermine his overall credibility and reliability"". At the time, Mr Gauke said he stood by his decision not to challenge the Parole Board because the ""victims succeeded in a different argument"". But he has now said he shoulders blame for the row surrounding the attempts to grant parole to the convicted rapist. ""Clearly, things didn't go as they should have gone,"" he told The Sun on Sunday. ""Look, I made the decision. I accept responsibility, so I'm not hiding behind my advisers. It's my responsibility entirely."" He added: ""We're looking at all the rules. We must be sure with a particularly sensitive case we have people on the panel who can be sufficiently probing and ask tough questions."" His comments come a week after Nick Hardwick, who quit as chairman of the Parole Board as the court announced its judgment in March, said the Ministry of Justice was also ""at fault"" for failures in the Worboys case. ""I don't think the Secretary of State should resign. I do think the Secretary of State should, as I've done, accept responsibility for the mistakes that were made because that is the only way that things will be put right,"" he told the BBC. Mr Hardwick announced he was standing down after being told by Mr Gauke that his position was ""untenable"" in the wake of the High Court ruling. Worboys was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years after he was convicted for 19 offences - including rape, sexual assault and drugging - for attacks on 12 women. However, police believe he committed crimes against as many as 105 women between 2002 and 2008, when he was caught. The CPS decided not to overload the indictment against Worboys by prosecuting him for every attack. Dozens of women were told the prosecution would be more powerful if the court heard only the strongest cases. Mr Gauke said in March he would be instructing officials to issue new guidance that ""all relevant evidence of past offending should be included in the dossier submitted to the Parole Board, including possibly police evidence"". Parole Board rules will also be examined so victims can receive summaries of the decisions which have been made about offenders."
2018-04-08,"Police must increase their use of stop and search to help combat a rise in violent crime, a senior officer has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180409003114/https://news.sky.com/story/senior-police-officer-calls-for-increased-stop-and-search-to-combat-violent-crime-11320111,"Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, says that while the power may have been used too freely in the past, the ""pendulum has now swung in the opposite direction"". Ms Thornton's intervention comes amid concern about violent crime in London. The Metropolitan Police has opened 55 murder investigations this year. Among these is the investigation into the death of teenager Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, 17, who was killed in Tottenham on Monday. There were six non-fatal stabbings in the capital from Thursday night into Friday morning, and the number of suspected murders in March was higher than in New York. Ms Thornton appears to have the support of London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, who told the BBC on Saturday morning that ""stop-and-search based on suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon (is) going up"". There would be ""more arrests as a consequence of this intelligence-led stop-and-search"", he said. :: Ex-London gang member's warning: 'Further attacks could be coming' Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Ms Thornton says concern is not restricted to London. Knife crime has ""increased by 21% and gun crime by 20% on the previous year across the country"", she said. Nevertheless, chief constables tell her that officers are ""hesitant"" about using stop and search. Numbers have fallen, she says, from nearly three quarters in the last six years from 1.2m in 2010-11, to just over 300,000 in 2016-17. But while someone can only be stopped if officers have ""reasonable grounds to suspect that a prohibited article is being carried"", Ms Thornton says officers can feel ""overly cautious about using a power that has been subject to so much political debate"". It has been controversial because black people are more likely to be stopped. Ms Thornton says it is essential that those stopped are treated with ""dignity and respect"" and that body-worn cameras will ""increase the confidence of the pubic that powers are being used properly"". She also says the use of powers specifically aimed at gang violence, under which a senior officer can search anyone in a specific area, has been ""discouraged"". In London, the use of stop and search has dropped from 1,429 instances in 2011-12 to 23 in 2016-17. Barry Mizen, whose son Jimmy was killed in southeast London in 2008, told Sky News that ""if stop and search is the short-term answer to put a break on the amount of deaths and stabbings we are seeing then I think we all have to support that"". He added: ""But let's make it a short-term response. In the longer term, let's look to build a stronger community spirit."""

The British driver has since deleted the post, which showed five women wearing skintight jumpsuits with low necklines. It comes as the head of the Monaco race insisted 'grid girls' will be retained for the glamorous Mediterranean event on 27 May despite F1's new US owners Liberty Media axing them. President of the Automobile Club de Monaco Michel Boeri told the Monaco Matin newspaper he had a good relationship with the owners. He said: ""They understand that Monaco is not Spa, or Monza. We've had no problems with Liberty Media. Except for the grid girls issue. ""They'll be there on the grid, but they won't be holding any name-boards. They're pretty - and the cameras will be on them once again."" Monaco's move comes as Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Kozak said he wants to bring the models back for the Sochi GP in September. Mr Kozak, who is on the Russian grand prix organising committee, was quoted as saying: ""Here it should be adults. ""In all forms of motor sport there are girls advertising cars harmoniously and pleasantly. ""If we manage to reach agreement we plan to reinstate this tradition. After all, our girls are the most beautiful."" Grid girls, who hold a sign showing the name of the driver and their number at the start, were scrapped before this season began as their use was seen as outdated and sexist. At the first race of the new campaign in Melbourne last month, the new grid kids who accompanied the F1 drivers on the grid were karting and junior racing drivers."

Just a few weeks ago they were seemingly on the brink of death - so how did they survive?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180409003114/https://news.sky.com/story/miracle-recovery-how-sergei-and-yulia-skripal-survived-the-novichok-attack-11318984,"Alastair Hay, Professor of Environmental Toxicology at Leeds University, tells Sky News how they may have fought off the novichok nerve agent and managed a ""miracle"" recovery. :: But first, how dangerous is novichok really? ""The nerve agents are deadly,"" says Prof Hay. ""That's why they were chosen as chemical weapons. If you are exposed to a number of lethal doses then invariably it is fatal."" They block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme active in the nervous system. The result is involuntary contraction of all muscles, leading to cardiac arrest and asphyxiation. One of the scientists who helped make novichok has also told Sky News the substance was designed to do ""irreparable"" damage to the body.  :: Paramedics' quick treatment was crucial ""The Skripals have survived because they've had great medical care,"" says Prof Hay. ""I'm sure if the paramedics hadn't been on the scene as quickly as they were - and were able to ensure that the Skripals kept breathing - they wouldn't have survived."" The former spy and his daughter were reportedly frothing at the mouth when they were found on a bench in Salisbury last month. Those who made the first 999 call may have saved their lives. :: Did they get an antidote? There isn't a magic-pill ""cure"" for novichok poisoning - which makes treating it something of an inexact science. Prof Hay says ""doctors treating the Skripals would have been a bit in the dark about some aspects of their treatment"" because ""a very specific (antidote) to target the nerve agent and pull it off an enzyme that is blocked is just not known"". However, the toxicology expert says the father and daughter were likely to have been given one of several general antidotes. In this case, they appear to have helped. :: Sergei Skripal no longer in a critical condition :: The body 'flushes out' the nerve agent The precise way novichok is metabolised by the body is not fully known, says Prof Hay. However, if someone can be kept alive long enough after the initial poisoning, then the body stands a chance of ridding itself of the toxin. ""The nerve agents are eventually metabolised and excreted from the body,"" explains the professor. ""So it's highly unlikely there is any nerve agent present… after even a couple of weeks. ""We don't know too much about how these compounds are metabolised, but we do know they would eventually be excreted."" It is possible that Ms Skripal, 33, and her father, 66, were sedated to reduce stress on the brain while the body flushed out the nerve agent. ""Once they had some idea the nerve agent had probably been removed from the body, they could bring somebody out of sedation,"" explains Prof Hay. :: Body starts making the blocked enzyme  The enzyme suppressed by nerve agents such as novichok ""is eventually made again in the body"". That's what could have kickstarted the rapid improvement seen in the Skripals' health over the last few weeks. ""If you can keep someone alive eventually they will recover because the body makes up what was blocked by the nerve agent,"" says Prof Hay. ""And that happens increasingly, and that's why someone progresses and improves... The recovery of the enzyme in the nervous system would ensure that the recovery would continue and improve considerably. ""I'm delighted that appears to be the case with Yulia Skripal."" :: 'Saved by the NHS' ""In a way it is a miracle really,"" says Prof Hay. ""But also a testimony to our NHS: great doctors well-trained, looking after people appropriately and well. ""So it's the skill of our doctors that's ensured their survival. Without it, I'm pretty certain they would not have survived."""

There is growing speculation that Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, who is also recovering, may now be able to help the investigation. In a statement on its website, the Russian embassy said it was ""high time"" to arrange a meeting between Boris Johnson and ambassador Alexander Yakovenko to discuss ""the whole range of bilateral issues, as well as the investigation of the Salisbury incident"". It hoped the British would engage ""constructively and that such meeting is arranged shortly"", adding that ""interaction"" with the Foreign Office had been ""utterly unsatisfactory"".

At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York, Russia's envoy Vassily Nebenzia insisted there was ""no chemical weapons attack"", despite reports 70 people were killed and 500 injured in the city of Douma on Saturday. He added: ""Through the relevant channels we already conveyed to the US that armed force under mendacious pretext against Syria - where, at the request of the legitimate government of a country, Russian troops have been deployed - could lead to grave repercussions."" The US has said it will call for a new UN security council vote on a fresh inquiry into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. President Bashar al Assad's regime in Syria, which is backed by Russia, has denied being responsible for the attack. But Mr Trump earlier declared the US will ""know the answers quite soon"" over the Douma attack, as he suggested those to blame could be Syria, Russia, Iran or ""all of them together"". The US President also warned ""nothing is off the table"" when asked if he would consider military action. Meanwhile, Theresa May has suggested President al Assad is behind the attack. The Prime Minister said, if confirmed as a chemical weapons attack, it would be ""yet another example of the Assad regime's brutality and brazen disregard for its own people"". Mr Nebenzia claimed Russia is being ""unpardonably threatened"" by the US and UK with a tone that ""has gone beyond the threshold of what is acceptable, even during the Cold War"". He also claimed experts from the international chemical weapons watchdog should fly to Syria to probe the allegations, as he offered them protection in their work via Syrian authorities and Russian troops in the country. However, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, insisted America ""will respond"" whether the UN Security Council acts or not. She said: ""We are on the edge of a dangerous precipice. The great evil of chemical weapons use that once unified the world in opposition is on the verge of becoming the new normal. ""The international community must not let this happen. We have reached the moment when the world must see justice done. ""History will record this as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty, or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria. ""Either way, the United States will respond."" As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia can veto any substantive resolution. Mrs Haley added ""the monster"" responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria ""has no conscience"", as she told Moscow its ""hands are all covered in the blood of Syria children"". The UK's ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, told the meeting on Monday night that Britain believes the Syrian regime is responsible for the attacks. She said: ""It is truly horrific to think of victims, families sheltering underground when the chlorine found them."" Ms Pierce warned fellow nations on the UN Security Council they should ""dread what we risk happening, that chemical weapons become a routine part of fighting"". In a dismissal of Russia's recent suggestion of a new Cold War between itself and the West, the UK envoy said: ""This is not the Cold War, in the Cold War there was not this flagrant disregard for the prohibitions that are universal on the use of weapons of mass destruction."" ""It is not us who wants to alienate Russia, she alienates herself,"" Ms Pierce added. As she called for an independent investigation into the suspected use of chemical weapons, Ms Pierce said: ""We have nothing to hide, but it appears Russia and Syria and their supporters Iran do have something to fear."" After the Syrian regime used sarin nerve agent during an attack in Khan Sheikhoun in April last year, Mr Trump launched retaliatory missile strikes against a Syrian government airbase."

The Tory MP was grilled on the figure amid a political row over whether a drop in the number of police officers has led to a rise in violent crime. Ministers have insisted evidence does not suggest fewer officers is to blame for an increase in violence, which has come under scrutiny following a spate of stabbings and shootings in London. Asked by LBC Radio's Nick Ferrari whether she knew the current number of police officers in the country, Ms Atkins replied: ""Erm, yes, I think. Well, I know in London it's around about 31,000 officers."" Pressed on the figure for the whole country, Ms Atkins added: ""It's erm, you're testing me, Nick. I'm so sorry. ""It's, um, um, I'm not going to hazard a guess, I'm just going to front up and say I'm so sorry, that number has slipped my mind. I do apologise."" Told it would be a ""good idea"" to have the figures, Ms Atkins admitted: ""It would be."" However, the Conservative minister found support from Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner. ""Whilst I have a lot to take issue with in regards to policing in the UK and Government policy, this type of 'gotcha' interview does nothing to get to the nub of the issue of concern,"" she posted on Twitter. It is not clear which country Ferrari was referring to but he said the correct figure was 123,142. Figures released by the Home Office show there were 123,142 police officers in England and Wales at the end of March 2017. By 31 September, the figure had dropped to 121,929. This was the lowest number of officers since comparable records began in 1996. At the end of last year there were 17,256 full-time police officers in Scotland and there are currently 6,703 full-time police officers in Northern Ireland - the other two countries in the UK. However, as a Home Office minister, Ms Atkins is only responsible for police forces in England and Wales. During last year's general election campaign, in an interview with Ferrari, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott memorably failed to put a correct figure on the cost of Labour's promise to provide an extra 10,000 police officers on the streets. Earlier on Monday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd admitted she hadn't read a leaked Home Office report blaming police cuts for a rise in violent crime - on the day she was due to launch a strategy to tackle the trend."

Like her two previous pregnancies, they had to announce the news before she had reached the 12-week stage because she was suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness. Kate will be looked after by a similar team of doctors and nurses that helped her through Prince George's birth in July 2013 and Princess Charlotte's in May 2015. Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who holds the role of surgeon gynaecologist to the Royal Household, and Alan Farthing, a consultant gynaecological surgeon, will be present. He is also surgeon gynaecologist to the Queen. Kate carried out her last royal engagement on 22 March at the Olympic Park with her husband, and she was also seen at church in Windsor with the Royal family on Easter Sunday."

Harry and Meghan do not have formal links with the seven charities that they have chosen, but they do reflect their joint passions for causes including sport for social change, women's empowerment, conservation, the environment, homelessness, HIV and the Armed Forces. They have deliberately chosen a number fof smaller charities ""to be able to amplify and shine a light on their work"". :: Details of Harry and Meghan's cake revealed The seven charities they have chosen are CHIVA (Children's HIV Association), Crisis, the Myna Mahila Foundation, Scotty's Little Soldiers - a charity for bereaved Armed Forces children, StreetGames, Surfers Against Sewage, and The Wilderness Foundation UK. Information on how to make donations is on the Royal Family website, with links created to each of the charity's websites to make it as easy as possible to give money. Kensington Palace said the announcement was aimed at the general public to channel the outpouring of goodwill towards the couple. A palace spokesperson declined to comment on whether the couple had also sent out a formal gift list to the guests invited to the ceremony and reception, but said like other weddings invited guests would also have the option to make charity donations."

Users may need to log in. If you were affected, please email our technology reporter at aj.martin@sky.uk with the phrase ""Facebook Data Breach"" in the subject. Alternatively, you can click on the address above if your web browser supports automatically opening email clients. The changes - which are being introduced globally - come alongside an update to the News Feed which will show people what apps they use and what information is shared with those apps. Users are intended to be able to remove apps that they no longer want in an easier fashion, and as part of this process Facebook will be informing people if their data was shared with Cambridge Analytica. Affected users will automatically be presented with a notice that says: ""We have banned the website 'This Is Your Digital Life,' which one of your friends used Facebook to log into. ""We did this because the website may have misused some of your Facebook information by sharing it with a company called Cambridge Analytica."" The company's phrase ""may have misused"" seems to be constructed out of a sense of legal caution rather than its ignorance about whether particular users were affected. Those not affected by the Cambridge Analytica incident will simply read: ""You can go to the Apps and Websites section of your settings anytime to see the apps and websites you've used Facebook to log into."" It comes as Facebook's founder and chief executive is set to appear before two Congressional hearings this week, being grilled by the Senate on Tuesday and the House on Wednesday. Mr Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla had private meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Monday ahead of the hearings. He said in written testimony released by the House commerce committee: ""I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here."" Mr Zuckerberg added that Facebook is ""an idealistic and optimistic company"" that ""focused on all the good that connecting people can bring"". He continued: ""It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. ""That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy."" The 33-year-old added: ""We're in the process of investigating every app that had access to a large amount of information before we locked down our platform in 2014. ""If we detect suspicious activity, we'll do a full forensic audit. ""And if we find that someone is improperly using data, we'll ban them and tell everyone affected."" Two weeks ago, Mr Zuckerberg made an admission over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, saying: ""You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014. ""This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time."" Although the data was openly given by Facebook to the university researcher, the company has said that this was legitimate and that only its further transfer to Cambridge Analytics was illicit. The university researcher referenced, Aleksandr Kogan, allegedly developed This Is Your Digital Life, which allowed Cambridge Analytica to potentially unlawfully collect the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. Meanwhile, the company has warned that it is ""reasonable to expect"" that potentially every Facebook user has had their phone number and email address scraped from the site."

Billy Jeeves, 28, is being sought by police following the break-in that took place in Hither Green, southeast London, on 4 April. It is not thought that Jeeves is responsible for the death of his alleged accomplice. The suspect is said to have links to Orpington and Swanley in Kent and Cambridge. The Metropolitan Police also want to hear from people who might have seen his white Vauxhall Astra van, with the registration GU52 AXT, in the days before or after the burglary. The vehicle was found burnt out and destroyed in Star Lane in Orpington on Saturday 7 April. His alleged accomplice Vincent died after the break-in at Mr Osborn-Brook's property. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Harding said at the time: ""This is a tragic case for all of those involved.

Mr Osborn-Brooks' arrest sparked outcry from his neighbours. An online fundraising campaign to pay for his legal fees or to ""make his home more secure"" raised £7,609 in four days. Vincent has emerged as a career criminal who was wanted by Kent Police in connection with a distraction burglary at a pensioner's home in Farningham in November 2017. He was also on the force's ""most wanted"" list in 2013 over a burglary in Gravesend, Kent, according to reports. Police said one of the suspects who entered Mr Osborn-Brooks' home was armed with a screwdriver and forced his way into the kitchen, while the other man went upstairs. It is thought that a struggle took place between the pensioner and Vincent who was stabbed in the upper body. Police have not said what object was used to inflict the fatal blow. Both intruders are said to have fled after the altercation at the home in South Park Crescent, but Vincent collapsed on nearby Further Green Road. An eyewitness is said to have seen a man attempt to drag Vincent towards a van but eventually left the area without him. Vincent was taken by ambulance to a central London hospital where he later died."

""What this study shows,"" said Julian Kirby, lead plastics campaigner at Friends of the Earth UK, ""is that between 2004 and 2014 we've seen a 40 to 50% increase in plastic packaging, and we've seen a doubling in food waste. ""What that really casts into quite serious doubt I think is the argument that the food packaging industry use quite often which is that we need plastic to avoid food waste. ""Too often the industry is using plastic packaging in order to market food, to encourage us to buy more than we even need."" He added that plastic food packaging formats often drive food waste. ""Retailers wanting to top and tail runner beans as just one example, they're actually, in order to fit in with the plastic packaging, they're actually wasting more food than they would have done, so in that case plastic is causing food waste rather than reducing it."" The report adds that the harmful effects plastics have on the environment are often not properly estimated when policies are made on food packaging. ""The packaging industry and the European Commission are not practising sound decision making when it comes to food packaging,"" says Ariadna Rodrigo from Zero Waste Europe. ""Their methodology, which often ignore the impacts of plastic waste, results in conclusions that favour complex food packs which are impossible to reuse or recycle."" At one shop in North London, Planet Organic, they are trying things a new way, with a section called Unpackaged, where people can fill up their own reusable containers. The founder of Unpackaged, Catherine Conway, says more and more people are ditching the plastic. ""We set up the first zero waste shop in 2006,"" she told Sky News, ""and we've definitely seen a growing trend towards shopping without packaging but it's certainly been within the last three or four months since all of the campaigns about plastic in the oceans has really fired up the public imagination, and we've got a 40% upturn in sales since Christmas so the public's really on board with it now. ""Aside from the obvious environmental benefits, the great benefit of shopping unpackaged is you get the better value bulk price but you can purchase just the quantity that you need."" But the British Plastics Federation says there is still a role for their product. ""If you look around you plastic packaging ultimately makes food fresher, it's more hygienic and it's healthier,"" says Stephen Hunt, its Membership Services Director. ""But no one has more of a problem with plastic waste than the British plastics industry. ""We absolutely welcome this report and its findings, we'll look at it in detail and take it away and see what lessons there are to be learned."" The study acknowledges that plastic has a role to play in food packaging - but campaigners say now we know what damage it does to our planet, the industry should be challenging itself to find more sustainable alternatives - and they want the Government to put most single-use plastics on the scrap heap within five years. :: Sky Ocean Rescue is encouraging the public to cut down on their use of plastic"

It was the day after he had been convicted of harassing his ex-partner, 29-year-old Laura Williams. Burke, 31, from St Helens, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court on Monday to her murder and having an offensive weapon, namely a knife, in a public place. ""You perpetrated a cold-blooded execution in public for the purpose of revenge and in my judgment the killing was an act of unspeakable savagery,"" said Judge David Aubrey, sentencing Burke. ""This was a cowardly act of revenge designed to kill and did kill a totally innocent person in broad daylight in front of, and witnessed by, so many."" Prosecutor Gordon Cole QC said the killing was a pre-meditated and planned attack carried out in a ""totally ruthless way"". The court heard Ms Williams began dating Ms Hayes after the split with Burke. Burke had repeatedly threatened to kill himself or Ms Hayes because he held her responsible for the end of the relationship, according to his mother Louise McConnell. She alerted police to the threats he had made over the phone to her in January 2017. Police also warned him to stay away from Ms Hayes in May last year after he was accused of harassing her. Months later, in November, he was charged with harassing Ms Williams and convicted of the offence a day before the murder. He walked into the Chapel Street outlet and attacked Ms Hayes as she assisted a family. ""It was immediately apparent that there was blood flowing and that Cassie Hayes had had her throat cut,"" said the prosecutor. He remained inside the branch and was heard saying Ms Hayes ""had it coming for... what she had done to his family"". Mr Cole said: ""After this ruthless and chilling murder the defendant seemed to remain calm. He showed no emotion and remained seated whilst everybody else was reacting in one way or another to what had happened."" Police arrived to find Burke lying on the floor. He told officers: ""I was in court yesterday and I lost. It was either kill me or kill her, so I killed her. ""The only reason I wasn't still cutting her when you turned up was cos you'd shoot me and I didn't want to put you through that."" Ms Hayes later died in hospital. Her mother Tracey Hayes told Burke he should ""rot in hell"" for the murder. ""You took the most precious gift I ever had in my life, my beautiful daughter, my baby, in the most horrific way ever,"" she said in a statement from the witness box in court. ""You are the most evil, evil monster walking on this whole earth. You do not deserve to breathe fresh air."" She added: ""It has torn our lives apart... I hope you rot in hell you evil, evil coward of a man."""

However, in an interview with The Sun on Monday, the 33-year-old insisted there was something ""murky"" about the incident. He said: ""I ran into an office after being told by the staff of Selfridges that someone was there with a gun. Whether they were shooting into the air, or whatever, something happened that day - whether it was covered up, I don't know."" Really not sure what’s happened! I’m in the back office... but people screaming and running towards exits! British Transport Police (BTP), who were first to respond to rumours of a serious incident in London's West End, have since insisted there was no gunfire. In a statement, the force said: ""This caused a significant level of panic which resulted in numerous calls from members of the public reporting gunfire. I’m safe and in hotel with loads of people! So many different stories flying around just hope everyone is safe 🙏🏻 ""A full and methodical search of the station and Oxford Street was conducted by our specially trained firearms officers. ""During the search, officers did not find any evidence of gunfire at the station.""

I believe Olly Piers Morgan was among those who criticised Murs for his tweets at the time, warning the singer to be careful what he posted to his 8.4m followers. Commenting on Murs' interview on Monday, Morgan tweeted: ""Oh stick a cork in it @ollyofficial, for goodness sake... NOBODY. FIRED. A. GUN.

New living rooms have not been so small since the 1930s, when they were 16.01sq m, and bedrooms and kitchens have also shrunk. :: Record slump for housebuilding sector at start of 2018 The average master bedroom is now 13.37sq m, which are the smallest on record in the last 80 years, and there are fewer bedooms overall, too. Homes built in the last seven years have had less than three bedrooms each on average, with new properties in all other decades since the 1930s having had at least that many. Kitchens have also got smaller, at an average size of 12.61sq m, which is way down on the 15.37sq m enjoyed homeowners in the 1960s. :: PM's plan to turn closed-down high street shops into houses It all means that at 46.01sq m, today's houses are smaller than in any other decade, adding further fuel to a previous assessment by the Royal Institute of British Architects that too many homes in Britain are being built like rabbit hutches. The figures analysed by LABC Warranty are based on data from property sites Rightmove and Zoopla, with the study having begun with homes built in the 1930s due to insufficient records from prior decades. UK houses prior to the Second World War were relatively small, with the 1950s marking the start of a ""housing revolution"" due to increased demand for property. :: Councils failing to build enough new homes will lose planning powers The rate of growth continued into the 1960s, with complaints of shoddily designed tower blocks pushing developers towards the more straightforward, ""box-like"" homes that have maintained their popularity ever since. But house sizes have steadily declined since the 1970s, when living rooms were at their biggest and the average UK home boasted a greater overall number of bedrooms than ever. ""Today, Britain's houses have never been smaller,"" the firm's analysis concluded.""Compared to the previous decade, homes built from 2010 onward are over 4sq m smaller. Our analysis of the first seven years of the decade is continued regression."""

At 14 years of age I was receiving counselling for self-harm and depression. At 15 I was a troubled and struggling student, told by my educators that I would amount to nothing and by 18 I was working for £5 an hour trying to make ends meet. My story is just part of the wider north Belfast story. I could count on my hands, and yours, the number of school friends who dreamt of becoming doctors and nurses. The closest they ever got was a stethoscope under the Christmas tree or a zero-hour contract administering care in the community. Educational underachievement and academic selection or rather social selection has squashed the fingertips of those amongst us who dare reach beyond the rung of the class ladder. Low pay, a lack of employment opportunities and increasing non-flexible household bills, such as our rates and taxes, have resulted in poverty - food, fuel and financial. There are some in my community that have gone to bed at night on an empty stomach having given their children their last, and others forced to choose between heating and eating. More frustrating, however, is that the power to make a difference, to make a meaningful impact, rests with the Northern Ireland Assembly. An Assembly that, through the mechanism of mandatory coalition - which effectively forces a cross-community government, occupied by two ideologically opposite parties - has institutionalised sectarianism. Every election in Northern Ireland is now a show of strength for constitutional politics rather than a mandate for socio-economic change. Until such times the style and system of governance in Northern Ireland changes, we are, regrettably, condemned to the politics of fear and division and denied our hopes and ambitions."

However, opposition politicians branded Mr Johnson's wishes for an ""authoritarian leader"" as ""hugely inappropriate"", claiming he had ""embarrassed"" the UK Government. Campaign groups also expressed concern about ""anti-Semitic undertones"" to Mr Orban's campaign, the Hungarian leader's comments about Muslims, and the politician's attitude towards refugees and migrants. Meanwhile, international observers to Hungary's election highlighted a ""pervasive overlap between state and ruling party resources, undermining contestants' ability to compete on an equal basis"". The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said: ""Voters had a wide range of political options, but intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing constricted the space for genuine political debate, hindering voters' ability to make a fully informed choice."" :: Hungary 'strongman' predicted to target opponents after election win Posting on Twitter on Monday, Mr Johnson wrote: ""Congratulations to Fidesz and Viktor Orban on winning the elections in Hungary. ""We look forward to working with our Hungarian friends to further develop our close partnership."" Asked later on a trip to Sweden whether she had congratulated Mr Orban on his re-election, Prime Minister Theresa May appeared to offer a more luke warm assessment of the result. She said: ""The UK has a history of many years of cooperation with the Hungarians and we look forward to continuing to work with the Hungarian government in the future."" Mr Johnson was joined in congratulating Mr Orban by European Council President Donald Tusk, although the EU boss also added: ""During your renewed term as Prime Minister I count on you to play a constructive role in maintaining our unity in the EU."" As a strong eurosceptic, Mr Orban has frequently clashed with Brussels over attempts to force EU member states to take in quotas of refugees. Following Hungary's election, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage praised Mr Orban as ""the strongest leader in Europe and the EU's biggest nightmare"". France's National Front leader Marine Le Pen praised Mr Orban's ""great and clear victory"", while the Netherlands' anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders hailed the ""excellent result"". Responding to the Foreign Secretary's congratulations for Hungary's prime minister, Labour's shadow foreign minister Fabian Hamilton said: ""Given the already damning reports from international bodies on how this election was conducted, it seems hugely inappropriate for Boris Johnson to congratulate Viktor Orban on winning it."" Mr Hamilton added it was ""disgraceful"" Mr Johnson failed to mention the Hungarian government's ""shameful record on political freedom, women's equality and LGBT rights"" or Mr Orban's ""Islamophobic rhetoric"" or ""anti-Semitic attacks"" on Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. Mr Soros's philanthropy for his refugee charity became a frequent target for Mr Orban during his election campaign. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, claimed Mr Johnson had ""embarrassed the Government"" on the same day the OSCE had criticised Mr Orban's re-election. She said: ""We would expect the Foreign Secretary to take these allegations more seriously and work with colleagues across Europe to investigate whether the election in Hungary was fair."" The SNP's Stewart McDonald branded Mr Johnson's congratulations for the Hungarian leader ""shameful"", while Labour MP Peter Kyle, a supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""It seems there's not a single authoritarian leader Boris Johnson won't pander to in pursuit of his hard Brexit fantasy. Viktor Orban in Hungary is just the latest. ""This is all eerily reminiscent of the Boris Johnson's shameless sucking up to Donald Trump. ""It demeans our country and it's not worthy of his position as Foreign Secretary."" We respect the HU people's broad support for Viktor Orbán & Fidesz. We criticise him when needed, but we also congratulate him if he wins an election.The @EPPGroup has made its expectations & red lines very clear to the HU govt and will continue to do so. https://t.co/qG3wyt8yhK Meanwhile, the Board of Deputies for British Jews expressed concern at the ""anti-Semitic undertones"" of Mr Orban's campaign against Mr Soros, and the use of ""classic anti-Jewish tropes"" in his description of opponents. The organisation also condemned Mr Orban's comments about ""Muslim invaders"" and description of migrants as ""a poison"". Amnesty International warned against ""attempts to stoke hostility towards refugees and migrants"" under Mr Orban. The Hungarian Prime Minister's victory also sparked a row in the European Parliament. German MEP Manfred Weber, the chair of the European People's Party (EPP) group in the European Parliament, was challenged for offering his congratulations to Mr Orban by Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator. Mr Orban's Fidesz party is a member of the EPP, which is led by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker."

Here is his take on the issues facing the communities he works in, in Belfast. The big thing is drugs, there has been a big influx of drugs into the community, and when I was a teenager, that didn't exist. There obviously would have been people taking drugs, but it would have been a very small percentage. Then there were the security issues. You would have been faced with the British army, who were heavily armed on the streets, they would have been stopping you where you were going, and that doesn't exist now. But the social issues we are dealing with today are very similar. There is educational underachievement, lack of employment and deprivation. Things are much better, but a lot of that is quite similar. Today it's the drugs being taken, both prescribed and illegal. Then you have the mental health issues that are as a consequence of the conflict - a legacy of the conflict. It makes things a lot more difficult for young people in today's world. There's a thing called trans generational trauma, which is very prevalent in Belfast today. Belfast was a war zone, parts of Belfast more so than others, and the parts that would have been more affected would have been the socially deprived areas. Where I grew up in Ballymurphy, there were two instances where people were killed by the British army including Catholic priests, women and children. That is something that has an impact right across the community. Seeing bombs going off on a daily basis impacts on people. Back then, there was no counselling, no way of dealing with this, no mental health professionals as they're called today. That didn't exist during the conflict. So some people grew up and tried to deal with things in their own way and that impacts on future generations. If you witness something as a young mother or father walking down the street, it has an impact on you, you go home and you take that home with you. Some people are prescribed drugs by their doctors to deal with it, and if you're taking those drugs and drinking as a way of coping, that has a lasting effect on your family. In my opinion, the younger people that I work with across Belfast are not sectarian, they are younger than the Good Friday Agreement. Social media has broken down a lot of walls in young minds, so they interact online on a daily basis. But they don't physically interact that often because there are two separate communities, and we still have gates closing at the peace line. They are locked at the end of the night, and for the life of me, I don't understand why. There is no conflict or tension, but people find that they still need to be closed, so we are closing the walls in our minds and we're not prepared to open them, to interact with each other."

She was responding after a memo marked ""official - sensitive"" obtained by The Guardian found police cuts have ""likely contributed"" to a spike in violent crime. The document said criminals may have been ""encouraged"" by the reduction in police staffing numbers and a fall in prosecution rates. ""I haven't seen this document,"" Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday. ""There are a lot of documents that go round the Home Office. We do a lot of work in this area. ""Of course violent crime is a priority. I think that you do a disservice to the communities and the families by making this a political tit-for-tat about police numbers."" Ms Rudd later added: ""There are many different views that people have, which is why I commissioned this report to make a really detailed look at it."" :: London's year of horror so far London Mayor Sadiq Khan met with her that morning to discuss knife crime, which has risen significantly in the capital. He wrote on Twitter that she had ""some positive ideas on tackling violence"". But, he warned, ""there needs to be an acceptance that cuts to policing and youth services are a factor"". It comes on the same day Ms Rudd launches a £40m Serious Violence Strategy to tackle violent drug gangs and introduce prevention inventive. Ahead of the launch, she said the Government ""must do whatever it takes"" to make Britain's streets safe. Home Office minister Victoria Atkins defended police numbers, which have been cut from 143,734 to 123,142 in seven years. ""We have to be led by the evidence and we know that in the most recent spikes in knife crime, there were many more police on the streets,"" she told Sky News Sunrise. ""By the time we've got the police involved, it's too late. We need to be getting to these young people before they make that terrible decision to pick up a knife."" She added the rise in violent crime was ""incredibly complex"" and that ""we need to focus on all these factors, not just one or two"". More than 50 people have died in London since the start of 2018 as a result of crime. Ms Rudd delivered a speech at on Monday morning laying out her plan to put an end to the killings."
2018-04-09,Two men accused of being members of the Islamic State 'Beatles' cell have told Sky News there will be more IS-inspired attacks in Europe.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180410051405/https://news.sky.com/story/is-beatles-warn-of-more-attacks-in-europe-in-sky-news-interview-11324575,"Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, who were captured by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) earlier this year, issued the warning in a Sky News interview. They said they did not die on the battlefield because ""God decreed"" it was not their destiny. The men, both from west London, did not deny being members of the four man British IS cell, and seemed unrepentant. Speaking to Sky News at a detention facility in Kurdish-controlled northern Syria, they said they would wait for a court to prove they were directly part of the group that held 20 hostages and oversaw the beheading of seven. They did not specifically condemn terror attacks in London, Manchester, Paris and Brussels. The pair insisted they were not responsible for the violence carried out by Islamic State, in the same way that British people are not responsible for the actions of the UK military. Kotey described the videos issued by Islamic State of people being beheaded as ""propaganda"" and blamed Western media. When asked if they ever considered the beheadings to be ""not what they signed up for"", Kotey said: ""It's a bit like if a coalition airstriker carried out one of his airstrikes under collateral damage or the guise of it."" While the pair accepted being members of Islamic State, they said they joined for religious reasons. Elsheikh said: ""We are in no way justifying anything Islamic State did. It is not an obligation of me to justify or condemn. ""You being a British citizen, you don't turn around when Britain commits some war crime and say 'But I didn't sign up for this'. ""You didn't sign up for it, you were born British. Many people who became religiously aligned to the Islamic State, it is a default, just like being born into a certain country."" The group's ringleader Mohammed Emwazi, who became known as 'Jihadi John', died after a drone strike in 2015. :: Who are the IS fighters nicknamed 'The Beatles'? Kotey, described by neighbours as a ""reserved, polite boy"", is believed to have attended the Al Manaar mosque in Notting Hill with Emwazi after converting to Islam as a teenager. He left his London life and two children behind to travel to Syria in 2009. According to the US State Department, Kotey acted as a guard for IS and ""likely engaged in the group's executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding"". Elsheikh came to Britain as a child refugee from Sudan and lived in White City. Before his transformation into a jihadist, he worked as a mechanic and was described by his mother, Maha Elgigouli, as ""very clever"" and a ""nice boy"". The US State Department said he had ""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"" while serving as a jailer for IS."
2018-04-09,"Some of the largest rocks at Stonehenge were there long before humans and are not likely to have been moved to the location, an archaeologist says.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180410051405/https://news.sky.com/story/some-stonehenge-rocks-were-at-salisbury-plain-long-before-humans-11323822,"Archaeologists and antiquarians have for centuries wondered why Stonehenge is where it is and why the largest stones were dragged miles to a hillside on Salisbury Plain. It had been thought those stones, called sarsens, were brought from the Marlborough Downs, 20 miles (32km) away. Mike Pitts, one of only a few archaeologists to have excavated within Stonehenge, has found evidence that two of the largest sarsen stones have been there for millions of years. The largest megalith at the site, the heel stone, which aligns with sunrise on midsummer's day, is 75 metres from the centre of the stone circle and weighs 60 tonnes. Unlike the other large sarsens, it has never been shaped or dressed. Mr Pitts found a hole that was up to six metres in diameter while excavating beside the heel stone. The pit, which has been back-filled for years, was too large to have been the ""socket"" for a standing stone but big enough to have contained the huge boulder itself. It suggests the stone was lifted out of the hole and stood upright, but not brought from elsewhere. Another unexplained hole, found between two of the stones in the central 'horseshoe' of sarsens, poses the theory another of the largest stones - stone 16 - may have originated at the site. The two holes also appear to align with sunrise on the summer solstice. It had been thought that the sarsens did not occur naturally on Salisbury Plain but recent discoveries have dispelled that theory. Sarsen is a layer of super-hard sandstone that formed millions of years ago over the chalk that makes up the rolling hills of Wiltshire. During the Ice Age, the permafrost that covered Salisbury Plain repeatedly thawed and froze, shattering the layer of sarsen and over millions of years the stones sank below the surface leaving only a few fragments visible. Stonehenge contains other stones, called blue stones, which most archaeologists believe were brought to the site from Wales by humans. But, in a report published in the journal British Archaeology, Mr Pitts says it was the sarsens that made Stonehenge the centre of the prehistoric world, not the other way round. He said: ""The assumption used to be that all sarsens at Stonehenge had come from the Marlborough Downs. ""The idea has since been growing that some may be local and the heel stone came out of that big pit. If you are going to move something that large you would have to dress it before you move it to get rid of some of the bulk. ""That suggests it has not been moved very far. It makes sense that the heel stone has always been more or less where it is now, half-buried."""
2018-04-09,"Criminals are launching more online attacks against British businesses than ever before, the National Cyber Security Centre and NCA have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180410051405/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-hit-by-more-online-attacks-than-ever-before-11324135,"Nation states including Russia and North Korea have been behind attacks which affected the UK and other countries this year, while organised crime groups have also continued to harm the economy. Reporting on the cyber threat to business, the NCSC and the National Crime Agency highlighted how successful law enforcement and industry collaboration underpinned the UK's response to cyber attacks. ""Despite these very real threats to the nation's security, I am confident in the UK's ability to combat the attacks that we face every day,"" said the NCSC's chief executive, Ciaran Martin. ""The NCSC's aim is to make the UK an unattractive target to cyber criminals and certain nation states by increasing their risk, and reducing their return on investment."" :: What can the UK actually expect in a cyberwar? Launched on Tuesday at the start of the CyberUK summit in Manchester, the threat report has been published in collaboration with industry partners - with whom the NCSC and the NCA regularly collaborate. The report stresses that the private and public sector need to work together to handle cyber crime, and most experts in the cyber security arena have applauded NCSC's public engagement work with both citizens and businesses since it was founded in October 2016. Donald Toon, the director of the NCA's Prosperity Command, warned: ""Organisations which don't take cyber security extremely seriously in the next year are risking serious financial and reputational consequences. ""By increasing collaboration between law enforcement, government and industry we will make sure the UK is a safe place to do business and hostile zone for cyber criminals."" :: Parliamentary email service attacked The report runs through a number of case studies covering the WannaCry ransomware attack which involved malware designed by North Korean hackers which hit the NHS leading to the cancellation of almost 7,000 appointments. The report also detailed data breaches affecting Yahoo, Equifax, and Uber - as well as an unnamed telecommunications company - the largest of which were likely carried out by groups assessed to have links to state actors. Businesses are also warned about business email compromise, a form of phishing attack where a cyber criminal impersonated a senior executive and attempts to coerce the victim to send funds or information to the attacker. :: UK's critical infrastructure being targeted According to the report, Dublin Zoo was hit by such a scam last year after attackers intercepted legitimate supplier invoices and manipulated data on the documents to change payment details and account numbers. Dublin Zoo lost nearly £420,000 to the scam. The report also highlighted fake news and information operations, noting laws regarding platform liability mean that social media platforms do not share the liability for defamatory comments made by their users. This can present ""opportunities for those looking to cause reputational damage to a business"" according to the NCSC. :: Cryptojacking attacks surge 1200% The agency added it ""helped to combat cyber attacks on the UK electoral system by providing advice and guidance to local government and political parties, but does not have a role in policing content on the internet. ""In January, the UK government announced plans to set up a National Security Communications Unit, under the Cabinet Office, to counter disinformation by state actors and others."" At the time of that announcement onlookers expressed concern that the ""fake news unit"" would be used to address matters of legitimate political contention, which the civil service should remain neutral on."

He told an audience in Dublin: ""The Irish peace was born out of weariness of children dying and of lost chances. ""The further you get away from that, the easier it is to take the absence of bad for granted and to live in this purgatory we are in now."" Northern Ireland had endured 30 years of violence, leaving 3,600 people dead, when the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires in 1994. Four years later, the Belfast Agreement under-pinned the fragile peace by establishing a power-sharing administration in Belfast. But the devolved government collapsed 15 months ago and efforts to restore it have so far proven unsuccessful. The 1998 Agreement was the culmination of two years of political negotiation, chaired by President Clinton’s peace envoy, the former US Senator, George Mitchell. ""It was moment of elation, of exhaustion. I hadn’t slept for a couple of days. Negotiations had been very difficult and intense,"" said Senator Mitchell. ""It was a feeling of great relief. It was a very close-run thing. It wasn’t until the last moment we were able to get assurance that all of the parties would agree."" Former President Clinton and former Senator Mitchell will both receive the Freedom of the City in a ceremony at Belfast City Hall. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, the British and Irish Prime Ministers at the time, will also participate in events marking the anniversary. The people in Northern Ireland voted 71% ‘yes’ in a referendum on the ground-breaking compromise. Former Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and John Hume, former leader of the nationalist SDLP, won the Nobel Prize for peace for their part in it. Former President Clinton, who had called party leaders from the White House during the final hours of negotiations, said there had never been an agreement quite like it before. ""When it happened, people around the world had to stop and think, well I don’t want my children to grow up with all this violence either."""
2018-04-10,The bills of millions of British Gas customers are to be hiked by an average of £60 a year.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180411060111/https://news.sky.com/story/british-gas-energy-bills-to-rise-for-millions-11324916,"The biggest household gas and electricity supplier said it was ""reluctantly"" announcing the price increase of an average 5.5% for a typical dual fuel customer. British Gas owner Centrica blamed the price hike - which comes into force on 29 May - on rising wholesale and Government policy costs and said it would impact 4.1 million customers. It highlighted the smart meter roll-out, as well as schemes to reduce carbon emissions, and suggested ""all Government policy costs should be paid for in a fairer way such as through general taxation"". But Energy Minister Claire Perry said she was ""disappointed"" by the hike which she said was ""unjustified... when customers are already paying more than they need to"", and urged customers to switch suppliers. ""This is why government is introducing a new price cap by this winter to guarantee that consumers are protected from poor value tariffs and further bring down the £1.4 billion a year consumers have been overpaying the Big Six,"" she said. ""Switching suppliers will always help consumers get the best deal, saving £308 by switching from a default tariff offered by the Big Six."" British Gas announced plans in November to scrap the standard variable tariffs (SVTs) for new customers ahead of Government plans to impose a price cap on them. The controversial default tariff has no end date and is used by the majority of its customers. A failure to switch means almost half of UK households remain on standard variable tariffs (SVTs) - often the most expensive type of energy bill as customers default to them when fixed-cost deals expire. British Gas said it stopped selling SVTs to new customers on 31 March and all existing customers were being ""contacted to encourage them to choose one of our fixed-term deals"". The price hike will not affect the firm's 3.7 million customers who are on fixed-term contracts, prepayment meters or classed as vulnerable, it added. Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica, said: ""We fully understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers' household bills. ""The Government's energy policies are important but they are also pushing up customers' bills. ""We believe the Government should level the playing field so the customers of all suppliers pay a fair share of energy policy costs. ""We continue to encourage the Government to consider moving these costs out of energy bills altogether and into general taxation,"" he added. All energy firms have been facing pressure for some time over the way they treat their customers. In February, MPs called for a cap on the price of gas and electricity amid fears consumers are being ""ripped off"". A report by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Select Committee found customers were paying £1.4bn a year more than they should be. Draft legislation for an absolute cap on energy tariffs was published by the Government last year."

Alastair Hay, Professor of Environmental Toxicology at Leeds University, tells Sky News how they may have fought off the novichok nerve agent and managed a ""miracle"" recovery. :: But first, how dangerous is novichok really? ""The nerve agents are deadly,"" says Prof Hay. ""That's why they were chosen as chemical weapons. If you are exposed to a number of lethal doses then invariably it is fatal."" They block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme active in the nervous system. The result is involuntary contraction of all muscles, leading to cardiac arrest and asphyxiation. One of the scientists who helped make novichok has also told Sky News the substance was designed to do ""irreparable"" damage to the body.  :: Paramedics' quick treatment was crucial ""The Skripals have survived because they've had great medical care,"" says Prof Hay. ""I'm sure if the paramedics hadn't been on the scene as quickly as they were - and were able to ensure that the Skripals kept breathing - they wouldn't have survived."" The former spy and his daughter were reportedly frothing at the mouth when they were found on a bench in Salisbury last month. Those who made the first 999 call may have saved their lives. :: Did they get an antidote? There isn't a magic-pill ""cure"" for novichok poisoning - which makes treating it something of an inexact science. Prof Hay says ""doctors treating the Skripals would have been a bit in the dark about some aspects of their treatment"" because ""a very specific (antidote) to target the nerve agent and pull it off an enzyme that is blocked is just not known"". However, the toxicology expert says the father and daughter were likely to have been given one of several general antidotes. In this case, they appear to have helped. :: The body 'flushes out' the nerve agent The precise way novichok is metabolised by the body is not fully known, says Prof Hay. However, if someone can be kept alive long enough after the initial poisoning, then the body stands a chance of ridding itself of the toxin. ""The nerve agents are eventually metabolised and excreted from the body,"" explains the professor. ""So it's highly unlikely there is any nerve agent present… after even a couple of weeks. ""We don't know too much about how these compounds are metabolised, but we do know they would eventually be excreted."" It is possible that Ms Skripal, 33, and her father, 66, were sedated to reduce stress on the brain while the body flushed out the nerve agent. ""Once they had some idea the nerve agent had probably been removed from the body, they could bring somebody out of sedation,"" explains Prof Hay. :: Body starts making the blocked enzyme  The enzyme suppressed by nerve agents such as novichok ""is eventually made again in the body"". That's what could have kickstarted the rapid improvement seen in the Skripals' health over the last few weeks. ""If you can keep someone alive eventually they will recover because the body makes up what was blocked by the nerve agent,"" says Prof Hay. ""And that happens increasingly, and that's why someone progresses and improves... The recovery of the enzyme in the nervous system would ensure that the recovery would continue and improve considerably. ""I'm delighted that appears to be the case with Yulia Skripal."" :: 'Saved by the NHS' ""In a way it is a miracle really,"" says Prof Hay. ""But also a testimony to our NHS: great doctors well-trained, looking after people appropriately and well. ""So it's the skill of our doctors that's ensured their survival. Without it, I'm pretty certain they would not have survived."""

Here is his take on the issues facing the communities he works in, in Belfast. The big thing is drugs, there has been a big influx of drugs into the community, and when I was a teenager, that didn't exist. There obviously would have been people taking drugs, but it would have been a very small percentage. Then there were the security issues. You would have been faced with the British army, who were heavily armed on the streets, they would have been stopping you where you were going, and that doesn't exist now. But the social issues we are dealing with today are very similar. There is educational underachievement, lack of employment and deprivation. Things are much better, but a lot of that is quite similar. Today it's the drugs being taken, both prescribed and illegal. Then you have the mental health issues that are as a consequence of the conflict - a legacy of the conflict. It makes things a lot more difficult for young people in today's world. There's a thing called trans generational trauma, which is very prevalent in Belfast today. Belfast was a war zone, parts of Belfast more so than others, and the parts that would have been more affected would have been the socially deprived areas. Where I grew up in Ballymurphy, there were two instances where people were killed by the British army including Catholic priests, women and children. That is something that has an impact right across the community. Seeing bombs going off on a daily basis impacts on people. Back then, there was no counselling, no way of dealing with this, no mental health professionals as they're called today. That didn't exist during the conflict. So some people grew up and tried to deal with things in their own way and that impacts on future generations. If you witness something as a young mother or father walking down the street, it has an impact on you, you go home and you take that home with you. Some people are prescribed drugs by their doctors to deal with it, and if you're taking those drugs and drinking as a way of coping, that has a lasting effect on your family. In my opinion, the younger people that I work with across Belfast are not sectarian, they are younger than the Good Friday Agreement. Social media has broken down a lot of walls in young minds, so they interact online on a daily basis.

Despite tackling the claims, the writers came under fire from Kondabolu and other critics for appearing to brush off the furore. But others on Twitter backed the writers, saying the controversy was a ""non-issue."" The latest airing of The Simpsons featured Marge reading her favourite childhood book to her daughter Lisa. Marge realises the story is more racist and offensive than she remembered and tries to edit it as she reads.

Mr Kondabolu replied on Twitter: ""The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress"". He earlier tweeted: ""Man, I really loved this show. ""This is sad."" In “The Problem with Apu,” I used Apu & The Simpsons as an entry point into a larger conversation about the representation of marginalized groups & why this is important.

He wrote: ""I think the fact that they put this 'argument' in the mouth of Lisa's the character, the character who champions the underdogs and is supposed to be the most thoughtful and liberal, is what make this the most ridiculous (as in worthy of ridicule) and toothless response.""

In his documentary he said Apu was one of the only representations of South East Asians on US television when he was younger, and that other children imitated the Kwik-E-Mart owner to make fun of him. Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has been a part of the comedy series since 1990 and is voiced by white actor Hank Azaria, who mimics a strong Indian accent when playing the role.

French national Yohan Michael Tunka Buaga, 26, was arrested after the 18-year-old Briton told officers she was drugged and raped on 4 April. Buaga was charged with rape on Monday and is being held on the nearby island of Koh Samui. Police lieutenant colonel Piyapong Boonkaew said: ""The suspect has admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim, but he said that it was consensual and not rape. ""We are now investigating the case and waiting for forensic examination."" Crimes against tourists in recent years have sparked concern about safety in the country, which remains a popular destination for those on a budget and relies on tourism to boost its economy. Concerns over tourists travelling to Koh Tao were raised as early as August 2012 after British IT consultant Ben Harrington, 32, was found dead with both his watch and wallet missing.

The 12th series of the talent show begins at 8pm on Saturday 14 April, with regular judges Simon Cowell, David Walliams, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon all returning. Dec will present the live shows solo amid reports Ant has checked into rehab to fight his problems with prescription drugs and alcohol. ITV said in a statement on Tuesday: ""Dec will be hosting the live shows, which for the first time ever are coming from the Hammersmith Apollo, while Ant steps down from his TV commitments for now. ""We send Ant all our love. ""And we know that Dec will do a brilliant job."" The duo have fronted BGT since its inception in 2007. Ant was arrested in Richmond on Sunday 18 March after his Mini was involved a collision with two other cars. The 42-year-old is due to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on 16 April. He said in an interview with The Sun on Sunday: ""I feel like I have let a lot of people down and for that I am truly sorry. ""I want to thank my wife, family and closes friends for helping me through this really difficult time. ""I've spoken out because I think it's important that people ask for help if they're going through a rough time and get the proper treatment to help their recovery."" The Sunday paper reported that Ant's prescription drug and alcohol problems started after he had failed knee surgery two years ago. Dec presented Saturday Night Takeaway without his long term co-presenter for the first time on 31 March. The 42-year-old teased that he had ""twice as much work to do"" before introducing actor Stephen Merchant as the show's announcer, followed by a performance by singer Paloma Faith. Later in the show, he quipped: ""I'll have to do it myself, like everything else this week."" A decision was made for Dec to present the last two episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway on his own after Ant's drink-driving charge. Dec said the live recordings were ""tinged with sadness"" due to the absence of his TV partner of almost 30 years. The pair started out in children's drama series Byker Grove in the 1990s, and went on to pursue a music career under their character names PJ & Duncan."

He had asked South Africa's constitutional court to review both his jail term and murder conviction, but both requests were dismissed in a ruling. :: Reeva Steenkamp - the woman behind the name Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp dead on Valentine's Day 2013 after firing four times through the locked door of his bedroom toilet. He later claimed he believed she had been an intruder, and his lawyers have challenged both his prosecution and sentences in years of wrangling in the courts. It now appears the former star will serve his full term, with no further recourse to appeal available. ""This is the end of the road. There are no other legal options available,"" national prosecuting authority spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said. Pistorius was initially sentenced to six years in prison for culpable homicide - equivalent to manslaughter - after a high-profile court case. But the term was slammed as ""shockingly low"" by prosecutors, and was doubled to 13 years after being upgraded to murder on appeal last November. In making the ruling, the supreme court of appeal commented it was ""difficult on the evidence"" to accept Pistorius was ""genuinely remorseful"", noting contradictions in his account meant ""one did not know what his explanation is for having fired the shots"". South African legal expert Dr Llewellyn Curlewis told Sky News then that Pistorius would be ""ill advised if he intends to appeal"". Ms Steenkamp was a successful model and was training to be a legal advocate. She was 29 when she was murdered. Her family's lawyer said they ""always had faith in the justice system"" and had been focusing on the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation, established in her memory."

The incident caught on a ""harrowing"" body cam video. Officers responding to a report of a man banging doors in the flats found Buttigieg, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, on a landing holding two large blades. While a colleague held the door to the landing area closed, Pc Rhydian Jones tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to drop the weapons. Buttigieg refused and instead held the knife-points to his stomach as if to harm himself, while verbally threatening to harm the officers. Pc Jones, having failed to calm Buttigieg, opened the door but Buttigieg leapt out brandishing the weapons. The officer quickly pushed it shut, trapping him between the door and the frame. As Buttigieg struggled to get free, another officer Tasered him. The weapon did not incapacitate Buttigieg, who began to ""lash out"". He tried to stab Pc Jones on ""at least three occasions"", according to a statement from the force, before Pc Jones and Pc Ashley Cotton wrestled him to the ground, disarmed and subdued him. In the statement, Gwent Police said: ""Tony Buttigieg clearly appeared to be under the influence of either alcohol or some other intoxicating substance and was waving the knives around, making threats to harm himself and the officers. ""Despite officers' negotiations, he tried to gain entry to another flat and then began to push the knife into his stomach area in a self-harm action."" Buttigieg, who was originally charged with attempted murder, accepted a charge of attempted grievous bodily harm at a hearing in February. Police released details of the case as they honoured the officers who attended the incident. Detective Chief Inspector Nick Wilkie, who led the investigation, said: ""The body worn video footage is particularly harrowing to watch. ""Luckily, the outcome wasn't fatal but nonetheless it was traumatic for all those involved,"" he added. Pc Jones, Pc Gareth Marsh and Pc Ashley Cotton received a Chief Constable's Commendation for their bravery in responding to the incident."

Speaking from the Dwaynamics boxing gym, set up in honour of her son Dwayne Simpson, who was killed in 2014 while trying to protect his friend, she said it was high time grassroots organisations received effective support from the Government. ""The cries of the youth are not being heard to the magnitude that is needed,"" she told Sky News. ""Right now, it's not about blame, it's about supporting the grassroots work that is located within our communities."" Stop Our Kids Being Killed On Our Streets campaigner Stefan Brown echoed the sentiment. He said ""the community has got to do it ourselves"" because ""the MPs and Government (are) not listening to the real people, the people who are doing the real work"". He also branded the renewed response from authorities to violent crime as ""rubbish"", before urging the Government to focus on funding grassroots community groups. Taking part in the debate in Brixton, south London, former gang member Elijah Mochia said the stop and search approach to policing violent crime ""isn't helping"". He called for more investment in projects that can help young people. ""Young people are scared, they're traumatised, they're going through things they don't even understand,"" he added. ""We need to stop young people picking up the knives in the first place."" Imarni Robinson, 16, said it was vital to ""open up people's eyes to a young person's perspective"".

""This is the moment where we listen to young people and we do what they tell us to do,"" she said. Former Tory MP for Enfield Nick de Bois said the debate was about ""empowering"" communities already dealing with violent crime amid the ""dreadful"" spate of deaths in the capital this year. ""The challenge for us now is to seize the moment of public interest and concern,"" he said, before calling for a ""comprehensive approach"" to the issue. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Hewitt said there was a need for ""everyone to listen more"", adding that he did not agree that officers were ""not listening"". ""This problem is not going on everywhere, it's going on in certain communities and we have got to collectively listen to what these communities are saying,"" he said.

Pablo Perversi, chief innovation, quality and sustainability officer at Barry Callebaut, the cocoa producer which developed the ruby bar, said: ""I am very pleased to see the result of our partnership with Nestle, the iconic four-finger KitKat made with our ruby chocolate. ""Consumers across the world will be intrigued by the unique taste of this crispy delight."" Alex Gonnella, marketing director for Nestle's UK confectionery business, said: ""After the extremely successful launch of KitKat Chocolatory Sublime Ruby in Japan and South Korea, this is the first time the ruby chocolate will be available in an iconic four-finger format and we are sure that the ruby chocolate KitKat will be a great hit in the UK.

""Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household."" :: What it's like to get invited to Harry and Meghan's wedding A Government source said Theresa May wasn't expecting an invitation. The source added the couple's wedding venue is smaller than Westminster Abbey, where William and Kate got married, in the presence of various heads of state including then prime minister David Cameron. Despite Harry and Meghan's wedding being an important national occasion, the Prince is not in the immediate line of succession, unlike William. The nature of the guests and their choice of venue reflect Harry's position. As well as the Prime Minister and Mr Corbyn, Donald Trump and former US president Barack Obama are also absent from the couple's guest list. :: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding invitations revealed Instead, the couple have chosen 600 guests they have a direct relationship with to witness their marriage on 19 May at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel. Kensington Palace earlier named some of the members of the public chosen to join the crowds in the grounds of Windsor Castle on the big day.

The 37-year-old's loved ones returned to the scene on Tuesday to re-attach tributes to the fence, but they were torn down again within minutes. Now a woman claiming to be his aunt has tried to reason with those responsible. :: 'Burglar' death: Police release image of 'accomplice' Billy Jeeves ""If people leave the flowers alone, within a week they'll die, we will come here, clean this road, and go and never come back,"" she insisted. ""All we want is them just left until the flowers die and we will take them away."" Elvina Lee, who said she was Vincent's first cousin, had earlier described whoever pulled down the tributes as ""scum"" and called Mr Osborn-Brooks a ""murderer"" and a ""lowlife"". He was arrested after Vincent died from stab wounds having collapsed near the pensioner's house following reports of a burglary in the early hours of 4 April. Mr Osborn-Brooks was held on suspicion of murder, but has been released and told he will face no further action. The Met Police has also said its officers were not involved in taking any of the tributes to him down - nor has the force had to deal with a public order offence on South Park Crescent in relation to the memorial. The makeshift shrine has not been well received by neighbours, with one man who tore it down on Tuesday slamming it as an ""insult"". Referring to the tributes, he added: ""These need burning."" Another local, Theresa Webb, 43, said earlier they were ""inappropriate"" and in ""poor taste"". She said: ""You're thinking 'How long will it be up there?' I'm relieved it's down. There was 101 bouquets down there."" Some of the bunches of flowers were dumped in a nearby cemetery. A resident who gave his name only as Peter said: ""I wouldn't want them on my wall, anyway, put it like that. ""They were climbing the fence and everything yesterday. Will he ever be able to come back and live here? I doubt it. It's sad."" Nikita Hill, 39, who lives nearby, said: ""I don't think they should have put it outside his home. Maybe they could have done it further away. But he's got loved ones and family too so I understand why they did it."" The Met said that on the night of the incident one suspect, armed with a screwdriver, forced the homeowner into his kitchen when he discovered them, while his accomplice went upstairs. A struggle is believed to have followed and the intruder was stabbed in the upper body but it is not clear what object was used to inflict the fatal blow. A witness said an accomplice dragged Vincent towards a van before he then fled. Police have named 28-year-old Billy Jeeves as wanted in connection with the alleged burglary and want to hear from anyone who may have seen the van with the registration GU52 AXT. Jeeves' white Vauxhall Astra van was discovered burnt out and destroyed in Orpington, Kent, on Saturday. The damage to the makeshift shrine comes as Vincent's body was released back to his family by a coroner, and an inquest into the death was opened. The coroner at Southwark Coroner's Court heard that Vincent, from Lime Road in Swanley, Kent, was jobless and single at the time he died at University Hospital Lewisham. The Met Police's Detective Chief Inspector Simon Harding told the court: ""The facts are that on Wednesday April 4, two males including Henry Vincent entered a residential address at about 12.40am whilst committing a burglary. ""During this burglary the male resident stabbed Henry Vincent, that ultimately led to his death."" Several of Vincent's relatives were in court. The coroner told them: ""I know you are having a dreadful time, I am releasing the body to you."""

Having made a rapid recovery in recent days, Ms Skripal was discharged on Monday and taken to a secure location. The Russian Embassy in London said that if the Skripals were resettled in the USA, Australia, Canada or New Zealand and offered new identities - as reported - it would be ""another gross violation of international law"". A statement said: ""With a secret resettlement of Mr and Ms Skripal all opportunities to hear their version of the events of 4 March will highly likely be lost forever. ""The world, while having no opportunity to interact with them, will have every reason to see this as an abduction of the two Russian nationals or at least as their isolation."" Christine Blanshard, deputy chief executive and medical director at Salisbury District Hospital, said both Ms Skripal, 33, and her father, 66, have been responding well to treatment in the five weeks they have been in hospital. She said they have received ""round-the-clock"" care and revealed that nerve agents cause hallucinations and sickness. Mr Skripal is making good progress and will be discharged ""in due course"" but is recovering more slowly than his daughter, she added. They were contaminated by the nerve agent novichok, thought to have been smeared hours earlier on the handle of Mr Skripal's front door at his home on the edge of the city. His daughter had arrived the day before on a visit from her home in Moscow. For nearly a month both were in a critical condition, but they have recently made a remarkable recovery. Reacting to the news Ms Skripal had been discharged, the Russian Embassy in London tweeted its congratulations but said it needed ""urgent proof"" that she was not being influenced. We congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery. Yet we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will. Theresa May said: ""Obviously I welcome the fact that Yulia Skripal has been discharged from hospital and I wish her the best for her continuing recovery."" When contacted on Tuesday morning Viktoria Skripal, Yulia's cousin, said she had only just heard, via the story broken by Sky News, that her cousin had been discharged. She has since been trying to contact her. ""I think Britain will insist that she claims asylum,"" she said, adding: ""I've tried lots of numbers for her but have had no response. ""How should I feel? I'm feeling pleased that she's well enough to be released from hospital. ""So far my feelings are unclear because I have not seen her and nobody has seen her, we've just had information."" At the end of last week Viktoria Skripal said she had been denied a UK visa to travel to Salisbury to visit her cousin and uncle. At the end of March, Prime Minister Theresa May said doctors indicated the Skripals ""may never recover fully"" as she announced that more than 130 people in Salisbury could potentially have been exposed to the nerve agent. The poisoning of the Skripals prompted nearly 30 countries to expel more than 150 Russian diplomats in solidarity with the UK after it blamed Russia for poisoning the family. Russia has reacted by expelling other countries' diplomats and closing down the US consulate in St Petersburg - after Donald Trump closed the Russian consulate in Seattle"

His accuser, who first came forward in November 2016, said she had consensual sex with Olympic swimmer Ieuan Lloyd after meeting him in a club and going home with him. After Lloyd left his bedroom, she said Putland entered, sat on the bed and began taking his clothes off, but she told him she did not want to have sex again. The court heard she was lying on the bed wearing a skirt and top but no underwear, and that it was pitch black in the room. She said she told him they could not ""pass her around"" and that she said ""no"" and turned her head away. ""He lay on top of me and that's when I was saying 'you can't pass me around' and he said 'we're not passing you around',"" she added. Putland denied her accusations and insisted the sex they had was consensual. He told the jury of seven women and five men at Cardiff Crown Court that, after they were introduced by Lloyd, he chatted to the woman and she had been ""very friendly and happy and flirtatious"". He said it was her manner that led to him kissing her, her returning his kisses, and then to consensual sex and that the woman did nothing to make him think she was not consenting. In a statement after the five-day trial, the swimmer described the experience as ""horrendous"". ""I am obviously very relieved by the verdict and very glad to have been vindicated, but I can't say I am elated,"" he said. ""This has been going on for 18 months and the experience has been too horrendous, not just for me but my family, and especially for my mum."" In his closing speech, Christopher Rees, for the defence, told jurors: ""Bad sex is not rape. Regretted sex is not rape."" Pointing out there had been ""glaring inconsistencies"" in the woman's version of events, he added: ""She did not stop it. She did not call out to Ieuan Lloyd. She did not call out to anyone at all. From that you can infer that she did consent, or may have consented."" Initially, Putland faced two counts of rape but was cleared of one count following a trial in September last year. That jury failed to reach a verdict on the other count of rape relating to the same woman and the prosecution decided to proceed with a retrial."

At 14 years of age I was receiving counselling for self-harm and depression. At 15 I was a troubled and struggling student, told by my educators that I would amount to nothing and by 18 I was working for £5 an hour trying to make ends meet. My story is just part of the wider north Belfast story. I could count on my hands, and yours, the number of school friends who dreamt of becoming doctors and nurses. The closest they ever got was a stethoscope under the Christmas tree or a zero-hour contract administering care in the community. Educational underachievement and academic selection or rather social selection has squashed the fingertips of those amongst us who dare reach beyond the rung of the class ladder. Low pay, a lack of employment opportunities and increasing non-flexible household bills, such as our rates and taxes, have resulted in poverty - food, fuel and financial. There are some in my community that have gone to bed at night on an empty stomach having given their children their last, and others forced to choose between heating and eating. More frustrating, however, is that the power to make a difference, to make a meaningful impact, rests with the Northern Ireland Assembly. An Assembly that, through the mechanism of mandatory coalition - which effectively forces a cross-community government, occupied by two ideologically opposite parties - has institutionalised sectarianism. Every election in Northern Ireland is now a show of strength for constitutional politics rather than a mandate for socio-economic change. Until such times the style and system of governance in Northern Ireland changes, we are, regrettably, condemned to the politics of fear and division and denied our hopes and ambitions."

The regulator will look at how Save the Children dealt with the allegations and will find out if they were fully disclosed. The commission says it is concerned with whether Save the Children adequately reported the full extent and nature of the allegations, made between 2012 and 2015, by the end of 2016, when it demanded to see an independent review which trustees said was acted upon. Michelle Russell, director of investigations and enforcement at the Charity Commission, said: ""This inquiry centres specifically on how the charity handled complaints in 2012 and 2015 about senior members of staff, and how the charity responded to and managed public and media scrutiny of those events in 2018. ""We have questions that must be answered, and we need to hold the charity formally accountable for providing them in a clear and timely manner. ""Opening a formal investigation does not necessarily mean that we have concluded that there has been wrongdoing by the trustees of The Save the Children Fund. ""However, we do have questions that must be answered, and we need to hold the charity formally accountable for providing them in a clear and timely manner."" It emerged earlier this year that Save the Children had 31 allegations of sexual misconduct between April 2016 and March 2017, 10 of which were referred to police. A leaked report from 2015 suggested the charity's chairman Sir Alan Parker's ""very close"" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how allegations were handled. Mr Forsyth left the charity in 2016, having previously apologised unreservedly to the three women who made complaints. He quit as UNICEFf's deputy executive director this year when the allegations resurfaced after the Oxfam scandal. Mr Cox, who was Save the Children's chief strategist, admitted he had ""made mistakes"" which caused some women ""hurt and offence"".

A report will be published by the commission after the inquiry is completed."

New living rooms have not been so small since the 1930s, when they were 16.01sq m, and bedrooms and kitchens have also shrunk. :: Record slump for housebuilding sector at start of 2018 The average master bedroom is now 13.37sq m, which are the smallest on record in the last 80 years, and there are fewer bedooms overall, too. Homes built in the last seven years have had less than three bedrooms each on average, with new properties in all other decades since the 1930s having had at least that many. Kitchens have also got smaller, at an average size of 12.61sq m, which is way down on the 15.37sq m enjoyed homeowners in the 1960s. :: PM's plan to turn closed-down high street shops into houses It all means that at 46.01sq m, today's houses are smaller than in any other decade, adding further fuel to a previous assessment by the Royal Institute of British Architects that too many homes in Britain are being built like rabbit hutches. The figures analysed by LABC Warranty are based on data from property sites Rightmove and Zoopla, with the study having begun with homes built in the 1930s due to insufficient records from prior decades. UK houses prior to the Second World War were relatively small, with the 1950s marking the start of a ""housing revolution"" due to increased demand for property. :: Councils failing to build enough new homes will lose planning powers The rate of growth continued into the 1960s, with complaints of shoddily designed tower blocks pushing developers towards the more straightforward, ""box-like"" homes that have maintained their popularity ever since. But house sizes have steadily declined since the 1970s, when living rooms were at their biggest and the average UK home boasted a greater overall number of bedrooms than ever. ""Today, Britain's houses have never been smaller,"" the firm's analysis concluded.""Compared to the previous decade, homes built from 2010 onward are over 4sq m smaller. Our analysis of the first seven years of the decade is continued regression."""

The National Cyber Security Centre's CYBERUK conference in Manchester will be the backdrop for the launch of a £9m fund to increase cyber capabilities and tackle organised crime online, focusing on those who use anonymous and hidden online services for illegal activities such as hacking, people trafficking, selling weapons and drug dealing. The Home Secretary is expected to address the threat of the dark web, calling it a ""dangerous place where anonymity emboldens people to break the law in the most horrifying of ways"". She will add that it is ""a platform of dangerous crimes and horrific abuse"". Earlier this year, prolific paedophile Matthew Falder was convicted of 137 offences committed on the dark web, including encouraging rape, sexually exploiting children, blackmail and voyeurism. This conviction was part of a four-year investigation by the National Crime Agency's specialist cyber teams alongside security and intelligence agencies. Ms Rudd will say: ""The world of cyber is fast-developing and we need a fast-developing response to match. One that recognises that it is the responsibility of everyone in the UK to fight the evolving threat. ""Whilst criminals plot and hide behind their screens, their actions have real-life consequences for their victims."" More than £5m will be used to support the police to establish dedicated cyber crime units in every police force. Currently, only 30% of police forces have the minimum capability to pursue cyber crime. Forty specialist regional cyber ""protect"" officers provide a link between local and national authorities across the UK, delivering security advice to people and businesses based on the latest National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) threat analysis. On Tuesday, the NCSC and the National Crime Agency (NCA) reported that British businesses are suffering more cyber attacks than ever before with criminals having access to ""nation-state grade capabilities"". The funding announcement is part of £50m of newly allocated money from the National Cyber Security Programme and existing Home Office budgets. It will also be used to develop a ""cyber app"" for Metropolitan Police officers for improved advice and victim care."

Speaking after a suspected chemical attack in the city of Douma that reportedly killed 70 people and injured 500, Mr Blair said those responsible must be ""held to account"". He told Sky News: ""If you don't respond to the use of chemical weapons against civilians then obviously we're ignoring what the international community has said. ""Which is that this is unacceptable and those that use such methods should be held to account and we're giving carte blanche for the use of chemical weapons. ""So I think it's a pretty simple equation. ""Even if we take the action - which I think we will have to do - it doesn't solve the longer-term question of what happens in Syria."" Pushed on whether ministers should call a Commons vote on joining any US action, Mr Blair said: ""They don't strictly need one and we're not talking about ground action, this would be action in support of military intervention by the US."" Britain has left open the option of airstrikes in Syria. Mrs May said on Monday that if President Bashar al Assad was found to be behind another chemical attack, ""the regime and its backers, including Russia, must be held to account"". Meanwhile, speaking on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, Mr Blair admitted the road to peace in Northern Ireland still had ""big challenges and big problems"". ""If you compare where we are to where we'd be in an ideal world, we haven't got there yet,"" he said. ""But if you compare it to where we were during The Troubles, I think it would be strange and foolish to say anything other than that the GFA had a beneficial impact and we should try and preserve it."" Soon after, Labour's shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner was forced to apologise for calling the agreement a ""shibboleth"". He clarified he ""absolutely"" did not mean to give the impression it was ""in any way outdated or unimportant""."

The supercentenarian, whose exact age is 112 years 259 days, married his wife Hatsuno in 1931 and the couple had five children. Mr Nonaka has taken the Guinness World Records title as the oldest man on Earth after Spaniard Francisco Nunez Olivera died in February aged 113. Receiving his certificate, Mr Nonaka, wearing a knit cap and a kimono-style jacket, flashed a smile and posed for a group photo with his family, making a victory sign with his right hand. He dug into a cake bought for the celebration and said it was ""delicious"". His granddaughter Yuko Nonaka said: ""He needs a wheelchair to move but he is in good condition. ""He loves eating any kinds of sweets - Japanese or western style. He reads newspapers every day and often soaks in the hot springs."" Guinness World Records is currently investigating possible contenders for the title of oldest living person as no one has been recognised since Violet Brown from Jamaica died in July 2017, aged 117. Japan is well-known for the longevity of its people and has been home to several oldest title holders, including Jiroemon Kimura, who died in June 2013 at the age of 116. The country boasts around 68,000 people aged 100 or older, the Japanese government said in 2017."
2018-04-10,A west London council has become the first in the UK to implement an exclusion zone outside a local abortion clinic. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180411060111/https://news.sky.com/story/pro-life-campaigners-banned-from-protesting-outside-abortion-clinic-11326004,"Ealing Council says the 100 metre safe zone, around a Marie Stopes clinic in Mattock Lane, Ealing, will protect the clinic's users from harassment by pro-life campaigners. Clinic staff say their clients have, for years, been harassed and intimidated by groups who stand on the public footpath outside the facility. After a lengthy consultation, Ealing councillors said their own findings corroborated the clinic's claims. Sky News was given access to the clinic's incident log which catalogued intimidatory behaviour by pro-life campaigners over the course of a year. On one occasion, in January 2017, staff noted that protesters told a client she would ""be haunted by her baby"" and that ""God will punish you"" if she had an abortion. Another entry, from April that same year, noted: ""Client very tearful after being called a murderer as she walked into the clinic."" The buffer zone campaign was launched by Ealing residents who formed a lobby group, Sister Supporter. Founder Anna Veglio-White told Sky News: ""We're not a pro-abortion group, we're not an anti-abortion group, we're an anti-harassment group. And this is about women being stopped whilst accessing a legal healthcare facility."" Ealing Council will use a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) to implement the safe zone. PSPOs are normally used to ban anti-social behaviour, such as drinking alcohol, from public spaces like playgrounds and areas around schools. Like other PSPOs in the borough, the Marie Stopes clinic order will be introduced for three years with a review to be held after six months. Pro-life supporters gathered outside of the council building on Tuesday night, to pray and protest against the council's decision. Alina was on her way to have an abortion when she was stopped by pro-life campaigners, who gave her a leaflet with information and offers of support. She told Sky News it was the first alternative to an abortion she had been offered and that she was grateful they had intervened. She said: ""There are so many women who have an abortion who can't live with it. We have to think about them. No one presented them with another option."" Birmingham and Portsmouth councils are among those that have already begun their own consultations on the use of PSPOs around their local abortion facilities. At government level, the Home Office is looking at whether legislation should be created to legally enforce buffer zones around abortion clinics nationwide. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said: ""While everyone has a right to peaceful protest, it is completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harassed or intimidated simply for exercising their legal right to healthcare advice and treatment."""

Care minister Caroline Dinenage told Sky News: ""Some of the money goes to provide the limbs, but some of it goes to research and development so we can find newer, easier ways of doing it with less cost, but actually make it easier for those in the future. ""Sport and activity are so important to any child’s health, well-being and confidence, and today’s announcement should help many more disabled children to fulfil their sporting ambitions."" At the Prosthetic Rehabilitation Centre at London's Stanmore Hospital, two youngsters who have benefited from the program told Sky News how it felt to be fitted with activity blades for the first time. Ollie Bauert, 10, who is without the lower portion of his right leg, said: ""It made a big difference because I could finally have fun with all my friends and not have to worry about staying behind."" Masie Catt, who is eight and requires prosthetics for both legs, said: ""When I got it on I was happy because I felt a big difference. It's springy and I could just run fast."" A £1.5m investment to the fund was previously announced in September 2016, with £750,000 funded through the National Institute for Health Research to create a Child Prosthetics Research Collaboration. The aim is to bring together leading national research centres with capabilities in child prosthetics with key experts from the NHS, industry, and clinical academia. Also at the launch was Paralympic gold medallist Richard Whitehead MBE who told Sky News: ""As an elite athlete I have the technology to perform at the highest level, but what I'm doing today is providing the young people with a little bit of inspiration and hope, and obviously showing my medal around what is possible. ""And I'm getting some inspiration from these youngsters as well."" There are an estimated 2,000 children in the UK who are without limbs, for a variety of reasons. So far, 220 of them have applied for help through this scheme and all have been accepted. It is hoped that many more will now come forward for an activity prosthetic that could help transform their lives."

There are estimated to be around 2,000 US troops in Syria. Ms Sanders added: ""We are determined to completely crush ISIS and create the conditions that will prevent its return. In addition we expect our regional allies and partners to take greater responsibility both militarily and financially for securing the region."" Earlier, the French President said he had persuaded Mr Trump to stay in Syria and launch airstrikes as punishment for the alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma. ""Ten days ago President Trump wanted the United States of America to withdraw from Syria. We convinced him to remain,"" Mr Macron said during a two-hour grilling on French television. ""I assure you, we have convinced him that it is necessary to stay for the long-term,"" he added. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al Assad has said the Western airstrikes in his country were based on ""lies"" by the UN Security Council. Speaking to a group of visiting Russian politicians, he said the US, Britain and France had waged a campaign of ""lies and misinformation"" against Syria and its ally Russia. The two nations deny using chemical weapons in the attack on Douma in the suburbs of Damascus last Saturday, which triggered the US-led decision to carry out strikes on Friday night. Mr Assad was described by the Russians as being in a good mood, a day after the airstrikes destroyed three chemical weapons facilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to his fellow Syrian ally, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, on Sunday night. A Kremlin statement said they agreed ""that this illegal action is adversely impacting prospects for political settlement in Syria."" Mr Putin stressed ""it will inevitably entail chaos in international relations"" if violations of the UN charter continue. Mr Rouhani accused the US ""and some Western countries"" of not wanting Syria ""to reach permanent stability"". However, they agreed to not allow ""fire of a new tension"" to flare up in the region. Mr Trump defended his use of the term ""mission accomplished"" to describe the operation in Syria. He said the mission was ""so perfectly carried out, with such prescion, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term 'Mission Accomplished.' ""I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!"" Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin will announce on Monday further economic sanctions on Russia for supporting the Syrian regime. She said it would affect companies ""dealing with equipment related to Assad and any chemical weapons use"" as Russia needed to feel the consequences for ""protecting"" the Assad regime. US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it is now the international community's obligation to act in Syria as ""Russia has failed to do so"". She told Sky News: ""The United States, Britain and France - responsible allies - are showing Bashar al Assad that he has to stop. ""We will defend the rights of his people even if he won't do it himself."" As world leaders and their representatives set out their views on the strikes, hundreds of people in Turkey, Iraq, India and Cyprus protested against the mission. Left-wing activists in Cyprus took to the road outside the gates of RAF Akrotiri, the British military base on the island where jets involved in the operation took off from. Socialist Unity Centre of India activists in Kolkata burned an effigy of Donald Trump as they protested the strikes. In Istanbul, protesters outside the French Consulate demonstrated against the ""imperialist aggression in Syria"" while those in Baghdad carried Syrian flags as a show of unity as they burned US flags. The leader of Hezbollah, the Lebonon-based, Iranian-backed militant group, said the strikes have strained international relations and could totally ""torpedo"" UN peace talks in Geneva. Hassan Nasrallah said the strikes were ""limited"" and were a recognition of the strength of the ""resistance axis"" - referencing the alliance between Syria, Iran and Hezbollah. In the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon criticised the strikes. Mr Corbyn called for a War Powers Act to make it necessary for MPs to approve future British military action, with the Opposition leader criticising Theresa May's decision to carry out the strikes without parliamentary approval. He also called her justification on humanitarian grounds ""legally debatable"". Mr Cable told Sky News it was a ""mistake"" to launch the strikes ""without getting proper political endorsement"", adding the move was a ""mistake of judgement"" borne out of political weakness. And Ms Sturgeon questioned the Prime Minister saying there was ""no practical alternative"", saying she was not sure if that ""is really the case"". She called for a full parliamentary debate on the matter. Foreign Minister Boris Johnson defended the strikes, saying Britain had a duty to show Syria had not ""got away"" with using chemical weapons. Theresa May will go before the Commons on Monday to answer questions about her decision, after insisting there was no ""alternative path""."

Writing on Twitter, the Dover MP said he would now be able to defend himself after learning what the claims were. He denied any wrongdoing when news of the claims came to light and said he did not know what the allegations against him were at the time. It was some 5 months before I was made aware of what the “allegations” against me were. Now I know, I am completely confident I will be able to prove my innocence. I will continue to defend myself vigorously for as long as necessary. The alleged female victims were interviewed by police earlier this year, according to The Sunday Times. Officers also spoke to Mr Elphicke under caution on 12 March, which he claims was the first time he was made aware of the nature of the allegations. ""It was some 5 months before I was made aware of what the 'allegations' against me were,"" he wrote. ""Now I know, I am completely confident I will be able to prove my innocence. I will continue to defend myself vigorously for as long as necessary."" The MP told the Mail on Sunday he had made ""repeated requests"" to learn the details of the allegations following his suspension. ""I met with the police on March 12 (and) was then told for the first time the nature of the allegations made against me,"" he said. ""Until that point I had no idea whatsoever of the allegations which had led to my having the Conservative whip suspended in early November 2017, despite my repeated requests for clarification to both the chief whip and the police."" The Metropolitan Police confirmed an interview had taken place but did not give any further details. A spokesman said: ""On 12 March, 2018, a man was interviewed under caution, by appointment. The interview was in connection with an ongoing investigation being carried out by the Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command into alleged sexual offences.

A woman called Shashi Singh was arrested on Sunday, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) spokesman RK Gaur said. It follows the arrest, on Friday, of politician Kuldeep Singh Sengar, from Uttar Pradesh state, who has been accused of raping the 17-year-old. The girl's family, who tried unsuccessfully for nearly a year to get police to register their case, claimed Singh had taken their daughter to see Sengar, and allegedly stood guard while he raped her. Police only brought the case after the girl tried to burn herself alive outside the state leader's residence. Her father, who had been in police custody, died the next day from injuries he sustained in an alleged beating. The rape and murder of the eight-year-old in Jammu and Kashmir state in January made national headlines. The child was kidnapped, drugged and repeatedly raped over five days, including inside a Hindu temple, before being strangled and beaten with a rock. Communal tensions have been heightened by the crime. Although Jammu and Kashmir is India's only Muslim-majority state, the Jammu region in the south, where the crime took place, is Hindu-dominated. Muslim activists, who see the case as a crime against their community, have demanded action. But some right-wing Hindu groups have claimed the accused were unfairly charged. Eight people - all Hindus - have been arrested over the killing, including four police officers and a minor. In a country where 40,000 rape cases are reported every year, campaigners say victims are reluctant to go to the police. Prime minister Narendra Modi has promised justice for the victims, while India's women's minister has called for the death penalty for child rapists."

Speaking after about 1,000 opponents of Britain's exit from the European Union staged a ""people power"" rally in London, he said: ""They are people who believe in the common interest, who have always had at heart the needs of everyone, not just an elitist few. ""That's what this campaign is about."" Sir Patrick claimed another public vote was needed because the British public was given a ""false"" opportunity in 2016. He said the original referendum campaign was ""fed by disinformation, untruths and outright lies that created an atmosphere that was toxic"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is steadfast in his belief that Britain can live long and prosper outside the EU, riffed on another one of Star Trek's most famous lines in his response to Sir Patrick. He said Brexit would allow Britain to ""boldly go"" to areas it has neglected in the search for new free trade deals. The People's Vote campaign is demanding the British public be given the final say on the deal secured by Prime Minister Theresa May, rather than MPs in Parliament. It draws together nine grassroots campaign groups in a joint effort for a vote. An online poll from Opinium published to mark the launch suggests more than half of the British public (52%) backs a vote on the final deal, with 31% opposed. Speaking at the launch event, Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""It may seem like the odds are stacked against us as a movement, but fighting for what you believe in is never easy. ""We are short on time, but we have people power on our side. Together, we are on the verge of something extraordinary."" Another one of those attending was Green Party MP and co-leader Caroline Lucas. ""We will be making the case in Parliament, but this is too big and too important to be determined solely by politicians,"" she said. ""So, it's up to you.

2018-04-15,"The UK's largest producer of chillies has said consumers have no need to be concerned about the world's hottest pepper as long as it is eaten ""correctly"", after it emerged that a man was hospitalised after taking part in an eating competition.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180415224105/https://news.sky.com/story/no-complaints-over-worlds-hottest-chilli-pepper-11331885,"Salvatore Genovese, who grows the Carolina reaper on his seven-acre farm in Bedfordshire called Love My Chillies, told Sky News: ""I'm not a doctor or a scientist - I'm a chilli grower. We grow them, pack them, and sell them. ""We have sold, in the past couple of years or so, over half a million Carolina reapers and I have never had any knowledge or any complaint of anyone having to be hospitalised."" His response comes after doctors warned of the medical effects of eating mega-hot chillies competitively following a British Medical Journal report which highlighted the case of man in the US who had taken on the Carolina reaper in an eating contest. Health professionals found that arteries in the 34-year-old's brain had temporarily constricted, causing neck and head pain, including so-called ""thunderclap"" headaches. The headaches are described as ""a blinding pain"" that come in waves - and can reach their most intense within 60 seconds. The journal said a CT scan five weeks after the episode in 2016, however, showed that the affected arteries had returned to their normal width. The authors of the article said that eating cayenne pepper has been linked to the sudden constriction of the coronary artery and heart attacks and said ""it is plausible that our patient had reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) secondary to the Carolina reaper"". Mr Genovese said the Carolina reaper should be cooked and eaten ""correctly"". ""It's not really designed to... just plonk it in your mouth and eat it... I would never do that and I wouldn't recommend it. ""Just cook with it, make a curry, infuse it slowly take it out if you want to afterwards, and get the rich flavours from that super-hot chilli. ""The way I always put it, is treat it like salt. You're not going to take a handful of salt and put it in your food and say 'wow I've got a wicked salt kick'. Just use small amounts, use accordingly. ""If you want to do a chilli contest that's different. I think that's what this guy was doing. He probably had a dozen Carolina reapers."" The Carolina reaper was recorded by the Guinness World Records as the hottest chilli pepper in the world last year. It is rated at up to 2.2 million Scoville heat units with tests showing an average of 1.64 million units. Shahina Waseem, dubbed the ""UK Chilli Queen"", is unbeaten in 23 chilli eating competitions, and says in her experience ""the pain doesn't last"". ""For me personally, things are very much in the moment. So while I am eating it I am suffering and this is after an hour and a half of 'burn time',"" she said. ""You start from mild to the hottest chillies, you go through 13 or 14 rounds, and then you end up with the Carolina reaper and then it does get you. ""For me the pain would last an hour or two hours max. I have heard of people suffering afterwards - for me it's not so bad afterwards but during the competition I feel like I'm dying."" Consultant dietician Lucy Jones agrees that chillies we buy in supermarkets are eaten sensibly but people need to be aware of the risks of extreme eating challenges. ""There are certain pre-existing health conditions, which make eating chillies more dangerous - these are ultra-hot chillies we are talking about now - and that's things like asthma,"" she said. ""And that's because there have been case reports of it actually inducing asthma attacks so people really need to think about their situation and their own health background when they decide whether they want to take on these food challenges."""
2018-04-15,Jeremy Corbyn has called for legislation which would make it necessary for MPs to approve future British military action.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180415224105/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-war-powers-act-in-wake-of-syria-airstrikes-11332225,"The Labour leader made the call for a War Powers Act as he hit out at the Government's justification for launching airstrikes on Syria in the wake of a chemical weapons attack. Britain, along with the US and France, hit chemical weapons facilities in a series of raids on three sites during the early hours of Saturday after civilians were targeted in Douma. Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted the military action was ""right and legal"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the world had ""finally"" said ""enough is enough"" as he defended the ""proportionate"" strikes. But Mrs May's decision not to seek a vote in Parliament beforehand has provoked criticism. :: Live: Syria airstrikes reaction:: Johnson defends strikes on 'barbaric' Assad:: Analysis: PM faces political fallout Mrs May will address the Commons on Monday, allowing MPs to scrutinise the Government's case. It is not clear if there will be a vote on the military action. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Corbyn said there should have been a vote ahead of the strikes. ""I think Parliament should have a say in this and I think the Prime Minister could have quite easily done that,"" he said. ""She took a decision sometime last week that we were going to work with Macron and Trump in order to have an impact on the chemical weapons establishment in Syria. ""She could have recalled parliament last week - it is only the Prime Minister who can recall parliament - or she could have delayed until tomorrow when Parliament returns. There is precedent over previous interventions when parliament has had a vote. ""I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name."" Mr Corbyn also questioned Mrs May's assertion that the airstrikes were justified on humanitarian grounds, saying this was ""legally debatable"". The Labour leader said that if Britain wants to ""get the moral high ground around the world"" it has to abide by international law on military action. When pressed on his own position, Mr Corbyn said he could ""only countenance involvement in Syria if there is UN authority behind it"". He added: ""If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. ""That surely would save a lot of lives."" The stance sparked criticism from opponents, who pointed out that Russia has consistently vetoed UN efforts on Syria. Some said the stance would effectively give Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""veto"" over Britain's foreign policy. Truly Jeremy Corbyn is now Putin's ""useful idiot"". As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia has a veto. So Corbyn is saying he will only back action that Putin supports. https://t.co/pDrYc30QiD Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister told Sky News it was a ""serious mistake"" for the UK's role in Syria to be altered without Parliament's backing. Nicola Sturgeon called for a full Commons debate as well as a commitment that any further action must be authorised by MPs.

He told the BBC: ""There is no proposal on the table at the moment for further attacks because so far - thank heavens - the Assad regime has not been so foolish to launch another chemical weapons attack. ""If and when such a thing were to happen then clearly, with allies, we would study what the options were."" On Mr Corbyn's War Powers Act suggestion, David Lidington said there were ""no plans"" for legislation."

The Prime Minister is due to ask all the 52 leaders at the meeting to sign up to the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance set up to help developing Commonwealth countries research and improve waste management. So far four Commonwealth countries, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu and Ghana, have joined the UK in the alliance. The Government said £25m of the fund is available to help researchers investigate the issue of marine plastic from a scientific, economic and social perspective. Another £20m has been earmarked to curb plastic and other environmental pollution generated by manufacturing in developing countries and prevent it seeping into oceans. That leaves £16.4m which will be spent on improving waste management at a national and city level to stop plastics entering the water. The Government pledged to match public donations to tackle plastic waste through the UK Aid Match up to a total of £5m. Outrage on plastic waste was triggered after the documentary Blue Planet II, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, highlighted the scale of the problem. The PM said: ""This week we will look closely at how we can tackle the many threats to the health of the world's oceans, including the scourge of marine plastic pollution. ""As one of the most significant environmental challenges facing the world today it is vital that we tackle this issue, so that future generations can enjoy a natural environment that is healthier than we currently find it. ""The UK public has shown passion and energy in the fight against plastic waste, and I believe the Commonwealth is uniquely placed to further this transformative action. ""It is a unique organisation with the strength and the commitment to make a difference."" She added: ""If we stand together, we have the opportunity to send not only a powerful message to the world, but also to effect real change."" Britain, which is co-chairing the event with Vanuatu, will ask Commonwealth nations to follow the UK's lead in banning microbeads and slashing the number of single use plastic bags. WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said: ""This alliance, and the leadership the UK Government is showing through the Commonwealth, demonstrates that we're committed to being part of a global solution. ""Two billion people around the world lack access to effective waste collection, so much of the plastic they use ends up in our oceans.

2018-04-15,The consumer goods giant Unilever is facing an investor backlash at its annual meeting next month over millions of pounds in bonuses handed to its top two executives.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180415224105/https://news.sky.com/story/unilever-faces-backlash-over-polman-bonus-11329209,"Sky News has learnt that the advisory service run by the Investment Association (IA)‎, the fund managers' body, has issued a ""red-top"" warning in relation to Unilever's remuneration report. The alert threatens to embarrass the owner of Dove shampoo and Marmite at a time when relations with investors are being strained by the company's decision to relocate its headquarters to the Netherlands. ‎City sources said on Friday that the IA ""red-top"" related to the decision by Unilever's remuneration committee to award annual bonuses worth €2.3m to Paul Polman, its chief executive, and €1.1m to Graeme Pitkethly, the chief financial officer. The bonuses were the maximum possible under the company's existing remuneration ‎policy, which is being overhauled this year. The IVIS service is understood to have been angered by that decision because Unilever's underlying sales growth for last year fell short of the target figure by a small margin. Ann Fudge, the non-executive director who chairs the‎ remuneration committee, wrote in the annual report that the duo's bonus awards reflected their ""very strong personal commitment"" and ""leadership"". Their bonuses contributed to total pay packages‎ worth €11.7m and €3.1m for Mr Polman and Mr Pitkethly respectively. It was unclear on Friday whether major institutional investors planned to vote against the remuneration report at Unilever's AGM on May 2. Shareholder advisory agencies, which can influence large percentages of public company investors‎' voting decisions, are also piling the pressure on Unilever's board. In its report issued on Friday, a copy of which has been seen by Sky News, ISS recommended that investors oppose Unilever's remuneration policy - a resolution which is voted on every three years and is binding. ISS‎ said it continued to have concerns about increases to fixed pay and the annual bonus potential, justifying investor opposition. A big protest vote on boardroom pay at Unilever would embarrass Mr Polman, who has claimed in the past to be ""embarrassed"" by his remuneration and suggested that he would work for nothing. It would also underline strained relations with the City as Unilever waits to discover whether it will remain a constituent of the FTSE-100 index when it scraps its UK joint headquarters. The company, which also owns Lynx deodorant and the ice cream brand Magnum, said no jobs would be affected by the move and that its decision had not been influenced by Brexit. Unilever employs 7,500 people in Britain, more than twice the size of its Dutch workforce. Mr Polman plans to retire next year after a decade at the helm. ‎Last year, he unveiled big changes including the sale of its spreads business in the wake of an unsolicited £115bn takeover approach ‎from Kraft Heinz. The IA and Unilever declined to comment."

Mr Batten, who is also UKIP's MEP for London, said he would now concentrate on restoring the ""party's fortunes"" after it saw its vote share in the polls slip from a high of more than 25% in the European elections in 2014 to less than 2% in 2017. He also pledged to resign after 12 months to allow a full leadership election to take place. He said in a statement: ""I received the backing of all three UKIP Lords, our major donors, our MEPs, our London and Welsh Assembly Members, and party activists and members from all over the UK. ""I would like to thank everyone for their support, and am grateful for the trust and confidence placed in me. ""For the next twelve months, I will concentrate on doing all I can to restore the party's fortunes. A very good start has been made and the party is now on a sound financial footing. ""However, we need to get UKIP back into the political fight. We have made a very good start with the 554 UKIP candidates standing in the English local elections. ""Don't pay any attention to our enemies who are crowing that our candidates numbers are 75% down on what they were last time. ""The truth is that instead of 554 candidates, the number would have been zero if you had not all backed me from the 17 April onwards and the party had disintegrated. Instead, let's celebrate the 554 and help them all we can. ""My role as Interim Leader was to ensure the immediate survival of the party. That has been done. However, we must move on and progress."" UKIP lost control of its only major council in February when the party's local leader resigned. Before he became the official leader, Mr Batten was forced to defend his description of Islam as a ""death cult"". Diane James was the first to replace Mr Farage after a vote but, before taking up the role, she announced she would not be doing so as she claimed she did not have the authority. Paul Nuttall followed Ms James but lasted seven months before he resigned when he failed to win a seat in the General Election. Steve Crowther was acting leader until Mr Bolton was elected."

Mrs May drew a link with the nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, telling a news conference: ""We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere."" The Prime Minister was asked if the strikes had been a warning to Russia and responded: ""The action that took place last night was an action which was focused on degrading and deterring the operational capability and the willingness of the Syrian regime to continue to use chemical weapons. :: LIVE: US, UK and France launch airstrikes on Syria ""There have been many instances when we have seen them using those chemical weapons. ""But I believe it should also be a message to others that the international community is not going to stand by and allow chemical weapons to be used with impunity."" Mrs May said chemical weapons had ""all too often"" been used in recent times. ""I think it is right that the international community has come together and said we will not accept this,"" she added. The airstrikes on Syria were carried out in a joint operation between the UK, US and France. US President Donald Trump announced the ""precision strikes"" on Friday night. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the military action against Syria was ""legally questionable"" and makes real accountability for war crimes less likely. He said: ""Bombs won't save lives or bring about peace. This legally questionable action risks escalating further, as US defence secretary James Mattis has admitted, an already devastating conflict and therefore makes real accountability for war crimes and use of chemical weapons less, not more likely."" Mr Corbyn said he would be pushing for the Government to release the legal advice it received ahead of the strikes. On Saturday afternoon the Government published advice it said it had received, which said the UK ""considers that military action met the requirements of humanitarian intervention"". It said the Syrian regime has been using chemical weapons since 2013, killing nearly 1,000 civilians and injuring hundreds more which ""constitutes a war crime and a crime against humanity"". :: Syria airstrikes: What did military action hit? The document said it was ""highly likely"" the regime would seek to use chemical weapons again despite the international law prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.. It said the UK and its international partners have continually tried to alleviate the humanitarian suffering caused by chemical weapons use in Syria at the UN Security Council but have repeatedly been blocked by the regime and its allies, naming Russia. ""Since 2013 neither diplomatic action, tough sanctions, nor the US strikes against the Shayrat airbase in April 2017 have sufficiently degraded Syrian chemical weapons capability or deterred the Syrian regime from causing extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale through its persistent use of chemical weapons,"" it said. ""There was no practicable alternative to the truly exceptional use of force to degrade the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capability and deter their further use by the Syrian regime in order to alleviate humanitarian suffering."" The action was highly targeted, necessary and proportionate to alleviate humanitarian distress and ""therefore legally justifiable"" it added. ""The action was the minimum judged necessary for that purpose."" Mrs May has been heavily criticised for not recalling Parliament to put the plans to a vote and will go before the Commons on Monday to answer questions about her decision, insisting there was no ""alternative path"". However, there have been plenty of MPs, including some Conservatives opposed to action in 2013, who have publicly backed the prime minister. Mr Trump said Syria's use of chemical weapons in Douma was a ""significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime"". After the announcement, the US said strikes had been launched at 9pm EST (2am BST) and had destroyed important infrastructure at three sites connected with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme. General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the allied strikes destroyed three main chemical weapons facilities. :: Syria airstrikes: What did military action hit? They included a scientific research facility in the Damascus area, a chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs and a third location that contained both a command post and a chemical weapons equipment storage facility in the same area, the US military added. Russia reacted with fury to the attacks with President Vladimir Putin denouncing the airstrikes as an ""act of aggression"". In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr Putin said Moscow was calling an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. He said: ""Russia in the most serious way condemns the attack on Syria where Russian military servicemen help the legitimate government to fight terrorism."" Moscow's ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov warned that ""such actions will not be left without consequences"". The Syrian government, which denies the chemical attack, said the strikes were ""brutal, barbaric aggression"" by western powers and vowed to continue to ""restore security and stability in all corners of the country"". State news agency SANA, quoting an official in Syria's foreign ministry, said: ""The barbaric aggression will not affect in any way the determination and insistence of the Syrian people and their heroic armed forces. ""This aggression will only lead to inflaming tensions in the world and threatens international security."" French president Emmanuel Macron said: ""Our response has been limited to the capabilities of the Syrian regime relating to the production and use of chemical weapons. ""We cannot tolerate the trivialisation of the use of chemical weapons, which is an immediate danger for the Syrian people and for our collective security."""
2018-04-15,The father of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has told Sky News he would consider talking to his son's killers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180415224105/https://news.sky.com/story/stephen-lawrences-father-neville-says-he-has-forgiven-his-sons-killers-11332237,"Neville Lawrence said he has decided to forgive the gang of racists who murdered the 18-year-old in Eltham, southeast London, on 22 April 1993. Mr Lawrence has embraced Christianity in recent years and said: ""I wanted to be baptised and in order to be baptised you have to forgive people who have done you wrong. ""It has been a heavy load to carry around and hatred is not a nice thing to have. ""In order to free myself of carrying this burden around I decided to forgive all of these boys who racially-motivated murdered my son. ""You can forgive somebody whether or not they want it."" Up to six thugs attacked Stephen and his friend Duwayne Brooks. David Norris and Gary Dobson are serving life sentences after being convicted of murder, but the rest have evaded justice. Mr Lawrence said he would be prepared to meet the killers: ""If by any chance these people repent for what they have done and ask to see me I would consider going and talking to them."" The 76-year-old said he plans to spend the 25th anniversary of his son's death in church. The initial investigation into Stephen's death was dogged by incompetence, racism and alleged corruption. Mr Lawrence and his ex-wife Doreen met Nelson Mandela two weeks after Stephen died. He said: ""When I met him for the first time I was so inspired by his persona and the way he talked to people. ""He made it clear to us that in his country it was something that they go through every day, but never in his wildest dreams did he think that something like that would happen in a place like Britain. ""Meeting him gave me the courage to do some of the things I have done over the years. ""Other families came to my rescue as well. When you are going to go on a journey, if somebody else who has been through it comes and talks to you they can give you an idea what you're going to face down the road. ""What those families did for me I can't even start to explain to people. I decided, after a certain amount of time, on my journey, that if anybody who had the same kind of experience wanted me to come and talk to them then I would do that. ""I also decided that I would go into schools and universities and talk to the younger generation."" Parts of the UK, especially London, have seen a surge in violent crime this year - with nearly 60 murders in the capital since the start of 2018. Mr Lawrence, who talks to young people about the perils of carrying weapons, said: ""Right now with the violence, and the knife crime violence, it is even more urgent now that I talk to these youngsters and explain to them the pain and the suffering they inflict on families. ""It is a life sentence and something that will never be served. I've been serving a life sentence for the last 25 years and I will go on serving that until the day I die."" If young people are left with nothing to do they will get involved in activities that are ""devastating"" to their community, Mr Lawrence warned. He and his former wife, who is now Baroness Lawrence, have campaigned for more than 20 years to get justice for their son. The bungled case led to a major public inquiry and eventually a change in the law to allow Dobson to be tried twice for murder. The Met has admitted the investigation is unlikely to progress without new information. But focus on the case will continue with an inquiry into undercover policing, probing claims that police moles infiltrated campaign groups supporting the Lawrence family. Mr Lawrence's solicitor Jocelyn Cockburn said: ""I am humbled by his message of forgiveness to mark the anniversary of his son's death. ""Neville can feel proud of what he has achieved in the intervening years."" Mr Lawrence believes that, in death, his aspiring architect son has become a ""legend"".

In a statement to the Commons, she will also set out her justification for the decision - arguing that it was done to alleviate further humanitarian suffering in Syria caused by chemical weapons attacks. :: Trump wants US troops out of Syria 'as soon as possible' The PM will say: ""UNSC-mandated inspectors have investigated previous attacks and on four occasions decided that the regime was indeed responsible. ""We are confident in our own assessment that the Syrian regime was highly likely responsible for this attack and that its persistent pattern of behaviour meant that it was highly likely to continue using chemical weapons. :: Johnson defends strikes on 'barbaric' Bashar al Assad ""Furthermore, there were clearly attempts to block any proper investigation, as we saw with the Russian veto at the UN earlier in the week. ""And we cannot wait to alleviate further humanitarian suffering caused by chemical weapons attacks. ""Let me be absolutely clear: we have acted because it is in our national interest to do so. ""It is in our national interest to prevent the further use of chemical weapons in Syria - and to uphold and defend the global consensus that these weapons should not be used. ""For we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere."" A source close to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has described the Prime Minister's announcement of an emergency debate as ""very odd, panicky and weak"". Labour argue that the Government has been trying to block the debate all weekend and, as the party in government, has the power to set Government business without asking the Speaker for an emergency debate. ""They are in government. They can set the agenda,"" said the source. Mr Corbyn will also call for a War Powers Act which would oblige prime ministers to consult Parliament in the future before committing forces into the field of action. The SNP has told Sky News it would support the act. In a statement, the party says there are fresh questions over the Government's legal justification and the need to allow the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) to fully investigate the chemical attacks in Douma last weekend. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: ""It is welcome that the Prime Minister has finally caved in to our calls for a full parliamentary debate on the escalation of military action in Syria. ""But a debate and vote should have happened last week before any change to the role of UK forces in Syria. Indeed, we have been calling for Parliament to be recalled since last Wednesday. ""This extraordinary u-turn is an admission that the Prime Minister made an error in failing to recall Parliament and is yet more evidence of how ill considered this military action is - and just how far Theresa May's actions have been dictated by presidential tweet. ""A clear precedent was set in 2015 ahead of the targeted strikes against Daesh - yet the Prime Minister decided to ignore this before launching airstrikes. ""Theresa May needs to realise that she leads a minority government and that Parliament must have a voice in matters of such importance before actions like that are taken. ""This debate is an opportunity to ensure that there is no future change in the role of British military in Syria without Parliament's approval."" But in her statement the Prime Minister will point to the international backing which the UK and its allies have since received. Mrs May will say: ""Over the weekend I have spoken to a range of world leaders, including Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Gentiloni, Prime Minister Trudeau, Prime Minister Turnbull and European Council President Donald Tusk. ""All have expressed their support for the actions that Britain, France and America have taken."""

Originating in Chicago and slang for automatic weapons, it's been labelled ""demonic"" and ""malign"", and often contains references to gangs, guns, knives and drugs. Headie One, an artist whose music has been singled out by police as being part of the problem, believes this blame game is too simplistic. ""I feel like Amber (Rudd), she needs to open her eyes a little bit. If she is going to ban drill music, she needs to ban all genres of music...they are not addressing the root of the problem, they are just playing around. I feel like they are being silly. Only a fool would say that drill music is the root of the problem of violence in the capital - don't make no sense."" He said his music, which contains references to knives and guns, is not glamorising a violent lifestyle, it was reflecting his reality. ""I grew up on a council estate, that was reality... artists in other genres talk about things that are reality to them - they wouldn't be blamed for an outright problem that is going on around us right now."" Guvna B is a double Mobo award-winner who agrees that blaming the music isn't the answer. ""I feel like drill music is an expression of art and my main issue with focusing on drill music is yes the lyrics are really horrific but it's still a byproduct of a root issue."" He wants to use his music to send a positive message and to inspire young people but believes its crucial inner-city areas like the one he grew up in in east London are also given more help. He thinks the Government has to connect more with communities and provide more opportunities going forward. ""The main problem is we all realise we are responsible for our actions but our starting line is different... you feel really underprivileged and that no one really cares. If you're from this estate you don't see past this estate. You can be a musician, a rapper, a footballer, those are your likely chances of making something of yourself. So a lot more opportunities in different spheres (are needed)."" Guvna B's new album Hands Are Made For Working includes tracks which address the issues facing youth culture today. He is also performing in the summer at the Allo Mate Live Festival, an urban music festival and arts development programme which he has organised for the second time. The aim, he says, is to bring together some of the best current talent and to inspire young people with positive lyrics and clean content."

""As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption we are experiencing is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business,"" he said. ""That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside.

In a statement, WPP said: ""The previously announced investigation into an allegation of misconduct against Sir Martin has concluded. The allegation did not involve amounts that are material."" Sir Martin, who acquired the small Kent-based firm in 1985 and turned it into the world's largest marketing services group, will be treated as having retired, the company confirmed. Chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman until a new chief executive has been appointed. Sir Martin denied any wrongdoing after the allegations surfaced earlier this month, but said he understood the company had to investigate it.

It is the third day of the hearing in which the 77-year-old singer is seeking damages against the BBC in London's High Court over coverage of a police search on his penthouse apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014. The search was part of an investigation into a historical child sex abuse allegation. Mr Fenwick said Mr Johnson had ""clearly stated"" he had information from Operation Yewtree - the Met Police investigation into sexual abuse allegations launched in 2012 - and would publish it immediately unless he worked with him. With that in mind, Mr Fenwick said he came to an arrangement to notify the reporter when the force ""was ready to take further action"" in order to avoid the investigation being prejudiced by the publication of a story ahead of the raid. Mr Fenwick said he also feared premature disclosure of the raid may give Sir Cliff the opportunity to dispose of any evidence, as well as having a negative impact on the victim. The former officer rubbished claims that appeared in the media that the police brought in the BBC to maximise coverage of their search, calling them ""ridiculous"". He was unable to explain why the raid warrant made provision for ""civilian media"" personnel to accompany the search and enter the property. Sir Cliff broke down in tears last week as he gave evidence over the ""shocking and upsetting"" BBC coverage which he said would ""forever taint"" him. The singer also said he was so upset by the coverage he thought he was ""going to have a heart attack or a stroke"". The BBC claim they accurately reported the raid in good faith, and said it was ""a matter of legitimate public interest"". Sir Cliff denied all allegations against him and in June 2016 prosecutors announced the singer would face no charges. The High Court hearing is due to last 10 days."

The prince joins the likes of Jay-Z, David Beckham and Rihanna, who are also said to enjoy the spicy peri peri chicken on offer at the restaurants. William made the revelation at a joint Commonwealth Business and Youth forums event at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in London. Business leaders and philanthropists from across the world gathered to share their advice with young entrepreneurs. William was introduced to the co-founder of Nando's Robert Brozin, and pointed out his security officer before telling him: ""This man here is your biggest fan. ""He introduced me to Nando's, it's very good, he should buy a stake in Nando's."" The prince later gave a brief speech in which he told of his admiration for the entrepreneurs he meets on his trips overseas. He said: ""As I have travelled across the Commonwealth and here in the UK, I have always been impressed by the ingenuity, the drive and commitment of those I meet behind small and medium-sized companies particularly. ""When Catherine and I visited India in 2016, we were completely blown away by the innovation on display in the Indian businesses we met from Formula E-Cars and new ways of teaching braille."" William also spoke about his ambitions for the Royal Foundation which he founded with Prince Harry and Kate in 2011, and which Meghan Markle will join as its fourth patron after the Royal wedding. He told delegates: ""We, as the Royal Foundation, can help lead, but if we can connect to some of those bigger foundations in the world and come together with one message, imagine the focus and the change. ""I like the idea of a team. Its all about how we work together."" Mr Brozin, who opened his first restaurant in South Africa in 1987, said about William: ""I'm not surprised he's eaten at Nando's. ""The beauty of Prince Harry and Prince William is that they're really accessible and they are guys that go out a lot - I'm very happy that they've tried it. ""I was certain they would have tried it because they're so accessible. ""They're people's people, which is so nice.""

The highest concentration was found there, and a further eight areas were potentially contaminated. Salisbury cemetery, where the remains of the ex-spy's wife and son rest, was not targeted. A spokesman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""In this instance, direct contact is required for a person to be poisoned. Only a small proportion of the material is transferred in each contact and the substance is diluted in each secondary or tertiary contact. ""The class of nerve agent does not produce significant vapour or gas and can only be moved between sites by direct transfer from a contaminated person or by moving a contaminated item."" The details emerged as Defra announced a major specialist clean-up operation was under way across the city ""to bring a small number of potentially contaminated sites back into safe use"" for residents and tourists. About 190 specialist military personnel from the Army and RAF have been called in to support the operation, which is expected to take months. The 66-year-old former Russian double agent and his 33-year-old daughter were attacked with novichok and found slumped on a bench at The Maltings shopping centre on 4 March. In an analysis of samples taken from the home of the Skripals, the highest concentrations of toxic chemical novichok, thought to be responsible for their poisoning, was found on door handles. The mall where the pair were discovered unconscious, Zizzi and the Ashley Wood compound where the ex-spy's red BMW 3 series was taken after the attack have been handed back over by the police investigation. The clean-up will also focus on two areas near Bourne Hill police station and two ambulance stations. The Mill Hill pub and the Skripals' home will be the last to be cleaned. A police cordon at the London Road cemetery was lifted on Tuesday - the first area to be reopened to the public after extensive testing determined it was not contaminated with the poison. The department's chief scientific adviser Ian Boyd said: ""Our approach is based on the best scientific evidence and advice to ensure decontamination is carried out in a thorough and careful way. ""Our number one priority is making these sites safe for the public, so they can be returned to use for the people of Salisbury. ""Thanks to detailed information gathered during the police's investigation, and our scientific understanding of how the agent works and is spread, we have been able to categorise the likely level of contamination at each site and are drawing up tailored plans. ""Meticulous work is required and we expect it will be a number of months before all sites are fully reopened."" A £2.5m fund has already been announced by ministers to support businesses, boost tourism and meet unexpected costs in the wake of the attack. Last week, the Government's national security adviser said Russian intelligence had been spying on the Skripals for at least five years. Cyber experts from military intelligence agency the GRU targeted Yulia Skripal's email accounts as far back as 2013, claimed Mark Sedwill in a letter to NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. A programme set up in Russia in the 2000s trained personnel from ""special units"" in the use of chemical warfare agents, he said, including investigating how nerve agents could be administered through door handles. Russia has continued to deny any involvement in the poisoning and accused Britain of abducting Ms Skripal, who has been discharged from hospital and taken to a secret secure location. Mr Skripal, who is no longer in a critical condition, is said to be making good progress and is also expected to be discharged in due course."

Mrs May said doing so would have compromised the ""effectiveness of our operations and safety of British servicemen and women"". Jeremy Corbyn, who has called for a War Powers Act requiring Parliament's backing for future military action, said Mrs May had ""tossed aside"" the convention that prime ministers seek the support of the Commons before committing forces to combat because it was ""inconvenient"". :: Analysis: 'Unforeseen risks in no longer consulting Parliament The Labour leader said Mrs May's predecessor David Cameron had come to Parliament a number of times to seek the authority for military action. ""I am sorry to say the Prime Minister's decision not to recall Parliament and engage in further military action in Syria last week showed a flagrant disregard for this convention,"" he said. Mrs May hit out at her opposite number's call for a War Powers Act, claiming it would ""seriously compromise"" national security, national interests and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad. She said such legislation would make smaller-scale and targeted military action like that in Syria ""unviable"". The PM told the Commons: ""Making it unlawful for Her Majesty's Government to undertake any such military intervention without a vote would seriously compromise our national security, our national interests, and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad."" ""And for as long as I'm Prime Minister, that will never be allowed to happen."" :: May denies launching strikes on Trump's orders Concluding her speech, Mrs May claimed a ""clear majority"" of MPs believed the Government did the right thing. ""I realise that for some in this House, and especially for those who have not had to do what I have to, the attractive purity of a democratic principle that Parliament should always decide may still appeal more than the practice of how to ensure an effective military operation that delivers our national interest,"" she said. Mrs May went on to say that she hoped MPs could agree on her ""commitment as Prime Minister to being held to account by this House for the decisions that I've taken"". Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, a former soldier, said a War Powers Act would be an act of ""calamitous insanity to bring down on our foreign policy"". But Mr Corbyn defended his proposal in the face of sustained Tory attacks, saying it could ""specify at what point in decision-making processes MPs should be involved, as well as retaining the right of ministers to act in an emergency or the country's self-defence"". He said: ""It is about democracy, it is about accountability, it is about making very serious decisions, that is what MPs are elected to do. ""It would bind this Government and future government to the basic democratic principle on the most serious and crucial issues of public policy that we're ever asked to take a decision on. ""All those that we here in 2003 during those debates on Iraq remember them very well and remember the questioning very well from the public about what they did and how they voted."" Mr Corbyn was backed by the Scottish National Party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who said the ""time has come"" for such a change. He added: ""A long-standing policy of the SNP, we believe it will stop situations as we saw last week where Parliament is completely bypassed in a reckless fashion."" :: At the end of the debate, MPs voted on the motion: ""That this House has considered Parliament's rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces overseas"". They voted 317-256 in favour of it. It represents a victory for the Government, which backed the motion, and a defeat for Mr Corbyn. The Labour leader asked his MPs to vote against the motion in order to ""express our dissatisfaction with the Government's response and assert the rights of Parliament"".

Caribbean leaders were summoned to Downing St to listen to an extraordinary apology from the Prime Minister but the Windrush scandal is far from blowing over. ""I want to dispel any impression that my government is in some sense clamping down on Commonwealth citizens, particularly those in the Caribbean, who brought a life here,"" Mrs May said. But that impression is far from dispelled and her government has not been able to provide convincing answers to some crucial questions. The Windrush generation and its descendants, named after the boat some of them arrived on from the Caribbean, have played a vital role in Britain's post-war recovery and multi-ethnic society. The news that some of them have been hounded by the Home Office has been profoundly shocking to many. The impression that people are being pursued by immigration officials and threatened with deportation simply because their papers are not in order, has for many sounded fundamentally un-British. Theresa May's ministers have been at odds with each other. They have differed on the basic question of whether or not people have actually been deported or not. We still do not have an answer. They cannot produce an estimate either of the numbers of people who have been denied healthcare or lost jobs because officials have questioned their status. But the PM is at the heart of the controversy too because of her role as home secretary for much of the period in question. She was in the job when in 2014 a key clause of legislation which had provided longstanding Commonwealth residents with protection from enforced removal, was quietly removed from the statue books. She was there during a so-called ""hostile environment"" policy on immigration. And on her watch in 2010, the government destroyed Windrush-era documents that recorded when Caribbean immigrants arrived in this country. The Home Office says it did so for data protection reasons. But critics say the documents were vital historic evidence. Theresa May told her Caribbean guests: ""I don't want anybody to be in any doubt about their right to remain here in the United Kingdom."" Her government has its work cut out dispelling those doubts and fears."
2018-04-17,The Government has risked deepening a Brexit row with devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales by taking them to the Supreme Court.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180417191015/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-uk-govt-challenges-scottish-and-welsh-administrations-in-supreme-court-11334738,"On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeremy Wright announced he is asking the UK's highest court to rule whether Brexit legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly is legal. The row centres on Edinburgh and Cardiff's rejection of the UK Government's flagship Brexit legislation, the EU Withdrawal Bill. The Scottish and Welsh administrations have branded the bill a ""power grab"" by Westminster and warned the UK will be thrown into a constitutional crisis if the Government doesn't win their approval for the legislation. Both devolved governments fear that law-making powers being returned from the European Union after Brexit will be held in London and not passed on to their administrations. As a result, both the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly passed their own alternatives to the key Brexit legislation last month, which aims to replicate EU law into UK law in time for its departure from the trading bloc next year. Mr Wright will now challenge the legality of the Scottish and Welsh administration's Brexit legislation and will ask for a Supreme Court ruling on whether it is constitutional and within the powers of Edinburgh and Cardiff. Ongoing talks between Westminster and the devolved governments have yet to overcome the impasse over the EU Withdrawal Bill, although Mr Wright expressed hope the discussions could yet achieve a breakthrough and avoid the Supreme Court's involvement. He said: ""This legislation risks creating serious legal uncertainty for individuals and businesses as we leave the EU. ""This reference is a protective measure which we are taking in the public interest. ""The Government very much hopes this issue will be resolved without the need to continue with this litigation."" The Government is already facing a battle to pass the EU Withdrawal Bill through Westminster's Parliament, with the House of Lords likely to try and amend the legislation in a series of votes this week. Responding to Mr Wright's decision to refer Edinburgh's Continuity Bill to the Supreme Court, the Scottish government's Brexit minister Michael Russell pointed to how an ""overwhelming majority"" of MSPs passed the legislation. He revealed Scotland's chief law officer would be challenging the UK Government's position in the Supreme Court by arguing ""it is within the powers of the Scottish Parliament to prepare for the consequences for devolved matters of UK withdrawal from the EU"". Mr Russell added: ""Our Continuity Bill is an important and necessary piece of legislation to prepare Scotland's laws for Brexit while protecting the powers of the Scottish Parliament that people voted for. ""The Scottish government has made clear it cannot recommend the Scottish Parliament consent to the Withdrawal Bill in its current form. ""Alongside the Welsh government, we have always said our preference would be to reach an agreement with the UK Government to amend the EU Withdrawal Bill to respect the powers of the devolved administrations and both governments are ready to continue meaningful talks to further discuss potential solutions. ""While the Scottish government is not opposed to UK-wide frameworks in certain areas when these are in Scotland's interests, this must only happen with the agreement of the Scottish Parliament."" The Welsh government also signalled their intent to defend their legislation at the Supreme Court. A spokesperson said: ""We have always said our preference is for a UK-wide withdrawal bill, which respects devolution and we continue to work with the UK Government to achieve this. ""In the meantime, our bill is a legitimate means of protecting Welsh interests and devolution settlement and we will defend any action before the Supreme Court."" In June 2016, a majority of Scottish people voted to Remain in the EU, but most Welsh voters backed Leave."

There are estimated to be around 2,000 US troops in Syria. Ms Sanders added: ""We are determined to completely crush ISIS and create the conditions that will prevent its return. In addition we expect our regional allies and partners to take greater responsibility both militarily and financially for securing the region."" Earlier, the French President said he had persuaded Mr Trump to stay in Syria and launch airstrikes as punishment for the alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma. ""Ten days ago President Trump wanted the United States of America to withdraw from Syria. We convinced him to remain,"" Mr Macron said during a two-hour grilling on French television. ""I assure you, we have convinced him that it is necessary to stay for the long-term,"" he added. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al Assad has said the Western airstrikes in his country were based on ""lies"" by the UN Security Council. Speaking to a group of visiting Russian politicians, he said the US, Britain and France had waged a campaign of ""lies and misinformation"" against Syria and its ally Russia. The two nations deny using chemical weapons in the attack on Douma in the suburbs of Damascus last Saturday, which triggered the US-led decision to carry out strikes on Friday night. Mr Assad was described by the Russians as being in a good mood, a day after the airstrikes destroyed three chemical weapons facilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to his fellow Syrian ally, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, on Sunday night. A Kremlin statement said they agreed ""that this illegal action is adversely impacting prospects for political settlement in Syria."" Mr Putin stressed ""it will inevitably entail chaos in international relations"" if violations of the UN charter continue. Mr Rouhani accused the US ""and some Western countries"" of not wanting Syria ""to reach permanent stability"". However, they agreed to not allow ""fire of a new tension"" to flare up in the region. Mr Trump defended his use of the term ""mission accomplished"" to describe the operation in Syria. He said the mission was ""so perfectly carried out, with such prescion, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term 'Mission Accomplished.' ""I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!"" Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin will announce on Monday further economic sanctions on Russia for supporting the Syrian regime. She said it would affect companies ""dealing with equipment related to Assad and any chemical weapons use"" as Russia needed to feel the consequences for ""protecting"" the Assad regime. US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it is now the international community's obligation to act in Syria as ""Russia has failed to do so"". She told Sky News: ""The United States, Britain and France - responsible allies - are showing Bashar al Assad that he has to stop. ""We will defend the rights of his people even if he won't do it himself."" As world leaders and their representatives set out their views on the strikes, hundreds of people in Turkey, Iraq, India and Cyprus protested against the mission. Left-wing activists in Cyprus took to the road outside the gates of RAF Akrotiri, the British military base on the island where jets involved in the operation took off from. Socialist Unity Centre of India activists in Kolkata burned an effigy of Donald Trump as they protested the strikes. In Istanbul, protesters outside the French Consulate demonstrated against the ""imperialist aggression in Syria"" while those in Baghdad carried Syrian flags as a show of unity as they burned US flags. The leader of Hezbollah, the Lebonon-based, Iranian-backed militant group, said the strikes have strained international relations and could totally ""torpedo"" UN peace talks in Geneva. Hassan Nasrallah said the strikes were ""limited"" and were a recognition of the strength of the ""resistance axis"" - referencing the alliance between Syria, Iran and Hezbollah. In the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon criticised the strikes. Mr Corbyn called for a War Powers Act to make it necessary for MPs to approve future British military action, with the Opposition leader criticising Theresa May's decision to carry out the strikes without parliamentary approval. He also called her justification on humanitarian grounds ""legally debatable"". Mr Cable told Sky News it was a ""mistake"" to launch the strikes ""without getting proper political endorsement"", adding the move was a ""mistake of judgement"" borne out of political weakness. And Ms Sturgeon questioned the Prime Minister saying there was ""no practical alternative"", saying she was not sure if that ""is really the case"". She called for a full parliamentary debate on the matter. Foreign Minister Boris Johnson defended the strikes, saying Britain had a duty to show Syria had not ""got away"" with using chemical weapons. Theresa May will go before the Commons on Monday to answer questions about her decision, after insisting there was no ""alternative path""."
2018-04-17,It was the construction industry's most high-profile casualty in the wake of the financial crisis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180417191015/https://news.sky.com/story/the-stump-on-track-to-be-square-miles-tallest-building-11335465,"The Pinnacle, or Helter-Skelter as it was nicknamed, was to have been one of the most striking additions to the City landscape - taking its place among a string of unusually shaped skyscrapers that include The Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and the Walkie-Talkie. But while those three were all completed - The Gherkin actually opened in 2004, three years before the crisis - work on The Pinnacle, which had been backed by Saudi money, ground to a halt in 2012 after funding dried up. For the next few years, with just six storeys completed and foundations extending to the equivalent of a further three storeys underground, the shell of the building was rechristened ""The Stump"" by wags in the City and the construction industry. But in early 2015, a consortium of investors led by the French insurance giant Axa paid £300m for the site, with the City of London Corporation agreeing planning permission later that year. A new tower is now going up rapidly and, when it is completed next year, it will be - at 62 storeys high - the tallest building in the Square Mile. It's got a new name, too: Twentytwo, after its address at 22 Bishopsgate. The architecture will not have quite the flourishes that the Pinnacle would have had but, according to its developers Lipton Rogers, it will boast something far more important - it will be somewhere people actually want to work. Sir Stuart Lipton, who with his business partner Peter Rogers built the City's famous Broadgate Centre, the Chiswick Park office campus in west London and redeveloped the Royal Opera House, argues this is far more important than creating a buzz in the architectural world. He points out that a lot of the eye-catching buildings put up in the early 2000s, while looking stunning, were often not always very practical for the people working in them. There is also an argument that they looked rather ostentatious - an image not really in keeping with these chastened, post-crisis times in which businesses are striving harder than ever to prove that they are a force for good in society. More important to Sir Stuart will be that the 12,000 people expected to ultimately work in Twentytwo will enjoy being there, which is why there will be ever-changing art displays in the building, lots of light and wi-fi everywhere. The decision has also been taken to devote a tenth of the space in the building to things that will make the building pleasant to those working in it: a central ""market"" with an array of fresh foods and kitchens with an open terrace and bar; a gym featuring a climbing window with views across the capital; a ""retreat"" with yoga studios and a spa; plus a business club and lounge. Mindful of the changing way in which people get to work, the building will also have what Sir Stuart promises will be London's biggest cycle park, with space for up to 1,700 bikes - plus cycle hire and maintenance facilities. Sir Stuart explained: ""We want Twentytwo to have a sense of civic pride and space. If people are happy in their workplace, they will be more productive."" Possibly one of the more ambitious aspects of the new building is the way in which its owners are targeting not just big businesses to become its tenants. It is also looking for tenants among SMEs, start-ups and tech companies, who will be offered preferential terms on their rent. Sir Stuart added: ""The City is a global leader in financial services and it will be in technology too."" But what about demand from tenants? Twentytwo is one of an estimated 450 tall buildings being planned for London over the next decade (the global definition of a 'tall building' is 200m (656ft) or more, the City's is 150m (490ft) and above and London Mayor Sadiq Khan's is 30m (100ft and above). There is going to be no shortage of office space. Will there be sufficient demand for it? Sir Stuart is in no doubt: ""Thirty years ago, the top rents in the City were £71 per square foot. Today, they are about £71 per square foot. The City is a very fluid place - it adapts with the times."" Some folk still decry the way the old stone facades of the Square Mile have been superceded by giant glass skyscrapers. To Sir Stuart, they exemplify how the City threw off its stuffy image after Big Bang, changing with the times to face head-on the competition several miles to the east at Canary Wharf. It still is - and that probably means that, in time, Twentytwo will be overtaken as the Square Mile's tallest building."

MPs pressed her on her ability to meet the demands of her full-time, £140,000-a-year probation role with her new Defra responsibilities. Dame Glenys said she would be prioritising her probation work but had to ""make some adjustments"" - saying she told Defra she would give up two days a week to free up more time for the review. When asked if her new role was impacting on her full-time job, she said: ""Of course I don't have the commitments a younger woman might have at home. ""So when the needs arise, for example should I be appearing at a select committee, then I may be doing extra work at the weekends."" She said it meant she would sometimes work longer days but said she had stepped down from other commitments - including those at her local church council - to make time. ""My husband is enjoying the prospect of learning how to cook, so there are some hidden benefits for me at least.""

Chairman Robert Neil told Dame Glenys her responses were ""profoundly unsatisfactory"". ""I am shocked at what I have just heard,"" he added. ""At the moment we are utterly unconvinced by what you have said."" Labour MP Ellie Reeves also criticised the probation boss, branding her remarks ""incredibly unhelpful"". She said: ""As a Member of Parliament and a mother of a three-year-old, and as someone that has spent a large part of their career representing women in relation to maternity discrimination, I think that gives very much the wrong message. ""I think that those comments should very much be reflected upon, they are incredibly unhelpful."""

The 32-year-old victim was shot with a Beretta semi-automatic shotgun on 25 October last year. He later died in hospital from a single gunshot wound to the chest. The father-of-two had turned up at the defendant's home in Oswaldtwistle, near Accrington in Lancashire, over an ongoing dispute between his partner Kate Phelan's son Wesley Metcalfe, also aged 14, and Thomas. The row had flared up on social media with a suggestion they might meet for a fight. Mr Holt and Ms Phelan were seen shouting and banging on the window's of the defendant's house. After the shooting, it is alleged Moseley immediately handed the weapon to his son who was inside the house and told him in the hallway: ""Tell them you have done it because you can't get done for it."" The court heard Thomas saw his father taking a shotgun from a cabinet next to the porch and load it with three cartridges. He asked his father what he was doing and was told to call the police. He dialled 999 and a sound was heard about 10 seconds into the call, which the prosecution suggested was the firing of the gun. Mr O'Sullivan said: ""It is inherently unlikely, is it not, that Thomas can put the receiver down, hand it to someone, pick up the gun and fire it on the doorstep in all that time."" The jury heard Thomas told police he had shot Mr Holt and he was arrested. When Matthew Moseley was arrested he said he had heard the shotgun go off but did not know who had fired it. Two days after the shooting, police bugged the vehicle the father and son were being driven to court in. Mr O'Sullivan said the father ""can be heard telling Thomas that he is a minor and cannot go to jail"". The prosecutor continued: ""He went on to say to Thomas, 'self-defence for you, you didn't know what you were doing. Me, different ball game'."" The court heard that after he was charged with murder the defendant made a number of phone calls in prison which were recorded, including one to his wife Julia, during which he told her: ""I weren't even f****** aiming. I just picked it up and bang."" In a separate call to Thomas, he said: ""They are going for life. You do realise that? They did explain that to you? I will never see you again. I will never, ever get out... because they coerced you into changing your statement."" Mr O'Sullivan told the jury: ""The police did not coerce Thomas into anything... the prosecution say in that call Matthew Moseley was trying to manipulate his son, deploying what can only be called emotional blackmail, in order for his son to take the blame for the death of Lee Holt."" The trial continues."

2018-04-17,"The Government has been accused of overseeing a ""national shame"" as Windrush-era citizens are threatened with deportation despite living in the UK legally for decades. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180417191015/https://news.sky.com/story/windrush-scandal-what-its-like-to-face-deportation-after-decades-in-the-uk-11334190,"Anthony Bryan is a Windrush immigrant who arrived in the UK from Jamaica, aged eight, in 1966. Despite living in the UK for 52 years, Mr Bryan was told he was in the country illegally after applying for a passport in 2015. The claims resulted in Mr Bryan losing his job, being arrested, and being detained in the Verne immigration removal centre. A seat on a flight to Jamaica had been booked for his deportation before a last-minute intervention, and he and his family have spent thousands of pounds in fees to ensure he remains in the UK. Here, he shares his experience being of being a British citizen threatened with deportation. The first time I knew anything about this was when I decided to visit my mum and applied for a passport. That's when everything started and immigration authorities came out of the woodwork. All of a sudden I was contacted by Capita, telling me that I'm here illegally. I couldn't believe it. I've been here all my life, and I have always felt that I was British. I thought I was nationalised, and that all that had been sorted out by my mum decades ago. I don't know anything about Jamaica. My friend advised me saying I would need to respond to this and if I didn't they would just come for me. When they came to arrest me, they said I was here illegally. And because I didn't have the documentation, in their eyes I suppose I was. That's when they brought me to the Verne detention centre. I felt sick, I really did. The Verne was frightening, terrifying really. I'm 60, and I thought I'd experienced a lot of things. But that was something new. It's right by the sea. You get locked up every day. There were a lot of fights, and people fought over nothing because they have nothing to do and so much anxiety about what might happen to them. You're locked up around people in authority, who at any time can put you in handcuffs and put you on a plane. They come to deport people in the night - it's really terrifying. The people in the centre have done nothing wrong. They've committed no crimes, but they're locked up, in detention, and they don't know for how long. When you're locked up but you don't have a sentence and you're not being punished it's hard to keep your sanity. When they released me from the detention centre, it was as surprising as when they arrested me. But I had to sign on every fortnight and six weeks later they arrested me again. It feels like as if you're just signing on until they feel like arresting you again. That was a really difficult, stressful time. You're getting locked up, you're getting released, you don't know what's going to happen. I did feel angry at first because I didn't know where to turn. I feel calmer now I know that I'm not going to be deported, and I'm thankful that my missus was around to sort things out for me while I was inside. If I didn't have a support network, I would have been long gone. But there still are a lot of angry people and people who are scared. There were people I was friends with at school who are in hiding. They're saying they won't go to jail when they've done nothing. Before this I didn't have any problems with Britain. When I came to Britain as a child, where I was coming from wasn't as bright as Britain. I was made here and I do love Britain - after all, I've been here 52 years. I've never left. I'm British Jamaican, of course, and that will never change. But I'm British! I hope that as this gets more attention people will get more confident and they will come out and say this is their situation and get some support. And all I can say to the Government is that they need to sort things out for the people in my situation. It's the decent thing to do."

He was treated on the beach by paramedics before being flown 160 miles by helicopter to a hospital in Perth, where he remains in a serious but stable condition. Photographer Peter Jovic, a witness to the incident, told ABC how the surfer had managed to ""body surf"" back to the beach after being attacked. He said there was a ""lot of thrashing around"", which made it ""hard to see what was going on"" ""I saw the guy who had been attacked get separated from the board and then start to paddle for an inside wave, which he managed to body surf all the way in,"" he added. ""They got him to shore and started working on him to stem the bleeding."" Another witness, Brett Newland, told the station it was a ""large shark"" and that ""from the way it was behaving, it would have been a white pointer"" - better known as a great white. The attack prompted the World Surf League (WSL) to temporarily postpone the nearby Margaret River Pro surfing contest, with lifeguards having spotted a 13-foot-long shark just off a nearby beach two hours later. In a statement posted to its Facebook page following the incident, the WSL said it had decided to suspend the competition for an hour after ""discussions with local authorities"". The league added: ""Surfer and staff safety are top priorities for the WSL and when competition resumes, further enhanced safety measures, including ski and drone presence, will be added to the event's mitigation protocols. We look forward to a great completion of the event."" Several beaches in the Gracetown area were closed in the wake of the attack, including Lefthanders, where the Department of Fisheries reported the presence of a whale carcass. An alert has been issued warning beach-goers that the carcass could draw sharks closer to shore."

This would be the highest temperature seen since August last year. Ibiza's weather will pale in comparison with temperatures of about 21C (70F) - and the UK will even put Barcelona and Istanbul in the shade, where a mere 18C or 19C (64F to 66F) is expected. Although the summer-like temperatures will be above average for this time of year, Sky weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar says they are not unexpected. She added: ""This is welcome news for those who thought spring warmth was never to come, especially after the cool and cloudy conditions last week. ""It's not unusual for the weather to be so changeable this time of the year, as spring is a transitional season between winter and summer. ""The unusual thing was the positioning of the jet stream, a fast current of air high up in the atmosphere that separates warm and cold air and determines the position and strength of low pressure systems. ""Last week it had moved as far south as the Mediterranean and North Africa, where it was wet and windy. That meant the UK was influenced by colder air, with high pressure situated across Scandinavia allowing easterly winds to develop. That easterly flow was the main culprit for the cloudy skies and murky conditions. ""This week, the jet stream returns north. For the first few days rain will affect many northern and western areas, but from Thursday most places will be mainly dry with bright or sunny spells as pressure starts to build. ""We'll import warmer air from southern Europe which could see temperatures rise to around 25C across parts of the South East as well."" Sky weather producer Joanna Robinson added: ""Sheltered parts of Scotland, like the Moray Firth and Edinburgh, could see 18C or 19C. ""UV levels will also rise. Over the weekend, there'll be more of an Atlantic influence, so it doesn't look to be quite as warm, but high pressure will keep most places fine and dry. ""So far this year, nowhere in the UK has reached 20C (68F), with the highest being 19.5C (67.1F) on 14 April."" The UK's bitterly cold start to the year finally came to an end last week with a brief warm spell near the tail end of the Easter holidays - a tease for the sunnier blue skies to come."
2018-04-17,Downing Street has defended the Home Office's decision to destroy landing cards recording the arrival of Windrush generation immigrants to the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180417191015/https://news.sky.com/story/downing-street-defends-home-office-decision-to-destroy-windrush-landing-cards-11335554,"A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said disposing of the documents was the right decision to take, amid a row over the immigration status of people who came to Britain from the Commonwealth after the Second World War. Labour MP David Lammy said ""heads must roll"" at the Home Office, while shadow home secretary Diane Abbott labelled the revelation ""truly shocking"". The Home Office, which took the decision for data protection reasons, said the slips ""did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK or their immigration status"". :: What it's like to face deportation after decades in the UK The PM earlier told Caribbean leaders she was ""genuinely sorry"" for the ""anxiety caused"" and said she wanted to dispel the notion that the Government wanted to clamp down on citizens from the region. Named the Windrush generation after the cruise ship that brought one of the first large groups of West Indians to Britain, anyone who entered the UK before 1973 is legally entitled to live in the country. However, despite having been in the UK for the majority of their lives, the group of British residents have begun to experience issues as a result of tightened immigration requirements. It has seen some Windrush generation residents, who might never have felt the need to apply for a UK passport before, left without the documentation now required by officials. As many as 50,000 are thought to be experiencing difficulties in finding work, getting NHS care, accessing benefits, or trying to secure housing. There are even fears some may have been deported in error. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said she did not have ""any evidence"" this had happened, but Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said on Tuesday that officials were trawling through files to establish whether there had been any wrongful deportations. On the subject of the registration slips, the PM's spokesman said the UK Border Agency disposed of them in 2010, which is when Mrs May was in charge of the Home Office. He said: ""The slips provided details of an individual's date of entry, but did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK, or their immigration status and therefore would not have bearing on immigration cases whereby Commonwealth citizens are proving residency in the UK."" He added: ""It was done for, I think, reasons as well to protect personal information. ""The decision was taken to securely dispose of these documents, and that was the right one to take."" When asked if Mrs May had been aware of the disposal when she was home secretary, the spokesman responded: ""My belief, at this moment, is that it was an operational decision that was taken by the Border Agency."" Reacting to the disclosure, which was first reported by The Guardian, Mr Lammy tweeted: ""It is an absolute disgrace that the Home Office has destroyed these documents and then forced Windrush-generation migrants to try and prove their status, threatening them with deportation and stripping them of their rights. Shame on you all."" It is an absolute disgrace that the Home Office has destroyed these documents and then forced Windrush-generation migrants to try and prove their status, threatening them with deportation and stripping them of their rights. Shame on you all. #Windrush https://t.co/ccIFryoLXB Ms Abbott said culpability for the ""fiasco"" rests with the Home Office. She added: ""Amber Rudd must explain who authorised this action and when, and what Theresa May's role was as the then Home Secretary. ""The Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation because they cannot provide documents, but now we learn that the Home Office destroyed the very records that could have demonstrated their right to remain. ""The Home Secretary should immediately announce that she will accept the burden of proof in deportation cases like these lies with the Home Office, not with the potential deportee. ""And she should say what steps she will take to ensure that people who have a right to be here continue to enjoy free access to the NHS, and the freedom to change jobs, homes or bank accounts without further harassment under her Government's hostile environment policy."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Registration slips provided details of an individual's date of entry, they did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK or their immigration status.

The young white cat was taken to RSPCA Newbrook Farm Animal Hospital after CCTV controllers became concerned she may have been thrown from the building. The RSPCA is trying to track down the owners to find out how she managed to fall. Inspector Mike Scargill said: ""This is a very worrying incident and the cat is extremely lucky to be alive. ""I am appealing to the general public for any information that might help me investigate what happened. ""The cat may have slipped and fallen on her own, but it's very concerning to hear that the CCTV controllers think they may have seen someone actually throw the cat from the building, so I'm very keen to speak with anyone with information who might be able to tell us more. ""I am also keen to find the person who owns this cat. She's a young white female, with white patches of tabby markings on her tail, back and head. ""She's really been through it and suffering a broken jaw would have been incredibly painful for her, so I'm sure being reunited with her owners will give her a much-needed boost."""
2018-04-17,British luxury carmaker Aston Martin has signed up seven banks to prepare a £4bn stock market flotation that would rank among the City's most anticipated share sales for years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180417191015/https://news.sky.com/story/aston-martin-gears-up-for-4bn-float-with-bank-appointments-11335131,"Sky News has learnt that the company's shareholders have approved the appointment of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Unicredit to act as bookrunners on the prospective deal. The quartet of banks will work with Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which have won the prized roles of joint global co-ordinators on Aston Martin's initial public offering (IPO). The recruitment of such an extensive syndicate of banks, which has been approved by Aston Martin's two Italian and Kuwaiti shareholders, is the clearest sign to date that the luxury car marque is pushing ahead with plans to go public. The manufacturer of models such as the Vanquish S said in February that it was examining ""a range of strategic options...including the potential for an IPO"". Sources said the company would seek a valuation of between £4bn and £5bn. London is the likeliest listing venue for an Aston Martin IPO, although its board and shareholders have also been examining New York as they seek a luxury goods valuation similar to that achieved by Ferrari, the US-listed Italian car marque. If it does list in London, it may also list Global Depositary Receipts, a form of instrument linked to a company's shares, in New York, according to insiders. The Gaydon-based car manufacturer is also preparing to recruit an independent chairman in preparation for the flotation. Aston Martin, which reported a strong set of full-year results two months ago, unveiled plans to revive its Lagonda brand as an all-electric marque at the recent Geneva Motor Show. Andy Palmer, the company's chief executive, said the revamp would ""appeal to people other than traditionalists, such as those who want to upgrade from a Tesla"". In an effort to embrace growing demand for electric vehicles, Aston Martin has said that each of its models will be developed with hybrid technology or full battery power by 2025. Aston Martin, which faced years of financial struggles, has delivered a turnaround in its financial performance, to the relief of its main shareholders, ‎Italy's Investindustrial and Investment Dar, a Kuwaiti vehicle. Daimler, the German car manufacturer which owns Mercedes-Benz, also holds a small stake.‎The company recently reported the highest sales in its history last year, at £876m, with pre-tax profits of £87m. Aston Martin's stock market debut will bring a dash of glamour to the public markets, regardless of whether the maker of the DB11, Vantage and Rapide models opts for a London or New York listing. Aston Martin's shareholders are being advised ‎by Lazard, the investment bank, on their strategic options. Its recent performance has enabled it to draw up plans to enter the lucrative SUV market, with the DBX expected to go on sale in 2020. Aston Martin employs more than 2,700 people, and sells its cars in 53 countries. Its growth prospects have been spurred by its strong performance in overseas markets including China, where it plans to open 10 new showrooms. The carmaker announced the expansion during Theresa May's recent trade visit to China, where she was joined by bosses including Mr Palmer. Aston Martin's chairmanship currently rotates between its two largest shareholders, but the company has begun a process to identify an independent chairman, according to insiders. A spokesman for Aston Martin declined to comment on the banks' appointment."

It had already announced in January it was to shut its Neasden operation outside London with the potential loss of 380 jobs - as well as plans to bring down the shutters on 14 stores, affecting a further 500 positions. M&S logistics director, Gordon Mowat, said: ""Closing Hardwick will help to remove some complexity from our network and speed up our supply chain. ""However, it was not a decision we took lightly and it is not in any way a reflection on the hard work and dedication provided by the teams on site."" M&S said XPO and DHL had begun consultations with affected staff. The retailer - once the darling of the UK high street - has endured tough times for years as its fashion offering, particularly in womenswear, has struggled under the weight of growing competition. Food, which has propped up its bottom line, has come under pressure more recently as the wider sector battles the effects of Brexit-linked inflation. Several large retailers have been shedding staff as they try to save costs, with Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco axing thousands of middle managers earlier this year. M&S, under its relatively new leadership team of chief executive Steve Rowe and chairman Archie Norman, has set about a five-year turnaround plan to bolster the chain's fortunes. Other major changes to have been announced earlier this year include outsourcing most of its 430-strong IT team, and selling its 27 Hong Kong stores to a franchisee."

Hunniford outlined her concerns in a written witness statement given during the latest stage of the trial in London, which is being overseen by Mr Justice Mann. Sir Cliff has told the judge how BBC coverage of the police raid on his home in August 2014 left him feeling ""forever tainted"". He said seeing footage of his penthouse apartment being searched in Berkshire was like ""watching burglars"" going through his belongings. Sir Cliff claims the BBC's coverage of the search, which was staged after a sex assault allegation, was a ""very serious invasion"" of his privacy - with the star demanding damages at the ""top end"" of the scale. The BBC disputes his claims, with corporation bosses claiming its coverage was accurate and in good faith. Mr Justice Mann began overseeing the trial on Thursday. Hunniford said she had watched the BBC report of the police search in August 2014. ""I could not believe what I was seeing,"" she said. ""He is a gentle and kind soul and I was extremely worried about how he would be reacting. ""He seemed utterly distraught that the search and allegations against him had been broadcast so widely around the world, and about what everyone must be thinking about him."" She said she had seen Sir Cliff in recent months and that he seems ""more his old self and is looking a lot better"". Hunniford added: ""However, he cannot stop talking about how violated and betrayed he feels about the BBC decision to broadcast the police search of his apartment and create the media storm that ensued."" Sir Cliff's lawyers have said the BBC got information about a sex assault allegation from a ""tainted"" police source. They have told Mr Justice Mann that the information came from someone connected to a wider Metropolitan Police inquiry into sex abuse allegations, an investigation codenamed Operation Yewtree. Justice Rushbrooke QC, who leads Sir Cliff's legal team, said lawyers knew ""for a fact"" that ""Yewtree was the source"". They suggested that the journalist who obtained the information must have known that it had been ""improperly"" released by someone involved in a ""highly sensitive"" police operation and said the source was ""tainted"". A BBC reporter who covered the South Yorkshire Police search of Sir Cliff's home texted one of the force's press officers about a ""bonkers but brilliant"" day, it was heard. The press officer replied saying she was getting ""lots of grief from the media"" because ""everyone thinks we tipped you off"". Detail of the text conversation between journalist Dan Johnson and Carrie Goodwin, head of corporate communications at South Yorkshire Police, was analysed by the judge as evidence. Ms Goodwin accepted during cross examination from the BBC's lawyer that she knew how the broadcaster planned to handle the story one month before the search was carried out. During Monday's evidence, there was a dispute between the BBC and South Yorkshire Police. The force said the BBC put pressure on them to let reporters accompany the raid, while the BBC claims that the police were keen for the publicity. To execute the warrant to search the address, South Yorkshire Police had to operate in the Thames Valley force area. Ms Goodwin sent a press officer to attend the raid all day and accepts this was slightly unusual."

The 42-year-old was driving with his mother through Richmond, west London, when he crashed his Mini into two other cars on 18 March. Prosecutor Katie Sinnett-Jones told Wimbledon Magistrates' Court that the incident happened when McPartlin drove around a ""sharp bend and lost control"", then ended up on the wrong side of the road. He collided with another Mini Cooper before driving ""straight into the front of an oncoming car"". The court heard that the host had been seeking help for ""alcohol and emotional issues"" at the time following the breakdown of his marriage. The driver of the other Mini said afterwards that he thought he and his family were going to die in the collision. In a statement read in court by Ms Sinnett-Jones, the driver said: ""Myself and my family were in deep shock as we believed we could have died as as a result of Mr McPartlin's reckless driving."" McPartlin was breathalysed at the scene and found to have 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes. ""Anthony McPartlin is sorry and is doing everything he can to ensure this never happens again,"" McPartlin's barrister, Liam Walker, said. ""He hopes that in time he can make himself better and that he might be forgiven by all of the many people he knows and he feels he has let down terribly."" McPartlin's fine works out to about 4.5 days' pay. Speaking briefly outside court after the sentencing, the TV presenter said: ""I just want to say I'm truly sorry for what happened. ""High standards are expected of me, I expect them of myself. I've let myself down, I let a lot of people down. And for that I am truly sorry. ""I'd like to apologise to everybody involved in the crash and I'm just thankful no one was seriously hurt."" After McPartlin, of Chiswick, west London, was charged, ITV announced the Saturday Night Takeaway host would step back from his TV commitments, with co-presenter Declan Donnelly presenting the final two episodes of the show on his own. McPartlin appeared alongside Donnelly on TV screens over the weekend as Britain's Got Talent aired its pre-recorded audition shows. But ITV has confirmed Donnelly will be hosting the live shows without his TV partner of almost 30 years."

She said she had decided to come out with the news herself before her friend did. Wurst, who won the singing contest in 2014 with the song Rise Like A Phoenix, wrote that she had received medical treatment and that she was feeling healthy and strong. The bearded performer, the alter ego of Thomas Neuwirth, wrote that ""coming out is better than being outed by a third party"". Eurovision’s @ConchitaWurst has posted on Instagram about living with HIV, following threats from a former partner to reveal her status.This kind of threat is wholly shameful and underlines the abhorrent stigma that still surrounds HIV.

She added that her reason for going public was ""to encourage (others) and make a step against the stigmatisation of people who through their own behaviour or through no fault of their own were infected with HIV."" The post concludes: ""to my fans: the information about my hiv status may be new to you - my status is not! I'm well and... I'm stronger, more motivated and liberated than ever. Thank you for your support!"" Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, which campaigns on and provides services relating to HIV, said: ""The decision to talk openly about your HIV status should be a personal one and not taken away or ever, ever used as a threat. ""Threatening to reveal someone's HIV status, under any circumstances, is entirely wrong. What other health condition would be used as blackmail against someone? And we know this isn't something which only happens to those in the public eye. ""Despite all the medical advances we've made in the fight against HIV, in treatment and in testing, Conchita's Instagram post highlights how much more we have to do to tackle the abhorrent stigma which still surrounds the virus. ""We applaud Conchita for handling this with such dignity and including in her post that people living with HIV who are on effective treatment, like her, can't pass the virus on."""

He said Stallone called him to share Johnson's story, adding that the boxer's ""trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial"". Mr Trump said: ""Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!"" Johnson was sentenced in June 1913, after being convicted by an all-white jury under the Mann Act, which made it illegal to accompany a woman over state lines for ""immoral purposes"". The world heavyweight champion was married three times, to white women, which caused controversy at the time. Johnson was charged over his relationship with his second wife, Lucille Cameron, who was said to be a prostitute. Her mother also claimed she was insane. Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon! The Mann Act was passed after the alleged crime, but he was sentenced to a year and a day in prison. But he skipped bail with his wife and the two lived in exile across Europe for seven years, before he eventually surrendered and served his sentence in 1920. Johnson's story was fictionalised for The Great White Hope, starring James Earl Jones, and told in a documentary called Unforgiveable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. His great-great niece has pushed for a pardon for Johnson, who was also an inventor, and the case has been supported by Senator John McCain. Mr McCain previously said Johnson was a ""boxing legend and pioneer whose career and reputation were ruined by a racially charged conviction more than a century ago"". He added: ""Johnson's imprisonment forced him into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice, and continues to stand as a stain on our national honour."" Stallone, best known for the Rocky boxing series of films, is a supporter of the President and attended his 2016 New Year's Eve Party in Mar-a-Lago."

He said the legal action was the result of months of frustration with scammers piggybacking on his reputation and preying on Facebook users with get-rich-quick scams. Mr Lewis said: ""There are customers who have lost a lot of money. Some of them won't even talk to me because they've seen my face on the advert and think it's me who has scammed them - it's an absolute disgrace. ""I've had enough of this. It's affecting my reputation, but more importantly it is affecting real people who are handing over money in good faith while the scammers are raking in the cash."" The television personality and journalist pledged that if he wins any money in damages, he will donate it to charity. He said the action was not designed to win the defamation case itself but to force the company to change its policy on advertising, for example reducing the risk of such scams by having inbuilt settings notifying well-known people every time their image was used in an advert, requiring their approval that the post was legitimate. Mr Lewis said: ""I hope to open up a legal remedy for other people who have found themselves in the same boat. ""I don't do adverts. I've told Facebook that. Yet it simply continues to repeatedly publish these adverts and then relies on me to report them, once the damage has been done. ""I've got no idea how successful this legal action will be or how long it will take but I can't sit back and let it (scamming) happen. I'm trying to give Facebook a bloody nose and actually get some changes made - or at least get people talking about this."" Mr Lewis said he would be prepared to call a halt to the defamation claim if Facebook pledged to tackle the scam ads problem. Facebook said: ""We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis that he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed. ""We are in direct contact with his team, offering to help and promptly investigating their requests, and only last week confirmed that several adverts and accounts that violated our advertising policies had been taken down."""

Hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen, typically when it comes into contact with your mouth, nose, eyes and throat, and you can ease the symptoms by taking anti-histamines. But what is histamine and why does it make you feel like you have a cold? Histamine comes from cells in your body called mast cells, which are triggered excessively by your allergies. Dr Ellie Cannon told Sky News: ""Histamine initiates a process of inflammation where the blood vessels open, causing the typical watery eyes and runny nose of allergies. ""It also causes the sneezing with hay fever, due to its effect on the nerve cells,"" she said. ""Histamine is released appropriately when your body has inflammation. The problem with allergies is that histamine is over produced, causing the very significant symptoms people can get."" So what can you do to ease hay fever symptoms and enjoy the warm weather without suffering? Here are some tips."

It meant Sir Mo comfortably beat the two hours, seven minutes and 13 seconds achieved by Steve Jones back in 1985. His performance was all the more impressive considering the conditions, with the 23.2C (73.8F) recorded by the Met Office at St James' Park making it the hottest London Marathon on record - beating the 22.7C (72.9F) recorded in 1996. Sir Mo held was driven on towards the end by some of the 800,000 spectators who lined the 26.2 mile course, cheering him on as he reached the finish line. He said afterwards he would be spending time with his family after not seeing his children due to a strict training regime in Ethiopia during the last three months. He added: ""Today it was the hardest way to run in any race. But at the end of the day you've got to fight like a man."" Sir Mo was not the only Briton with reason to celebrate, as David Weir won his eighth London Marathon men's wheelchair title. ""At the beginning I felt a little bit nervous to be honest, it was a little bit hot and that's why I lifted my visor up to get some air and to cool down a bit,"" he said. ""But I'm really happy this year."" Elsewhere, Vivian Cheruiyot, from Kenya, won the women's elite race and Australian Madison de Rozario won the women's wheelchair title. It was her first victory in London, finishing ahead of four-time champion Tatyana McFadden. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge, who won gold at the 2016 Olympics, triumphed in the men's elite race with a remarkable time of two hours, four minutes and 16 seconds. ""I ran a beautiful race,"" he said. The sweltering conditions had forced organisers to advise runners to rethink their fancy dress plans and drop their target finish times, with more ice, water and run-through shower stations positioned along the route. Among the 40,000 runners taking part for charity were firefighters who tackled the Grenfell Tower blaze, who raised more than £41,000 for children affected by the inferno, and a police officer who was stabbed during the London Bridge terror attack. Members of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust also took part on what was the 25th anniversary of the teenager's murder. They set off from Blackheath at 10am after the Queen started the 38th annual event from Windsor Castle by pressing the traditional red button. Prince Harry, who is patron of the London Marathon Charitable Trust, was in the capital to cheer people on. One who failed to finish was glamour model and businesswoman Katie Price, who was running to raise funds for a lung charity because of a disease suffered by the mother and who had vowed to complete the race even if she had to crawl over the line. Well said mummy pic.twitter.com/HiUTtRQPeq After dropping out of the race between 10km and 15km, she posted a video insisting said she did train, despite reports she had not done so, and didn't mind not finishing as ""if my mummy is proud that's what matters to me"". Organisers hope another record to tumble will be how much the event raises for charity, with it having registered a new high for an annual one-day fundraising event last year with £61.5m. Well said mummy pic.twitter.com/HiUTtRQPeq The annual race has raised £890m in total since 1981 and continues to grow in popularity, with 386,050 people applying to take part this year - almost a third more than in 2017 and the highest number for any marathon in the world."

The message from the Queen was loud and clear - pick my son Prince Charles as the next head of the Commonwealth. Speaking in front of 53 leaders, she said: ""It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949."" In one sentence she ticked all the boxes; showing her own commitment to the organisation, reminding them how far back those ties go and declaring that she believes her son is the best man for the job. In the run up to this year's CHOGM, we have been teased with suggestions that this would be the week where leaders discuss who would follow the Queen. Theresa May's spokesman even said at the start of the week that we could possibly see a decision this Friday. I have to admit I was sceptical. This subject is so sensitive. Talking about who will replace the Queen means we are talking about her demise. Head of the Commonwealth is, after all, a job for life. But after Thursday's reception I wouldn't rule out some kind of announcement after the leaders meet privately in Windsor on Friday. Maybe they will just reaffirm the links between the monarchy and the Commonwealth, but that in itself would be something and make it increasingly likely that Charles will inherit the title from his mother. Speaking at the opening reception, the current chair of the Commonwealth and Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, gave the heaviest nod yet, saying Charles would provide the solid, passionate leadership they need. The Commonwealth has got its critics who think it is an outdated organisation and, because of its colonial roots, a throwback to the British Empire. The connections with the royal family don't help with that image. But there is an enormous amount of respect for the Queen and how her distinctive style of quiet diplomacy has held together this family of nations. This was always going to make it more likely that the leaders would stick to the status quo and maintain ties with monarchy. Her Majesty is not giving up on her role just yet. She sees this as a lifelong commitment. But her remarkable intervention now paves the way for her son to step up when the time comes."

The MP was responding after his constituent wrote to him complaining she was ""appalled and ashamed"" to hear of the impact of the Prime Minister's ""hostile environment policy"" on immigration. Mr Freer replied: ""I am sorry to hear that you have been misinformed. It is so sad that Opposition parties would seek to deliberately misquote and misinterpret what Theresa May said. ""The Windrush issue is absolutely nothing to do with immigration reforms introduced under the Cameron Government. Then the policy was to make it harder for ILLEGAL immigrants to settle in the UK. The Windrush people were and are legal. Wholly separate and unconnected. ""I would also point out that the decision to destroy the landing cards of the Windrush people was taken by the last LABOUR Government, so it really is the height of opportunism and hypocrisy for the Opposition to take some moral high ground."" Mr Freer's attack on Labour reflects the view of many Conservative MPs that Jeremy Corbyn's party is attempting to exploit the Windrush controversy to deflect attention from its own race row over anti-Semitism. His Finchley and Golders Green seat, in north-west London, has the largest Jewish population of any Parliamentary constituency in the country, at over a fifth of its residents. It is in the outer London borough of Barnet, which is one of the key battlegrounds in the local elections on 3 May, with Labour attempting to snatch the council from the Conservatives. Despite being a Government whip, a role that restricts his speaking in Parliament, Mr Freer has been a vocal campaigner against anti-Semitism. He joined the high-profile Parliament Square protest last month and wrote on the subject in The Times as recently as last week. :: Sky Views: Britain wakes up to its imperial past In her email to Mr Freer, his constituent wrote: ""Apart from the terrible injustice to the many individuals concerned, ranging from losing their jobs, their homes, their right to health care, fearing deportation and being subjected to incredible levels of stress, what image of Britain are we projecting here? ""What must EU27 nations make of this conduct? How can Britain present itself as an honourable and trustworthy negotiating partner when it treats its own citizens and people who have made honest mistakes in such a dreadful fashion. It is truly shameful."""
2018-04-22,Sir Alex Ferguson would be forgiven a wry chuckle.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180423024114/https://news.sky.com/story/the-magic-had-gone-arsene-wenger-outstayed-his-welcome-at-arsenal-11339370,"That other long-serving managerial giant of the Premier League era left Manchester United on a high - timing his own exit as expertly as he had applied the boot to players he no longer wanted. Arsene Wenger, by contrast, had outstayed his welcome. An unheralded line from his final news conference before the announcement of his departure was telling. ""We want to finish in front of Burnley,"" he said. With all due respect to Burnley's achievement in even entering that sentence, it is a measure of Arsenal's slide that Wenger was reduced to aiming to avoid slipping below them into seventh place in the Premier League. My busy text inbox after the announcement included this, from an Arsenal-supporting senior executive in another sport: ""Far too late but thank God."" From his arrival in autumn 1996, Wenger steered his club into the Champions League every season - until 12 months ago. Then, a fifth-placed finish in the Premier League consigned Arsenal to the relative backwaters of the continent's secondary competition, the Europa League. Many expected that Wenger - or his employers - would take that as his cue for the ride into the sunset, laden with honours, albeit everything that mattered bar the FA Cup dating back more than a decade. Instead, Arsenal gave the manager a new two-year contract. No other elite club would have done it. The magic had gone. In his early Arsenal years, Wenger led the way in changing the culture of English football, dragging an entire generation out of the bookies and the boozer and into a brave new world of sports science and managed diets. His first decade brought three league titles, four FA Cups and a whole season unbeaten in 2003-04. A magic touch with (mostly foreign) young signings helped Arsenal keep their place at the top table while investment was focused on building the new Emirates Stadium. And he retained throughout a sense of humour, perspective and dignity. But now, after years of under-achievement, months of discontented rumblings and weeks of empty Emirates seats, Wenger has finally decided - or been persuaded - that the game is up. What a game it's been. What a legacy. He deserves the waterfall of tributes that have flowed his way. Sir Alex Ferguson said: ""I am proud to have been a rival, a colleague and a friend to such a great man."" And there may yet be a glorious finale. If Arsenal can overcome Atletico Madrid in the Europa League semi-finals, the final would be Wenger's last match, with qualification for next year's Champions League as the bonus prize. Fergie again: ""He can now have the send-off that he truly deserves."" A tough act to follow. But he has failed to live up to his own record. Time for someone else to try."

The former barrister's decision to stand down will end his nine-year reign as First Minister, succeeding Rhodri Morgan in December 2009. The announcement comes after Mr Jones, 51, referred himself to an independent inquiry over allegations of bullying at a senior level of the Welsh government three years ago. It followed the death of assembly member Carl Sargeant, who is believed to have taken his own life after being removed from his role as cabinet secretary for communities and children while facing allegations of inappropriate behaviour. Former minister Leighton Andrews has said that Mr Sargeant and others were the target of a ""bullying culture practised by certain people within the Welsh Government"". Mr Jones insisted that any issues brought to his attention were dealt with, but Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies suggested Mr Jones may have ""misled assembly members"" over his knowledge of bullying in the Welsh government. Mr Jones told conference there had been ""the darkest of times"" in recent months, and thanked his children and wife Lisa, who he said had been seriously ill in the run-up to conference, for their support. He said: ""In any normal political career, you expect to be put through the ringer, and even have your integrity challenged. ""I don't think anyone can know what these last few months have been like. No-one that is, apart from Lisa and the kids. ""They have carried me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them, and it is time for me to think about what's fair for them."" ""I intend as I've always maintained - to be here to give every answer to every question. But I intend to stand down in the autumn, allowing for a new First Minister to take place by the end of this year. ""At that point it will make sense to have a fresh start. For my family, for my party and for my country."" Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Carwyn has led Welsh Labour to achieve unprecedented electoral success, forming two Labour Welsh Assembly governments. ""Over the last nine years he has stood up to Tory austerity and stood up for the people of Wales as a strong voice for devolution and democracy. ""Carwyn has been a staunch advocate of a jobs-first Brexit which works for Wales, including continued membership of a customs union. ""I pay tribute to Carwyn for his tireless commitment to making Wales a more equal country which works for the many, not the few."""

But a nasty ""pollen bomb"" will be left behind, caused by simultaneous releases from millions of birch, plane and oak trees. Millions of people in southern England are already suffering but it is set to spread northwards in the next few days. Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said: ""Tree species normally release pollen at different times in spring, starting with willow and alder in February and March. ""These are wind-pollinated species, which make vast amounts of pollen - one birch or hazel catkin makes 5m grains, and a tree has thousands of catkins. We are swimming in clouds of pollen - we just can't see it."" The National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit at Worcester University, which produces pollen forecasts, says levels will peak over the weekend before only a slight decline going into next week. Mr Barter said: ""The tree pollen count will decline soon but then we face an even worse situation in May when grass starts to flower. ""Grass produces far more pollen simply because there is so much of it."" The medical term for hay fever is allergic rhinitis. It is triggered when our immune systems mistake airborne particles such as pollen for a harmful pathogen which usually causes inflammation of the airways. Pollen expert Shenagh Hume told Sky News that sometimes people mistake hay fever for a spring cold. ""They sneeze or get bunged up and think it's just a cold. But if your eyes are itchy or sore, you are sneezing or bunged up at this time of year, it is likely to be hay fever. ""Hay fever can be serious, especially for people with asthma because the size of the airways is reduced by pollen."" She said around 40% of the UK population suffers from hay fever."

English Heritage launched Operation Clothes Moth a year ago after its experts witnessed the numbers of common or webbing clothes moths double, and observed the appearance of the pale-backed clothes moth. Thousands of traps were handed out at English Heritage sites for the survey which collected data from 42 counties. It discovered an ""alarmingly high"" number of pale-backed clothes moths, and also revealed that the reported catch of the common clothes moth was significantly higher in London and the South East, where an average of 23 moths were found per trap - more than anywhere else in England. The South West was the next highest with an average of 17 moths in each trap. The East Midlands, North West and North East recorded the lowest levels of moths. Higher and older pre-1950s properties were found to have more moths because they have more voids, fireplaces and attics than newer homes. Flats or apartments are more susceptible as they have shared walls, English Heritage found. Amber Xavier-Rowe, English Heritage's head of collections conservation, said: ""The response from the public has been brilliant and the data we've gathered has been invaluable in informing our understanding of the clothes moth threat. ""Now that we know where the clothes moth concentration is the highest, we can put in place extra measures to ensure that our historic houses in these areas are fully protected and preserved for future generations. ""We wouldn't have been able to do that without the public's help."" She added: ""Operation Clothes Moth has really resonated with a lot of people who yes, want to help us protect our collections but also to protect their favourite woolly jumpers."" A guide has been drawn up by English Heritage based on 20 years of experience of protecting historic collections from insects to help homeowners defend their property from infestations. Checking for moths in the creases, folds and behind labels of clothing, keeping items in vacuum bags, and taking out items from the wardrobe and giving them a good shake at least once a month to disturb the moths are among tips offered in the guide."

Another of the acts was a George Formby tribute act featuring politician turned entertainer Ed Balls, and comedians Frank Skinner and Harry Hill. While events were held nationwide to celebrate the Queen's 90th birthday, Elizabeth II usually prefers to spend her birthday in private. But the concert came at the end of a week that saw Prince Charles approved as her successor as head of the Commonwealth at the end of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust youth charity, of which her grandson Prince Harry was appointed president this week, was earmarked as the main beneficiary of Saturday night's event. The Prince was in the audience with his wife-to-be Meghan Markle, and the second in line to the throne Prince William, whose heavily pregnant wife Kate was absent. At the end of the evening, Elizabeth went on stage to join some of the performers with her son, Charles. He joked that she could not have predicted that in 1948, when he was born, his mother would be sharing a stage with her 70-year-old son. Charles then led a round of cheers from the audience as his mother acknowledged them with a smile and her trademark royal wave. Harry also paid tribute to his grandmother. Others who took part in the 5,000-seater show included Craig David, Jamie Cullum, Shawn Mendes and Anne-Marie. Elizabeth was born on 21 April, 1926, and became queen in 1952 at the age of 25. She also celebrates an official birthday in June when soldiers parade through central London for the Trooping the Colour."

A spokesman said: ""We are supporting the British families of those who have died and those injured following a serious road traffic accident near the town of Al Khalas, Saudi Arabia."" The coach was travelling between Mecca and Medina on Saturday afternoon when it was hit by the tanker, which then caught fire and set the coach alight. One of the victims is understood to be Raj Begum Hussain, a 70-year-old woman of six with 13 grandchildren, from Blackburn. The three other victims were from Preston: an elderly man, an elderly woman and her son. Their families are planning to fly to Saudi Arabia in the next few hours.

Many of those injured suffered fractures and are being treated at a hospital in Mecca. The driver of the tanker is also said to have died. Gulfaraz Zaman, director of Blackburn-based Hashim Travel company, said: ""The coach driver said they were travelling in the opposite direction to the petrol tanker when a car overtook the tanker and he had to move in to the side of the road a little to let it through but then the petrol tanker hit the coach which caught fire.""

The 20-year-old was bodyboarding in the ocean off Kauai on Thursday, when what he believed to be a tiger shark between six and eight feet long bit his leg. Mr McWilliams, who says he has worked as a survival training instructor, was able to swim around 30 metres back to shore, where a bystander called paramedics. ""I didn't know if I lost half my leg or what,"" he said. He received seven stitches in hospital. Last year, Mr McWilliams had to have nine staples in his scalp after he was mauled by a black bear at a Colorado summer camp. Mr McWilliams was asleep outside when the bear started biting the back of his head. He defended himself by punching the bear and poking it in the eye, causing it to loosen its grip. ""I guess I was just in the wrong spot at the wrong time,"" he said. The two attacks followed his encounter with a rattlesnake during a Utah hiking trip a few years earlier. The bite was not severe, he told the Honolulu Star Advertiser, and he was only ill for a couple of days. Mr McWilliams says his parents are grateful he is still alive."
2018-04-22,Glasgow has become the unlikely capital of Britain's satellite-building industry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180423024114/https://news.sky.com/story/glasgow-leads-britains-satellite-space-race-11343521,"The former shipbuilding hub has re-invented itself for the space age. It now makes more satellites than any other city outside the United States. Scotland's first satellite, built by Clyde Space, was launched just four years ago. Since then Alba Orbital and Spire Global have joined the space race, between them putting around 100 satellites in orbit. Spire makes one satellite a week in its dust-free 'clean room' in a city-centre business centre, but it has ambitions for trebling production. Sky News was given rare access to film inside the facility, watching as nano-satellites the size of a loaf of bread were assembled from miniaturised components. Traditionally satellites have been as large as a bus, taken 10-15 years to design and build, and have a working life in orbit of a decade or so. But nano-sats can be built in days or weeks at a fraction of the cost of their older cousins, and have a lifespan of just two years before they drop out of their very low Earth orbit and burn up in the atmosphere. Joel Spark, the company's co-chief technology officer, said it allows the hardware to be regularly updated with newer models. ""The whole point is to launch and replace,"" he said. ""We change our phones every two years. Why would you want a space craft that old?"" Nano-sats cost a few thousand pounds - a fraction of their larger cousins. And because they are so tiny, launch costs are also far smaller, making it viable to have constellations of the devices covering a much greater area of the planet's surface than previously possible. Spire already has 78 nano-sats in orbit, monitoring radio signals from ships and, later this year, aircraft. The signals allow the company to track 75,000 individual vessels a day, making it possible to spot illegal fishing, watch out for piracy and trade on commodities before a cargo ship has even reached port. Peter Platzer, Spire's chief executive, said world trade is now worth $12.5 trillion a year, with 90% of goods being transported by sea. ""We can see the location, speed, heading, cargo details - a host of information to understand what's happening on the oceans,"" he said. Similar tracking technology is being rolled out on aircraft, so they can be monitored when they are beyond land-based radar. It would have helped to narrow the search for flight MH370, the Malaysian Airlines plane that has never been found. ""We would have known within minutes that the aircraft was off track,"" said Mr Platzer. ""It would have allowed other people to intervene and figure out the plane was in trouble."" Nano-sats are likely to be used for high-speed interaction between driverless cars, mobile coverage in the remotest of regions and a host of Earth monitoring applications. Worldwide more than 2,000 small satellites are expected to be launched by 2025. The Government will later this year announce the location of Britain's own space port, which will be used to launch satellites and provide a base for space tourism. Science minister Sam Gyimah said Britain's space industry is a quiet success story. ""Most people know what Elon Musk is doing in the US, but in the UK we've got some great companies solving real world problems in a way that's really valuable - £250bn is the total value to our economy, in terms of jobs and growth.

2018-04-22,"The Health Secretary has accused social media networks of ""turning a blind eye to a generation of young people"" by failing to protect them when using their platforms online. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180423024114/https://news.sky.com/story/social-media-firms-must-protect-children-or-face-new-laws-says-jeremy-hunt-11342107,"Jeremy Hunt says he is ""disappointed"" by the lack of progress made in areas such as age verification, screen time limits and cyber bullying. He met with the bosses of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter in November, but in a strongly-worded letter he told the companies not enough progress has been made. ""I fear that you are collectively turning a blind eye to a whole generation of children being exposed to the harmful emotional side effects of social media prematurely,"" he said. ""This is both morally wrong and deeply unfair on parents, who are faced with the invidious choice of allowing children to use platforms they are too young to access, or excluding them from social interaction that often the majority of their peers are engaging in. ""It is unacceptable and irresponsible for you to put parents in this position. ""This is not a blanket criticism and I am aware that these aren't easy issues to solve... however, it is clear to me that the voluntary joint approach has not delivered the safeguards we need to protect our children's mental health."" The firms have been given just over a week to set out what steps they have taken to cut underage use, prevent cyber bullying and encourage healthy screen time - and what more they intend to do. Mr Hunt stressed that the Government does not rule out bringing in new legislation to deal with the situation when it considers options in May. Tamanna Miah, 24, campaigns for more help for young people when it comes to cyber bullying. She told Sky News she was a victim herself: ""I experienced a number of things. Whether it was people commenting on my photos, my posts, being really negative, mocking my religion, my background, my family, where I lived, what I wore, the way I dressed, everything from my appearance to my culture."" Her friend Rosina St James said she is concerned about children who are growing up with social media profiles from a very young age. ""Everybody is taking selfies constantly and for me it's the psychological effect of the self-esteem and self-worth and your identity attached to that because you get lost in looking the best, of having the best status, or wanting everybody to know about what you're doing."" The National Bullying Helpline says it has seen a big rise in the number of inquiries for help when it comes to cyber bullying - more than 1,000 every day. The ambassador for the helpline, actress Debbie Arnold, says tougher laws are needed urgently. ""Murder is a crime, hitting someone is a crime. We need to know the barriers, where is cyber bullying? When does it become a crime? When is it telling tales and when does it go from one thing to another. I mean, it's caused people to kill themselves. It causes people life-long anxiety. Cyber bullying is everywhere and we have got to do something to stop it."" Sky News approached all major social networks for a response to Mr Hunt's letter. Google responded saying it is taking action and shares the Government's commitment to ensuring the internet is a safe space. Katie O'Donovan, public policy manager at Google UK, said: ""Along with all parents, we understand the challenge of helping children make the most of the internet in a safe and responsible way. ""Google shares the Government's commitment to this, which is why we launched Family Link to help parents set digital ground rules for their children such as screen time limits. We also developed the first online safety course to be officially accredited and have taught it to over 40,000 school children so far."" Facebook said: ""We welcome the Health Secretary's continued engagement on this important issue and we share his ambition to create a safe and supportive environment for young people online. ""We continue to invest heavily in developing tools for parents and age appropriate products to meet this challenge, and we look forward to continuing to work with our child safety partners and Government to make progress in this area."" Snapchat said it tries to prevent under-13s joining its network and provides a number of tools to help older youngsters protect themselves. A spokesperson said: ""We take our responsibility to create a safe and secure experience extremely seriously and continue to invest in reources to keep our community safe online. ""Bullying, harassment and intimidation have no place on Snapchat. We provide tools for Snapchatters to report violations and our dedicated Trust & Safety team reviews abuse reports and takes action when they become aware of a violation."""
2018-04-22,"Policing the Royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could cost as much as £6m, according to estimates based on new figures relating to Prince William and Kate Middleton's big day in 2011.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180423024114/https://news.sky.com/story/should-royals-pick-up-6m-security-bill-for-harry-and-meghans-wedding-11343552,"Figures obtained by the Press Association through several Freedom of Information requests show that, in total, £6.35m was spent policing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. Nearly £3m was spent on overtime costs alone, with hundreds of officers drafted in to help police crowds watching the event in London which saw an estimated one million people line the streets. :: Royal wedding 2018: Ultimate guide Next month's wedding of Harry and Meghan at Windsor Castle is expected to be on a smaller scale - but with a similar price tag. Thames Valley Police are preparing for around 100,000 spectators in what will be one of the force's largest-ever security operations. Reinforcements have been drafted in from other police forces, including the Metropolitan Police. Anti-monarchy campaigner Graham Smith argues that the costs should be covered by the Royals themselves and not paid for by the public. He said: ""I think if it is going to be in the region of £6-8m, that's the sort of money the Royals can afford themselves. We should remember that it might be a private wedding, but they've chosen to do it in the centre of Windsor, they've chosen to do the procession through the centre of Windsor - they could have done it privately in Sandringham or Balmoral where the security is already in place. So I think it doesn't make sense the taxpayer picks up the cost - the Royals should pick up the whole bill for this event."" A previous estimate for the total cost of the security put forward by the Met Police in 2011 placed the figure higher at around £7.2m. Policing expert Graham Wettone thinks the tab will run up to nearly as much as the 2011 Royal wedding. He said costs have gone up since then and the threat from terrorism is just as serious. He said: ""The police will have been planning this already for months. We're already at probably a million or two into the costs of the operation before we even get to the day itself. ""On the day there will be overt police officers deployed, sharp shooters out on the streets and also some on standby in the background ready to come out if needs be, and then there is of course the highly visible policing presence in and around the town centre."" A Thames Valley Police spokesman said costs for the police operation and any additional infrastructure will be shared between the force and the local council, but that any opportunity to recover costs from the Home Office at a later date ""will of course be explored"". There is evidence that occasions like this can be good for tourism and business. The UK's national tourism agency Visit Britain said the country experienced a 7% increase in visitors around the time of Prince William's wedding between April and June 2011 compared to the previous year. Then, of course, there are the intangible benefits of having a national ceremony like this broadcast to hundreds of millions around the world. It's estimated, for example, that William and Kate's big day was viewed by two billion people worldwide."
2018-04-22,A man who died after a fight in London - becoming the 57th to die a violent death in the capital this year - has been named. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180423024114/https://news.sky.com/story/man-who-died-after-fight-in-london-named-as-aaron-springett-11342946,"Detectives are appealing for anyone who saw what happened to Aaron Springett in the moments before and after he collapsed to get in touch. Mr Springett was found in London Road, Morden, southwest London, at about 10.20pm on Thursday. The 32-year-old was taken to a south London hospital in a critical condition but died the next day. A post mortem examination gave the cause of his death as blunt force trauma to the chest. :: London's surge of violence: 2018's victims Officers have found out he was involved in an altercation with a man close to Paddy Power bookmakers on London Road about 25 minutes before he was found by paramedics. The Met Police said the spot in London Road - the main street in Morden - was close to Morden Tube station and would have been busy at the time. Officers believe there would have been a number of witnesses who are yet to come forward. Detective Inspector Will White, from the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ""I would like to speak with anyone who saw what happened to Aaron. ""The assault happened in a busy area in sight of a number of shops and bus stops and I'm certain people were in the area and may have seen or heard what happened. ""Any piece of information, however small, could greatly assist our inquiry. I would also like to hear from anyone who may have filmed the initial altercation on their phones as this footage might be vital."" A 31-year-old man has been charged with murder but police are continuing to ask the public for help. Mr Springett's death came as officers continued to investigate the suspected murder of a 20-year-old stabbed to death near Finsbury Park. The man was found on Roth Walk at around 3am on Saturday, Scotland Yard said, following reports of a stabbing on Seven Sisters Road. He was pronounced dead at the scene, becoming at least the 58th to die. A 21-year-old taken to hospital for treatment was later arrested on suspicion of murder, possession of an offensive weapon and affray. The incident in Morden occurred hours before two men suffered stab wounds after a fight in Upper Tooting Road, near Tooting Bec Tube station, about 2.5miles (4km) away in southwest London. Local MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan‏ tweeted that it occurred on Saturday evening after an ongoing dispute between two males and involved bottles. Less than half an hour after the Tooting incident, paramedics were called to treat a 14-year-old boy who was stabbed in the leg in Lloyd Park, Walthamstow, northeast London."

She issued Labour's strongest criticism yet as pressure grows on the Prime Minister and Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal. Asked on Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson whether Mrs May could personally be accused of racism, Ms Butler said: ""Yes.

It came as Jeremy Corbyn blamed Mrs May for setting a ""deliberately unreachable bar"" for Windrush citizens and their children by creating a ""hostile environment"" policy. ""We're now seeing the consequences in a string of harrowing human stories - people's lives ripped apart because of the personal decisions and actions of Theresa May and her Government,"" he told a Welsh Labour conference. Justice Secretary David Gauke also admitted on Sunday that he was ""ashamed"" of the scandal. Earlier this week, Amber Rudd apologised and blamed officials in her own department. ""The Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual,"" she said on Monday. Days later, Mrs May told leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that she was ""genuinely sorry"". Baroness Scotland, Secretary-General of the group of 53 nations, told Sky News ""many people were greatly encouraged and warmed"" by the apology. ""Family fall out sometimes,"" she said. ""They do things they regret, and then they say sorry. But the great thing about families is that the tend to forgive each other."""

Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi was quoted by Iran's official IRNA news agency as saying Mr Edalat had been arrested on ""security charges"", without elaborating. It is the first official confirmation of his detention. The semi-official Fars news agency reported earlier this week that Mr Edalat was among several people arrested by the Revolutionary Guard over accusations of being a member of a ""network affiliated with Britain"". Mr Edalat, who has campaigned against Western military action targeting Iran, travelled there from his home in England on an unknown date to attend an academic workshop, according to the Centre for Human Rights in Iran.

She had faced intensifying calls to resign over claims she misled Parliament over the targets - as well as her handling of the Windrush scandal. This has seen Commonwealth citizens who came to Britain after the Second World War being wrongly threatened with deportation. :: What Rudd's departure means:: Who could replace her?

""I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility for the fact that I was not.""

I am very sorry you’re leaving. pic.twitter.com/IjLOoLA09J Ms Rudd's departure is a major blow for Mrs May, who publicly declared her ""full confidence"" in her ally as recently as Friday. Having told the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday that her department did not have targets for deporting illegal immigrants, a 2015 report swiftly emerged contradicting Ms Rudd's evidence. She was hauled before MPs and admitted they did exist. However, she claimed she was not aware of the targets and had not signed them off. The pressure on the MP for Hastings and Rye increased further on Friday with the emergence of a memo - copied to her - which again discussed deportation targets. Ms Rudd insisted once again that she did not know about them and claimed to have not read the memo. Sky's Political Editor Faisal Islam said: ""My understanding is this is about what was and wasn't said to Parliament rather than the handling in general of Windrush. ""If there's some connection between a crackdown, which was certainly not aimed at the Windrush generation but in which they were caught up, then I think the Government may well have further questions to answer and clearly the opposition will try to point that towards Theresa May's tenure at the Home Office."" The resignation of Ms Rudd is the fourth Cabinet departure in six months, following the exits of Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel and Damian Green. Labour's Diane Abbott said the development was ""inevitable"" and should have happened ""much sooner"". The shadow home secretary said: ""The architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give an immediate, full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch. ""Outstanding questions remain, and a change of Home Secretary must mean a change in the 'hostile environment' policies begun by her predecessor, or it will be meaningless. ""The Prime Minister must come before the House of Commons to explain whether she knew that Amber Rudd was misleading Parliament and the public last week about deportation targets."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: ""It's clear that Amber Rudd has ended up, at least partly, being the fall guy to protect the Prime Minister. ""Theresa May must face questions now given these dreadful failures largely took place under her watch as Home Secretary."" Labour MP David Lammy, who is the son of Windrush migrants, tweeted that Ms Rudd's resignation ""must not detract from the fact that this crisis was a direct result of the hostile environment policy"" initiated when Mrs May was home secretary. He called for the Home Office to quickly compensate and grant citizenship to the Windrush generation. Michael Gove paid tribute to his one-time Cabinet colleague, with the Environment Secretary tweeting: ""I'm so sad about Amber's departure from government - she was a huge asset - brave, principled, thoughtful, humane, considerate and always thinking of the impact of policy on the vulnerable - I hope Amber will be back soon - we need her."" Backbench Tory MP Anna Soubry said Ms Rudd was a woman of ""great courage and immense ability"", adding: ""Amber will be missed in many ways. We'll give her a huge welcome on to our back benches. ""If there is any justice she will soon return to the highest of office. Proud to call her my friend."" One leading bookmaker has installed Communities Secretary Sajid Javid as the early favourite, followed by Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Karen Bradley and James Brokenshire."

2018-04-29,"J Sainsbury and Wal-Mart, the world's biggest supermarket retailer, are in advanced talks about a shock £10bn tie-up that would create ‎a more powerful rival to Tesco, the current UK market leader.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/sainsburys-and-asda-in-talks-about-shock-10bn-grocery-merger-11350004,"Sky News exclusively revealed on Saturday that the two companies are in negotiations about combining Wal-Mart's Asda business with Sainsbury's, in a deal that would send shockwaves through the entire British retail industry. Following the story, Sainsbury's released a statement confirming the groups were in advanced talks. It said: ""J Sainsbury plc notes the speculation concerning a possible combination with Asda Group Limited. Sainsbury's confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury's and Asda businesses. A further announcement will be made at 7am on Monday 30 April."" It was unclear this weekend how a deal would be structured, although one insider said Wal-Mart was likely to reverse Asda into Sainsbury's while taking a stake in the combined group. Another huge uncertainty surrounding any combination of the UK's second-largest and third-largest grocers would be their proposals to secure approval from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Some analysts believe a reduction in the pool of national food retailers of‎ major scale would be almost impossible to secure approval for without the disposal of many hundreds of stores. That in turn could pose a threat to substantial numbers of jobs, although insiders said this weekend that store closures and job losses were ""not a major factor"" in the discussions. One proponent of the tie-up suggested that the CMA's decision to wave through Tesco's recent £3.7bn takeover of Booker, the wholesaler, had ‎given a green light for others to explore industry-reshaping mergers. The CMA is likely to look at store conflicts on a localised basis, according to one insider. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said: ""The grocery market - and the British shopper - already suffers from the mid-market being dominated by just a handful of big players. ""What the merger of the second- and third-biggest supermarkets threatens is the creation of even more concentrated local monopolies, so it is obvious that there must be an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, starting immediately."" Sainsbury's has a predominantly southern bias to its store estate, while Asda, which is headquartered in Leeds, is more heavily concentrated in the north of England. Britain's traditional retail industry is under enormous pressure from the prolific growth of online rivals which are not saddled by the fixed costs of bricks and mortar‎ players. Asda and Sainsbury's have also faced a big challenge from the emergence of the German discounters Aldi and Lidl, ‎which have begun to build a big presence in the UK. A tie-up would give the two British chains even greater buying power but would inevitably lead to greater scrutiny from regulators such as the Groceries Code Adjudicator, which was set up to protect small suppliers. One source close to Wal-Mart said the merger would allow the two companies to invest in providing more products at lower prices. A deal would be likely to require the blessing of the Qatar Investment Authority, which holds a 25% stake in Sainsbury's having bought into the chain more than a decade ago. If concluded, a deal‎ would be the most significant in the UK's food retailing sector since Wm Morrison bought Safeway to give it a UK-wide presence in 2004. Sainsbur‎y's has itself been acquisitive in recent years, snapping up Argos and examining takeovers of wholesale businesses such as Palmer & Harvey, which collapsed into administration last year. The leadership of ‎a combined Asda and Sainsbury's would be an intriguing detail of a deal, with former Sainsbury's director Roger Burnley recently being promoted to become chief executive of the Wal-Mart-owned chain. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury's chief executive, is said to have been a driving force behind the proposed merger. The execution risks attached to a tie-up would be crucial to the fate of David Tyler, the Sainsbury's chairman, who has just seen an attempt to merge Hammerson, the commercial property company he chairs, abandoned after opposition from investors. A second attempt to secure large-scale consolidation‎ in the retail industry would, analysts say, underline the belief that bigger companies will be better-placed to withstand the competitive threat from Amazon and other big digital retailers. Among the advisers said to be working on the deal are Morgan Stanley and UBS for Sainsbury's, with Rothschild advising Wal-Mart. Asda did not return calls seeking comment."
2018-04-29,Labour have called on the Prime Minister to launch a full inquiry into whether Home Secretary Amber Rudd misled Parliament in recent comments over the existence of deportation targets for illegal immigrants.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/windrush-row-labour-call-on-pm-to-launch-inquiry-11351761,"In a letter to Theresa May, obtained by the Sunday Times, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Ms Rudd of breaching the ministerial code, and called on the Cabinet Office officials to launch a wide-ranging investigation into ""who knew what and when about targets for removals"". It comes as 200 MPs signed a separate letter sent to the Prime Minister by Labour backbencher David Lammy, which demands the Government sets out greater detail on its handling of the Windrush scandal. :: Windrush scandal victim Richard Black dismisses settled status offer On Saturday, Cabinet colleagues came to Ms Rudd's defence, with Justice Secretary David Gauke telling Sky News he was confident she had not intended to mislead anyone over whether she knew about migrant removal targets. Late on Friday night, Ms Rudd confirmed she would address the House of Commons on Monday to answer ""legitimate questions that have arisen on targets and illegal migration"". She also apologised for not being aware of specific removal targets and accepted that she should have been. The letter sent to Mrs May by Diane Abbott says ""the Home Secretary has clearly lost control of her department and lost the trust of the public"" and calls for Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and Sue Gray, the outgoing head of Propriety and Ethics, to launch a wide-ranging inquiry into a number of areas. These include whether a Home Office memo, recently leaked to the Guardian which mentioned apparently national deportation targets, had been received by the Home Secretary; whether any previous memos or documents mentioning targets have been received by Ms Rudd, and whether Theresa May, while she was Home Secretary, had been aware of such targets. In a separate letter, Mr Lammy, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the Government's handling of the Windrush scandal, wrote: ""There are a number of issues raised by the statements made by yourself and the Home Secretary that require urgent and immediate attention."" The letter, signed by 200 Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs, goes on to call for specific detail to be published regarding the compensation and redress people can expect, such as whether people would be reinstated in jobs, or rehoused if they were evicted. ""Will this compensation be retrospectively applied to all those affected and will it cover compensation for the trauma, pain and suffering caused in addition to legal fees, application fees, loss of employment, denial of access to benefits, public services and healthcare?"" the letter states. It also requests the Government sets out written guidance on the burden of proof Windrush migrants will be expected to provide to receive confirmation of their status from the Home Office, and urges the Government to put commitments made verbally into law. ""Windrush citizens are not 'applying' for anything - they have the right to citizenship, as you have confirmed. We do not believe that the Home Office should treat Windrush citizens as applicants required to meet a certain threshold - this process should seek to confirm applicants' status. If the Home Office has no grounds to disbelieve that a Windrush citizen tells them, they should issue confirmation of status without delay,"" Mr Lammy wrote. ""Given the gravity of these issues, it is important that the Government enshrines the changes that have been announced in response to the Windrush crisis into law without delay."" Number 10 was approached for a comment on the contents of the two letters sent to the Prime Minister on Saturday, but has not yet issued a response."
2018-04-29,"This Thursday more than 22 million electors can vote in 150 English local authorities. More than 4,000 councillors will be elected.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/local-elections-2018-why-should-we-care-11351680,"Unfortunately, fewer than four in 10 of us will vote. Local electoral turnout, apart from occasions when local and parliamentary elections coincide, has declined. But here are reasons why we should all take notice of these elections, especially those with a vote. This year marks the centenary of women's suffrage. In fact, some women voted in local elections before 1918. The reason was that the Victorians recognised the importance of the relationship between taxation and representation. Women who paid local rates had a stake in shaping local accountability. This relationship still holds. :: All you need to know about the local elections Wherever we live, the local council is funded in part from local taxation. Locally delivered services impact upon our immediate environment and our quality of life, from refuse collection and street cleaning to education of our children and care of the elderly. Councillors determine how resources are allocated, which services are prioritised. There is no point complaining on Friday after staying home on Thursday. The context of voting is important too. We saw in June 2016 that voters were mobilised in record numbers to decide whether this country remained or left the EU. Much of the political establishment supported remain and thought the electors would follow their lead. A year later, Mrs May gambled and lost by again misreading the electoral mood. Each of these examples define our history and our national identity. In the same way, local elections are about defining our sense of community. When democratically elected authorities were created in the nineteenth century the reformers believed that their size and shape should reflect communities of local interest. People should vote in wards small enough to capture a sense of neighbourhood. Council areas should reflect cultural traditions and important geographies. These conditions still operate to an extent but are threatened by so-called economies of scale and a drive towards larger authorities. Local government should be an antidote to centralisation. Some bemoan the 'postcode lottery' when services fit local conditions and not a national standard. But if democratically elected councils decide on diversity is that not their right? Few of us want exactly the same shops in every high street, so why do we want uniformity in every local authority? Far from restricting the power of local democracy we should arguably be extending it. The devolution of power this century has neglected the majority. Labour tried and failed to introduce regional government to England. More layers of government, more politicians - no, thank you. So, those with a vote, use it. For the rest, watch and learn. These elections present threats and opportunities that will shape the future of British politics. Battle is resumed between the major parties and their respective leaders. Mrs May has to atone for her previous inept campaign appearance. Mr Corbyn to demonstrate he's no one-trick pony, capable of advancing Labour but not to outright victory. The Conservatives can expect some losses but if London's electors desert in large numbers and flagship councils like Wandsworth and Westminster fall then expect more speculation about her future. Corbyn's Labour will make gains of council seats and councils controlled, but how many of each? Below a hundred-seat gains and below-par performances in target authorities such as Barnet, Dudley and Trafford may trigger more of his already disgruntled backbenchers to voice concerns about the party's ideological shift. These elections are vital for the supporting cast. Strictly speaking, UKIP is defending 125 seats won in 2014. In practice, it is defending many fewer either because its councillors have already jumped ship or it does not have a candidate to defend the vacancy. Last year's county elections saw the party lose every seat it was defending. A repeat may be the party's death knell. Vince Cable's Liberal Democrats are doing well in council by-elections as some voters take the least worst option. A stiffer test now awaits the party: wresting control from the Conservatives in the two southwest London boroughs of Kingston and Richmond must top the list. Staging a recovery elsewhere is vital if the current two-party domination is not to go unchecked."
2018-04-29,US wireless carrier T-Mobile has announced a $26bn (£18.9bn) acquisition of Sprint Corp.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/t-mobile-agrees-26bn-deal-to-buy-rival-sprint-11352835,"The all-stock deal would see the companies - third and fourth-largest in the US telecoms industry - combine to serve 127 million customers and employ more than 200,000 people. The agreement is likely to attract regulatory scrutiny, with concerns over competition and fears it could mean higher prices for customers, as a combined company would not have to offer as many promotions to lure new users. John Legere, president and chief executive of T-Mobile US, said: ""This combination will create a fierce competitor with the network scale to deliver more for consumers and businesses in the form of lower prices, more innovation, and a second-to-none network experience - and do it all so much faster than either company could on its own."" There are also concerns over employment, with The Communications Workers of America union saying the deal will cost at least 20,000 US jobs. But Mr Legere said on Twitter: ""From day one, the new T-Mobile will always have more US employees on payroll than both standalone companies. ""Last year we added 27,000 jobs associated with our growth, and there's no reason we can't grow at the same rate."" Deutsche Telekom currently owns more than 63% of T-Mobile, while Japan's SoftBank owns 84.7% of Sprint. The new larger business would be 42% owned by the German company, which would also nominate nine of the board's 14 directors. SoftBank would nominate four directors and own 27% of the company. It is not the first time Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to merge. Talks in 2014 failed because of regulatory opposition from the Obama administration, and last year because of disagreements over who would control the combined company. Analysts greeted the news with mixed feelings. BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk raised concern over Sprint's debt and annual losses, saying that, while it had cut costs, it had not invested enough in its network. He added: ""T-Mobile does not need a merger with Sprint to succeed, but Sprint might need one to survive."" But MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said T-Mobile's momentum was slowing, which may explain why the company and its German parent ""have warmed to the idea of a merger sooner rather than later"". The company, which would be called T-Mobile, will have headquarters in Bellevue, Washington (T-Mobile's current base) and Overland Park, Kansas, Sprint's home."
2018-04-29,Ministers have announced plans to crack down on a business loophole which has been used by overseas criminals to launder dirty foreign money.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/new-laws-to-tackle-foreign-money-laundering-11351798,"Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs) were first created in 1907 for farm holdings, but ministers say their legal structure makes them attractive money laundering vehicles for international crime groups. Government research shows one laundering scheme used 100 SLPs to move up to £60bn out of Russia. They have also been linked to criminal networks in Eastern Europe and allegedly used in international arms trafficking deals. While SLPs are used by thousands of legitimate businesses - particularly in the private equity and pensions industries - the Government is launching a consultation on further measures to prevent their abuse. They include a requirement that users have a real connection to the UK and do business or maintain an address in Scotland, closing a loophole which means they can be used by anyone around the world. They are also proposing that new SLPs should be registered through a company formation agent, meaning the ""front men"" will be subjected to anti-money laundering checks. Business Minister Andrew Griffiths said: ""The UK has taken a leading role in the fight against money laundering and is known internationally as a great place to work, invest and do business. ""But as we are seeing especially with Scottish Limited Partnerships, is that they are being abused to carry out all manner of crimes abroad - from foreign money laundering to arms dealing. ""This simply cannot continue to go unchecked and these reforms will improve their transparency and subject them to more stringent checks to ensure they can continue to be used as a legitimate way for investors and pension funds to invest in the UK."""

Speaking in Michigan, he said the previous US embassy in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, had boasted the ""best site in all of London"". But he continued: ""Some genius said we're gonna sell the site and then we're going to take the money and build a new embassy. ""That sounds good, right, but you've got to have money left over if you do that, right?"" He said that while he would have to check, he thought the Mayfair site had been sold for $250m. ""They go out and they buy a horrible location. And they build a new embassy. That's the good news. The bad news is it cost over a billion dollars,"" he added. ""So now what do we have? We have an embassy in a lousy location."" The new building's security features are said to include bomb-proof triple glazing. Up to £15bn in regeneration investment is being put into improving the area around the new embassy with the London Underground adding a new branch to the Northern Line to provide public transport to the site. Mr Trump, who is coming to Britain on Friday 13 July, explained his no-show earlier this year by saying the new embassy was a ""bad deal"" in an ""off location"". There was speculation at the time, however, that his cancellation was driven by fear of protests in the British capital. He explained at the rally on Saturday: ""By the way, they wanted me to cut the ribbon on the embassy and I said I'm not going. I don't wanna do it. ""I said 'I'm not cutting that ribbon'. I said 'I'm not going'."" The move was a ""Bush-Obama special"" that ""could have been stopped by Obama"", he claimed. The move from Grosvenor Square was initiated by George W Bush's administration. The plan was revealed in a post on its website dated 8 October 2008 - just under a month before Mr Obama's election. It said: ""The US State Department today signed a conditional agreement with the real estate developer Ballymore to acquire a site in the Nine Elms Opportunity Area in Wandsworth for the construction of a new Embassy."" Mr Trump was not entirely negative about the new building. ""Hey, hopefully we'll have many years of success with that embassy,"" he said at the rally in Michigan. London mayor Sadiq Khan has also called for Mr Trump to apologise for re-tweeting three videos from the far-right group Britain First ahead of his visit to Britain. Mr Khan told ITV's Peston on Sunday it was ""probably inappropriate"" for him to join protests when the US President arrives, but that demonstrations were inevitable. He appealed for them to be peaceful and lawful. Mr Khan also said: ""It's ironic in this of all weeks that the architect of the 'hostile environment' policy in this country has invited the architect of the hostile environment in the USA to London."""

Police said she had been slumped on the filthy sofa ""with her chin on her knees for five days"". Her daughter, Emma-Jane Kurtz - a solicitor who specialised in looking after elderly clients, denied wilful neglect but was found guilty at Oxford Crown Court. Sentencing her on Friday, Judge Peter Ross said Mrs Kurtz had been ""left to rot"". ""Her hands and her feet and her face were engrained with faeces and she had urine burns on her upper legs and lower back,"" the judge said.

2018-04-29,"The end of Alfie Evans' brief life just short of his second birthday is a tragedy for his parents, who devoted themselves to his care.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/alfie-evans-who-should-decide-how-a-child-dies-when-medicine-can-do-no-more-11349674,"He spent 17 months on the intensive care unit at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. His death however, has been a subject of fierce public debate in the UK, the United States and beyond. At its heart are questions about the rights of the child, the limits of parental responsibility, and how best to untangle the knot of ethical and medical issues. In most cases, the fate of a terminally ill child is resolved without publicity or debate. Doctors and parents reach agreement away from the courts and the cameras, and where there is legal challenge it is settled under the anonymity of the family courts. :: Timeline: How parents fought to save Alfie Three times in the last nine months, however, these battles have been played out in public, as the parents of Charlie Gard, Isaiah Haastrup and now Alfie went public as they fought in court to keep their children alive. All three cases were different in detail, but at their heart are the same questions about who, ultimately, decides how a child lives and dies when medicine can do no more. These are desperately difficult issues for families and doctors to navigate - but British law is quite clear. The Children Act 1989 states that ""the child's welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration"", and legal precedent has consistently followed that line. The rights of the child are treated as separate from those of the parents, usually represented in proceedings by a court-appointed guardian, and the ""best interests"" of the child are put first. Who defines ""best interests"" is central, and the courts have consistently followed medical opinion, rather than moral or religious arguments. In Alfie's case, there was no dispute about his condition. Doctors from three countries agreed he was in a semi-vegetative state and that there was no chance of recovery. Since December 2016, the toddler had suffered from an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease which ultimately left him with almost no discernible brain function and reliant on life support. In the final court hearing before his death, the barrister for his father, Tom Evans, told the court they were seeking ""care, not cure"". In contrast to the case of Charlie Gard, which saw doctors in the US offering further treatment, Alfie's case became a decision about how and where he died. The choice was between two palliative care regimes: Alder Hey Hospital, one of the most advanced and experienced paediatric centres in Europe, or the Bambino Gesu hospital in Vatican City. Mr Evans is Catholic, and the Pope, who had received him at the Vatican, had provided a military air ambulance on standby to take his son to Rome. The court was told that there, the palliative regime would be in line with Catholic teaching, provided with ""a view to continuing life"" rather than managing Alfie's death. Ultimately, it was a choice between the will of the parents and the advice of doctors - and the courts found with the latter. It was consistent with precedent but there are those who believe a more nuanced position was possible. Raanan Gillon, emeritus professor of medical ethics at Imperial College, told Sky News: ""Where possible, the courts should allow people to follow their side of the moral dilemma. ""It was possible to say it is okay for the doctors to withdraw treatment but also legally permissible for family to find doctors that agree with the parents and care for him elsewhere."" As with Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans' plight was seized upon by religious campaigning groups and their interventions have sometimes looked like exploitation. For the last month, the Christian Legal Centre provided pro bono legal support to the Evans family. It is part of Christian Concern, a group that seeks to ""see the United Kingdom returned to the Christian faith"" in order to reverse ""family breakdown, immorality and social disintegration"". They deny exploiting the family, but one of their case workers did advise Mr Evans to seek a private prosecution against doctors at Alder Hey for conspiracy to murder. There have been other nakedly political interventions. Senior figures on the Republican religious right in the US have warned that the case exemplifies the dangers of ""socialised medicine"", ignoring the fact that NHS free-at-the-point-of-use treatment kept Alfie alive for 17 months. Nigel Farage told Fox News Alfie's fate had effectively been decided by a ""death panel"" convened by the state, ignoring the division between the executive and the courts. Far more distressing than the attention-seeking of politicians has been the abuse of staff at Alder Hey Hospital, and demonstrations that at one stage saw a police line strung across the doors to keep protesters out. The hospital is hugely valued by the people of Merseyside, utterly embedded and overwhelmingly supported by the community it serves. Repairing that relationship will take time. And we should get used to these disputes. As medicine advances, more children will be kept alive but not cured. Familiarity with the issues will not make them easier to resolve."
2018-04-29,What's it like inside immigration centres for Windrush cases? Sky News political correspondent Laura Bundock witnesses the process:,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/frustration-and-relief-inside-an-immigration-centre-with-the-windrush-generation-11353072,"Lunar House, the Home Office immigration centre in south London, has been open throughout the weekend to help deal with the high numbers of Windrush cases. I go in with Joan Thomas, who has an appointment at 11.45am. Joan arrived in the UK on 17 May 1967 from St Vincent to join her mother, who'd come over with the very first Windrush migrants. ""It's been a horrible, really anxious wait,"" Joan tells me. Lunar House is a towering office block. The front desk is expecting Joan, her name's ticked off a long list and we pass through airport-style security. We're taken to the third floor, where Joan is given a number and a long form to fill in. It's after basic information: name, address, date of birth and details of any convictions. Within a couple of minutes Joan's number is called. We head to a desk, one of many lining two sides of the room. Joan hands over her paperwork including the passport she last used when she arrived in the UK aged 12. She's also brought her degree certificate, national insurance card, some other qualifications and her bank details. The immigration officer takes the papers and says Joan's case looks straightforward. ""We've had some through who have absolutely no paperwork,"" he says. He takes Joan through to ""biometrics"", a glass double door with a large black fingerprint on the side. Behind is another room with more desks on either side and a camera set up. A second immigration officer takes Joan's finger and thumb prints on a small scanner. Joan writes her signature on another screen and has her photo taken. ""I think Theresa May owes me a bottle of rum,"" laughs the officer. It's clearly been a busy time. Joan's then told to wait for her number. The waiting area is filled with people with very similar stories to Joan. Windrush children who came to the UK to join their parents but never had official paperwork. One man has had problems getting his benefits. His lawyer explained: ""They wanted him to apply for official status but he couldn't afford to pay. I have many clients still too afraid to come here."" The wife of another man says her husband, who was born in Jamaica, has always wanted to travel but ""he's been too scared to go very far in case they won't let him back into the country"". ""All these years he's been worried men in vans will turn up and take him away."" People share their stories as they wait. There is a feeling of frustration it's taken so long. But there's also a sense of optimism that finally their cases will be resolved. Just after 2pm, Joan's called back. She tells me she has ""huge butterflies"" and feels nervous. Another officer says there's no need to worry, she has been given official status and hands Joan a ""no time limit"" letter. In other words, the right to remain. She's told her biometric residence permit will arrive within a few days. After which they will be in touch about citizenship. There's a small cheer from the other people in the waiting area when Joan returns. It took just over two-and-a-half hours for her case to be sorted. She leaves with just a piece of A4 paper - but the reassurance she's been waiting more than 50 years for. ""I feel relieved,"" Joan says. ""Finally I can go away I can go back to St Vincent."""
2018-04-29,The public could be allowed to challenge the release of serious criminals from jail under plans to shake up the parole system.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/worboys-controversy-could-see-public-get-right-to-challenge-parole-decisions-11349612,"It follows the outcry over the decision to release 'black cab rapist' John Worboys. A review ordered by Justice Secretary David Gauke has said most high-profile cases could be automatically reviewed without anyone lodging a challenge. But Ministry of Justice (MoJ) officials said there should also be a way for people to fight a criminal's release with having to resort to a lengthy and ""onerous"" judicial review. One possibility is an ""open approach"" where anyone who believes a case meets a certain threshold can ask for it to be reconsidered. Another option is to limit it only to the interested parties – normally the offender, Parole Board and Secretary of State. Victims could also be included, although they are not normally classed as a direct party to the Parole Board decision. Under the proposals, the decision to release an offender would be provisional for a certain time to allow for any challenges. The MoJ said some cases with ""strong public interest"" could trigger automatic reconsideration. Worboys' case would be likely to fit in that category. The 60-year-old was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years after being convicted of rape, sexual assault and drugging as he drove his cab around London. After a public outcry and a challenge by two victims, the High Court last month quashed the Parole Board's decision. Worboys will now be kept locked up until the case has been reassessed. Under the new scheme, the mechanism for challenging decisions will be judge-led but operated within a ""specialist division"" of the Parole Board. Any oral evidence sessions could be open to the public, with information released about panel members. :: How Parole Board rules may change following Worboys case Offenders who have reached the parole point in their sentence but been denied would also be able to use the new system. The shake-up will also bring forward legislation to lift the ban on the Parole Board releasing information about its decisions – another change prompted by the Worboys case. Members of the public and journalists will be able to apply to know the reasons behind a prisoner's release. Improvements will also be made to how victims are contacted and notified about someone's release. This again comes after some of Worboys' victims said they had found out about his release from the media. Justice Secretary David Gauke said: ""It is my ambition that the outcome of this process will mean victims have more confidence in the system. ""We have moved at pace to address the shortcomings of the parole system which the Worboys case has brought to light. ""But we must take a balanced approach. I am determined to lead a thorough reform process, the first action of which we launched today."" Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove welcomed the proposals but said ""the devil is in the detail"". She told Sky News: ""The Government has listened but there is a lot more work to do. ""We have to look at these proposals carefully. The devil is in the detail. We have to make sure victims' voices are heard."" The proposals are now open for consultation and people can give their views on the MoJ website."

2018-04-29,"The demise of Amber Rudd, once seen as a leading candidate for the Tory leadership, has been even swifter than her rapid rise to near the top of British politics.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/the-fall-of-amber-rudd-and-what-it-means-for-pm-11353265,"And the Windrush scandal, which has left her reputation in tatters, is just the latest example of how the Home Office is often seen as a graveyard for political careers. In modern times, only Theresa May has made the leap from Home Secretary to Prime Minister. And many MPs believe she and not her successor is really to blame for Windrush. The daughter of a stockbroker, Amber Rudd was educated at the elite Cheltenham Ladies College and Edinburgh University before working for investment bankers JP Morgan. And perhaps surprisingly for a politician with an unflashy image, she also worked on Richard Curtis' hit 1994 film Four Weddings And A Funeral as ""aristocracy co-ordinator"", which meant finding extras to appear in it. She appeared briefly in one of the church scenes herself. In the 1990s she was married to the writer and restaurant critic AA Gill, who died in 2016, and they had two children. He called her ""the Silver Spoon"" in his columns because of her privileged background. After being placed on David Cameron's A-list of parliamentary candidates, in 2010 she won the marginal seat of Hastings and Rye and was soon Parliamentary private secretary to the Chancellor, George Osborne. She was on her way. After spells as a Government whip and junior minister in the coalition government, she joined the Cabinet as Energy and Climate Change Secretary when Mr Cameron won a Tory majority in 2015. But it was the 2016 EU referendum campaign, which brought about the downfall of Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, that dramatically raised her profile. As a leading Remainer in the campaign, she was one of the stars of the TV debates and was involved in a memorable clash with the leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson. She firmly told Mr Johnson: ""You don't save money by leaving the EU, instead you have less for public services."" Her reward, when Theresa May became Prime Minister, was to succeed her at the Home Office, a top job but seen by many as a poisoned chalice. And it has been a turbulent 22 months. Her first Tory conference speech as Home Secretary, in 2016, was reported as a hate incident to police after she suggested that companies should be forced to disclose how many foreign workers they employ. She told the conference: ""The test should ensure people coming here are filling gaps in the market, not taking jobs British people could do."" But it was Windrush - and her apparent lack of grip on her department - that ended her tenure at the Home Office, despite a series of U-turns and apologies. Hundreds of people who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from the Caribbean countries have been called the Windrush generation as they arrived on the MV Empire Windrush. They were brought to the UK in response to post-war labour shortages in the UK and given indefinite leave to remain - but those without documents were recently told they needed evidence to continue working, get treatment from the NHS or to remain in the UK. Ms Rudd's downfall began on Monday last week when she apologised, saying: ""There's absolutely no question about their right to remain and I apologise about any wrongdoing to them."" She was ultimately undone by the forensic probing of the Home Affairs Select Committee, when her evidence was contradicted by her own civil servants, who have now had their revenge. She claimed: ""If you're asking me about numbers, that's not how we operate."" Besides a Home Secretary, Theresa May has also lost a key ally on the Brexit war cabinet as it tackles the vital issue of the customs union. Pro-Brexit MPs will shed few tears for her demise, but Remainers will be dismayed. As will Theresa May, who now Amber Rudd has gone will become the chief target for opposition attacks on Windrush."
2018-04-29,No excuses.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/the-obvious-brexit-link-in-the-uks-economic-slowdown-11348437,"Try as one might to blame the weather for the weakness of these GDP figures, to judge from what we have just heard from the Office for National Statistics, the economy was starting to sag well before the Beast from the East came in and disrupted UK economic activity. Consumers - the engine of the UK economy for decades - have been spending less and less in recent quarters. The services sector, which grew by around 2% a year in 2015 and 2016, is now growing by around 1% a year. The construction sector - always volatile - was certainly affected by the Beast. But activity was already trending lower well before the temperatures dropped. All of which is why overall growth is quite so weak. The first quarter's growth of 0.1% was the weakest since late 2012, when Britain was still suffering the effects of the euro crisis. Indeed, GDP per head, a better measure of how income growth across the country feels for the average person, actually fell by 0.1%. Now, it is worth treating these figures with a certain degree of caution. They are early, provisional numbers which are usually revised. And other measures of the UK economy, for instance purchasing managers indices, are not quite as weak. Nonetheless, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that Britain is facing what looks like a broad-based slowdown. And while the snow in March might well have worsened the GDP print for the first quarter of the year, it is only a part of the explanation. The economy is expected to bounce back in the following quarters, but even then the growth rate is expected to stay well below its long-term average - about 1.5% annual growth as compared to the 2.5% it used to enjoy before the crisis. Why so weak? It is hard to escape the conclusion that people and businesses are simply spending less because of nervousness about Brexit. Since no one knows precisely what kind of arrangement the UK will have with the EU in the coming years, no one knows precisely what to invest in, how much, and for how long. So everyone from businesses to consumers has tightened their belts. Nowhere is this more obvious than when you look at the breakdown of today's GDP numbers. In these early estimates we don't get a direct number on how much consumers spent (that'll come next month). But we can focus on consumer-facing industries. Only a couple of years ago these businesses that sell directly to households were enjoying growth of around 5% a year. In the past couple of quarters that has dropped down below 1% a year. In Q1, the growth rate was a mere 0.4%. So consumers are tightening their belts. And while other economies around the world are enjoying an acceleration in growth, Britain is facing a slowdown. One direct consequence: the Bank of England, which was previously expected to lift interest rates at its meeting next month, now seems likely to leave borrowing costs on hold. But probably only until August."
2018-04-29,A controversial floating nuclear power plant made by Russia has headed out for its first sea voyage.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/russias-floating-nuclear-plant-heads-out-to-sea-11349888,"The floating plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, was towed out of the St Petersburg shipyard where it was constructed on Saturday. It is to be pulled through the Baltic Sea and around the Norwegian coast to Murmansk, a city of 300,000 people, where its reactors are to be loaded with nuclear fuel. The Lomonosov is to be put into service in 2019 in the Arctic off the coast of Chukotka in the far northeast, providing power for a port town and for oil rigs. Rosatom, the state-owned atomic energy corporation, is the owner of the nuclear power plant. The website of OKBM Afrikantov, the power equipment company responsible for the design of the reactors and other elements, lists the project as a ""pilot design"". The vessel will have at least two nuclear reactors, according to World Nuclear News, of a type that are similar to those used on Russian nuclear-powered ice breakers. Unlike a normal ship, however, the Lomonosov is unable to move itself and relies on tugs. Several more floating plants are likely to be constructed if the Lomonosov is successful. The plant will mean an estimated 45,000 tons of fuel or diesel oil does not have to be used, according to OKBM Afrikantov's site. Floating plants are adapted to operate in hard-to-reach areas next to sea shores or the banks of large rivers far from centralised power supplies, the company says. As they are built to be situated on coasts, those behind the project say the floating plants are made to withstand tsunamis, tornados and other environmental impacts, as well as possible collisions with ships. The barge that would go on to house the plant was launched in June 2010. The project has been widely criticised by environmentalists. Greenpeace has dubbed it a ""floating Chernobyl"" and the ""nuclear Titanic"". ""Nuclear reactors bobbing around the Arctic Ocean will pose a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already under enormous pressure from climate change,"" said Jan Haverkamp, nuclear expert for Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe. Rosatom denied any risk however, with Vitaly Trutnev, director of Directorate for the Construction and Operation of Floating Nuclear Thermal Power Plants, a Rosatom's subsidiary, telling Sky News: ""It is a significant milestone for our project as well as for the whole world's nuclear industry. Floating nuclear power plants would enable electricity and heat supply to the most remote regions boosting growth and sustainable development. ""Building upon three hundreds of reactor-years of safe operation of units powering icebreakers, FNPP features the most cutting edge safety and security systems and is expected to be one of the safest nuclear installations in the world."""

They had launched a series of legal challenges to continue treatment for their 23-month-old son, who had a degenerative neurological condition. The Pope, who gave Alfie and his parents Italian citizenship as they tried to win permission to move him to Rome for treatment, said: ""I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie. Today I pray especially for his parents, as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace."" Hundreds of people gathered outside Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where the youngster had been treated, on Saturday afternoon to release balloons in his memory. :: Timeline: The fight to keep Alfie Evans alive Others left flowers outside the medical centre, with messages such as: ""We fell in love with a little boy we never knew. Alfie will be forever engraved in our heart. Fly high little man""; and ""Alfie you stole the heart of the world!"" Many were seen crying as they visited a scene where, on Monday, as passions ran high, police were forced to block dozens of people who tried to storm the hospital building. Thousands paid tribute on social media, with RIP Alfie Evans trending all morning, but their comments were often highly polarised over the courts' decisions. His story also featured heavily in news bulletins and on websites around the world. On Saturday morning, Kate Evans broke the news on the Alfie's Army Facebook page, saying: ""Our baby boy grew his wings tonight at 2:30 am. We are heart broken. Thankyou everyone for all your support."" Tom Evans said on the social network at around the same time: ""My gladiator lay down his shield and gained his wings at 02:30 absolutely heartbroken. I LOVE YOU MY GUY."" In February, Mr Justice Hayden ruled that doctors at Alder Hey could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents. The couple, from Liverpool, wanted to move their son from the city's Alder Hey Children's Hospital to Italy where they said doctors were willing to treat the little boy. The judge said he accepted medical evidence which showed that further treatment was futile. Court of Appeal judges upheld his decision, while Supreme Court justices and European Court of Human Rights judges refused to intervene. Alfie's life-support machine was switched off on Monday night. On Tuesday morning, Mr Evans said doctors were ""gobsmacked"" that his son was breathing nine hours after his life support ended and the couple went back to court in a bid to get permission to take him to Rome. Mr Justice Hayden said the family could instead ""explore"" the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home. :: Analysis: Who should decide how a terminally ill child dies? On Friday, his parents said they would work with doctors to ensure their son had the ""dignity and comfort he needs"". The public nature of the family's fight with doctors has led to the case being a cause celebre for some groups. Hospital bosses said they were ""shocked"" at the ""barrage"" of abuse received by some members of staff. Merseyside Police felt it necessary to issue a warning over comments being made about the hospital online. Archbishop of Liverpool, Malcolm McMahon, referred to the heated arguments taking place in a statement he made on behalf of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. :: Alfie Evans' family pledge to 'build bridge' with doctors He said: ""I would like to express my deepest sympathy at this moment of loss to Tom and Kate as we hold little Alfie in our prayers. ""All who have been touched by the story of this little boy's heroic struggle for life will feel this loss deeply. But as a Christian Alfie has the promises of God, who is love, to welcome him into his heavenly home. ""Although the past few weeks have been difficult with much activity on social media, we must recognise that all who have played a part in Alfie's life have wanted to act for his good, as they see it. ""Above all, we must thank Tom and Kate for their unstinting love of their son, and the staff at Alder Hey Hospital for their professional care of Alfie. ""Now it is time for us to give Tom and Kate space to grieve their son's death and offer our prayers for him and consolation for all."" Alder Hey hospital said in a statement: ""We wish to express our heartfelt sympathy and condolences to Alfie's family at this extremely distressing time. ""All of us feel deeply for Alfie, Kate, Tom and his whole family and our thoughts are with them. ""This has been a devastating journey for them and we would ask that their privacy and the privacy of staff at Alder Hey is respected."""

Joe Clarke, national officer for Sainsbury's at the union Unite, told Sky News the potential deal was an ""absolute shocker"", with ""implications for tens of thousands of jobs"". Staff were in ""utter disarray"" and ""absolutely shocked"", he said, adding that Unite was asking for ""senior level discussions"" with both companies ""immediately"". Retail analyst Natalie Berg said there would ""naturally be some job losses"" if the deal went ahead, partly because there would be some ""reduction in duplication at head office"". Asked how individual shops might be affected, Mr Clarke said: ""Obviously, if you've got stores in close location to one another, stores will close."" He added that the deal, if it went ahead, would have ""severe implications"" for workers in both supermarket chains. ""There's 350 people working in any given store,"" he said, adding that the companies had to ""consider the people they employ"". Mr Clarke said news of a potential merger came at an already difficult time for Sainsbury's staff. Sky News reported in March that the chain was facing opposition to a pay shake-up that it said would give its store staff a ""leading rate"" in the sector. But it also admitted that a pay rise would mean the end of its discretionary annual bonus and paid breaks, and said the changes could result in a small number of workers losing out financially. Mr Clarke said staff had been in discussions ""for two months now"" and had just found out ""from the media that all along they've been in discussions behind the scenes with Asda for merger"". He said Unite was asking Sainsbury's to withdraw from the talks about a pay shake-up. Ms Berg told Sky News there were ""unprecedented levels of change"" in the sector because of the ""onslaught of the discounters"". In the last five years, Aldi and Lidl have grown their combined market share by 80%, she said. There was also the increase in online shopping to consider, and ""rising costs and subdued consumer demand"". All that means ""consolidation is inevitable"", she said."
2018-04-29,Commonwealth Games organisers are being urged to change their minds and build a new velodrome in the West Midlands for the Birmingham games in 2022.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180429232322/https://news.sky.com/story/commonwealth-velodrome-would-be-golden-opportunity-for-west-midlands-11349567,"Olympic champion Chris Boardman is the latest big name in cycling to say that a new velodrome would be an ""asset"" to the city. The current plan is to hold the track cycling in 2022 at the Lee Valley VeloPark in east London - 130 miles away - the venue for the Olympic Games in 2012. Organisers in Birmingham say they have conducted a ""rigorous"" evaluation and believe London is the most cost effective and realistic option despite a growing online petition, complaints from MPs and anger amongst the cycling community in the West Midlands. The Olympic gold medallist from the 1992 games, Chris Boardman, has told Sky News that while it has to be a sensible business decision, demand for new facilities is still growing. ""Birmingham needs to decide - what do you want to be known for? ""If you want to put on a big sporting event then it needs facilities and those facilities are whatever you make of them afterwards - the Commonwealth Games is the opportunity to do that,"" said Boardman. ""I think a velodrome would be an asset for Birmingham but you would have to work at it, you would have to have a strategy around it to leverage it and link it in to other things going on in the area."" This weekend Boardman is opening the UK's first wind tunnel specifically built for cyclists, a project in Evesham in Worcestershire that has taken years to develop but under 12 months to build. In his view, a new velodrome could be opened by 2022 if the will and money were in place to do it. ""Four years is not long in building terms but it is certainly enough,"" he said. Birmingham has had less time than usual to organise the games after Durban in South Africa dropped out of the running for 2022. At Halesowen, one of the few outdoor cycling tracks in the West Midlands, 14-year-old cyclist Kinga Ingram explained to Sky News the difficulties of not having an indoor facility locally. Having only taken up the sport two years ago, Kinga is already ranked fifth in the country for her age group and has a realistic chance of making the England squad for the 2022 Games in her home city. She told Sky News: ""It is two hours to get to Derby or Newport and you are sat in the car after a hard training session for two hours cramped up and it just causes injury. ""You are getting home late, you are tired at school... I had a really nasty injury myself from travelling in the car a lot and having late nights and not enough sleep, and I tore my hamstring and it took me out for three months."" In a recent open letter, cycling legend and commentator Hugh Porter from Wolverhampton urged the authorities to reconsider. He wrote: ""I call upon Birmingham City Council, British Cycling and other decision makers to revisit the decision not to build an indoor velodrome in Birmingham and to make it possible for the people of the West Midlands to enjoy the many benefits of having their own indoor velodrome."" Halesowen Cycling Club chairman David Viner told Sky News it was a ""golden opportunity"" that was being missed by games organisers to open up cycling to deprived and diverse communities in the West Midlands. He said: ""All we are saying for cycling is to be treated with the same respect with which athletics is being treated, or swimming or other sports. ""To have the track cycling in London makes the track cycling a total irrelevance as far as the Commonwealth Games is concerned... the Birmingham Commonwealth Games."" A Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said: ""We have yet to formally announce the complete Birmingham 2022 sports and venue line up. We anticipate doing this in the coming months. ""When deciding on venues and locations for all sports, a full and rigorous evaluation has been carried out, looking at existing local venues, followed by an examination of regional venues where suitable local options do not exist, and finally any facilities further afield where there are no local or regional options. ""As part of its bid process Birmingham explored other regional velodrome options as well as new and temporary facilities, but the options were neither compliant nor economically viable. ""We hope that the existing velodromes in the UK, including Derby Arena, are able to play a role as training venues."""

It made $250m (£181.5m) in ticket sales during its opening weekend in the US, narrowly beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens for the highest opening weekend ever. However, taking inflation into account would mean the Star Wars film still holds the US record, with about $260m (£188.5m) in today's dollars. Dave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney, said: ""To have now the biggest movie of domestic history as one of the Marvel cinematic universe films seems like a fitting tribute to the Marvel Studios team which has had just an astounding, unmatched run in the last decade."" Starring Robert Downey Jr, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Josh Brolin and many more A-listers, the film had a reported $300m-$400m production budget. It brings together more than 20 superheroes including Iron Man, Captain America, Spider-Man, Black Widow and Black Panther for an all-out battle with supervillain Thanos. Plot details have been shrouded in secrecy, but several major characters die or appear to be killed off. Many film websites and blogs put odds on which characters will not make it with Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, coming out on top in many. Last week the directors asked fans not to give away spoilers. Anthony and Joseph Russo also encouraged enthusiasts to stay away from social media if they want to enjoy the surprises. The two-hour and 40-minute film was shot over 18 months, with a sequel due out in May next year."

Patel, who has been banned for 18 months, activated his Tesla S 60's autopilot function before changing seats, St Albans Crown Court heard. The move left the steering wheel and foot pedals unmanned. The driver later admitted to Stevenage police that he knew what he had done was ""silly"" but the car was capable of something ""amazing"". He added that he was just the ""unlucky one who got caught"". Patel, from Nottingham, had activated autopilot while the car was in motion on the northbound carriageway between junctions 8 and 9. A passenger in another car spotted him and filmed his Tesla as it drove past at roughly 7.40pm on 21 May 2017. The footage was posted on social media before Patel was reported to the police. He received a Notice of Intended Prosecution in the post before being interviewed by officers at Stevenage Police Station. As part of the investigation, officers obtained a statement from a Tesla engineer who described autopilot as a ""suite of driver assistance features"". The engineer added that the features were intended to provide assistance to a ""fully-attentive driver"". Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) assists with the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle while Autosteer provides assistance with steering. Tesla states that drivers should ""never depend on TACC to adequately slow down the model S, to always watch the road in front of you, and be prepared to take corrective action at all times"". The manufacturer adds that ""failure to do so can result in serious injury or death"". Investigating officer PC Kirk Caldicutt said: ""What Patel did was grossly irresponsible and could have easily ended in tragedy. ""He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day. ""This case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar. ""I want to stress that they are in no way a substitute for a competent motorist in the driving seat who can react appropriately to the road ahead. ""I hope Patel uses his disqualification period to reflect on why he chose to make such a reckless decision on that day."" Patel was also given 100 hours of unpaid work, ordered to carry out 10 days of rehabilitation and pay £1,800 in costs to the Crown Prosecution Service."
