2018-01-01,Sixteen-time world champion Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor is widely regarded as the greatest darts player ever to have graced the oche.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/world-darts-championship-what-makes-phil-the-power-taylor-great-11191599,"He now faces his final challenge in the form of the 2018 PDC World Darts Championship - his last event before retirement. Ahead of the final, some of the 57-year-old's greatest rivals and allies share their memories of playing against him. Peter Manley The guy was on a different planet at the time. He was out there on his own and it was very difficult to play him. You weren't just playing Phil, you were playing the whole audience at the Circus Tavern. They would sing ""there's only one Phil Taylor"" from start to finish and eventually that can grind you down. In two of my finals which I lost 7-0, there were a few sets which I lost 3-2 and they could have gone either way. But full credit to the man. I did whatever I could to put him off but he was above everything that anyone ever did. John Part I played him when he was in his prime. He was dominant and confident. If you had 146 left, you had to take it out because he was on a double. If, by some chance, you were on a double and he had 146 he'd take it out, every time. So there was a ruthlessness about him. It can be debilitating. It's not fear, it's resignation. He built an invincibility stigma. He didn't get 110 averages in those days but he didn't have to because he was already so far past everyone else. Dennis Priestley I have some great memories of playing Phil but I would like to have had better! I was competitive up until the 2000 final and bearing in mind Phil is 10 years younger than me he has managed to last so much longer. What stands out is that he was always so dedicated and practised very hard. I was a good professional and did things right but Phil always seemed to put an extra yard in or find an extra yard. He will do really well again this year but I feel for him on the schedule. If he gets through the early rounds I think he will have to play three days on the trot and I know myself getting older how much that will take out of him. Raymond van Barneveld I've played him four times at the Worlds now. He's won two times and I've won two times. They were all top, top games, but despite beating him in 2007, I didn't have good memories in 2009 when he won 7-1 - that was a bit tough. Adrian Lewis He's been saying for a couple of years that the time is right. He will miss the competitiveness and the buzz, and I'll be sad to see him go. He's had a great career and nobody will emulate what he has done. I will miss the banter in the practice room. His determination and concentration levels are second to none. I remember when I lost to Peter Manley in the quarters at my first ever World Championship, he beat Mark Dudbridge in the final. After he won he told me: ""I'll see you at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning"". I thought he was joking. But no, we practised the morning after he won the world title. It wouldn't surprise me if, in 2019, we see some breaking news from the PDC. Rod Harrington I played him in the 1995 final, but I wasn't at my best then. I think I could have easily been 4-0 up after winning the first two sets. But he pulled it back to 2-2 with two big checkouts in the last legs and that was like the kick in the teeth that put me down. Phil moved on and eventually beat me quite comfortably. I think I was world number one at the time and beat him plenty of times in those years, especially over the shorter distances. But the leg-on-leg pressure that he puts on people - and still does - was the thing that was hard to cope with. There was never a leg that you won when he was 200 away. There wasn't a lot between us back then and I was coming into the Worlds with plenty of confidence, but I just kind of ran out of steam. I do remember thinking ""this is my time to beat Phil"", but it wasn't to be. Wayne Mardle He made players panic - that's his big trait because I'll always remember playing Phil and feeling that way. At his best he made you believe that he would never miss. Of course he might miss! He wasn't always taking out 161s and going out in 12 darts but he made you believe that's what he was doing. From the first shot of the first leg, you were thinking: ""I can't miss doubles, I will only get one chance to break, I have to take it."" Phil was so good and so relentless that you believed your only chance was the one that had just happened. You believed that nothing else would go your way. John Lowe Phil has been brilliant for the sport since taking over from me and Eric Bristow. I played against Phil for 10 years because he's been playing for longer than people think. Eric once said to me: ""This guy is good"". The first time I played Phil was in Canada and I saw straight away that he was a natural. He told me that he copied my throw, which was a nice compliment. It's a good thing that he has decided to quit, bearing in mind that he hasn't won a world title in years. If he gets to the semi-final, he'll have done exceptionally well. Bob Anderson They (the matches against him) were usually a headache. I think I played Phil about 30 odd times and managed to get past him on five occasions I think and I was quite pleased with that. He was hard work to play against - extremely professional and he had an uncanny habit of looking as though he was going to miss and then hit the double with the last dart. That was soul destroying. He was a wonderful player. Obviously, 16 world titles is an incredible record. I know what it took out of me to win one so I take my hat off to him. I think it is probably the right time for him to retire. I knew when it was time for me to go and I am sure Phil realises maybe now is the time for him.

2018-01-01,Dinner For One is a cultural phenomenon. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/why-is-germany-obsessed-with-this-obscure-british-film-11190506,"The 18-minute British sketch has dominated German television every New Year's Eve since 1972, has spawned catchphrases and drinking games, and is almost unheard of in the UK. The black-and-white sketch stars Freddie Frinton as James, an elderly butler serving May Warden's Miss Sophie on her 90th birthday. Miss Sophie has invited her four closest friends for a celebratory dinner, the only problem being that these friends are all long deceased. James is forced to take their place, stumbling around the dinner table, adopting their voices and personas and making toasts on their behalf, knocking back four glasses of sherry, white wine, champagne and port in the process This is clearly not the first time James has had to endure this alcoholic onslaught. Before each course, James asks ""same procedure as last year?"" - to which Miss Sophie replies ""same procedure as every year"". This has become a common expression in Germany, and is an accurate summation of the attitude of German audiences to their much loved film. The sketch ends with a soused and unsteady James escorting Miss Sophie up to her bedroom, with an innuendo-laden ""same procedure as last year?...Well, I'll do my very best."" Millions of Germans plan their New Year's Eve celebrations around the sketch and can quote it line by line. Some even attempt to match James drink for drink, which is no mean feat. According to the Hollywood Reporter, more than 17 million people - around 21% of the German population - tuned in to watch the sketch on 31 December 2016. By comparison, the most watched show in the UK was the final of the Great British Bake Off, which was watched by 15.9 million people. The Dinner for One craze has also spread to Scandinavia, South Africa and Australia. Despite this international success, only 13% of Brits have ever heard of the film, and just 8% said they have actually seen it. Dr Rainer Stollmann, professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bremen, says most Germans are unaware of their beloved film's obscurity in the UK. ""90% of Germans have not realised this,"" Prof Stollmann told me. ""Germans know it as well as they know some of the Grimm fairy tales. They can quote lines from it."" Unsuspecting Brits in Germany might even have the film's catchphrase thrown at them by Germans, assuming the sketch is as well known in the UK as it is Germany. But why did this sketch find a home in Germany and fall into obscurity in the UK? A spokesperson for NDR, a German broadcaster that airs the sketch, said it had ""a timeless humour"" which harks back to ""a nostalgic memory of a time when the entire family used to come together to watch TV"". Prof Stollmann argues Brits are put off by the sketch as it forces them to confront the country's class structure as well as painful moments in its imperial past. The butler repeatedly stumbles over a tiger skin rug laid on the floor, a clear symbol of Britain's occupation of India. The film doesn't have this connection in Germany. Prof Stollmann argues that German audiences merely see the sketch as an illustration of ""a British flair"" and, despite appearing quintessentially British, exudes ""German humour in a British costume"". Regardless of the cause of the sketch's popularity, it has been a mainstay of German festive viewing for nearly 50 years. So, German audiences remain captivated by this silly piece of British slapstick from the sixties. It is a comforting routine. The same procedure as every year."
2018-01-01,"Four people have been stabbed to death in London, in a string of apparently unrelated murders on New Year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/four-londoners-stabbed-to-death-during-new-year-11191497,"Four men between the ages of 17 and 20 have died between New Year's Eve and the early hours on Monday as a result of injuries inflicted by knife attacks. A fifth man is also in a critical condition following another stabbing incident on the first day of January, Scotland Yard said. The four incidents happened in north, east and south London, and none are being treated as linked. Five males have been arrested in connection with one of the murders, which took place in Enfield in the morning of New Year's Eve. The other attacks took place in Tulse Hill, West Ham and Old Street. ""There were thousands of officers on duty across London yesterday and throughout the night, all determined to play their part in keeping the public safe,"" Met Police Commander Neil Jerome said. ""It is heart-breaking that, at a time when so many of us are contemplating what lies ahead in 2018, four families are dealing with the grief of losing a loved one to senseless violence and the callous use of knives as lethal weapons."" Commander Jerome thanked Londoners and tourists for co-operating with police during New Year celebrations, but added ""there were small groups who chose to engage in disorder and violence, and whose actions have had utterly tragic consequences"". ""I can assure Londoners - and the families and friends of the four males killed and the fifth who remains in hospital - that detectives will work tirelessly to bring to justice those responsible for such despicable acts of violence,"" he said. :: The Met Police is urging anyone with any information to call police on 101. If they wish to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2018-01-01,The use of counter-censorship technology is increasing in Iran after the authorities blocked access to popular communications services.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/iranian-web-crackdown-drives-surge-in-privacy-technology-11191740,"Photo-sharing app Instagram and encrypted messaging app Telegram have been blocked in the country despite president Hassan Rouhani claiming he would allow ""space for legal criticism"" as demonstrations against the clerical regime continue. Despite the potential disruption to communications provided by these blocks, the use of anonymity network Tor has increased to its highest ever number in the country. Metrics collected by the Tor developers show a spike in usage in recent days driving close to 9,000 users connecting to the network directly from Iran. Tor encrypts its users' internet connections and relays them through other machines, allowing people to hide their location and identity from anyone engaging in network surveillance. Metrics are not available regarding the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to route around the state's network controls, but they are known to be popular in the country. :: Iran protests: 'Police officer shot dead and three wounded' Dr Steven Murdoch, a researcher at UCL and a contributor to the Tor project, explained to Sky News how the Iranian authorities were able to block access to those apps. ""For the vast majority of internet services, including Instagram and Telegram, a user's device must connect to a particular IP address or domain name. ""A country who controls the user's internet connection can quite easily identify which IP addresses and domain names correspond to a particular service, and block them."" ""It takes considerable effort to design a service that is resistant to such blocking, but it is possible,"" Dr Murdoch said. ""Tor is one example of a technology that allows its users to browse webpages that would otherwise be blocked. Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are another approach to bypass blocking, though it is possible that VPN services will keep track of what people do and hand this information over to government."" The founder and chief executive of blocked app Telegram, Pavel Durov, said that the Iranian government was blocking access to his app because the company refused to shut down discussions regarding peaceful protests. Iranian authorities are blocking access to Telegram for the majority of Iranians after our public refusal to shut down https://t.co/9E4kXZYcP9 and other peacefully protesting channels. In a statement on Telegram, Mr Durov said: ""We are proud that Telegram is used by thousands of massive opposition channels all over the world. ""We consider freedom of speech an undeniable human right, and would rather get blocked in a country by its authorities than limit peaceful expression of alternative opinions."" President Trump tweeted: ""Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!"" He added: ""Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!"" Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good! Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE! Ironically, US sanctions may be hindering Iranians' ability to circumvent the clerical regime's censorship. Dr Murdoch told Sky News that ""the instant messaging service Signal also has the ability to bypass blocking, by disguising itself amongst Google's services. This technique has been deployed in Egypt and UAE. ""However as a result of US sanctions, Google blocks users from Iran from accessing many of its services, including the one that Signal uses to resist blocking."" Google did not immediately respond to Sky News for comment regarding why this service would be covered by sanctions against Iran."
2018-01-01,"About 1,400 vehicles have been destroyed as a fire engulfed a multi-storey car park next to Liverpool Echo Arena.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/fire-has-destroyed-all-vehicles-in-large-liverpool-car-park-police-say-11191272,"Crews rescued two dogs from one of the vehicles inside car park as they battled the blaze, the fire service said. They were thought to be the only animals in the park at the time. The area has a capacity of 1,600 cars - and 1,400 vehicles were estimated to be parked at the time of the blaze, with all of them destroyed. Liverpool's mayor, Joe Anderson, said the blaze started in a Land Rover on the third level of the multi-storey car park - and police believe this caused other vehicles to ignite. There were periodic explosions and flames shooting up the outside of the building as the cars inside burned. Merseyside Police have described the fire as accidental, adding: ""We believe that all vehicles parked in the car park have been destroyed and advise owners to contact their insurance companies."" No one has been seriously injured, but crews trying to contain the blaze were hampered by strong winds. A reception centre has been set up nearby for people who are unable to get home. The huge blaze next to the Echo Arena, which is on the city's waterfront, forced organisers to cancel the Liverpool International Horse Show. Horses which were on the first level of the car park when the fire broke out were moved into the arena. Nearby buildings - including some apartments - were evacuated because of smoke billowing from the fire. Crews were first called to the car park at 4.42pm and were on scene eight minutes later."
2018-01-01,"The new year arrives with the prospect of greatness. The return of Wes Anderson, Roseanne and Jack White could make 2018 one to remember.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/ones-to-watch-2018s-most-exciting-movies-tv-and-music-11191663,"On the big screen... One of them is Lady Bird, actress Greta Gerwig's acclaimed directorial debut about a teenage girl growing up in California. The film stars Saoirse Ronan and has been so well received it broke the Rotten Tomatoes record with 100% positive reviews. Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Gina Rodriguez star, with Oscar Isaac returning for a supporting role. The film follows an expedition of biologists to an environmental disaster zone, where they find things that challenge their perceptions of reality. But having Joaquin Phoenix play Jesus and Rooney Mara play Mary Magdalene shows that this seemingly commercial director has some arthouse in him. We hope for the best. However, if you're a big Pacific Rim fan, chances are it won't be much of a conundrum. Not only does this promise to be another monster/robot clash of epic proportions, but it also brings back director Guillermo del Toro - only this time in the producer's chair. Del Toro could be on his way to an Oscar for Shape Of Water, so has delegated the dirty work to Steven S DeKnight, a man known only for mediocre TV shows. Hoping for the best but expecting the worst. Yes, one could argue Wes Anderson has become a parody of himself, falling into the traps of set design and losing the innocence which made his debut Bottle Rocket such a fundamental piece of film. But one thing Isle of Dogs has in its favour, is that it acts as the spiritual sequel to Fantastic Mr Fox, one of Anderson's best works. The movie tells the story of a 12-year-old Japanese boy who sets off alone in search of his bodyguard-dog, Spots. The cast is every person Wes Anderson has ever met and then some. A who's who of Hollywood A-listers including Bryan Cranston, Ed Norton, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Following in the footsteps of his fellow continentals, he has migrated to Hollywood with a basket full of A-listers including Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz. The two Rachels play childhood friends whose desires are taboo in New York's Orthodox Jewish community. The reason being that its two original directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, were fired by Lucasfilm for being too bold, and have been replaced by Ron Howard. Knowing Ron, the film will follow protocol and ensure that fans have a good dosage of mind-numbing entertainment and a completely unnecessary backstory. You might think all-female reboots of modern classics don't really work - not in the box office and not among fans or critics. That didn't stop the terrible Gary Ross from putting together eight of the most interesting women in cinema to pull off a heist so boring you struggle to finish the trailer. Still, the stellar cast, which includes Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Cater, will surely do their best to save the project. It's worth giving it a shot. It's not like the first Ocean's film is Ghostbusters-good, so there is less room for ruin. Elle Fanning plays Frankenstein author Mary Shelley, in the story of how she came to write her most famous novel and her romance with Percy Shelley, played by Douglas Booth. The movie also stars Game Of Thrones' Maisie Williams and Tom Sturridge, and is likely to make even the most millennial of spectators fall for period drama. This is where things get weird - and interesting. Indie director David Gordon Green has taken on the Herculean and seemingly unnecessary task of once again rebooting one of the great horror classics. The movie has been written by John Carpenter himself and brings back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, who will face Michael Myers (apparently) for the last time. Good luck with that. Scottish director David Mackenzie has spoiled us. His last two works, Starred Up and Hell or High Water, are among the greatest films of the century. Now he is back with the story of Robert the Bruce. Yes, the good-hearted coward from Braveheart. Only, this time, it aims to actually tell the story of the Scottish king, whose courage was essential to defeat the English army. Chris Pine, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Florence Pugh star in the main roles. Upcoming TV shows... With no date set so far, we at least know that Dolores and the Westworld gang will return some time in the spring. HBO and Sky Atlantic are looking to fill the hole that will be left by Game Of Thrones in two years' time and are putting all their eggs into a sci-fi basket. With its tricks, twists and turns, Westworld has left many questions - and die-hard fans are hoping to have them answered. As if there weren't already enough superheroes in our lives, Netflix has decided to recycle the lamest bunch of all. The Defenders were a disgrace, but Daredevil put on a good show and Jessica Jones was mildly entertaining. The best thing we can say about season two is tht we hope it's better than the first. A nostalgia boost with a pinch of sarcasm, Roseanne is back more than 20 years after it first aired. ABC made a good bet and is sure to do well with bringing back the much-loved show, something newer players like Netflix have already done with Fuller House and Arrested Development. If having Amy Adams make her TV debut wasn't exciting enough, this is an adaptation of Gillian Flynn's debut novel by the same name. Flynn wrote two other novels which have been adapted for the big screen, Dark Places and Gone Girl, the latter being picked up by David Fincher. Sharp Objects is the story of a newspaper journalist who must return to her hometown to report on a series of murders. Now for the music... Jack White has promised a new solo album but given very little detail about what to expect. The golden boy of White Stripes fame has released a solo album before, but says this one will be ""good gardening music or roofing music or, you know, back-alley stabbing music"". Sounds... great. This one has a name. Resistance Is Futile will be the band's 13th album and has been described as ""widescreen melancholia"". ""The main themes of Resistance is Futile are memory and loss; forgotten history; confused reality and art as a hiding place and inspiration,"" said a band statement. Kevin Shields' band will ""100%"" release a new album this year. That is according to Shields himself. ""Basically, the record started off as an EP, and I realised it has to be, like, a mini-album, because it's going to be at least 40 minutes long,"" he said. ""So it's going to be an album, but I don't really know how many tracks it's going to be. It'll probably be seven or eight, by the looks of it."" There will also be a summer tour. Responding to a fan on Twitter, frontman Ezra Koenig said the album was ""80% done"" and promised we could expect it this year. Mitsubishi Macchiato is the title, but not much else is known. ""I wanted to do something that at least has elements of spring time you know, because life has to keep going,"" he said. For those noughties bangers who miss the good old days of loud, angry music, The Prodigy have confirmed a new album is on the way. The band haven't released anything since 2015's The Day Is My Enemy. This started out as a rumour but has now been confirmed. The band's sixth album will pick up where they left off nearly four years ago. Bassist Nick O'Malley said that the album should be out in 2018 and that ""if it isn't, we've got problems"", according to NME. Casablancas is back with a new band. The Strokes frontman is now of The Voidz, and his sophomore record has already premiered in a few underground gigs. One of the album's tracks is called Wink, and there is not much more to say."
2018-01-01,"As the biggest rail fare rises since 2013 kick in, it is time to make complaining and claiming compensation far easier, writes Alex Hayman, head of public markets at Which?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/raw-deal-trains-must-be-run-for-passengers-not-the-rail-firms-11192639,"Many of us will travel to work today on an overcrowded, dirty or unreliable train service - and wonder why this ordeal is costing more money than ever. Rail season tickets are going up by an average of 3.4% but many passengers do not feel they are seeing a return for the extra costs. Satisfaction with value for money over the last decade has stayed stubbornly low and is unlikely to improve after this latest round of price hikes. We deserve trains that are run for passengers, not just the rail industry. When services fail to deliver, passengers need to be able to get the compensation they are owed and have access to a system that handles their complaints properly. The industry and government must urgently address this imbalance if they are to rebuild passenger trust. :: New Year rail fare hikes at five-year high What do passengers say about train services? Which? heard stories from thousands of angry and frustrated rail passengers in 2017. There were complaints about dangerous overcrowding, filthy carriages and services that only run on time one day in five. Others reported that unreliable train services were putting an unbearable strain on their work or home life - and that attempts to complain or claim compensation were ignored. We even heard from disabled passengers enduring agonising pain standing packed in trains ""like sardines"" and one man who urinated in his seat because his train lacked a disabled access toilet. Why are rail passengers getting such a raw deal? Passengers are shelling out more and more for season tickets, but some are still arriving at their destination late and frustrated. Many people have no choice about which train operator they travel with - and some may feel they are being unfairly squeezed to boost profits, with no sign of improvements to the services they pay for. To make matters worse, the rail sector has too often left passengers as an afterthought when making big changes. Is it possible to run a decent train service in this country? Our rail survey last year showed some operators proving it is possible to provide a service passengers are happy with. Merseyrail and Translink were among operators with punctual and reliable services, with carriages in good condition. However, commuters on some of the most popular routes, such as South Eastern and Southern, have endured nightmarish journeys and levels of service. There is no reason why they shouldn't do much better. What can be done to fix the rail system for passengers? If trust in the industry - currently stuck at a woeful 28% - is to be improved, train companies and the Government need to do much more to improve the lot of passengers. When things go wrong, passengers must be clearly informed about their rights to compensation for delays and cancellations. Claiming should be made simpler and easier and compensation should be paid out automatically, where possible. When people want to complain, they need somewhere to turn where they can trust their complaints will be resolved promptly, fairly and impartially. The Government has announced a new independent ombudsman for rail complaints. And when the scheme is introduced, it's crucial that all train companies sign up so all passengers can get their complaints dealt with."

Mr Kim also proclaimed that the isolated state achieved the historic feat of ""completing"" its nuclear forces in 2017. The speech, broadcast on North Korean television on Monday morning, suggests escalating tensions over the nation's weapons programme are not going to die down in the coming year. He reiterated that North Korea has developed the capability to strike all of the US mainland with its nuclear weapons, and claimed this meant that America would never be able to start a war against the country. During the speech, he emphasised ""these weapons will be used only if our security is threatened"". :: Sky Views - How to avoid war with North Korea Mr Kim also announced that the country is going to focus on ""mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment"" in 2018. Striking a conciliatory note regarding relations with neighbouring South Korea, Mr Kim said he was ""open to dialogue"" with Seoul. ""When it comes to North-South relations, we should lower the military tensions on the Korean Peninsula to create a peaceful environment. Both the North and the South should make efforts,"" he added. He also suggested Pyongyang may send a delegation to the Winter Olympic Games, which is due to be held in the South Korean city of Pyeongchang in February. The US State Department is yet to respond to Mr Kim's New Year address. Asked by reporters to comment on his speech, Donald Trump simply said ""we'll see, we'll see"" as he strolled into a New Year's Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Last week, the UN Security Council unanimously passed new sanctions in response to North Korea's recent intercontinental ballistic missile test - restricting vital oil supplies. Fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula were raised after Pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September - defying international warnings and sanctions. In response, North Korea's official news agency described the sanctions as ""an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region"". Days later, it emerged that a North Korean soldier who defected to the South in 2017 has anthrax antibodies in his bloodstream - sparking fears that Mr Kim's regime could use the disease as a biological weapon."

For example, don't resolve to ""get a whole new body"" - instead pledge to lose a dress size by March, and thereafter lose 2lbs every month. By setting milestones and time-bound goals, you stand a much better chance of success. 2. It's natural to slip up - but don't let minor setbacks crush your plans. If one day you don't make it to the gym, it's not the end of the world. Don't use it as an excuse to beat yourself up and eat the cake in the cupboard. Instead, change your mindset and turn it into a definitive ""critical moment"". Fit in a five-minute walk instead and get back to your gym routine tomorrow. 3. Reward yourself for success. Don't think of what you're giving up, but what you're gaining. For example, if you're giving up smoking, save all the money you would have spent on cigarettes and spend the money on a holiday at the end of the year. 4. Buddy up with a partner - they can reinforce your resolution and share in your pain. Appoint an accountability manager - a relative or a good friend who wants to see you succeed - you stand a much better chance of succeeding with someone keeping an eye on your progress. 5. It's not always about giving something up.  Your resolution can be to start something new - a pottery class or salsa dancing. The key is for it be something fun and constructive, plus you get to learn a whole new skillset at the same time. Fitness expert Laura Williams: 1. Don't ditch your favourite treat/tipple at the same time as embarking on a new exercise regime. You'll feel fabulous and empowered on day one, but by day 14 you'll be dreaming of Domino's under the duvet. Undertake one thing at a time if you're in it for the long haul. 2. Get fitness savvy fast. Do a little bit of research before you hit your post-Christmas bod with daily HIIT sessions. Is the nausea-inducing burpee really where you need to be? Or would a well-rounded routine that ticks multiple fitness boxes and which you can sustain week in, week out be a better fit? 3 Think feel-good factor on every level. Yes, the spinning studio makes for a good selfie and will help to whittle your waistline but having a goal to keep fitness sociable will help keep you feeling excited and optimistic about exercise. You can even fit altruism into your routine with a running club like GoodGym, which combines exercise with community projects. 4. Have a ""dream goal"" and a ""settle-for"" goal. Two goals are crucial for navigating your way to long lasting change. Losing two stone for Valentine's Day is a big ask; initially committing to lose a couple of pounds a week, for at least six weeks through diet and exercise will get you good results that you'll be happy with. 5. Pay attention to the maths as much as the macros. Calorie counting is making a comeback as we realise that all the coconut oil and cardio in the world won't get us to where we want to go shape-wise if the maths don't add up. A little awareness around the energy content of what you're eating versus the energy expenditure of what you'd doing is often enough to result in some serious shape-shifting. So don't burn your takeaway menus just yet. Doctor Ellie Cannon: 1. People often aim too high when setting fitness goals. An example is signing up for a gym and then planning to go four times a week. Aiming lower is not copping out. In fact walking for 30 minutes, five times a week could actually be better for you. 2. Sleep is underappreciated. If you're aiming for a less stressful 2018, improving your sleep quantity and quality can do wonders for your mental health. Aim for a couple of early nights per week and see how it makes you feel. You will be surprised at how much better you feel once you are getting enough sleep. 3. Be proactive. In the UK we tend to be reactive about our well-being, rather than embracing preventative healthcare. Check if you're due any vaccinations or check-ups. Women can get up to date with smear tests, men over 65 should book aneurysm tests. Now's the time for asthma check-ups, NHS over-40 health checks and flu jabs too. 4. Disconnect. Social media and online connectivity are good things in many ways, but they are also disruptive of relationships and can be damaging to mental health. It is unrealistic to cut yourself off from all social media, but a small reduction is doable. Ring fence one hour per day when you disconnect - maybe first thing in the morning or during your journey to work - and read a book instead. 5. Conduct a friendship audit. Isolation and loneliness are bad for both your physical and mental health. Taking time to reconnect with people who make you feel good and nurture your resilience is a powerful thing to do, and will set you up for the year. With forward planning, a little will-power and plenty of determination, 2018 could be the year you achieve your goals. Good luck!"

A female was also assaulted in the attack in the west of the city, which happened at around 7.45pm.

The 96-year-old reportedly made the comment when he spotted a tall man with a long ginger beard. A witness, who claimed to have overheard the incident, was quoted by The Sun as saying: ""The man appeared to be his with wife and child. Philip was wishing lots of people a Happy New Year and then he spotted this guy with his distinctive beard. ""He pointed at him in a funny way and turned to one of his Royal bodyguards, saying: 'Is that a terrorist?' ""He was obviously having a little joke, but he said it within earshot of the man who burst out laughing and appeared to find the whole thing hilarious. I think Philip knew he was going to be overheard."" Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the claims. The Queen, Princess Anne and Prince Edward also attended the morning service at the Norfolk church, where the Royals traditionally spend Christmas. Prince Philip stepped down from Royal duties earlier this year after decades of service and more than 22,000 engagements. Past comments that have caused controversy include asking a group of Aboriginal Australians in 2002: ""Do you still throw spears at each other?""

2018-01-01,"Commuters are being ""priced out of going to work"" by the largest rail fare increase in five years, according to a campaign group.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/new-year-rail-fare-hikes-at-five-year-high-11192715,"Passengers catching a train on the first working day of 2018 will be hit with an average ticket price rise of 3.4%, with some commuter routes set for price hikes of more than £100. There are protests planned at around 40 railway stations up and down the country on Tuesday, with some commuters spending up to five times as much of their salary on season tickets as people on the continent. :: Top five average increases by operator: :: 'Raw deal': Trains must be run for passengers Season tickets into London from Theresa May's Maidenhead constituency are to rise by £104 to £3,092 and one from Liverpool to Manchester is going up by £108 to £3,152, with the average cost to increase by a third faster than wages this year. Last year the average price hike was 2.3%, with season tickets into London terminals going up by £74, compared to £146 this year. Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, said: ""It's no wonder that poor value for money is the number one concern of rail travellers, with British rail fares amongst the most expensive in Europe. ""Fares are rising faster than most people's wages so they are taking a larger slice of their income. People are being priced out of going to work."" :: How much will your rail fare go up by? Matthew Pugh, 21, who travels from his parents' home in Andover to work for a film production company in the capital, told Sky News: ""It's just so frustrating. You work so hard and you get up so early and that money's going towards something that doesn't even work in the first place. ""Trains are constantly late, you don't get any information and I wonder 'am I going to have to move to London?', which at the moment just isn't affordable for me."" A Department for Transport spokesman justified the increase to prices by pointing towards the Government's investment in several ambitious rail projects, including Crossrail. :: Under 30s to benefit from new 'millennial' railcards ""We are investing in the biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian times to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better, more comfortable trains with extra seats,"" they told Sky News. ""This includes the first trains running though London on the Crossrail project, an entirely new Thameslink rail service and continuing work on the transformative Great North Rail Project. ""We keep fare prices under constant review and the price rises for this year are capped in line with inflation, with 97p out of every £1 paid going back into the railway."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who has pledged to freeze all bus and tram fares and single pay-as-you-go fares on the Tube until 2020 - described the fare hikes for those heading into the capital as ""eye-watering"". ""It's time for the Government and private rail companies to step up and give the passengers the service they deserve at a price they deserve,"" he added. Mr Khan's sentiments were shared by Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union general secretary Mick Cash, who has echoed Labour's call for the railways to be nationalised. In a bid to soften the blow of the fare increases, some rail operators have come up with money-saving schemes, such as the The Key introduced by Southeastern and the Smart Ticket by Abellio, which runs the Greater Anglia network. :: Firms 'mislead' customers by selling tickets for trains that will not run But Bridget Fox, from the Campaign for Better Transport says there needs to much broader innovation and a freeze on ticket prices in the short-term. She told Sky News: ""The number of people taking season tickets is falling because they are becoming unaffordable and they don't reflect the way that people work - part-time or flexibly. ""We'd like to see a fares' freeze to get things back in balance, like how motorists are enjoying a fuel duty freeze. We do need to invest in the railway but tickets need to be priced in a way that's fair."" The backlash comes as the Government faces increased scrutiny over the ownership of Britain's rail operators, with a recent investigation finding that 57% of passenger journeys in the 12 months to September were on foreign-owned services - mainly German and Dutch. Passengers can also expect further misery later this month, with more RMT strikes expected over the long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains."

The fifth British victim was Ms Bowden's daughter Heather, who was 11 years old. The plane came down in the Hawkesbury River off Jerusalem Bay, killing all those on board. Ian Thorpe, the brother of Mr Cousins' first wife Caroline, told Sky News his former brother-in-law and nephews were ""a very close knit-unit"" and that he ""would miss them terribly"". Mr Thorpe said the crash has ""wiped out nearly all my family"", leaving him with just his 14-year-old daughter. He talked about Mr Cousins, 58, who was due to step down from his company position at Compass, in March, as ""determined"" and a ""real credit"".

Mr Hutchings has appealed for any witnesses to come forward, as 10 recreational boats were believed to be in the area at the time. An investigation into the deadly crash has begun - but although a preliminary report is expected within 30 days, officials have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened. Work is continuing to recover the wreckage of the plane, which is submerged in 13m (42ft) of water.

""Lion-tailed macaques are a highly social species and as part of their natural grieving process have been guarding and preening this youngster which will help the whole group come to terms with their loss. ""We hope you understand that the closure of the Wildlife Centre recently, to allow our macaques time to carry out this process, is the right decision for our animals."" Lion-tailed macaques were only welcomed to Camperdown in late October, with four males and seven females making their way to Scotland from Belfast Zoo. The youngest was born in June and the oldest was born in December 1997. There are estimated to be less than 4,000 of them in the wild."

Under the system, investigators will be alerted to fraudsters who use the same phone number or a similar writing style while filling out different false claims. The connections are buried in billions of files, and it is thought the intelligent computer software will be able to increase prosecutions for whole groups of gangs. Currently, investigators target individual criminals after Jobcentre Plus workers raise concerns. The DWP says it has extensively trialled the technology, which will scan across the benefit system, including Universal Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Personal Independent Payments. Last year, about 5,000 people were prosecuted for benefit fraud and a record £1.1bn in overpaid benefits was recovered. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, David Gauke, said: ""We are committed to tackling benefit fraud, especially from organised crime gangs, because it diverts money from the people who really need it. ""Our fraud investigators work tirelessly to bring criminals to justice and this is just one of the latest and innovative ways we are using cutting-edge technology to protect taxpayer's money."" In November, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced £75m in funding for artificial intelligence. Much of the investment will support start-up firms and raise the number of new PhD students in the field to 200 a year. Funding will also reportedly go towards an advisory body to lift barriers to AI development."

2018-01-01,"Twenty years after Paul McCartney was knighted, and 17 years after George Harrison turned down an OBE, Beatles drummer Ringo Starr has been awarded a knighthood for services to music and charity work.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/opinion-ringo-starrs-knighthood-is-long-overdue-11188896,"It will be the first time the musician has been to Buckingham Palace since the band received MBEs back in 1965. Music journalist and Beatles fan Andy Welch looks back on the 77-year-old's legacy. Arise Sir Ringo. And not a moment too soon. In fact, the knighthood of the Beatles drummer is hugely overdue. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were, of course, the driving force behind the band, widely regarded as the greatest of British exports, with notable songwriting additions from George Harrison. As a result, McCartney was knighted in 1997, quite rightly the first popular music icon to be awarded the honour for services to British music, years ahead of Mick Jagger, Cliff Richard and the rest. It's perhaps safe to assume the honour would have at least been offered to Lennon too had he not died in 1980. Whether he'd have accepted - he returned his MBE, awarded in 1965 alongside the rest of The Beatles - is another matter. The same could be said for Harrison, who sadly died in 2001. Ringo should not have had to wait anywhere near so long, not when the honours are handed to sports stars, actors and politicians whose achievements and impact on the world pales in comparison with his. As one of two remaining Beatles, he can't help but be in the shadow of the creative colossus that is Paul McCartney. But Ringo was a quarter of the greatest cultural force the world has ever seen. And a brilliant part of it at that. ""John Lennon said he wasn't even the best drummer in The Beatles."" Quiet at the back. Lennon never said anything of the sort, that joke was made by one-time TV staple Jasper Carrott in about 1983. It's attitudes like that wrongly attributed 'joke' that have, I believe, held back Ringo's right and proper treatment. It's all part of the same pernicious, lazy perceived wisdom among pub bores and casual fans around the country that Ringo was some sort of talent-less journeyman, in the right place at the right time. Nothing could be further from the truth. There was nowhere to hide in that band. The next time you listen to a Beatles track, listen closely to the drums. Ringo's drumming, so fluid, so intuitive, is unlike virtually every other rock and roll drummer before or since. It couldn't be anyone else on the drum stool. He played the song, rather than merely adding a beat. His drumming has feel, he could swing like no other. Imagine, if you can, Beatles songs without his playing. It's impossible. After The Beatles was his solo work. Of course, it never hit the heights of his three bandmates. There are, however, diamonds in the rough - check out It Don't Come Easy and Photograph, if you need persuading. His tours with his All Starr Band are hugely successful. There's also his underrated acting career, Thomas the Tank Engine narration, and philanthropy - one auction of his belongings in 2015 raised more than $9m (£6m) for his and wife Barbara Bach's Lotus Foundation. Not bad for a boy from Liverpool. So arise Sir Ringo, better late than never."
2018-01-01,Predictions are always a tricky business and even the most seasoned observers can get it wrong.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/tales-of-the-unexpected-where-the-pundits-got-it-wrong-in-2017-11191496,"Here are just some of the events of 2017 where the pundits missed the mark. :: Theresa May calling a snap election Having previously ruled out going to the polls until 2020, the April U-turn by the Tory Prime Minister stunned Westminster. She said she had taken the decision while on a walking holiday in Wales with her husband Philip. With a healthy double-digit lead in the opinion polls over Labour, there was talk of a Tory landslide. However, a poorly-fought campaign and a resurgent opposition ended in electoral humiliation, with Mrs May stripped of her majority and having to strike a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her government. : The UK economy in the wake of the Brexit vote  A hostage to fortune this one as there are lies, damn lies and statistics as the saying goes. It has been pointed out the investment giant Goldman Sachs forecast sterling would fall from $1.25 to $1.14 in 2017, while it actually rose to $1.35. The firm also forecast the key indicator of the cost of government borrowing would rise from 1.28% to 1.65%, while it actually fell to 1.19% at the end of December. However, the UK's GDP growth rate of 0.4% in the third quarter has been outstripped by the eurozone. Inflation also hit a five-year high of 3.1% in November, as the impact of the pound's fall since the referendum sent the price of food, energy and services soaring. It saw the Bank of England make the first interest rate hike for a decade, with a rise from 0.25% to 0.5%. :: Donald Trump's impeachment Ever since the election of the controversial tycoon to the White House, there have predictions he could be forced from office, amid accusations of misconduct. Mr Trump has faced persistent allegations over Russian links to his 2016 election campaign, which is the focus of a major investigation However, despite the rows and acrimony he has been embroiled in his first year he remains in office. :: Daniel Craig returning as 007 Following his last outing as James Bond in Spectre, the British star has said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role. After such a strong comment it came as a surprise to many that he would return to play the screen spy for a fifth and (allegedly) final time. Asked on a US talk show in August if he had some good news on his involvement the long-running franchise, Craig responded: ""Yes"". This was in stark contrast to his previous remarks in which he said: ""We're done. All I want to do is move on."" :: La La Land ""winning"" then losing the Best Picture Oscar An envelope mix-up at the glitzy Hollywood ceremony led to the sort of drama usually reserved for the big screen. There was shock and confusion after Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly announced La La Land - widely expected to win - as scooping the Best Picture award winner at the 2017 Oscars, rather than the actual winner, Moonlight. With La La Land acceptance speeches under way, red-faced organisers had to intervene and inform the celebrating team that there had been a major blunder. :: The downfall of Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein Tinseltown was rocked by the scandal which swiftly engulfed the powerful film executive. Since the first allegations came to light, scores of women have come forward to say that they had been harassed or assaulted by Weinstein. While acknowledging he had ""caused a lot of pain"" and apologising, he denied the claims levelled against him. The controversy had global repercussions, with women worldwide encouraged to share their ow stories of sexual harassment and assault on social media using the #metoo hashtag. The scandal also led to a wave of sleaze claims at Westminster, with MPs and ministers accused of inappropriate behaviour. :: Harry getting engaged to Meghan Markle over roast chicken The Prince revealed he popped the question to the star of the US legal drama Suits during a ""cosy night"" at home cooking. Romance blossomed after the couple met back in July 2016 on a blind date in London arranged through a mutual friend. The couple made their first public appearance together in September at the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style competition for injured military personnel set up by Prince Harry.

You know it's there, you appreciate its relevance but, when the lights go out, you still credit the director.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/roger-deakins-the-brit-youve-never-heard-of-and-is-due-an-oscar-11191380,"""Lights, camera, action!"" - the traditional cue reflects the most important element in any film set: the light. A good cinematographer, or director of photography, can fix a faulty script, mask a mediocre set or make an otherwise bleak and empty character seem deep and mysterious. Light is what a cinematographer uses to paint a set or to define a character and, while some directors chose to do their own, most of them know better. In Apocalypse Now, Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz is introduced with only half of his face illuminated, showing a man whose soul has been overtaken by the darkness of the jungle. In a film running nearly four hours long, Kurtz appears for about 20 minutes, but his bald head emerging from the darkness remains the most iconic image of the film. The brilliance of Kurtz' lightning was not the work of its director Francis Ford Coppola, but of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. Storaro won an Oscar for his work. He was one of the greats. His closest successor, however, remains to this day unrecognised by the Academy. At 68, Roger Deakins has been nominated a total of 13 times for his work in movies like The Shawshank Redemption, Sicario, Fargo, and The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford. Look closely at some of his latest films, and you'll find his barren landscapes give them an almost dreamlike appeal. The way the light hits the characters making them sometimes godlike, barely human. He works well with directors who believe silence can speak louder than words, or that a character can be the sum of its surroundings. It comes as no surprise that Deakins became the right-hand man of some of the most talented filmmakers working today. The Coen brothers work around his schedule to start shooting a film. So does Sam Mendes. :: Grumpy Harrison Ford has 2049 reasons to smile His latest ally is one Denis Villeneuve, the Canadian boy-wonder who shot his way to the Oscars with the likes of Prisoners, Sicario and Arrival. Their last collaboration was the massively hyped, less-than-profitable sequel to Blade Runner. The film divided critics and fans, but seems to have lost itself on the way to the Oscars. Forgotten by most predictions, it now looks destined to thrive only in technical categories. One it cannot miss, is Deakins'. Whether you loved or hated Blade Runner 2049, it is unanimous that it is a spectacle of colour, light and shade. Deakins created a bleak and haunting world, which Villeneuve profited from. It could even be argued the director indulged him too much. Watching Blade Runner 2049, you can feel scenes stretching a little more than they probably should. It is the look of a director in love with his photographer. :: Blade Runner 2049: Can the replicant beat the original? The same can be seen in No Country For Old Men and Jesse James. Both films are auterish westerns - a genre which gives Deakins the freedom to play in the sun, a skill he mastered while shooting documentaries in Africa. Born in Devon, son to an actress mother and a builder father, he started off as a cameraman and moved on from docs to music videos, which he directed himself. It wasn't until he was found by the Coens that his career in Hollywood sparked. So why hasn't this auteur, this ally of great filmmakers, been awarded by the Academy after so many years in the industry? Lately, he seems to be beaten every time be his closest rival, the Mexican Emmanuel Lubezki. Lubezki tends to work closely with his Latin American peers Alfonso Cuaron and Alejandro Inarritu, both of which have stolen the Oscars spotlight in recent years. His work in The Revenant, Birdman and Gravity was preferred to Deakins' in Prisoners, Unbroken and Sicario. When the director suffers, often so does the photographer. :: Blade Runner 2049: What are the critics saying? This year he faces tough competition again, although mostly at the hands of a young bunch of talented cinematographers. Names like Helene Louvart, Sean Price Williams and Sayombhu Mukdeeprom are well known in the indie circuit, and could catch the attention of the Academy. But only one name this year has the strength to threaten Deakins. Hoyte van Hoytema, the giant who replaced Wally Pfiser as Christopher Nolan's right-hand man in his latest film Dunkirk. Pfiser is the reason why Nolan's films all look so ""Nolan-like"", and Hoytema managed not only to capture the same essence, but add something of his own. Lubezki himelf is on the race again, but this time he picked the wrong team. His work in Terrence Malick's insipid Song To Song will go largely unnoticed, damaged by a director whose style has gotten the best of him. This will be Deakins' 14th nomination. For the 14th time, the Academy will have the opportunity to shine a light on one of cinema's great contemporary masters. They better not miss it."
2018-01-01,The Archbishop of Canterbury has praised the compassion shown by communities after last year's terrorism and tragedy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/archbishop-praises-response-to-terrorism-in-new-year-message-11191298,"In his New Year message, Justin Welby said the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester and the Grenfell Tower fire had been ""terrible tragedies"". He added: ""When things feel unrelentingly difficult, there are often questions which hang in the air: Is there any light at all? Does anyone care?"" The Anglican leader used a Biblical passage from the Gospel of John, saying ""the light shone in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it"". That light was seen in the ""resilience"" of London's Borough Market, as it recovered from a terrorist attack in June, he said. Three men drove a van into pedestrians before attacking with hunting knives, killing eight people and injuring 48. Mr Welby said the light was also ""in the faces of the hundreds of volunteers"" who helped in the aftermath of the Grenfell fire that same month. Some 71 people died in the fire, which devastated the 24-storey building in London's north Kensington. He also praised the heroism of the emergency workers. ""So often in 2017, the depth of suffering was matched by a depth of compassion as communities came together,"" he said. He added that he remembered visiting those who had survived the fire and their ""desperation and sorrow"". In the message, which was broadcast on the BBC, he said he also wanted to highlight the suffering of people ""struggling to find work or relying on food banks"" and ""those who are bereaved or coping with poor mental health or physical illness"". He said their suffering ""will never make the news""."
2018-01-01,Tens of thousands of people across the UK have celebrated the beginning of 2018 with fireworks and parties.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/fantastic-fireworks-in-london-and-edinburgh-as-2018-arrives-in-uk-11191293,"In London, more than 100,000 people gathered on the banks of the River Thames for a 12-minute pyrotechnics extravaganza. More than 10,000 fireworks lit up the sky during the sold-out event, which received cheers from the crowd. They were accompanied by the music of Aretha Franklin, Annie Lennox, Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa and Florence Welch, with the second half of the show commemorating 100 years of women having the right to vote. :: Follow live updates here Jubilant crowds were also treated to Big Ben's bongs at midnight, with the famous clock's four-year-long renovations temporarily put on hold for the occasion. Although there were fewer police at the event than last year, security was still tight, with barriers and armed police patrolling a city which suffered four terrorist attacks in 2017. Celebrations were marred by rail strikes - with a walkout by South Western Railway staff frustrating the plans of those seeking to travel into the UK's busiest station, Waterloo. The industrial action covered the period when many people would be trying to get home after the fireworks display. In Edinburgh, about 75,000 were at Hogmanay celebrations, despite gusts of up to 76mph in parts of Scotland during the afternoon. Rag'n'Bone Man headlined Concert in the Gardens, with Declan McKenna and Nina Nesbitt as support acts. The Human League, Sacred Paws, Treacherous Orchestra and Huey Morgan also performed to crowds on three Street Party stages. Fireworks were launched from Edinburgh Castle at 9pm, 10pm and 11pm - building up to a nine-minute finale at 12am. Celebrations have been taking place around the world - and New Zealand was first to welcome in 2018, with fireworks focused around Auckland's Sky Tower. The Australian city of Sydney followed, keeping up its reputation as having one of the world's best pyrotechnics displays centred on Harbour Bridge. Turnout was healthy to say the least, with an estimated 500,000 spectators in attendance. Colourful shows in Hong Kong, Beijing, Paris and Berlin followed - with Dubai opting to mark the New Year with an extravagant lights show at the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. In New York, enthusiastic crowds braved temperatures of minus 12C (10F) to watch the Times Square crystal ball drop. It was the coldest New Year's Eve since 1962 - and celebration appeared to be less crowded than other years."
2018-01-01,"The recreational use of cannabis has been broadly legalised in California, with retail businesses now selling the drug to over-21s.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/california-legalises-recreational-cannabis-use-11192341,"Just two decades after medicinal use was legalised in California in 1996, the state has relaxed rules prohibiting its sale and ownership. Known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) or Proposition 64, the law change was voted for by Californians in 2016 despite a federal prohibition on the drug still being in effect in the US. California is the latest state after Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Nevada and Washington to legalise cannabis. Adults aged 21 and over are allowed to grow up to six plants and possess up to an ounce of the drug. Analysis by Californian authorities have estimated that it could increase tax revenue by up to $1bn (£740m), while reducing local government expenditures by tens of millions of dollars. Opponents of the legalisation have warned that it risks introducing young people to drug use and may lead to a rise in drug driving offences. ""This is something we've all been waiting for,"" said Johnny Hernandez, a tattoo artist from Modesto. ""It is something that can help so many people and there's no reason why we should not be sharing that."" The legalisation is not expected to seriously affect the black market in cannabis with taxes and fees on retail marijuana amounting to a price increase of as much as 70% for consumers."
2018-01-01,An app designed by Great Ormond Street Hospital staff that replaces the traditional clipboard at the end of patients' beds has saved thousands of nursing hours and been hailed as a pioneering use of technology.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180102040238/https://news.sky.com/story/patient-app-saves-thousands-of-nursing-hours-11191210,"Developed by GOSH clinical site practitioner and nurse Sarah Newcombe, the app enables staff to enter the vital signs of up to 350 patients using handheld devices rather than with pen and paper. The system generates automatic alerts to relevant specialist teams at the hospital if patients show signs of deterioration. It also enables staff to communicate directly with each other, and crucially they do not need to leave the bedside if they require help with acutely ill patients. Ms Newcombe told Sky News the app had proved particularly useful on night shifts, when reduced staff have to cover several sites, and it was not previously possible to identify the sickest patients without carrying out a full ward round. ""Quite often we have up to 350 children under our care and the idea came about, particularly from out of hours at night, when we weren't sure or able to identify where our sicker patients were,"" she said. ""The benefits we have seen following the implementation of this new system are brilliant. ""It has really helped us to improve the visibility of our patients and the response times of clinicians. It has also saved thousands of nursing hours per year, and has delivered more than 50,000 children's 'Early Warning Score' alerts per year."" The NHS has been criticised for failing to adopt new technologies fast enough, and it and the Department of Health have a patchy record in implementing and protecting IT systems. Bespoke apps like the one developed at Great Ormond Street are increasingly common however, and the NHS, with the support of unions, is seeking to make their use a central part of nurse training. With a national shortage of around 40,000 nurses it is hoped they will help reduce the amount of time spent on administrative tasks and increase the time spent with patients. Caron Swinscoe, clinical lead for nursing at NHS Digital, said: ""I absolutely believe people can't work harder and faster anymore. ""What we have got to do is equip them with the tools to be able to release time spent on admin and different pieces of work to spend time on patients. ""The greatest gift you can give a clinician is more time to spend with patients."""

The fall was mainly due to consumer-based stocks - shares in Unilever, Diageo and British American Tobacco were all down. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: ""The FTSE will be hoping this is just a blip on its recent record high-hitting run, and not the creeping grip of concern as it heads into what could be a tricky season for updates from its key retailers."" Earlier in the day, mining stocks were the main culprits, but Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Glencore all ended the session with gains of between 1.1% and 2.9%. Markets in Frankfurt and Paris also lost ground, down 0.4% and 0.5% respectively, on a day of thin trading, with many investors still on holiday. The euro and pound both rose against the US dollar. The dollar was held back by fears that the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates as quickly as expected in the coming months. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader, said the euro was strengthening as ""traders are making the bet that the (European Central Bank) will simply follow the Fed in the year ahead and end quantitative easing and then move toward rate hikes"". Figures were released on Tuesday showing solid manufacturing output and order growth in the UK last month but they were not enough to help the FTSE. Russ Mould, analyst at online stockbroker AJ Bell, said: ""Today is all about the latest PMI manufacturing surveys: China's looked good and India is even better, while the UK posted a decent figure."" Wall Street opened more strongly and Asian stocks were also mostly positive, helped by higher company profits and hopes that US tax cuts will bring economic growth to the US and globally. US jobs figures will be released at the end of the week."

The roof of the outbuilding collapsed in the blaze. In a statement, the safari park said: ""Staff and fire crews attended the scene, however, devastatingly for everyone at the park, none of the 13 animals could be saved. ""All other animals within the jungle drive-through enclosure are being monitored, but early signs suggest that they have not been affected. ""An investigation is under way into the cause of the fire and whilst the park will remain open, the jungle enclosure will remain closed for investigation. ""The park is grateful to the quick response from Bedfordshire Fire Brigade, who attended with three appliances."" The fire was spotted by security guards during a routine patrol at about 2.30am. Firefighters confirmed they attended shortly afterwards. Safari park spokesman Drew Mullin told Sky News an initial investigation by the fire service indicated the blaze had been caused by a generator fault. He said: ""We must now clear up and look after the staff. They are devastated, they build up a bond with the animals. ""We will keep the jungle closed for today, tomorrow and the next few days and then we will make a decision about reopening."" A Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue spokesman said the outbuilding housing the atas monkeys ""was well alight and its roof had fallen in"" when firefighters arrived. ""They fought the fire using fire hoses while wearing breathing apparatus to protect themselves from the smoke and fumes. The building was 90% damaged by the fire."" Firefighters closed the incident at 4.46am. It comes 10 days after four meerkats and a nine-year-old aardvark were killed in a fire at London Zoo on December 23. An investigation into the cause of that blaze is also being carried out. According to Woburn's website, its patas monkeys shared a 16-acre space with barbary macaques and a herd of mountain bongo. They were free to roam all night during summer months, but would have been housed indoors during the colder winter nights. In the wild, patas monkeys are classified as being of ""least concern"" so are not thought to be under threat."

Passengers catching a train on Tuesday were hit with an average ticket price rise of 3.4%, with some commuter routes set for price hikes of more than £100. The jump means some commuters are now spending up to five times as much of their salary on season tickets as people on the continent. :: Top five average increases by operator: :: Majority of Brits back rail nationalisation, Sky data poll shows:: 'Raw deal': Trains must be run for passengers Season tickets into London from Theresa May's Maidenhead constituency are to rise by £104 to £3,092 and one from Liverpool to Manchester is going up by £108 to £3,152, with the average cost to increase by a third faster than wages this year. Last year the average price hike was 2.3%, with season tickets into London terminals going up by £74, compared to £146 this year. Raja Amin, an organiser for the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union in the Midlands, told Sky News: ""People are paying through the nose - 3.4% is the biggest increase in the last five years. It's really unfair for those people. ""And while the fares are going up, they are cutting staff. Our campaign is that this doesn't make sense at all."" Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, also said: ""It's no wonder that poor value for money is the number one concern of rail travellers, with British rail fares amongst the most expensive in Europe. ""Fares are rising faster than most people's wages so they are taking a larger slice of their income. People are being priced out of going to work."" :: How much will your rail fare go up by? A Department for Transport spokesman justified the increase to prices by pointing towards the Government's investment in several ambitious rail projects, including Crossrail. ""We are investing in the biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian times to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better, more comfortable trains with extra seats,"" he told Sky News. ""This includes the first trains running though London on the Crossrail project, an entirely new Thameslink rail service and continuing work on the transformative Great North Rail Project. ""We keep fare prices under constant review and the price rises for this year are capped in line with inflation, with 97p out of every £1 paid going back into the railway."" Later in the day, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told LBC on a trip to Qatar that the fare rise is ""higher than I would wish"". He said: ""Can I promise there will be no fare rises in future? No I can't - I wish I could."" :: Under 30s to benefit from new 'millennial' railcards Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who has pledged to freeze all bus and tram fares and single pay-as-you-go fares on the Tube until 2020 - described the fare hikes for those heading into the capital as ""eye-watering"". ""It's time for the Government and private rail companies to step up and give the passengers the service they deserve at a price they deserve,"" he added. Mr Khan's sentiments were shared by RMT general secretary Mick Cash, who has echoed Labour's call for the railways to be nationalised. In a bid to soften the blow of the fare increases, some rail operators have come up with money-saving schemes, such as The Key introduced by Southeastern and the Smart Ticket by Abellio, which runs the Greater Anglia network. But Bridget Fox, from the Campaign for Better Transport, says there needs to much broader innovation and a freeze on ticket prices in the short-term. She told Sky News: ""The number of people taking season tickets is falling because they are becoming unaffordable and they don't reflect the way that people work - part-time or flexibly. ""We'd like to see a fares' freeze to get things back in balance, like how motorists are enjoying a fuel duty freeze. We do need to invest in the railway but tickets need to be priced in a way that's fair."" :: Firms 'mislead' customers by selling tickets for trains that will not run The backlash comes as the Government faces increased scrutiny over the ownership of Britain's rail operators, with a recent investigation finding that 57% of passenger journeys in the 12 months to September were on foreign-owned services - mainly German and Dutch. Passengers can also expect further misery later this month, with more RMT strikes expected over the long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains."

There has already been a Wolf Moon this month, which occurred on New Year's Day, when the moon appeared about 14% bigger and 30% brighter in the sky as it reached its closest point to Earth during orbit. Described by NASA as ""the most super of the three supermoons this winter"", it was the first of the two full moons in January - and also ""the biggest and brightest of 2018"". The next sky-watching promises to be even more spectacular. According to the US space agency, the second supermoon will be viewable ""from western North America across the pacific to Eastern Asia"". Blue Moons happen every two-and-a-half years on average, but a total eclipse of a Blue Moon last happened in 1866. A Blue Moon is the name given to the second full moon in a calendar month. NASA says that because there are roughly 29.5 days between full moons, it is unusual for two full moons to ""fit"" into a 30 or 31 day month. It is impossible for a Blue Moon to occur in a 28 or 29-day month, so February can never have a Blue Moon."

The comments come ahead of a visit by the PM to Berkshire to meet one of the 16,000 people the Government says have benefited from its flagship autumn Budget announcement. In November, Chancellor Philip Hammond abolished stamp duty on homes up to £300,000 altogether for first-time buyers. This relief was also made available for the first £300,000 of homes worth up to £500,000, helping people purchasing properties in higher value parts of the country, such as London. It means a stamp duty cut for 95% of all first-time buyers who pay it and no stamp duty at all for 80% of those buying their first home, with savings of up to £5,000. Hailing the announcement six weeks on, Mrs May said it had had an ""immediate impact"" and that one million first-time buyers would benefit in the next five years. ""I have made it my personal mission to build the homes this country needs so we can restore the dream of home ownership for people up and down the UK,"" she said. ""We are building a Britain that is fit for the future and our message to the next generation is this - getting on - and climbing up - the housing ladder is not just a dream of your parents' past, but a reality for your future."" But Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said that cutting stamp duty without building more affordable properties could only drive up prices. ""The number of young home-owners is in free-fall,"" he said. ""But under the Tories the number of new low-cost homes for first-time buyers has halved and not a single one of the 200,000 'starter homes' promised has been built. ""After almost eight years of Conservative failure on housing, homelessness has doubled, home-ownership has fallen to a 30-year low and the number of new social rented homes is at the lowest level since records began. ""It's clear Theresa May has no plan to fix the country's housing crisis."" The financial watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility said after the stamp duty cut was announced that it would only ""increase house prices"". And it added the main beneficiaries would be those who already owned a home."

Bell End was ranked fourth in the UK in a list of the top 15 rudest-sounding street names released in 2014. The petition page on change.org says it is ""time for a change"". ""As you may be aware, the term 'Bell End' can be seen and used as a rude and/or an offensive word,"" the petition reads. ""It can affect people including children being bullied and teased at school and generally now become a laughing stock, as seen very recently on Facebook and other social media sites, and it's time for a change."" The petition offers 'Bells Road' as a possible solution. Councillor David Hosell, Sandwell Council's cabinet member for highways and environment, said: ""Obviously if this is an issue that residents do feel strongly about, I would ask them to forward their petition to the council and we can look at their request in more detail."" Stephen Young, of Minge Lane, in Worcester - also voted one of the rudest-sounding street names - said the petition was ""a bit silly"" and ""over the top"". The 72-year-old said: ""There has been no plan to change the name of our road. We have had a problem with people nicking the sign but nobody is that fussed about the name. ""There are no plans to start a petition, people are happy with the name of the road."" The 2014 list - topped by Minge Lane - also included Slag Lane in Lowton, Lancashire, and Fanny Hands Lane in Ludford, Lincolnshire. Crotch Crescent, The Knob and Cockshoot Close were also in the top 10."
2018-01-02,"As the biggest rail fare rises since 2013 kick in, it is time to make complaining and claiming compensation far easier, writes Alex Hayman, head of public markets at Which?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180103011309/https://news.sky.com/story/raw-deal-trains-must-be-run-for-passengers-not-the-rail-firms-11192639,"Many of us will travel to work today on an overcrowded, dirty or unreliable train service - and wonder why this ordeal is costing more money than ever. Rail season tickets are going up by an average of 3.4% but many passengers do not feel they are seeing a return for the extra costs. Satisfaction with value for money over the last decade has stayed stubbornly low and is unlikely to improve after this latest round of price hikes. We deserve trains that are run for passengers, not just the rail industry. When services fail to deliver, passengers need to be able to get the compensation they are owed and have access to a system that handles their complaints properly. The industry and government must urgently address this imbalance if they are to rebuild passenger trust. :: New Year rail fare hikes at five-year high What do passengers say about train services? Which? heard stories from thousands of angry and frustrated rail passengers in 2017. There were complaints about dangerous overcrowding, filthy carriages and services that only run on time one day in five. Others reported that unreliable train services were putting an unbearable strain on their work or home life - and that attempts to complain or claim compensation were ignored. We even heard from disabled passengers enduring agonising pain standing packed in trains ""like sardines"" and one man who urinated in his seat because his train lacked a disabled access toilet. Why are rail passengers getting such a raw deal? Passengers are shelling out more and more for season tickets, but some are still arriving at their destination late and frustrated. Many people have no choice about which train operator they travel with - and some may feel they are being unfairly squeezed to boost profits, with no sign of improvements to the services they pay for. To make matters worse, the rail sector has too often left passengers as an afterthought when making big changes. Is it possible to run a decent train service in this country? Our rail survey last year showed some operators proving it is possible to provide a service passengers are happy with. Merseyrail and Translink were among operators with punctual and reliable services, with carriages in good condition. However, commuters on some of the most popular routes, such as South Eastern and Southern, have endured nightmarish journeys and levels of service. There is no reason why they shouldn't do much better. What can be done to fix the rail system for passengers? If trust in the industry - currently stuck at a woeful 28% - is to be improved, train companies and the Government need to do much more to improve the lot of passengers. When things go wrong, passengers must be clearly informed about their rights to compensation for delays and cancellations. Claiming should be made simpler and easier and compensation should be paid out automatically, where possible. When people want to complain, they need somewhere to turn where they can trust their complaints will be resolved promptly, fairly and impartially. The Government has announced a new independent ombudsman for rail complaints. And when the scheme is introduced, it's crucial that all train companies sign up so all passengers can get their complaints dealt with."
2018-01-02,"Health officials have urged people to get vaccinated following a number of deaths in Ireland which have been linked to ""Australian flu"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180103011309/https://news.sky.com/story/health-warning-after-aussie-flu-blamed-for-deaths-in-ireland-11193127,"The Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) said a ""small number"" of people had died in the last fortnight after contracting the H3N2 strain, which was blamed for one of Australia's worst ever flu outbreaks last year. Around 170,000 influenza cases were reported during Australia's winter season, with more than 370 deaths Public Health England and the Irish HSE have now urged people at higher risk of flu - including the elderly, pregnant women and children with chronic illness - to get vaccinated. Dr Kevin Kelleher, director of the HSE’s health protection surveillance centre, said: ""The HSE has in the last fortnight been notified of a small number of deaths directly related to influenza (less than 10). ""These indicators tell us that flu is actively starting to circulate in the community, yet it’s not too late for people at risk to get the vaccine from their GP or pharmacist. ""Prevention is better than cure, and the increase in flu activity means it is even more important to get your flu jab if you are in an at-risk group."" UFC fighter Conor McGregor reportedly cancelled his New Year’s Eve party after he was struck down by ""Australian flu"". In a now removed Instagram post, the Irish sports star said he was ""left shaking in bed"" for two days and that some of his family members had been admitted to hospital because of the virus. It comes after figures for England and Wales revealed the number of recorded flu cases more than doubled in the week before Christmas. Some 1,111 cases were reported in the week up to 24 December 2017, compared with 434 cases in the previous seven days. A Public Health England spokeswoman said: ""The current flu vaccine is still the best defence we have against the virus. We therefore encourage all those who are eligible to take up the offer of the vaccine. ""There are a number of ways to limit the spread of flu. These include carrying tissues and use them to catch coughs or sneezes, then to bin the tissues, washing your hands regularly with soap and warm water and frequently cleaning surfaces like computer keyboards, telephones and other regularly used objects. ""Avoid having unnecessary contact with other people if you or they are presenting symptoms of flu. ""These symptoms include coughs, runny nose, fever, sore throat, fatigue, aches and pains. ""Anyone concerned about their symptoms should stay at home and contact their GP, or call NHS 111, to seek further advice."" The latest advice comes after a leading doctor warned that pressures on the NHS ""escalated rapidly"" over the festive period, with hospitals experiencing significant bed shortages. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said many hospitals reported more than 99% capacity in the week before Christmas. ""We are on the cusp of a major issue at least as bad as last year, when it was described by the Red Cross as a humanitarian crisis,"" Dr Scriven said."
2018-01-02,Hospitals in England have been advised to cancel all non-urgent operations and in-patient treatments until at least the end of January after A&E departments experienced extreme pressure over the Christmas and New Year period.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180103011309/https://news.sky.com/story/hospitals-told-to-cancel-some-operations-amid-winter-pressure-11193433,"With many hospitals treating large numbers of patients in corridors and with extended ambulance waits, NHS England's National Emergency Pressures Panel (NEPP) has also lifted the ban on mixed-sex wards. The measures have been recommended to try and free up staff to help deal with an increased number of patients attending A&E with complex conditions, many of which require them to be admitted. There are also concerns about an increase in flu cases, particularly a severe Australasian strain that has already been linked to deaths in Ireland. The move comes after hospital trusts across England reported huge pressure over the festive period, with one A&E consultant comparing conditions in his hospital in Stoke to the third-world. One of the NHS' most experienced chief executives, Andrew Foster of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, told Sky News he had never seen such demand. ""There have been times in the last week when it has been more busy that I have ever seen it before with people queuing in the corridors and waiting to be assessed, so it has been an exceptionally busy winter period. ""Based on previous years it will carry on like this for another four to six weeks and then it will ease off - but when it comes to next winter we are going to need to put even more resources into place because safety is a concern."" Many hospitals, including in Kent and Cornwall, have moved to the highest level of alert or escalation, known as OPEL 4, where they seek assistance from other healthcare services in the region because they can no longer deliver comprehensive care. Ambulance Trusts have also experienced soaring demand, with the North East Ambulance Service declaring the highest level of alert, and the London Ambulance Service recording 320 calls in a single hour. Others, including hospitals in West Sussex and Milton Keynes, warned patients to stay away unless they had a life-threatening or serious illness. The chair of the NEPP, Sir Bruce Keogh, said: ""I want to thank NHS staff who have worked incredibly hard under sustained pressure to take care of patients over the Christmas. ""We expect these pressures to continue and there are early signs of increased flu prevalence. The NHS needs to take further action to increase capacity and minimise disruptive last minute cancellations. ""That is why we are making these further recommendations today."" Earlier, Dr Richard Fawcett, an A&E consultant at the North Midlands University Hospital Trust, tweeted: ""I personally apologise to the people of Stoke for the 3rd world conditions of the department due to #overcrowding."" In a statement, the Department of Health said: ""We know the NHS is extremely busy - as it always is at this time of year - but hardworking staff are taking the necessary steps to make sure patients continue to get seen as quickly as possible. ""Our NHS was recently ranked as the best and safest healthcare system in the world, and the Government is supporting it this winter with an additional £437m as well as £1bn extra social care funding this year."" Labour's shadow health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said the situation was the result of years of under-funding. He said: ""Despite the heroic efforts of our fantastic NHS staff, Theresa May's reassurances have proved meaningless and hollow. ""Tory under-funding and cuts have left our health service more vulnerable than ever before. ""Jeremy Hunt must urgently tell us how many elective operations he expects to be cancelled and how many more people will be waiting longer in pain and anguish because their scheduled operation has had to be cancelled."""
2018-01-02,Ryanair is seeking a licence from British regulators to safeguard against a hard Brexit amid little apparent progress on a new aviation deal between the UK and Europe.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180103011309/https://news.sky.com/story/ryanair-seeks-uk-licence-after-olearys-hard-brexit-warnings-11193212,"Sky News has learnt that Ryanair tabled an application to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) shortly before Christmas for a UK Air Operator's Certificate (AOC). Securing such a licence from British authorities may be required for the Irish carrier to continue operating its domestic UK business in the event of no deal being struck between ministers and their EU counterparts. Although Ryanair's domestic UK traffic involves just three routes and accounts for less than 2% of total revenues, the AOC application underlines the ongoing contingency planning taking place at both British and EU-based airlines. Ryanair's move follows a similar one by Wizz Air, the Central and Eastern European-focused airline, in October, to secure an AOC and operating licence from the CAA. Some UK-headquartered airlines have been forced to take the opposite measure by applying for AOCs elsewhere to enable them to continue flights between EU countries after 2019. EasyJet is seeking a licence from Austrian regulators to establish a new airline in the country. It is unclear whether Ryanair would be required to relocate a significant number of aircraft or employees to the UK in order to persuade the watchdog to grant the new AOC. The airline currently operates a number of flights between London Stansted, and Belfast, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports. In response to an enquiry from Sky News, a Ryanair spokeswoman said: ""Ryanair today confirmed that a subsidiary company, Ryanair UK, filed an application on 21 December last for an AOC with the CAA in the UK. ""This may be required for Ryanair's three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019."" The application follows months of warnings by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's pugnacious chief executive, that British holidaymakers face widespread cancellation of flights to popular EU destinations without meaningful progress on a new aviation deal. Mr O'Leary met Transport Secretary Chris Grayling last summer to discuss the state of negotiations about post-Brexit aviation rules. ""There is a real prospect, and we need to deal with this, that there are going to be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period of weeks, months beyond March 2019,"" the Ryanair chief told the European Parliament's Transport and Tourism Committee in July. ""There is not going to be an interim agreement... we will be cancelling people's holidays for summer of 2019."" While talks between the UK and EU are now progressing to a second phase focused on future trading arrangements, there remains uncertainty about the extent to which the aviation sector will be prioritised in discussions. Other airlines have been more sanguine about the prospects of a deal being reached in time. With ticket sales for flights commencing months in advance, though, industry executives believe a deal is essential well before the end of this year. Analysis carried out by some of Britain's biggest airports last year suggested that between March 2018 and March 2019, there could be a 41% fall in passenger demand - equating to 8.1m bookings, or 16.2m journeys - between the UK and EU countries. The CAA declined to comment, although a notice published on its website on Tuesday highlighted that it had received an application from Ryanair UK Limited for a Type A licence - the category required by large airlines. A Government spokesperson said: ""Aviation is crucial to the UK's economy and we are committed to getting the best deal possible for Britain. ""We will work closely with the international aviation community to ensure that this global industry continues to be a major success story for the UK economy."" Ryanair's application for a UK AOC requires the blessing of the CAA three months after the regulator instigated enforcement action against the airline for misleading passengers about their rights in relation to last autumn's deluge of flight cancellations. An escalating staffing crisis at Ryanair before Christmas amid threatened strikes prompted the carrier to say that it would recognise pilots' and cabin crew unions for the first time."
2018-01-02,SpaceX is preparing to send into space a satellite for the US government that is so secret the public cannot know even which branch of the administration commissioned the launch.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180103011309/https://news.sky.com/story/spacex-prepares-secret-zuma-satellite-launch-11193083,"A weather report ahead of the launch released on Tuesday described the conditions as excellent. Unlike the private aerospace company's previous classified launches for the military's National Reconnaissance Office and the super-secret space-plane it took into orbit for the Air Force, there is almost no information available about the ""Zuma"" payload. Zuma is known to be a low Earth orbit satellite (orbiting within 2,000km) which is an orbit necessary both for spy and military communication satellites. The secrecy surrounding the launch and the involvement of defence contractor Northrup Grumman in building and operating the spacecraft has led many to speculate that it is defence related. The National Reconnaissance Office has denied that Zuma belongs to them. The launch window opens at 8pm local time on Thursday at Cape Canaveral in Florida. After delivering the satellite into orbit, the Falcon 9 rocket is planned to return to a different launchpad at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Where the company's competitors are forced to build new rockets for every launch, SpaceX has managed to achieve an economy of business by reusing previously developed craft. This has helped the company to be valued at $21bn (£16bn), making it one of the most valuable privately-owned companies in the world - and drives down the launch cost for companies such as Northrup Grumman. According to Northrup Grumman's communications director, Lon Raid: ""This event represents a cost effective approach to space access for government missions. ""As a company, Northrop Grumman realises that this is a monumental responsibility and has taken great care to ensure the most affordable and lowest risk scenarios for Zuma."" The launch had been pushed back despite a US Government desire to launch Zuma before November of last year."

Charlie Alliston was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 18 months in a youth institution for crashing into Mr Briggs' wife Kim on an Olympic-style bike with no front brakes in February 2016. Mr Briggs said he hoped a Government review would be completed in the next few weeks as he called for the introduction of a new offence of causing death or injury by dangerous or careless cycling. He told Sky News: ""I maintain that the law is hopelessly out of date. ""A week after Kim died I received a call from the police to say there was an issue with the bike and they were considering bringing charges but they didn't know which charges they could bring because these laws weren't there. ""We then had to wait 18 months for the case to come to trial. You're already on a roller-coaster of emotion. I have two young kids who had lost their mum. I'd lost my wife. This just adds to it. ""I don't blame the police at all for this but the police had to go back to 1861 to scrabble around in a box of old laws, when it's very, very clear this is just an omission and we need the law to catch up."" Ministry of Justice figures, obtained by Sky News, revealed there were eight convictions for causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving in 2016 - up from four in 2015 and three in 2014. The MoJ refused to reveal the number of convictions in 2017, saying they would be released in May. Dangerous cycling convictions rose to 26 in 2016, compared with 23 in 2015 and 24 in 2014. There were also 63 convictions for careless or inconsiderate cycling, compared with 85 in 2015 and 96 in 2014. Mr Briggs said he found there was ""tremendous support"" for bringing cycling laws ""I haven't come across any opposition to what I'm trying to do,"" he said. ""There are some cycling groups that don't think it's a priority and I respect that argument. For me, it's a priority."" Mr Briggs said he had spoken to the families of Mary Evans and Rhiannon Bennett, who were both knocked over and killed by cyclists. ""The families go through the same tragedy but they also talk of the same confusion and same sense of being in limbo because there's no adequate law to charge people with,"" he said. ""If I get achieve something positive out of this, then I will have done a good thing."" The Government has said it will conduct an urgent review into whether cyclists who put lives at risk should be subject to laws equivalent to those applied to drivers. Ministers will take independent legal advice on the introduction of a new offence for cyclists and hopes to reach a decision early this year"
2018-01-02,Investigators will be looking for possible links between a fatal New Year's Eve seaplane crash in Sydney and another incident involving the same type of aircraft which killed a British family in Canada in 2015.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180103011309/https://news.sky.com/story/sydney-seaplane-crash-investigation-to-look-at-similar-2015-incident-in-canada-11192756,"They will also look at other incidents involving the same model of plane. The De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver plunged into the Hawkesbury River off Jerusalem Bay, near Sydney, on New Year's Eve, killing all on board. Richard Cousins, the 58-year-old chief executive of FTSE 100 company Compass Group, died alongside his sons Will and Edward, aged 25 and 23, his fiancee Emma Bowden, 48, and her 11-year-old daughter Heather. The aircraft's Australian pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, also died. :: Uncle of Australia seaplane crash victims: 'It's wiped out my family' The incident has similarities to a crash involving another CHC-2 Beaver plane in Canada in August 2015. A British family of four - Fiona Hewitt, 52, her husband Richard, 50, and children 14-year-old Harry and 17-year-old Felicity, all from Milton Keynes - died in the crash. The small aircraft had crashed into the side of a mountain in Quebec, killing the family along with a French passenger and the pilot. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau says all incidents involving the same model of plane would be looked into as part of the investigation. Nat Nagy, the bureau's executive director, said: ""We will be looking at any previous incidents and accidents specifically around this type of aircraft. ""Over the course of this week we will be able to piece together the factors surrounding the accident and from there, if we do identify any issue that is a safety critical issue, we will notify the appropriate authorities immediately."" The Cousins family had gone for lunch and taken flight about 3pm to return to Rose Bay, near Sydney Harbour. Mr Cousin was due to step down from his position at Compass in March. The company said its new boss, Dominic Blakemore, has taken charge in the wake of the accident. Mr Nagy said the plane made a right hand turn before it crashed into the sea 10 minutes later. Experts will look at whether the plane was operating at full power, and whether it was ascending or descending at the time of the crash. Following the Canada crash, a report by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) found the plane, operated by Air Saguenay, stalled and crashed into a mountain. The TSB recommended that the Canadian Department of Transport required all commercial DHC-2 aircraft in Canada be fitted with a stall warning alarm. Mr Nagy said it was not yet clear whether the plane involved in the Sydney crash had a warning system fitted."

Residents setting off from Tame Bridge Parkway, near Walsall, for Nuneaton have been hit with the biggest percentage increase of 50% - with a ticket now priced at £2,916. And Theresa May's own constituents have seen their annual ticket from Maidenhead to London Paddington jump by £732 since the Conservatives came to power, Labour said. It comes as passengers face a New Year fare hike - the highest in five years. One campaign group, Railfuture, warned: ""People are being priced out of going to work."" The bumper rise is sparking comparisons with European rail fares. In Germany, residents can purchase a BahnCard100 - a ticket covering travel across the entire network - for €4.270,00 (£3,795). For comparison, the new cost of a season ticket from Peterborough to Kings Cross is £6,540, while Liverpool to Manchester is £3,152. :: Under 30s to benefit from new 'millennial' railcards Meanwhile in France, the latest figures released by the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) show the annual cost of the commute from Ballancourt-sur-Essonne to Paris is just £750. And in Italy, passengers making the journey between Velletri and Rome - which is about the same 23-mile distance - pay £442 for the year. But commuters travelling the same distance from Wokingham into London Waterloo face a £3,248 bill. :: Adonis slams Govt rail 'bailout' Stephen Joseph, chief executive of CBT, told Sky News: ""UK railways are more expensive than many European networks, partly due to the different ways the railways are operated here. ""But it's also because passengers pay for the bulk of the running costs, despite the obvious economic and social benefits to the whole country from having a well-used rail network. ""But fare revenue now covers the costs of running the railways and then some. ""That's why we need simpler, fairer and cheaper rail fares, a freeze on any further rises and flexible season tickets to help the growing army of part-time workers - something most other European countries already offer."" Train companies argue higher fares are needed for more investment - to buy new trains, keep services running regularly and improve safety on the network. But the 2017 European Railway Performance Index found the highest-ranking countries included those with high government subsidy of rail fares, with Germany and France outstripping Britain."

It stood at 230,000 in the year to June. The Prime Minister's spokesman denied there was any change planned and said Mrs May's position was ""clear"". Despite lobbying from newly-elected Scottish Tory MPs as revealed by Sky News last month, their efforts to change the way migration is counted appear to have faltered. Asked if she would change the policy, the PM's spokesman said: ""No - the position of the Prime Minister on this is clear. ""The international definition of an immigrant is someone who is here for more than 12 months."" Asked if Mrs May would win a vote in the Commons if an amendment were tabled to the Immigration Bill to take students out of the number, the spokesman said: ""I'm not aware that there is a vote."" He was also challenged on Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson saying the current policy was ""distortive, counter-productive and sends out entirely the wrong signals"". The spokesman replied: ""There's no upper limit on the number of students who study in this country, many do so and our universities provide them with a wonderful service. ""Having a record of how many people are in the country is obviously necessary."" It comes amid reports of a Cabinet division over the position on counting international students in and out of the country. Sky News revealed in December how MPs had held private meetings with Home Secretary Amber Rudd and immigration minister Brandon Lewis to appeal for a change. Universities have argued that removing students from immigration numbers will send a powerful signal that talent is welcome in post-Brexit UK."

They had been together since 1995, after she moved to north London with her children from Islington. Johnson previously pleaded not guilty to murder, but admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. He changed his plea on the first day of his trial at the Old Bailey. After he killed her, Johnson threw himself in front of an express train at Cheshunt station, and survived, although was left with horrific injuries. Ms Best was found by police when they went to his north London home, and discovered her body lying on the floor with a belt wrapped around her neck and a blood-stained hammer nearby. Johnson has two previous convictions, for manslaughter, both involving the deaths of his partners. In November 1981, he was convicted by a jury of killing his wife Yvonne Johnson. He hit her over the head with a vase before pushing her over the balcony of their ninth-floor flat in Wolverhampton. In March 1993, he was convicted of killing his partner Yvonne Bennett, with whom he had a child. He strangled her with a belt after he discovered she had an affair. Johnson had been released from a psychiatric unit before he met Ms Best. Her sisters sat in court as the judge remanded Johnson into custody, to be sentenced on Friday."

Ticket prices have risen by an average of 3.4%, with some commuters now spending up to five times as much of their salary on season tickets as people on the continent. :: MP demo goes off the rails amid train breakdown The Department for Transport said the price rises were capped in line with inflation and paid for investment in several ambitious rail projects, including Crossrail.

Thirteen percent answered 'don't know'. :: Sky Views: Rail privatisation has been a success People in London, where 50% of train journeys in Britain start or finish, are unsurprisingly the most opposed to the fare hike, with 80% deeming it unfair - though a clear majority oppose the rise across every region. Younger people are also more likely to oppose the price rises, with 79% of 18-34s saying they are unfair, falling to 69% - still a large majority - among those aged 55 and older.

The zoo announced on Facebook that it would close early ""to work with some of our animals quietly"" - and later informed followers that it would remain shut on Saturday. The tragic news was revealed in a Facebook post. ""On Friday morning our troop of lion-tailed macaques lost one of their young members who sadly passed away,"" it read. ""Lion-tailed macaques are a highly social species and as part of their natural grieving process have been guarding and preening this youngster which will help the whole group come to terms with their loss. ""We hope you understand that the closure of the Wildlife Centre recently, to allow our macaques time to carry out this process, is the right decision for our animals."" Lion-tailed macaques were only welcomed to Camperdown in late October, with four males and seven females making their way to Scotland from Belfast Zoo. The youngest was born in June and the oldest was born in December 1997. There are estimated to be less than 4,000 of them in the wild."

He was arrested for drink driving on 12 November when he was found to be two times over the limit. The football pundit asked the officer if he was being arrested because he was black, and then accused the police of racism before urinating in the police car. The father of four pleaded guilty to drink-driving and a racially aggravated public order offence. In a statement read to the court, PC Gareth Evans said Sinclair was ""very calm"" before the arrest but began getting ""more aggressive"". ""He started asking if it was because he was black. Black people are under-represented in the police. He started getting more confrontational, he was getting more aggressive. ""I did not like the direction the conversation was going in - he was accusing me of being racist,"" said PC Evans. Sinclair called the officer a ""white..."" followed by a swear word as the van doors slammed, and he made further racist comments while in the back of the van and continued to be ""obnoxious, aggressive and racist while being booked in"", he said. PC Evans' statement concluded: ""Sinclair's behaviour following his arrest was awful. I'm not a racist. His behaviour was extremely racist."" Sinclair's lawyer, Nick Freeman, said his client had been subjected to racism in front of his family while out having a meal hours earlier - and that was the ""catalyst"" for his subsequent behaviour. Mr Freeman said a woman had approached Sinclair, patted him on the head and called him a ""little chocolate man"". ""He's totally appalled at his behaviour. He's embarrassed, genuinely contrite and first and foremost would like to apologise to PC Evans,"" Mr Freeman added. ""He accepts police were not racist towards him."" The prosecution dropped other charges after Sinclair's guilty pleas, including assault on a police officer, failing to provide a specimen and criminal damage."

Speaking to the German newspaper Die Welt, the independent crossbencher and former chief economist at Goldman Sachs justified his position by pointing out that China's growth this year would match the entire Australian economy. He said: ""If you look at China's growth in US dollar terms, the country will achieve a national economy the size of Australia this year. And four times New Zealand. ""And trade minister Liam Fox and our ludicrous foreign minister spend half of their time travelling to New Zealand. It is mad, mad."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also piled in, saying Mr Johnson and Mr Fox do not understand how global trade works. Sir Vince said: ""The future of our country is resting in their hands yet they have shown time and time again that they have a chronic misconception of how the modern, globalised world works."" He added: ""Of course it is right to disown (US President Donald) Trump's nationalistic and short-sighted approach to Pacific countries but far-flung trade deals will never compensate for leaving the world's largest market sitting on our doorstep."" The Die Welt interview was published as Dr Fox embarked on a three-day visit to China to promote British businesses and innovation. Speaking in Beijing, the International Trade Secretary said ""we want to be an open, outward-looking country"" after Brexit. He also addressed reports Britain has held informal talks about joining a Pacific trade group once the EU divorce comes into effect. Dr Fox said that while it was ""premature"" to sign up to the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership because the current agreement is being renegotiated, Britain will ""keep an open mind"" for the future. Speaking to MPs before Christmas, Prime Minister Theresa May outlined plans to sign trade deals with non-EU countries during the anticipated two-year Brexit transition period. This is expected to begin in March 2019 if the divorce progress proceeds as scheduled. As a result of Brexit, Britain will have the opportunity to negotiate its own bespoke free trade deals with countries around the world, rather than be bound by the agreements negotiated by the EU."

In the latest in a string of interventions since the June 2016 referendum, Mr Blair attacked Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying the party's ""timidity"" over Europe under his leadership will usher in Brexit if it continues. :: Blair urges tougher immigration controls in bid to stop Brexit Mr Blair's comments quickly provoked the ire of Brexit supporters. The campaign group Leave Means Leave said voters would take no notice of a leader ""who took us to war on a lie and who cannot admit when he is wrong"", the former accusation a reference to controversial Iraq War in 2003. In his call for his successor to radically alter his approach, Mr Blair urged Labour to ""make Brexit the Tory Brexit"". The ex-PM, who led Britain from 1997-2007, said he disagreed with Mr Corbyn's position ""strategically"", adding he believed it was ""mistaken"" tactically. :: Blair denies telling Trump UK was spying on him  ""First, because the Labour Party is saying that we too would do Brexit, we cannot attack its vast distractive impact,"" Mr Blair said. ""Labour could mount such a powerful assault on the Government's record from the appalling state of the NHS to crime, which through neglect and failure to support the police is on the rise again, if we were saying to the country: here's the agenda which could be delivered for the people were it not for the fact that all the energies of Government and substantial amounts of cash are devoted to Brexit. ""And, second, it puts us in a vulnerable position when the Government concludes 'the deal' some time in 2018."" Mr Blair said Labour should instead ""fight for the right for the country to re-think"" and demand full details from the EU of what the future relationship will look like before finalising Brexit. He suggested going ""to the high ground on opposing Brexit and go after the Tories for their failures to tackle the country's real challenges"". Mr Blair added: ""At every PMQs nail each myth of the Brexit campaign, say why the Tory divisions are weakening our country, something only credible if we are opposed to Brexit, not advocating a different Brexit, and challenge the whole farce head on of a Prime Minister leading our nation in a direction which even today she can't bring herself to say she would vote for. ""If we do leave Europe, the governing mind will have been that of the Tory right. ""But, if Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the single market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour."" As well as his article, the former PM's Institute for Global Change has issued a report setting out what it says has been learned since the referendum. Liberal Democrat Sir Nick Clegg, a former deputy PM and supporter of the pro-EU campaign group Open Britain, said the document laid bare the ""eye-watering costs and sheer complexity"" of Brexit."

The Prime Minister will visit medical staff later to thank them for their efforts. It comes after the Health Secretary, in an interview with Sky News, apologised to the tens of thousands of patients affected. :: NHS doctor: 'We are appalled by our own care' Jeremy Hunt said the situation was ""absolutely not what I want"". Mr Hunt later said a new 10-year plan was ""exactly what I think we need to do"" for the NHS, appealing to health service staff to ""bear with us"" as extra doctors and nurses are trained. Doctors on the front line say they are hopeful they are being listened to. Dr Kishan Rees, an emergency doctor in Lincoln, welcomed Mr Hunt's comments. :: Hospitals told to cancel all non-urgent operations after hectic festive period He told Sky News: ""Every single year there is a crisis and that can’t continue, of course that's not sustainable. ""We just need to look across the country all over the media and social media we have had senior doctors speaking out and airing some of their concerns and it’s very difficult for doctors and health care professionals to speak out about their concerns in terms of patient care and safety. ""I think we should be applauding the fact that they appear to be being listened to."" NHS England estimates that 55,000 non-urgent procedures could be postponed over the next few weeks. The Prime Minister said she recognised it was disappointing and frustrating for affected patients - but claimed the health service is better prepared ""than ever before"". But some experts argue the preparations were superficial. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, told Sky News the Government had ""done a lot of tactical planning, but the problem is more long term fundamental and strategic"". Three leading health charities say the NHS needs an extra £4bn next year. The Government allocated less than half that in the Autumn budget with £1.9bn, including £335m for this winter. It is estimated there could be a £20bn funding gap by the end of this parliament. An NHS England spokesman said: ""Hospitals are under significant pressure over the winter period and are reporting high levels of respiratory illness, increasing flu prevalence and a rise in the severity of illness among patients arriving at A&Es. ""The NHS' National Emergency Pressures Panel - led by senior clinicians - has acted promptly, at what is the busiest time of year, to help hospitals free up beds and staff to be able to care for the sickest patients."" Professor Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""It is much better that patients are given several weeks' notice, rather than a day's, that their operation won't go ahead. ""This avoids wasting their time and the guidance from NHS England is helping hospitals to better support their emergency and urgent patients. ""Unfortunately it is unlikely to help performance against the 18-week waiting time target."""

Italian authorities put the overall value of the collection of Treasures of the Mughals and the Maharajahs on display at several million euros. Police believe two thieves got away with earrings and a brooch on Wednesday - the final day of a four-month exhibition that featured some 270 items showcasing five centuries of Indian craftsmanship. Detectives said one kept watch while the other opened the display case and grabbed the jewelled golden brooch and earrings. The thieves, whom police said appeared to have been part of a larger gang, seemed to have been able to delay the museum's alarm system which only sounded when they were already escaping. They then disappeared among the crowds to make their escape. The alarm was raised several hours later at the palace, known as the Palazzo Ducale , in central Venice in Saint Mark's Square. Chief police commissioner Vito Gagliardi said. ""We are clearly dealing here with two skilled professionals who managed to pull off their feat despite all the display rooms being fitted with technologically highly sophisticated (alarm) systems."" A spokesman for the collection, John Maxse, said it was in contact with Italian authorities and Venice's Foundation of Civic Museums, which runs the Doge's Palace. Venice police said the items are so unique they will be nearly impossible to sell on the market. The collection was assembled by Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani and now belongs to Qatar's ruling family."
2018-01-03,Mother-of-three Deborah Dobrin says social media is leaving an image-conscious generation of children feeling insecure.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180104050851/https://news.sky.com/story/reality-versus-social-media-dangers-facing-image-conscious-children-11194342,"Here she describes how a few simple rules can help youngsters manage the ""minefield"" of the online world. The life of a teenager is governed by social media. They make plans, meet new people and make decisions in full public view of their friends. They are all so image conscious. Almost every picture I see posted is either photo shopped or changed in some way. Often kids look much older than they are or pose in ways that are not necessarily appropriate for their age. I am sure this makes lots of children feel insecure about themselves; boys as well as girls. As the mother of three boys aged 14, 11 and six, I find it really scary and I can't say I completely understand it at all. My eldest son has access to more social media than my middle son, who is not allowed on Snapchat or Facebook. My youngest son has no access at all. My social media experience tends to be sharing a few family snaps on Facebook or connecting with people via Linkedin for work. It's a minefield and something I try to manage as best I can without appearing to be a ""smother"" (my sons' phrase to describe an over protective mother). My rules are as follows: I have spoken to all my kids about ""reality versus social media"" and try to make them understand that most people post a glorified representation of reality. There is always more behind every picture and everyone puts their ""best face"" forward. I find the influence that bloggers and YouTubers have on my children a challenge. I try to keep on top of who are they following by watching YouTube videos with my kids. YouTube stars are the new celebrities and though, in my opinion, they are often incredibly dull, I try to show an interest. For me, the most important thing is to keep the conversation open with my kids, which is no mean feat with teenagers. I am sure there is plenty that I don't know about. I hope by discussing the dangers of social media regularly it will ensure that if they had a problem either online or off line they would come to me. Social media cannot be ignored, it is here to stay. Keeping my kids aware of ""online stranger danger"" and social media's influence on their confidence and mental health should hopefully make it a safer place. It's the best I can hope for."
2018-01-03,A London doctor tells Sky News what it is like to work in an overstretched NHS hospital where he says medics are desperately trying to treat hundreds of patients with not enough space to do so.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180104050851/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-frontline-doctor-reveals-reality-of-overstretched-hospitals-11194127,"Working as a senior doctor in an A&E department this winter means one very simple thing: providing care to more people than we have the resources or capacity to treat. It does not require a brain surgeon to work out that we cannot look after you on a trolley in a corridor as well as we could in a specifically designed patient area. Corridors don't have the correct equipment and they certainly don't come with the appropriately trained staff, but corridors are where patients are parked while they wait for beds in the hospital and the emergency room continues to fill. The numbers will increase as the winter crisis deepens. The cuts to beds, funding and social care, as well as problems recruiting healthcare professionals to staff A&E make this inevitable. :: Hospitals told to cancel all non-urgent operations after hectic festive period Our only option is to make do and hope. Hope that in a few days some bed space in the hospital will become available to move you to. Hope that some patients will be able to get the care they need in the community so that they can be at home. Hope that, in a few months time, the pressure may ease a little so that we can give patients the attention, the dignity and care that they need. Hope that Government funding may start to match the resources we need to care for patients' safely. Make no mistake, we are appalled by the level of care we can provide. Our attention, our decision making, our compassion and our energy all have limits and working consistently beyond capacity means mistakes can be made and the care we provide for our patients suffers. The end of each of my shifts is greeted with relief that it is over; my off-duty is then spent worrying about whether my decisions were correct, whether I missed an infection, a heart attack or a cancer. No doctor wants to work like this. No patient should have to experience it. That there are more patients who are older, sicker and more complex is completely predictable. A few million 70 year olds were not suddenly born in 2015. When politicians tell you that ""demand"" is too high or that ""too many patients"" are presenting to emergency departments, doctors roll their eyes, exasperated at the ministerial hogwash trotted out to excuse the fact that those in charge are failing the healthcare of this country. The crisis we are facing in our departments could have been prevented if the Government had provided the appropriate resources and planned for it. This is incredibly frustrating for those of us who work on the front line of the NHS. We cannot do more with less. We simply cannot. My patients are angry. I want to tell them that so am I. So are all healthcare workers. There is no health minister standing in our waiting room apologising for the seven-hour wait. The corridors of Westminster are not stacked with trolleys of patients waiting for a bed. And so it is left to doctors like me to assess, care for and treat patients as best we can, alongside apologising for the failings of the health service. Failings that we have no control over. And so as well as providing care, I now feel that it is also my job to speak out. To stand with our patients to demand better. It is a matter of life and death."
2018-01-03,"The Children’s Commissioner for England has called for compulsory digital literacy to be taught in primary schools to help children cope with the pressure of getting likes, comments and views on social media.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180104050851/https://news.sky.com/story/children-ill-equipped-for-social-media-demands-11194861,"The call comes after an in-depth study, involving eight groups with 32 children aged eight to 12, found the most popular social media accounts are Snapchat, Instagram, Musical.ly and Whatsapp - despite them being blocked for under-13s. The report - called Life in Likes - found that while eight to 10-year-old children use social media in a playful, creative way - often to play games - this changes significantly as their social circles expand in Year 7 and secondary school. Many Year 7 children say they are finding social media hard to manage and becoming over-dependent on likes and comments for social validation. Researchers say children become increasingly anxious about their online image and ""keeping up appearances"" as they get older. This can be made worse when they start to follow celebrities and others outside close family and friends and this group grows significantly upon starting secondary school. Their use of platforms like Instagram and Snapchat can also undermine children’s view of themselves by making them feel inferior to the people they follow. Children worry about ""sharenting"" – parents posting pictures of them on social media without their permission and then not listening if they ask for them to take photos down. Whilst most social media sites have an official age limit of 13, some research has suggested three-quarters of 10 to 12-year-old children have a social media account. Thursday's report reveals many children are approaching a ""cliff edge"" as they transition from primary to secondary school. Anne Longfield, Children’s Commissioner for England, said: “While social media clearly provides some great benefits to children, it is also exposing them to significant risks emotionally, particularly as they approach Year 7. ""I am worried that many children are starting secondary school ill-equipped to cope with the sudden demands of social media as their world expands. It is also clear that social media companies are still not doing enough to stop under-13s using their platforms in the first place."" Social networks say their terms and conditions are clear and that under-13s should not be joining. Michelle Napchan, head of public policy for Instagram in EMEA, said: “We agree with the need for education to help young people live healthy digital lives. ""That’s why we work with experts to develop tools and resources that young people can access directly from within the Instagram app, as well as a parents’ guide to Instagram where we encourage them to talk to their teenagers about internet safety. ""Our community guidelines also make it clear that you have to be 13 or over to use Instagram, and any account identified as belonging to someone under-age is removed."" The NSPCC says the technology companies could do more though, as it is easy to fake a date of birth when children sign up. It is also calling on parents to take a more active role. Tony Stower, head of child safety online, told Sky News: ""If you feel you are being isolated because you’re not keeping up with the latest snap streak, or you're not liking enough Instagram posts, that could be quite exclusionary. ""We need to make sure that parents are taking a keen interest in their children's lives and talking to them every day about the issues they face online and offline."""

Staff at the branches in Cambridge and Crayford had voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action, demanding more secure working patterns and a wage of at least £10 an hour. A McDonald's spokesperson told Sky News: ""Our people are at the heart of our business and, as a responsible and proud employer, we are committed to investing in them. ""Reward and recognition for our people and their contribution is a key priority, and to ensure we can attract and retain the best people, we regularly review pay and benefits. ""While our franchisees set their own pay rates, we have recommended an increase across all age bands for our hourly employees to be implemented from 22 January. ""From kitchen to counter to front of house, our success would not be possible without the hard work of our people, so we will keep working hard to do right by them."" One employee shared a picture with the Mirror Online of a notice put up for employees. It stated that the new rates of pay ranged from £5.75 to £7 for a crew member aged 16-17; £8 to £10 for a crew member aged 25 and over; and £9.50 and £11.75 for a shift-running floor manager.

They also confirmed that the current recommended starting rate was £5.10 for under 18s and £7.60 for over 25s but stressed these were minimum rates.

Residents setting off from Tame Bridge Parkway, near Walsall, for Nuneaton have been hit with the biggest percentage increase of 50% - with a ticket now priced at £2,916. And Theresa May's own constituents have seen their annual ticket from Maidenhead to London Paddington jump by £732 since the Conservatives came to power, Labour said. It comes as passengers face a New Year fare hike - the highest in five years. One campaign group, Railfuture, warned: ""People are being priced out of going to work."" The bumper rise is sparking comparisons with European rail fares. In Germany, residents can purchase a BahnCard100 - a ticket covering travel across the entire network - for €4.270,00 (£3,795). For comparison, the new cost of a season ticket from Peterborough to Kings Cross is £6,540, while Liverpool to Manchester is £3,152. :: Under 30s to benefit from new 'millennial' railcards Meanwhile in France, the latest figures released by the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) show the annual cost of the commute from Ballancourt-sur-Essonne to Paris is just £750. And in Italy, passengers making the journey between Velletri and Rome - which is about the same 23-mile distance - pay £442 for the year. But commuters travelling the same distance from Wokingham into London Waterloo face a £3,248 bill. :: Adonis slams Govt rail 'bailout' Stephen Joseph, chief executive of CBT, told Sky News: ""UK railways are more expensive than many European networks, partly due to the different ways the railways are operated here. ""But it's also because passengers pay for the bulk of the running costs, despite the obvious economic and social benefits to the whole country from having a well-used rail network. ""But fare revenue now covers the costs of running the railways and then some. ""That's why we need simpler, fairer and cheaper rail fares, a freeze on any further rises and flexible season tickets to help the growing army of part-time workers - something most other European countries already offer."" Train companies argue higher fares are needed for more investment - to buy new trains, keep services running regularly and improve safety on the network. But the 2017 European Railway Performance Index found the highest-ranking countries included those with high government subsidy of rail fares, with Germany and France outstripping Britain."
2018-01-03,Two Tory MPs have revealed they jokingly call their son 'Brexit Clifford' because he was born on the day Article 50 was triggered.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180104050851/https://news.sky.com/story/tory-mp-couple-nickname-their-baby-brexit-clifford-11194464,"Andrea Jenkyns and Jack Lopresti, who both backed Leave in the EU referendum, named the baby Clifford after Ms Jenkyns' late father. But because of the timing of the birth - on 29 March 2017 - they gave him a special nickname. Ms Jenkyns made the revelation after her wedding in the Palace of Westminster. She said: ""I am absolutely delighted, to have married Jack here today and have been lucky enough to have our son, Clifford, as the ring bearer. ""I would like to thank my mother, Val, for walking me down the aisle today. ""My father, Clifford, whom my son is named after, died six years ago and my thoughts and prayers were with him today."" On Ms Jenkyns' website, a press release about the wedding added: ""Baby Clifford was nicknamed 'Brexit Clifford' when he was born on the day Article 50 was triggered in Parliament."" Ms Jenkyns is MP for Morley and Outwood, having ousted former shadow chancellor Ed Balls in the 2015 general election by a margin of 422 votes. She tweeted photos of Mr Lopresti and Clifford beaming on the Parliament terrace over-looking the River Thames and another of her wearing a flowing white wedding dress holding the baby in the Commons chamber. Ms Jenkyns wrote in a post last week: ""A massive thank you to all our family and friends for your love and support on our wedding day. ""To my amazing Mum who walked me down the aisle.

Twenty-two people were killed in the explosion, which was caused by suicide bomber Salman Abedi at the end of an Ariana Grande gig. Parker was widely praised for his response to the attack after he spoke to news outlets about helping the injured. The 33-year-old has now admitted taking the purse of Pauline Healey as her granddaughter, Sorrell Leczkowski, 14, lay dying yards away. He also admitted one count of fraud, after using Mrs Healey's bank cards in McDonald's on the night of the attack. :: Medics describe 'night of horror' in Manchester During a hearing at Manchester Crown Court, he also pleaded guilty to taking a mobile phone belonging to a teenage girl. CCTV footage played in court showed Parker returning to Mrs Healey on multiple occasions before leaning over her and taking her purse. He had been due to stand trial from 2 January, having previously denied the charges, but failed to turn up to court. The case had to be adjourned, and he was later found hiding in the loft of a hostel in Halifax, where he was arrested. Speaking after the hearing, Sky News North of England correspondent Frazer Maude said the CCTV footage showed Parker ""picking up a jacket, feeling it as if to see if there was anything of value in it"".   :: Ariana Grande 'moved' by Manchester honour He said: ""The prosecution alleged he kicked a bag away from someone, before going back to it and rifling through it. ""He claimed that he had cradled a dying woman in his arms. Throughout all the CCTV footage, there was no evidence of him helping anyone. ""It was obvious that he was looking at people's possessions, in bags. Using his telephone to take pictures of the victims, those pictures were sold to one UK media outlet."" The photographs were sold to a UK news agency and it is understood they were used by some news sources. Prosecutors said there was some evidence Parker had provided some help to people at the venue's entrance, but that he used the opportunity ""equally"" to steal. Parker's lawyer told the court he was sorry for his ""appalling behaviour"". He will be sentenced on January 30. Judge David Hernandez said custody was ""likely"". The judge added that he would be unlikely to be able to refer to any other cases for guidance on sentencing. Parker has several previous convictions dating from 2000, including shoplifting and burglary offences. Mrs Healey went to the Arena with her daughter and granddaughter to meet someone after the concert but had not attended themselves. Mrs Healey was injured in the explosion and had 15 hours of surgery after the blast."

The London club has since identified the fan involved after he was ejected following the confrontation, which led to the former Tottenham Hotspur player being escorted down the tunnel. West Brom said their player had the club's ""total support"" in a statement on Wednesday, which said the player had already been subjected to ""general abuse from home supporters which he shrugged off"" before the alleged incident. The statement said: ""He acknowledges that he moved to confront one spectator who chose to make a comment about the death of his infant son. ""The club would like to think that all right-minded football supporters could understand this reaction, which did not result in any physical exchanges, before Jake was led away to our dressing room. ""Jake is an outstanding young individual who has the total support of everyone at the club and he has made it clear he considers this statement to be an end to an unhappy incident."" The Football Association requested observations from all those involved. West Ham United said it intended to take swift action and is considering implementing a stadium ban over the incident. After the game, West Brom manager Alan Pardew said he saw Livermore enter the crowd, but did not know what had motivated it. He said: ""The only thing I know is I see Jake in the crowd, which disturbed me. Obviously you don't want to see a player in the crowd. ""There's no way he's going in the crowd - because I know him, he's a great lad - unless he was provoked severely. That's all I know."" West Ham manager David Moyes said he did not see the incident. He said: ""I didn't know about it, but I've been told something happened."" Livermore tested positive for cocaine in April 2015 and played three further matches before being suspended by the FA. But he subsequently escaped a further ban after the FA decided the death of his new-born son in May 2014 was an overwhelming mitigating factor."

The author was, he said, afforded unchecked access to Trump World for weeks on end, chatting on and off the record with anyone he fancied. Now, we can divide the incendiary result into two sets of problems for the leader of the free world. The first deals with Russia. Mr Wolff quotes former chief strategist Steve Bannon describing a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr and Russian operatives promising dirt on candidate Hillary Clinton as ""treasonous"" - and adds that he was certain Trump Jr took the Russians to meet his father, directly contradicting many promises to the contrary. This is problematic because special counsel Robert Mueller is currently conducting a criminal investigation into whether or not Mr Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the elections. Mr Bannon also said that Mr Mueller's investigation would be all about money laundering, and that his path to Mr Trump would lead through shady business deals, perhaps via his son-in-law Jared Kushner - an astonishing thing to say given it could help Mr Mueller bring about criminal charges. :: President Trump launches scathing attack on former top aide Steve Bannon:: Blair denies telling Trump UK was spying on him The other set of allegations in the book are just plain embarrassing, and so deal a blow to the ego of a man who makes no secret of his love of being treated ""well"". These are just some of them: :: Trump did not want to win, and neither did anyone else on his staff. They weren't prepared to. When he did, Melania cried, and not in happiness. :: Mr Bannon says Ivanka Trump is as ""dumb as a brick"" - and he and other staff openly describe President Trump's lack of knowledge and ability to absorb basic information. :: One adviser describes how Mr Trump's eyes ""rolled back in his head"" when he tried to explain the constitution to him. :: His deputy chief of staff characterised him as a ""child"". :: Rupert Murdoch is quoted as calling Mr Trump a ""f****** idiot"". :: His treasury secretary and top economic adviser also apparently both regard him as stupid. A picture is painted of almost unbelievable incompetence and dysfunction; a White House lurching from self-inflicted crisis to self-inflicted crisis. Mr Trump's administration has strenuously denied what has been printed, but it almost doesn't matter. The President has been monumentally disrespected. And if there's one thing Donald Trump hates, it is disrespect. Now his war with Mr Bannon, a self-described bomb-thrower with an umbilical connection to Mr Trump's base via his Breitbart website, is wide out in the open. This is a moment of peril for the occupant of the Oval Office. There is a solidifying sense, whether true or not, that he is out of his depth. This will make it much harder for him to do an already hard job. And worse, there is now a chance that Mr Bannon might use the extraordinary influence and vision that helped him usher Mr Trump into the White House to do as much damage as possible to his former boss. Mr Bannon will be an unpleasant foe, and the stakes for the 2018 mid-term elections just got a lot higher."
2018-01-03,Princess Charlotte is preparing for a major milestone as her nursery school opens its doors for a new term this week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180104050851/https://news.sky.com/story/princess-charlotte-prepares-to-start-at-the-willcocks-nursery-11194262,"The two-year-old is attending The Willcocks in London - close to her family's Kensington Palace home - which is rated outstanding by Ofsted and described by Tatler magazine as a ""hidden gem"". Here's what we know about the place where Charlotte will spend her pre-school days. The Willcocks, which charges £3,050 a term for morning school, is owned and run by headmistress Lavinia Taylor and offers a range of classes including French, dance, sport and music. Founded in 1964 by Diana Willcocks, it calls itself a ""traditional nursery school"" and is located in the church hall of Holy Trinity Church in Kensington, close to the Royal Albert Hall. Activities enjoyed by its pupils include garden play, cooking, painting and music time, with each child's development monitored by an allocated member of staff. A recent Ofsted report on The Willcocks said children were ""exceptionally well-behaved"", while a parent testimonial on the school's website described its teachers as ""the kindest"" and ""most encouraging"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will initially be invited to a short ""stay and play"" session with Charlotte before they are asked to leave for a short period to see if she is happy. This will then be gradually extended to the full morning or afternoon. Some 32 children aged between two and five can attend the nursery's morning school, which runs five days a week from 9am to midday. Afternoon school - costing £1,800 a term - runs for two hours a day, three days a week. The nursery charges a registration fee of £125 to secure a place on its waiting list, which is non-refundable and does not necessarily guarantee a place at the school. William and Kate will be invited to the nursery's parents' association meetings to share ideas and plan fund-raising events. William can also join a fathers' breakfast club. It is not known if Charlotte, who is fourth in line to the throne, will start at the nursery on the same day as her classmates. Her new adventure comes just months before William and Kate welcome a new arrival into the family, with their third child due in April. In September, Charlotte's older brother, Prince George, started at Thomas's Battersea, a fee-paying independent school in south London. He previously attended Montessori nursery school in Norfolk, which is close to the family's country home, Anmer Hall. If William and Kate decide to send Charlotte to Thomas's Battersea with her brother she is unlikely to have to any problems gaining a place, as the school gives priority to siblings of current pupils."

He told Sky News: ""If you are someone whose operation has been delayed I don't belittle that for one moment, and indeed I apologise to everyone who that has happened to."" But he said that ""reluctantly"" postponing treatment to ease pressures on A&E departments was ""better for people"". The comments came after Theresa May denied the health service was in ""crisis"", saying it was more prepared ""than ever before"". :: NHS doctor: 'We are appalled by our own care' On Tuesday, NHS England told hospitals to postpone non-urgent operations, leading to tens of thousands of cancellations. After medics said they were struggling to cope with patient numbers, Mr Hunt offered a ""massive"" thank you for their ""heroic"" work and praised them ""going beyond the call of duty in every possible way"". Mr Hunt explained that under similar pressure in 2016, hospitals were calling patients the night before an operation and cancelling as the scale of the crisis grew. But this year a ""planned, methodical and thoughtful"" approach was being taken, he said. Pressed on whether more money was needed for social care to ease the pressure on frontline hospital staff, Mr Hunt told Sky News: ""There are undoubtedly pressures throughout the whole system. ""I think Theresa May has realised how important social care is to the NHS."" The PM also gave a ""huge"" thank you to health service staff doing a ""fantastic"" job. But she said: ""The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before, we have put extra funding in. ''There are more beds available across the system, we've reduced the number of delayed discharges of elderly people who would otherwise have been in NHS beds rather than in social care."" John Ashworth, Labour's shadow health secretary, responded: ""Yet again Theresa May reveals how entirely out of touch she is. Next, she will be trying to lecture patients that 'nothing has changed' for patients. ""The reality is we see hospitals at full capacity, ambulances backed up, cancelled operations and patients waiting for hours on trolleys. ""Instead of burying her head in the sand, Theresa May needs to explain why she has allowed underfunding and cuts to health and social care to continue."" Doctors in southeast London told Sky News earlier that nearly all hospitals in the area were at breaking point, with corridors packed full of patients on trollies. Meanwhile, the East of England Ambulance Trust said they had to use taxis to take 13 patients to hospital over the New Year because all ambulances were queuing outside hospitals."

Mr Trump himself fuelled the controversy after stating that his former senior adviser Steve Bannon - who told the book's author Michael Wolff that meetings between campaign officials and a lawyer linked to the Kremlin amounted to treason - had ""lost his mind"". The Times newspaper reported that Mr Wolff's book contains an account of a meeting between Mr Blair and senior Trump aide Jared Kushner at the White House last February. According to Mr Wolff, Mr Blair shared a ""juicy rumour"" that British intelligence agencies had spied on Trump campaign staff during the election, ""monitoring its telephone calls and other communications and possibly even Trump himself"". The book also suggested that the former PM was after a role as Middle East adviser to the President at the time. A month after the alleged meeting, then White House press spokesman Sean Spicer repeated claims made on Fox News that Barack Obama had asked British intelligence to spy on Trump Tower. The Government's GCHQ surveillance centre dismissed those claims as ""utterly ridiculous"". A spokesman for Mr Blair said the allegations in The Times ""are a complete fabrication, have no basis in reality and are simply untrue"". In an excerpt from the book, Mr Bannon is quoted as saying a Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a group of lawyers was ""unpatriotic"" and ""treasonous"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders claimed the book was filled with ""false and misleading accounts"", and labelled Mr Bannon's accusation as ""ridiculous"".

Thousands of people are expected to descend on the Berkshire town for the wedding on 19 May. Mr Dudley, leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead unitary authority, wrote on Twitter that some rough sleepers had made a ""commercial life choice praying on residents and tourists"". And in a letter to Thames Valley Police he complained about ""aggressive begging and intimidation"" as well as ""bags and detritus"" on the streets. The council leader claimed on Twitter over Christmas that there was ""an epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy"" in Windsor and called on police to ""focus on dealing with this before the #RoyalWedding"". But his stance has provoked outrage, with a local homeless charity describing Mr Dudley's remarks as ""sickening"". Murphy James from the Windsor Homeless Project, said: ""It's absolutely abhorrent that anybody has got these views in this day and age, especially a lead councillor of the borough. ""If somebody is sleeping out on the street, they are not there by choice, they are there because something has gone wrong."" Mr James said it was ""sickening"" that the councillor had cited the Royal wedding to back up his comments. The police responded to Mr Dudley's tweets by saying: ""We need to protect the most vulnerable in society by working together but each agency must understand its own unique responsibilities. ""Housing is the responsibility of the council but it is better that agencies work together so people don't become homeless. ""We deal with reports of begging proportionately but we have not had reports of anyone being marched to cashpoints to take out money."" As well as his public calls for action on Twitter, Mr Dudley wrote to Anthony Stansfeld, Police and Crime Commissioner for Thames Valley Police on Tuesday. In the letter, he said officers should use powers under the 1824 Vagrancy Act and the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 to ""protect residents and tourists"". Mr Stansfeld said he was ""somewhat surprised"" the letter had been made public before it had been sent directly to him. ""I myself attended a Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council in October and these issues were not raised,"" he said. ""I will of course provide Cllr Dudley with a full response addressing his concerns once I have received the letter and investigated further the issues he has raised."" He added: ""Protecting the public is of the utmost importance to both myself and Thames Valley Police and the force work day in and day out to keep people safe from harm and make the Thames Valley a safe place to live, work and visit."""

They are all being held in the West Midlands. A 37-year-old woman, from Banbury, is being held at a station outside the force area. Several counter-terror units from forces across the country were involved in the operation.

""A number of properties are being searched in connection with the arrests,"" the force said. ""The arrests were pre-planned and intelligence-led; there was no threat to the public's safety."" National Action was made a banned group in December 2016, by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. It is the first extreme right-wing group to be outlawed in the UK. The proscription means that being a member of or inviting support for the organisation is a criminal offence, carrying a sentence of up to 10 years' imprisonment. In the official list of proscribed groups, it is described as a ""racist neo-Nazi group"" that was established in 2013 and has branches across the UK which ""conduct provocative street demonstrations and stunts aimed at intimidating local communities"". When she banned the group, Ms Rudd said: ""National Action is a racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic organisation which stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology, and I will not stand for it. ""It has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone."" Police last arrested 11 people across England and Wales in September 2017 on suspicion of being members of the banned group."

They described the birth as an ""outstanding achievement which will have interest across the world"". Staff at the park in Kincraig near Kingussie had heard ""high-pitched sounds"" from Victoria's maternity den. Una Richardson, the head keeper responsible for carnivores, said: ""Because we don't have sight inside her cubbing box we can't be sure if Victoria has had more than one cub but we can confirm the birth."" The wildlife park stressed, however, that the first three months are perilous for polar bear cubs, whether born in the wild or in captivity. ""While we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother's exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned,"" Ms Richardson said. The cub is currently being monitored and the mother's den will remain closed to the public with minimal keeper activity to give her offspring ""every chance of survival"". Newborn polar bears are around 30cm long and weigh about the same as a guinea pig. They are born blind and open their eyes when they are a month old. Barbara Smith, the park's chief executive, said: ""At RZSS we believe we have a duty to help protect this magnificent species, with the reduction in sea ice, the polar bear's primary seal hunting platform, predicted to significantly reduce numbers over the next 40 years. ""Our polar bears are part of the European Endangered Species Programme and we hope Victoria's offspring will survive to reinforce the captive population, which may be needed in the future to augment and help restore a markedly reduced and fragmented wild population."" The polar bear breeding season began in March last year, when Victoria mated with Arktos, one of the park's two males."
2018-01-03,Florida has seen its first snowfall in three decades as a rare winter storm hit the southeast of the US on Wednesday.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180104050851/https://news.sky.com/story/florida-sees-snow-for-first-time-in-29-years-11194751,"The weather office in the sunshine state's capital Tallahassee measured 0.25cm (0.1ins) of snow on its roof, marking the first time it had experienced the white stuff since 1989. Plenty of excited locals - including the police force - took to Twitter to share pictures and videos of the exceptionally rare conditions. Five to eight centimetres (2-3ins) of snow were expected in northeast Florida, where there have been warnings of icy roads, power cuts and freezing temperatures. Warming shelters have been opened for residents and many flights out of Tallahassee Airport have been cancelled, with water attractions at a number of Florida's popular theme parks closed. It’s snowing in Tallahassee! As exciting as this is, please use extreme caution if you are driving & don’t expose yourself to the cold for too long without proper gear. #SunshineState #SnowDay #WinterIsHere pic.twitter.com/QVnnCTWQ5E The Governors of Georgia and North Carolina, meanwhile, joined their Florida counterpart in declaring a state of emergency, with at least 17 deaths across the US so far blamed on the record-breaking cold snap. In Rosevile, Michigan, police revealed that a 96-year-old woman suffering from dementia had been found dead in a playground, having apparently frozen to death after wandering outside in a robe and slippers. SNOW DAY!!! ⛄️😭 #Tallahassee pic.twitter.com/qICvKbXES7 Earlier this week, a homeless man was found dead on a porch in Charleston, West Virginia, and another man was found dead outside a church in Detroit, Michigan. Both may have frozen to death. Blizzard warnings remain in place from Virginia to Maine, with areas around Boston braced for about a foot of snow on Thursday due to the so-called ""bomb cyclone"" effect - when pressure falls very fast as a storm strengthens.

Be patient. ""With the amount of snow we're getting here, we could be ploughing your street and half an hour later it could look like we haven't been there."" The city broke a 100-year record on Tuesday with seven consecutive days of temperatures no higher than -6.7C, and Chicago also set a new low for New Year's Day, with temperatures not getting above -17C. In Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday, the conditions closed carriage horse tour companies and in nearby Mount Pleasant residents headed to grocery stores in droves to stock up on food and supplies. Parts of Texas, including Dallas, Houston and Austin, have also been below zero this week, and forecasters at the National Weather Service say New York City can expect between 5-10cm (2-4ins) of snow. Southeast Maine could see up to 38cm (15ins). Savannah in Georgia has already been blanketed in snow - its first in nearly eight years - and the coastal city airport has been closed. More than 2,000 flights have been cancelled across Savannah, Charleston and elsewhere because of the conditions. But North Carolina Zoo in the state's city of Asheboro has tried to make the most of the weather by offering discounted tickets to those keen to brave the cold and see polar bears, Arctic foxes and elk frolicking in their ideal conditions."
2018-01-04,Unilever is to close the the Norwich factory where Colman's Mustard has been made for 160 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105053654/https://news.sky.com/story/unilever-to-close-norwich-colmans-site-after-160-years-11195399,"The move will affect 113 jobs in the city, of which 40 will transfer to a separate Unilever site in Burton. Meanwhile, 25 jobs will be created at a new mustard milling and mint processing plant near Norwich. Manufacturing of most of the firm's other products is to move to elsewhere in the UK - mainly Burton upon Trent, already home to Unilever's Marmite and Bovril brands. Some other work, involving the packing of dry sauces, will move to an existing factory in Germany, where the sauce mixes are already made. Unilever took the decision after soft drinks maker Britvic said in October that it would close the Robinson's squash factory on a site shared with the Colman's plant. That prompted a review by Unilever, which said at the time that the operations of the two companies were ""uniquely intertwined"" with shared infrastructure. The conclusion of the review has now been announced, spelling a break in the long period of production of Colman's Mustard in the city. Unilever said the factory would be closed at the end of 2019, ""with a phased transfer of production likely to begin in 2018"". In a statement, the company said: ""We will protect the historic link between Colman's and Norwich by retaining the production and packing of Colman's mustard powder, the historic mustard milling process, and mint processing in a new state-of-the-art facility in the Norwich area, created through a new long-term partnership with a consortium of local farmers, backed by significant investment from Unilever. ""We will also continue to source our mint and mustard locally as we have for generations."" The firm said it recognised the closure announcement would be ""difficult news for our Norwich employees, their families, and the whole community in Norwich"" and that it was ""committed to supporting our employees during this difficult time"". It added: ""We will also offer all employees whose roles would be affected by the proposals a package of support, including redeployment opportunities at other sites, and services to help people find new employment."" Trade union Unite, which has a small number of engineering members at Colman's, urged Unilever to reconsider the business case for closure. Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy said: ""It is a devastating day for Norwich that the production of Colman's mustard will cease production in 2019, ending a tradition stretching back two centuries. ""Our aim during the consultation period will be to retain as many skilled jobs as possible within Unilever and that there should be no compulsory redundancies."" Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: ""The closure of Colman's in Norwich is a blow not only to the workers at Colman's and their families but to the town and region more generally."" A Government spokesperson said: ""The government is disappointed Unilever has decided to close its Norwich plant, though we welcome Unilever's commitment to mustard milling and mint production in Norwich."" Jeremiah Colman started his mustard and flour business in 1814 in Stokes Holy Cross, four miles south of Norwich. The current factory in Norwich was established in 1858. Colman's was taken over by Unilever in 1995."

Among those being awarded are the first officers who arrived on the scene; PC Jessica Bullough, PCSO Mark Renshaw, PCSO Jon Morrey and PCSO Lewis Brown. PSCO Morrey, who was on duty at the arena on the night of the attack, said he treated his first victim around 40 seconds after the explosion. He told Sky News: ""On the night it was just what needed to be done. People needed help. ""There were lower leg wounds. One man had a knee injury. His wife had an injury to her Achilles heel. There was a little girl about eight years old who needed treatment. “Most of the people I treated were very calm. I’d like to think I gave them the assurance they needed in a really dire time."" In total, 74 police, rail and security staff members are being honoured at the ceremony for their ""extraordinary acts of bravery in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester Arena terrorist attack"", BTP said. :: 'A night of horror': Medics relive night of the Manchester Arena bombing PCSO Renshaw treated a number of seriously injured people and comforted a little girl who had lost her mother. PC Bullough, who alerted the BTP control room that a bomb had exploded, performed CPR on a critically injured woman and used makeshift robes to cover people who had died. PCSO Brown, who was just six weeks into his job, ran from Manchester Victoria station to the scene, providing emergency first aid and supporting survivors. BTP said many officers arrived on the scene within minutes of the explosion and worked throughout the night, while others helped with the recovery and identification of victims. Staff from Northern Rail and Carlisle Support Services provided support by delivering first aid and evacuating casualties. BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said: “For many of us, the night of 22nd May will be a date that will forever be etched in our minds. “This ceremony gave us an opportunity to remember those 22 people who lost their lives and all the lives changed that night. “It also gave us a chance to formally recognise those who ran towards scenes of danger, despite unknown danger to themselves, to help and protect the many innocent people who found themselves caught up in the attack."""

The 42-year-old, who was pursued by police for shoplifting in a Sainsbury's and assaulting a security guard, claimed excessive forced had been used against him when he was surrendering. He said the incident left him feeling suicidal. An internal police investigation rejected the allegation and concluded that McClelland was a danger to the officers and the public. Throwing out the case at Brighton County Court, High Court judge Jonathan Simpkiss said McClelland had ""considerable antipathy"" towards the police and was ""squaring up for a fight"". He said it was ""quite clear the claimant posed a threat to officers"". :: Taser stun gun a 'less lethal' option for police forces McClelland's solicitor Sophie Khan called the decision ""bizarre"" and ""perverse"" and said he was considering an appeal. ""Paul is very disappointed,"" she said. ""The findings don't make any sense compared to the evidence. ""If you look at the CCTV the man has his arms in the air in a surrender pose. It's perverse.""

""Taser, Taser, Taser,"" the officer then shouts as the stun gun is used. In the clip, McClelland can be seen falling to the ground before another officer kicks him in the leg. PC Grant says: ""There are two barbs in your back, which will be removed. There will be no lasting effects from the Taser."" McClelland was asked how he was feeling after he was handcuffed. He was later convicted of theft, common assault and admitted obstructing a police officer, and was given a community order. According to court papers, he admitted he was drunk during the incident and that he wanted to ""fight them all"" as he was confronted by officers. Judge Simpkiss said it was ""objectively reasonable"" for the officers to use a Taser and that McClelland was not seriously injured. The judge said there was no evidence to support claims about any psychological trauma."
2018-01-04,"It always looked premature to assume, as some commentators did, that the festive season on the high street was all right simply because Next's Christmas trading was not as bad as feared.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105053654/https://news.sky.com/story/debenhams-is-largely-to-blame-for-its-christmas-trading-woes-11195140,"So it has transpired. Rumours have been swirling in the City for weeks that Debenhams is struggling - ""the share price at 32p tells you something's wrong"", one rival retailer told me just before Christmas - and sure enough, the UK's second-biggest department store chain has issued a profits warning. And an absolute lulu of a profits warning it is too. Debenhams is now guiding the market to expect profits during the current financial year of between £55m-65m. That compares with previous guidance of £83m and an out-turn of £95m last year, and reflects the extent to which the retailer had to cut prices in order to remain competitive. :: How the major retailers have fared over Xmas Shoppers did come out during the final few weeks before Christmas, with most of the damage done during the start of the 17-week period to 30 December on which the company reported today, but ominously trading then fell away in the immediate post-Christmas sales period despite more markdowns. Those markdowns have eaten into profit margins. The question is how much of this reflects general weakness on the high street due to weakening consumer spending and how much of it reflects problems specific to Debenhams. The surprising update from Next, along with indications that John Lewis did well over Christmas, suggests it is the latter - although Debenhams was at pains to point out that comparisons with Next are wide of the mark as the latter derives a far greater proportion of its sales from clothing. The truth is that Debenhams has structural issues that are inhibiting its ability to trade its way through the current tough retail climate. It has too many stores and was not as fast into digital as some of its competitors. Recognising that, the company hired Sergio Bucher, the former head of Amazon's European fashion business, as its new chief executive just over a year ago. He has already unveiled his strategy for turning around the business but clearly this is going to be a long job. However, progress seems to be being made in digital, where sales during the period were up by just under 10%. Mr Bucher has also pointed out that Debenhams grew sales in both beauty products and food, two areas he has targeted as crucial to the future growth of the business. One specific problem for Debenhams during the pre-Christmas trading period appears to be that competition was particularly intense in gifts where, Mr Bucher has admitted, the retailer's ranges were not sufficiently distinctive or sufficiently premium. This may have been something beyond his control as, given the lead times involved, he and his colleagues may well have been trying to shift lines that were ordered and bought under the previous managerial regime. Financially speaking, Debenhams has high 'operational gearing', which means that it has a very high fixed cost base. This means that a slight rise or fall in sales can translate into a big rise or fall in profits. Accordingly, the drop in profit margins that Debenhams has reported - some 1.5 percentage points - has been enough to wipe out a fifth of this year's expected profits. It means Mr Bucher is likely to have to accelerate his turnaround plans. Contrary to some reports, all of the stores in the Debenhams estate are profitable, although some are more profitable than others. That may mean, depending on the leases of individual outlets - the retailer owns few of its own sites - some stores may close, although Mr Bucher's solution to date has largely involved allowing other operators to take space in sites where he has felt Debenhams has too much. After the sharp share price reaction some will speculate that Debenham, whose stock market value is now down to just £440m, may now be a takeover target. This seems somewhat unlikely given the challenges facing the business and its relative lack of assets. Any would-be buyer is likely to sit back and wait to see how Mr Bucher's turnaround progresses during coming months."

The timing of a float has yet to be decided, and will partly depend on the company's performance in the important post-Christmas trading period, according to City sources. Entertainment Magpie is backed by NVM Private Equity‎, an investment firm which has helped to fund the company's pledge to pay consumers for items on the same day that they are received by its warehouse. The MusicMagpie website initially focused on items such as DVDs but has shifted more broadly into items including mobile phones, tablets and laptop computers. The company‎'s most recent set of accounts filed at Companies House, which cover the eight months ended 31 May 2016, suggested it was on course to become the UK's biggest consumer electronics recycler within a year. ""Management believes that the strength of the business's multi-sales channel approach, together with its operational and logistics strength, ongoing technology development, unique customer proposition, efficient marketing practices, and excellent customer service practices will cement the ambitions of the group to be known as 'The Recommerce Company',"" the accounts said. During the period, it made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £2.275m on turnover of £52.6m. According to a list published by Entertainment Magpie to coincide with a post-Christmas rush to cash in on unwanted festive gifts, many households could earn hundreds of pounds by trading books, games and handheld electronic devices. The company has expanded to the US, where it trades as Decluttr, and it has forged important relationships with sales channels such as Amazon and eBay. It was previously chaired by Allan Leighton, the businessman whose CV includes stints at the Co-op Group, Royal Mail and Asda. A spokeswoman for NVM declined to comment on its float plans for Entertainment Magpie. If it does go public, it could join companies such as Chargemaster, the electric vehicle-charging group, and Funding Circle, the peer-to-peer lender, as debutants on the London Stock Exchange."

Next, the first listed company to announce its progress, reported on Wednesday a 1.5% rise in full-price sales over the festive season. It had forecast a fall of 0.3% because of financial pressures facing shoppers. :: Debenhams Share gains were reversed on Thursday when Debenhams released an unscheduled profit warning. The department store chain said comparable sales in the UK were down on December the previous year and admitted it had discounted heavily to compete - hurting its bottom line. Its shares lost almost a quarter of their value in early deals. :: Poundland There is a crisis at the discount retailer's parent company, Steinhoff, as it battles accounting irregularities - with Poundland forced to deny it was having supply issues as a result. The early evidence would support that assertion as the retailer said it enjoyed the best festive season in its 27-year history, with like-for-like sales up 6% over the three weeks to Christmas Day despite some wintry weather disruption. :: Aldi The UK's fifth-largest supermarket chain said it also had a record Christmas - with annual sales topping £10bn for the first time. It credited sales of its ""specially selected"" premium range of food for driving 15% growth in December. :: Jigsaw The premium fashion retailer refused to participate in the frenzy of Black Friday discounting - holding back on major promotions despite a ""challenging"" market. It said sales for the five weeks to 31 December were 7% up on last year."

He was jailed indefinitely in 2009. Police later linked Worboys, a former stripper who appeared in adult films, to more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults after more alleged victims came forward. In a statement, the Parole Board said: ""We can confirm that a three-member panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of Mr John Worboys, following an oral hearing. ""The arrangements for Mr Worboys' release will be managed by the Ministry of Justice."" When he was sentenced, Warboys was told he must serve at least eight years in prison and that he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he no longer posed a threat to women. According to a government website, an indeterminate sentence can be given if a court feels the offender is a danger to the public. The serial offender, now 60 years old, was found guilty of assaulting 12 women during an 18-month period in the capital. Many of the women who were targeted by Worboys during his reign of terror had been drinking in trendy West End and Chelsea bars. He would offer them champagne spiked with powerful sedatives to celebrate a made-up lottery win, which he would attempt to prove by showing his victims a carrier bag stuffed with cash. The cab driver would then pounce on his victims in the back of his vehicle as they were left insensible and unable to protect themselves. One of his victims, whose identity is protected, told Sky News: ""I feel shaken up and very upset at the decision."" And the chief executive of Rape Crisis South London has criticised the decision to release Worboys, saying his victims would ""never be totally free from his despicable actions"". Yvonne Traynor added: ""It feels far too soon for this dangerous and manipulative perpetrator to be released into the public having served this woefully short time in prison."""
2018-01-04,"Increases in minimum wage levels risk raising the pace of mechanisation in the workplace, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105053654/https://news.sky.com/story/ifs-living-wage-increases-are-automation-threat-to-jobs-11194890,"A report for the economic think tank urges ""extremely careful"" monitoring of wage rates over the coming years as statutory pay goes up and employers look to cut costs. The National Living Wage, which applies to workers aged 25 and over, is set to rise to £7.83 per hour from April from a current rate of £7.50. Current ambitions will see it hit 60% of median wages in 2020 - around £8.56 if forecasts prove accurate. The IFS said those set to be brought within the minimum wage net in 2020 are more than twice as likely to be in the 10% most ""routine"" occupations as those who were directly affected by the minimum wage in 2015. It said that leaves roles such as retail cashiers and receptionists at the mercy of potential automation. However, the report admitted the future was ""uncertain"" and that the loss of some jobs to automation could open other opportunities. The report was released after a separate study in the summer warned that 15 million UK jobs ""could disappear due to technological disruption"". IFS research economist Agnes Norris Keiller, who wrote the study, said: ""The fact that there seemed to be a negligible employment impact of a minimum at £6.70 per hour - the 2015 rate - does not mean that the same will be true of the rate of over £8.50 per hour that is set to apply in 2020. ""Beyond some point, a higher minimum must start affecting employment, and we do not know where that point is."" She added: ""Meanwhile even higher rates, as proposed for example by the Labour Party, would bring even more employees in more automatable jobs into the minimum wage net."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: ""Technological change, if harnessed effectively, could bring about immense benefits - transforming jobs and workplaces and driving up productivity and living standards. ""All workers should be paid a full and fair wage, which is why Labour has pledged to introduce a Real Living Wage of at least £10 an hour by 2020, as well as support for smaller businesses to pay it. ""Labour will invest in our country's future, new technologies, our businesses, our infrastructure and people. Higher wages, good jobs, greater investment in skills and technology to boost productivity and high employment all goestogether. They are complements, not trade-offs."" A Government spokesman responded: ""The National Living Wage is creating a stronger economy and a fairer society, having delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years. ""But we also want to create highly-skilled, well-paid jobs for the future, backing innovation and supporting the development of new skills through our Industrial Strategy. ""That's why the Government is working with industry to ensure the benefits of new technologies are felt across different sectors and regions."""

Mr Trump has repeatedly described Mr Kim as ""Little Rocket Man"" and Mr Kim has called Mr Trump a ""dotard"", among many insults traded between the two. They have also both threatened to destroy the other, causing growing alarm worldwide."

Mr Bannon has been under fire after excerpts of the book were made public on Wednesday. One of the revelations was that Mr Bannon said a meeting between Mr Trump's son, Don Jr, and a group of Russians was ""unpatriotic"" and ""treasonous"". He also questioned Mr Trump's fitness for office. The President hit back on Wednesday, claiming his former close confidant had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House role last year, and on Thursday Mr Trump noted Mr Bannon spoke positively about him on his Breitbart radio show.

First Lady Melania Trump's office called the book something which would be found in the ""bargain fiction"" bin. The book also claims that Mr Trump never expected to win the 2016 presidential race, but believed his nomination would boost his brand and deliver ""untold opportunities"". Mr Bannon, viewed by many as the architect of Mr Trump's campaign, left the White House in August after a string of disagreements with the President and his allies. The strategist had contradicted Mr Trump's policy on North Korea in a media interview, had taken attention away from the President. He was viewed by some as a symbol of the far right who could be bad for the former magnate's image."
2018-01-04,"It is often called Scotland's favourite beverage, with a distinctive caramel colour and heady taste derived from a 106-year-old recipe.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105053654/https://news.sky.com/story/fans-stockpile-irn-bru-before-recipe-change-sees-sugar-content-halved-11195586,"So it comes as no surprise that attempts to meddle with the ingredients of Irn-Bru have prompted outrage. More than 9,000 people have signed a ""Hands off our Irn-Bru"" petition objecting to an imminent reduction to its sugar content, and consumers are reportedly stockpiling the original version of the fizzy drink. Historically Irn-Bru has contained a tooth-tingling 10% of sugar, but manufacturers plan to halve that - replacing it with artificial sweeteners such as aspartame from January. The decision, linked to a government tax on sugar to be introduced in April and a consumer shift towards products low in sugar, will drop the number of calories in a can from 140 to 65. It follows similar moves in the recipes of other drinks including Lucozade. But Ryan Allen, who started the petition, does not believe less is more. His Change.org page voices fears over the impact of aspartame and argues he would pay more for Scotland's high-sugar ""national treasure"". ""I believe that a responsible adult should have the choice as to what poisons they want to put in their body,"" he says. ""It's also well known to alleviate the effects of a hangover and is many a person's craving, saviour or go-to drink after a night on the tiles. I think to deny people in that condition their crutch would be a crime."" His sentiments were reflected on Twitter - with one fan declaring ""this can git tae France"" and dozens more pledging to stockpile the sugary version. Can't believe Irn Bru are changing the recipe, are you mad? I'm going costco and stocking up. Half the sugar? nope not for me. Consultant dietitian Rebecca McManamon, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said reducing sugar content could help slash the incidence of diabetes, obesity and tooth decay. She told Sky News that high-sugar drinks would only be recommended for people with diabetes who need a sugar boost. ""There is no benefit if you're feeling run down to have a sugary drink,"" she said. ""Even if you get a temporary reprieve, you're going to have a drop in energy afterwards."" Aspartame, she said, would likely only pose a danger if many litres of Irn-Bru were being consumed. Irn-Bru's manufacturer, AG Barr, has insisted that nine in ten people could not tell the difference between high and low-sugar versions. ""The vast majority of our drinkers want to consume less sugar so that's what we're now offering,"" a spokesperson said."

I was on arena duties with an officer I was training. Just after 10.30pm we heard a huge bang. I knew it was an explosion. Time stopped that night. People were running out of the arena. The automatic alarm was going off. There were that many people coming out I was struggling to get up the stairs. I was like a salmon swimming against the tide. I arrived in less than a minute. It was about 40 seconds after the explosion went off that I was helping the first lady. People were telling me that people needed help in the car park. I went over and there were injured people with shrapnel injuries and leg injuries. Bystanders were coming up to me and asked if there was anything they could do to help. They got me the first aid kits I needed. I was even given two nappies which were priceless. I helped nine people with lots of different injuries. There were lower leg wounds. One man had a knee injury. His wife had an injury to her Achilles heel. There was a little girl about eight years old who needed treatment. The night went on and on. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack Most of the people I treated were very calm. I'd like to think I gave them the assurance they needed in a really dire time. On the night it was just what needed to be done. People needed help. With me being ex-military and joining the police, it was just something that I knew I needed to. I did the best I could. Since then I've learnt to cope in my own way. My girlfriend Kat has been a huge help. We go out for walks which has helped clear my head. A lot of my friends who are still in the military have also been there to talk to if needed. Friday's ceremony is closure for me. It's nice to be appreciated for what BTP did on the night. We still get people coming up to us thanking us for what we did. They really do appreciate what we do when we put the uniform on. Far from putting me off the job, it's made me more proud of what I do for the force. I'm always proud when I put my uniform on and always will be."
2018-01-04,A London doctor tells Sky News what it is like to work in an overstretched NHS hospital where he says medics are desperately trying to treat hundreds of patients with not enough space to do so.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105053654/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-frontline-doctor-reveals-reality-of-overstretched-hospitals-11194127,"Working as a senior doctor in an A&E department this winter means one very simple thing: providing care to more people than we have the resources or capacity to treat. It does not require a brain surgeon to work out that we cannot look after you on a trolley in a corridor as well as we could in a specifically designed patient area. Corridors don't have the correct equipment and they certainly don't come with the appropriately trained staff, but corridors are where patients are parked while they wait for beds in the hospital and the emergency room continues to fill. The numbers will increase as the winter crisis deepens. The cuts to beds, funding and social care, as well as problems recruiting healthcare professionals to staff A&E make this inevitable. :: Hospitals told to cancel all non-urgent operations after hectic festive period Our only option is to make do and hope. Hope that in a few days some bed space in the hospital will become available to move you to. Hope that some patients will be able to get the care they need in the community so that they can be at home. Hope that, in a few months time, the pressure may ease a little so that we can give patients the attention, the dignity and care that they need. Hope that Government funding may start to match the resources we need to care for patients' safely. Make no mistake, we are appalled by the level of care we can provide. Our attention, our decision making, our compassion and our energy all have limits and working consistently beyond capacity means mistakes can be made and the care we provide for our patients suffers. The end of each of my shifts is greeted with relief that it is over; my off-duty is then spent worrying about whether my decisions were correct, whether I missed an infection, a heart attack or a cancer. No doctor wants to work like this. No patient should have to experience it. That there are more patients who are older, sicker and more complex is completely predictable. A few million 70 year olds were not suddenly born in 2015. When politicians tell you that ""demand"" is too high or that ""too many patients"" are presenting to emergency departments, doctors roll their eyes, exasperated at the ministerial hogwash trotted out to excuse the fact that those in charge are failing the healthcare of this country. The crisis we are facing in our departments could have been prevented if the Government had provided the appropriate resources and planned for it. This is incredibly frustrating for those of us who work on the front line of the NHS. We cannot do more with less. We simply cannot. My patients are angry. I want to tell them that so am I. So are all healthcare workers. There is no health minister standing in our waiting room apologising for the seven-hour wait. The corridors of Westminster are not stacked with trolleys of patients waiting for a bed. And so it is left to doctors like me to assess, care for and treat patients as best we can, alongside apologising for the failings of the health service. Failings that we have no control over. And so as well as providing care, I now feel that it is also my job to speak out. To stand with our patients to demand better. It is a matter of life and death."

They also have the same syrupy fondant yolk centre as Creme Eggs but with a white chocolate shell. Cadbury's has made only 350 to 400 of the limited edition chocolates so anybody searching for one will have to be as lucky as Charlie Bucket. As an added bonus, any sweet-toothed buyer could win up to £2,000, with every 85p egg worth at least £100. The ultimate prize egg is on sale at a Co-op supermarket while 33 others worth £1,000 are hidden in newsagents and corner shops as well as Sainsbury's Local, Tesco Express and Co-op branches. Anybody scrambling for a white chocolate egg must do so before 1 April when they will be taken off the shelves after appearing on New Year's Day.

Thousands of people are expected to descend on the Berkshire town when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle marry in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 19 May. Mr Dudley, leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead unitary authority, wrote on Twitter that some rough sleepers had made a ""commercial life choice praying on residents and tourists"". And in a letter to Thames Valley Police he complained about ""aggressive begging and intimidation"" as well as ""bags and detritus"" on the streets. Mrs May who, as a Tory MP, represents the Maidenhead constituency, said: ""I think it is important that councils work hard to ensure that they are providing accommodation for those people who are homeless. ""And where there are issues of people who are aggressively begging on the streets then it's important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive begging."" Council leader Mr Dudley claimed on Twitter over Christmas that there was ""an epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy"" in Windsor and called on police to ""focus on dealing with this before the #RoyalWedding"". But his stance has provoked outrage, with a local homeless charity describing Mr Dudley's remarks as ""sickening"". Murphy James from the Windsor Homeless Project, said: ""It's absolutely abhorrent that anybody has got these views in this day and age, especially a lead councillor of the borough. ""If somebody is sleeping out on the street, they are not there by choice, they are there because something has gone wrong."" Mr James said it was ""sickening"" that the councillor had cited the royal wedding to back up his comments. The police responded to Mr Dudley's tweets by saying: ""We need to protect the most vulnerable in society by working together but each agency must understand its own unique responsibilities. ""Housing is the responsibility of the council but it is better that agencies work together so people don't become homeless. ""We deal with reports of begging proportionately but we have not had reports of anyone being marched to cashpoints to take out money."" As well as his public calls for action on Twitter, Mr Dudley wrote to Anthony Stansfeld, Police and Crime Commissioner for Thames Valley Police on Tuesday. In the letter, he said officers should use powers under the 1824 Vagrancy Act and the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 to ""protect residents and tourists"". Mr Stansfeld said he was ""somewhat surprised"" the letter had been made public before it had been sent directly to him. ""I myself attended a Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council in October and these issues were not raised,"" he said. ""I will of course provide Cllr Dudley with a full response addressing his concerns once I have received the letter and investigated further the issues he has raised."" He added: ""Protecting the public is of the utmost importance to both myself and Thames Valley Police and the force work day in and day out to keep people safe from harm and make the Thames Valley a safe place to live, work and visit."""

Officers pursued Dempsey, catching up with him on the M271, but he failed to stop, and did everything he could to evade capture. Footage from police car dashcams and the National Police Air Service shows that he even tried to drive the wrong way down the M3. The 13-minute chase came to a sudden end in the village of Chilworth, near Southampton after one officer decided he would crash into Dempsey's car. No one was hurt in the smash. In court, Dempsey, from Eastbourne, admitted dangerous driving, escaping lawful custody, driving while disqualified and criminal damage. He was sentenced to two years in prison in total, made up of 16 months for dangerous driving, six months for escaping custody, and two months for criminal damage. The sentences will run consecutively. Dempsey is disqualified from driving for more than five years and will have to take an extended test to get back on the roads. Chief Inspector Mark Lewis, from the Joint Roads Policing Unit, said: “Thanks to the bravery and courage of our highly-trained officers this pursuit ended without injury and with the man responsible detained. “If Dempsey had not been stopped at that point, he would have got onto the M3, driving the wrong way, which would have been potentially fatal for him and any other innocent road users. “Our roads policing officers are specially trained to carry out a range of different tactics, such as the one used in this incident, in order to stop those posing a danger to others. “I am proud of the actions our officers took that day, putting themselves in harm’s way for the protection of others.”"

The money raised from those who refused would be used to increase the number of recycling plants able to handle plastic-lined take-away cups. Mary Creagh MP, the committee chairperson, told Sky News: ""We have seen, with the plastic bag charge, an 83% reduction in use. ""We think a latte levy will be the kind of charge that will make people think 'I need to bring my cup to work today', in the same way that they are moving more and more to reusable plastic bottles."" At least 2.5 billion disposable cups are thrown away every year. But just four recycling companies in the UK can separate the plastic film lining the inside of the paper cup. As a result just six million - 0.25% - are recycled. The MPs say that all of these cups should be recycled by 2023 - or the Government should step in and ban them. Edwin Harrison, owner of the independent Artisan coffee shop in West London, fears many of his customers would stay away if a charge was brought in. He said he had tried, but failed, to source easily recyclable cups. ""It's out of our hands,"" he said. ""With all the will in the world we can't make that change and we wish we could. ""I am an expert in making fantastic coffee, but they (the cup manufacturers) are the ones with the knowledge and resources to be able to change."" Some coffee shops give customers discounts for bringing their own refillable cups. But just 1 to 2% of customers do this. Research by psychologists suggests charging customers 25p for a disposable cup would have a greater impact, reducing the number sold by up to 30%. Chef and environmental campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall said: ""The committee has recognised that the huge mountain of disposable coffee cups is effectively unrecyclable, and is overwhelming and disrupting the nation's waste disposal systems, ultimately polluting our rivers and seas, and needs urgent action. ""But in the end, finding that solution needs to be a matter for law, not just financial incentive. Legislation needs to set a date after which the continued production of unrecyclable coffee cups is banned by law."" A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the committee's recommendations would be carefully considered. But they added: ""We are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups, with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups."" :: Sky has been running a campaign to make people more aware of the effect plastic has on the world's oceans and to share ways of tackling the problem.

2018-01-04,Theresa May has apologised for delays to thousands of NHS operations and hospital admissions caused by the winter crisis.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105053654/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-apologises-for-nhs-winter-crisis-11195334,"It comes after official figures revealed 16,893 patients waited more than 30 minutes on ambulances at accident and emergency departments in England during the week up to New Year's Eve - up 42% from 11,900 in the previous week. The Prime Minister said she recognised the situation was ""difficult"", ""frustrating"" and ""disappointing"". :: Why is there always a winter crisis in the NHS? She said: ""I recognise that it is difficult for people who are facing delays. I recognise that it is difficult if someone is delayed on their admission to hospital, or if somebody has an operation postponed. ""We will hope to ensure that those operations can be reinstated as soon as possible. ""I know it's difficult, I know it's frustrating, I know it's disappointing for people, and I apologise."" It comes as tens of thousands of planned operations have been postponed as the NHS deals with the most urgent cases. Figures published by NHS England showed the bed occupancy rate in hospitals reached 91.7% during the festive period - 85% is considered safe. Twelve hospital trusts reported 100% bed occupancy rates on New Year's Eve. Increased pressures on front-line services were mirrored in the NHS 111 service, which received a record 480,400 calls - up 21% from 396,300 in the previous week. Chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Janet Davies said the figures showed ""that almost every day last week, NHS hospitals in England were at bursting point"". She said: ""Lack of beds for new patients is a major factor contributing to the current severe pressure on the NHS, but it's impossible for trusts to open extra beds without more nurses to staff them. ""The RCN has been warning of under-investment in nursing posts for several years - now that underlying problem has developed into a full-blown crisis. ""There needs to be a fundamental review of the sort of health and social care we want in this country."" :: NHS doctor: We are appalled by our own care Mrs May spent an hour-and-a-half speaking to staff and patients at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, which had 99.8% occupancy on New Year's Eve. She maintained the NHS was ""better prepared for this winter than ever before"" and thanked staff who worked over the season ""for everything you've done"". However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May's response to the crisis was ""not good enough"". He tweeted: ""It is not good enough for @Theresa_May to say NHS problems are ""frustrating"" and ""disappointing"" when the Tory Government has caused this crisis. ""Nurses, doctors and patients are pleading with her to properly fund our health service, but she is ignoring them."" Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told Sky News the Government had been ""utterly complacent' with its handling of the crisis and that ""eight years of severe under-funding"" for the NHS had contributed to it. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to patients for the wave of cancellations, saying it was ""absolutely not what I want"". He hit back at criticism of the Government's handling of the winter crisis from former prime minister Tony Blair, who claimed ministers' focus was on Brexit. Mr Hunt tweeted: ""Tony Blair's memory is as selective in office as out of office: does he not remember his own regular NHS winter crises?

Is it all downhill from here? Is this it for Britain's greatest ball sports competitor of the last decade? Even he doesn't know the answer, and the doubts will be killing him inside, as the pain from his damaged hip grinds him to a standstill on the outside. His poignant statement announcing his withdrawal from the Brisbane International tournament this week laid bare how much his sport means to him. ""The little kid inside me just wants to play tennis and compete. I genuinely miss it so much and I would give anything to be back out there,"" he wrote. From there it was a matter of time before the inevitable confirmation that he would miss the year's first grand slam, the Australian Open, the tournament in which he's been runner-up an agonising five times, and the event on which all his rehabilitation work has been focused these past six months. The championship will also be missing former world number four Kei Nishikori when it starts on 15 January. Doubts still hang over the participation of Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, as the intensely physical demands of modern tennis take their toll. Even the phenomenal Roger Federer has prospered only through a drastic pruning of his schedule. Murray last competed at Wimbledon in July. Walking close behind him there, it was almost painful to watch him limp along. He opted then for rest and rehab, rather than surgery. Now, he says: ""I'll be flying home shortly to assess all the options"". That includes the knife, but the Scot adds: ""The chances of a successful outcome are not as I high as I would like, which has made this my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that."" Another former Wimbledon champion, Lleyton Hewitt, offers some optimism. He had surgery on both hips and returned to win tournaments, but not at grand slam level. Murray has talked about settling, if necessary, for being able to compete at the standard of a top-30 player. Some change, that, for the ultra-competitive reigning Olympic champion and three-times grand slam winner. If he means it, we may yet see him grace the tennis courts of the world beyond his 31st birthday in May. But Wimbledon finals, Olympic glory, that status as best in the world? It feels an improbably long way back."

And it's not just the media - there's been a parallel spike in A&E attendances lasting more than four hours pic.twitter.com/WAEzkBxGvx Why? Well, analysis from the health think tank the King's Fund highlights two key factors. Firstly, people are using NHS services more. That's partly due to a growing and ageing population, though that doesn't explain all of it - people are also simply using services more than they used to. Secondly, NHS funding is no longer keeping pace with the rising demand. In the years where the ""Winter NHS Crisis"" slipped off the agenda, funding for the Department of Health increased roughly in line with increases in hospital admissions. In the years since - and in particular over the last couple of years, where the increase in NHS service users has been particularly acute - it simply has not. Prior to 2010, NHS funding rose roughly in line with increasing demand. Since then, it hasn't. pic.twitter.com/R19z24IGBc Estimates from the King's Fund, Health Foundation and Nuffield Trust suggests NHS funding is at least £4bn below what is needed this year - and that's set to rise to at least £20bn by 2022/23. So what's the solution? The choice appears to be between a fundamental change to the way the NHS works, decreasing the range of services provided or having at least some people pay for the cost of their care at the point of use - or a marked increase in funding which will ultimately have to be paid by the taxpayer. Public opinion is very clear on Britons' preference - they say they would be willing to pay more in tax if it goes towards the NHS. A Sky Data poll last year showed some 68% would support a 1% increase in income tax across the board if it was guaranteed to go to the NHS. The risk for politicians is if that support softens when the money comes out of voters' payslips.

It claimed there was clear evidence of shoppers ""switching"" to its offering over the festive season as it continued to pile the pressure on more established rivals such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. :: How the major retailers have fared over Xmas In the first Christmas trading update in the sector, Aldi reported particularly strong demand for its ""specially selected"" premium range. It said mince pies, Aberdeen Angus beef roasting joints and Irish cream liqueur were among the top-selling products. More than 6.8 million bottles of wine, champagne and prosecco were sold during December alone. However, the chain, which has expanded aggressively, gave no breakdown of sales on a like-for-like comparison basis or any hint about profitability as its bigger rivals listed on the stock market are required to do. It did announce a pay rise for its store assistants - saying it would make Aldi the ""highest paying supermarket"". Aldi said it was to roll out a new minimum hourly rate of £8.85 nationally - a rise of 32p - and £10.20 in London from 1 February. The retailer, which has 762 stores in the UK, also reiterated its long-term strategy to have a network of 1,000 by 2022. Chief executive of Aldi in the UK and Ireland, Matthew Barnes, said: ""We see significant capacity for further growth as there are still more than 400 towns and cities across the UK without an Aldi store. ""Shoppers in these areas consistently tell us they would shop at Aldi if they could, and we are committed to meeting this demand for new Aldi stores."" Commenting on the chain's trading update, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, Molly Johnson-Jones, said: ""The announcement of wages continuing to increase will eat into profits. ""Aldi's full- year operating profit fell 17.1% for FY2016, driven by Aldi experiencing the same input inflation pressures that we have seen across the UK food & grocery sector throughout 2016 and 2017. ""Aldi needs to focus on sweating assets through 2018 to improve margins up from the 2.4% that we estimate they currently were for 2016. ""Food inflation is expected to remain above 2.5% throughout 2018, which will continue to drive consumers to switch to the discounters."""
2018-01-04,Scotland Yard is to ask the Government for £38m to help pay for the investigation into the Grenfell Tower fire. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105053654/https://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-scotland-yard-asks-for-38m-to-pay-for-investigation-11195641,"The force says the demands on police time could leave it facing unreasonable costs because of the complexity of the investigation. About 200 Metropolitan Police officers have been working on the criminal probe into the fire which killed 71 people in June 2017. Millions of documents have been seized and months have been spent removing potential evidence from the ruined tower block in west London, which remains a crime scene. Many suspects have been interviewed, and detectives have been investigating potential offences including misconduct in public office, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and breaches of fire safety regulations. The force is asking the Home Office to fully fund the £27m cost of the inquiry in the coming financial year, its head of finance has said. Another £11.1m is also being sought to cover the extra hours put in by detectives so far. A police force can apply for a special grant to help foot the bill of an investigation once it exceeds 1% of their budget under current rules. But because the Met's investigation into the fire is likely to involve many officers for a second year, it has asked the Home Office for more cash. The London Assembly's budget and performance committee was told the department had provided assurances their request was being given ""serious consideration"". Lynda McMullan, the Met Police's director of finance, told the hearing: ""The impact of Grenfell, that has had a very significant impact and we've put in a special grant claim for the current year for £11.1m, in terms of the additionality of cost to do with the incident for the current financial year. ""We have also indicated that we would like - we estimate that we will be spending - close to £27m on that particular investigation. ""We are asking whether or not we can have dispensation, not just simply the 1% referenced, but we also want to claim the full cost of our officer time for that investigation, not just the additionality, the overtime, in effect. ""We don't think it would be reasonable for us to pick up the full costs, as we know that the investigation will go on for some time."" The force has been told by Home Office officials that the matter will be put before ministers to decide whether to sign off on the additional funding, the committee heard. Ms McMullan added: ""We would like to have full costs rather than incremental costs for the next year because of the fact given, after a reduction in the number of officers, it doesn't seem reasonable we would absorb that full cost of those 200 officers. ""We have got assurances it is being given serious consideration."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""Given the unique and tragic circumstances of this event, we will consider any application we receive for funding from the Metropolitan Police as a matter of priority."""

Blizzard warnings are also in place from Virginia to Maine. The extreme weather phenomenon - known as a ""bomb cyclone"" - is caused by a massive drop in pressure bringing with it hurricane force winds. Seventeen deaths have so been blamed on the extreme weather, including two men killed when their pick-up truck overturned in North Carolina and a passenger who was unable to escape a vehicle that crashed through a railroad crossing 20 miles north of Philadelphia. Hurricane force winds have led to power cuts in more than 100,000 homes and businesses across the north east of America. Impromptu shelters and ""warming areas"" have been set up in many areas for those experiencing loss of power and burst water pipes. The North Carolina Highway Patrol responded to 700 collisions and 300 other calls for service during the storm. All flights were suspended from JFK Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York, and the majority of flights were also severely affected in Newark Airport in New Jersey and Boston airport in Massachusetts. Many schools were also closed and the Senate cut short its working week due to the extreme weather.

Unusually low temperatures in the state caused cold-stunned green iguanas to fall from the trees on to the ground.

The storm will become even more ferocious as it roars up the East Coast, heading towards Canada. Sky News US Correspondent Hannah Thomas Peter said: ""Once this storm has passed, there is going to be another problem to deal with, which is a massive drop in temperatures across the north east. ""It is going to be bitterly cold, and that's going to make recovery much harder."" Up to 30cm (12in) of snow is now expected in New York and 46cm (18in) expected to fall in eastern New England."

They make plans, meet new people and make decisions in full public view of their friends. :: Children 'ill-equipped' for social media demands They are all so image conscious. Almost every picture I see posted is either photo shopped or changed in some way. Often kids look much older than they are or pose in ways that are not necessarily appropriate for their age. I am sure this makes lots of children feel insecure about themselves; boys as well as girls. As the mother of three boys aged 14, 11 and six, I find it really scary and I can't say I completely understand it at all. My eldest son has access to more social media than my middle son, who is not allowed on Snapchat or Facebook. My youngest son has no access at all. My social media experience tends to be sharing a few family snaps on Facebook or connecting with people via Linkedin for work. It's a minefield and something I try to manage as best I can without appearing to be a ""smother"" (my sons' phrase to describe an over protective mother). My rules are as follows: I have spoken to all my kids about ""reality versus social media"" and try to make them understand that most people post a glorified representation of reality. There is always more behind every picture and everyone puts their ""best face"" forward. I find the influence that bloggers and YouTubers have on my children a challenge. I try to keep on top of who are they following by watching YouTube videos with my kids. YouTube stars are the new celebrities and though, in my opinion, they are often incredibly dull, I try to show an interest. For me, the most important thing is to keep the conversation open with my kids, which is no mean feat with teenagers. I am sure there is plenty that I don't know about. I hope by discussing the dangers of social media regularly it will ensure that if they had a problem either online or off line they would come to me. Social media cannot be ignored, it is here to stay. Keeping my kids aware of ""online stranger danger"" and social media's influence on their confidence and mental health should hopefully make it a safer place. It's the best I can hope for."
2018-01-05,There has been a sharp rise in UK productivity - long blamed for holding back the country's economic growth.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/productivity-growth-at-six-year-high-ons-11196200,"According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), growth in labour productivity hit a six-year high in the third quarter of last year - rising 0.9% following falls over the first six months. The data showed the fightback was driven by the manufacturing and services sectors, which both recorded increases of 1% compared with the previous three months. The ONS tempered the improvement by saying that productivity growth remains at its lowest levels since the 1820s on a rolling 10-year basis. Nevertheless, the figures will provide some cheer for the Chancellor, who is desperate to restore output levels in the UK as they continue to stubbornly lag the country's main competitors in Europe - particularly France and Germany. Britain ranks fifth out of G7 industrial nations on productivity - the amount of work produced either per worker or per hour worked. The Government has put its Industrial Strategy at the heart of its turnaround efforts - with economic growth slowing amid uncertainty over Brexit. Philip Hammond suffered a blow in the autumn Budget when the Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded its growth forecasts for the next five years because of historic weak productivity. But Howard Archer, EY ITEM Club's chief economic adviser, said there were indications 2017's statistics could end on an unexpected high. He said: ""The marked third-quarter rebound suggests that some of the first-half 2017 weakness in productivity may have been cyclical. ""Businesses may have been keen to employ given concerns over potential labour shortages and also given the low cost of labour (particularly relative to capital)."" Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said it was too soon to start celebrating as ""giant leaps"" were needed. ""The UK's productivity remains well below pre-crash levels and with Brexit around the corner, unless a more concerted effort is made to improve productivity, we won't be in a strong enough position to compete once we leave the EU."""
2018-01-05,The decision to release black cab rapist John Worboys after he served his minimum eight-year term has sparked concern among victims and police.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/how-the-parole-board-decided-to-release-black-cab-rapist-john-worboys-11196219,"Worboys' release was decided by a Parole Board panel, after it heard evidence at an oral hearing and was given an number of documents. The driver had been jailed in 2009 on an indeterminate sentence with a minimum term of eight years, which made him eligible for parole at the end of 2017. :: What is the Parole Board? The board in an independent body which assesses the risk of serving prisoners in England and Wales to decide who could be suitable for release into the community or to go into open prison conditions. The board has 204 members and there are an additional 105 members of staff who support them. A typical panel will be made up of three members. :: How do they make decisions about prisoners and parole? Prisoners who are serving four years or more, or life or indeterminate sentences, go before the board when they are up for parole. The board also looks after those who have been jailed before and returned to prison, serving life or indeterminate sentences. At first, one member will assess the case ""at the paper stage"", looking through a dossier provided by the prison sentence and probation staff. This will include information about the prisoner's offending history, their behaviour in prison, any courses they may have completed and, in some cases, a psychological assessment. There may also be victim statements, as well as a statement from the prisoner or their legal representative. In some cases, the paper stage is as far as it goes, and the single board member makes the decision based on what they have read. :: What happens in an oral hearing?  The assessment may go beyond the paper stage and the prisoner will attend an oral hearing, with three members of the Parole Board. Hearings are usually held at the prison where the inmate is held, and other people like the prisoner's legal representative, their offender manager, or other prison-based staff such as psychologists will likely be present. The hearings are usually private. Details of Worboys' hearing have not been disclosed. :: How does the panel decide? The panel will weigh up the documentary evidence from the paper stage and what they hear at the oral meeting and discuss the best course of action. The options available to them include release, recommendation to transfer to open conditions, or no direction to release. They can also defer the decision for a set period of time. Members of the board have to consider the impact and nature of the crime, as well as the prisoner's awareness of the effect on victims, and their behaviour since they have been behind bars when they make their decision. :: Can the Government overrule them?  The board's decisions are binding and there is no legal power for the Government to overrule them. However, the Justice Secretary can step in if there is a recommendation for a prisoner to move from closed to open conditions. In Worboys' case, the Justice Secretary cannot intervene as the board has decided he should go into the community to be managed by the probation service, under strict licence conditions. Parole Board decisions are only usually challenged in court when a prisoner has been denied release. :: Why was Worboys up for a parole hearing?  Worboys was given an indeterminate sentence when he jailed in 2009, under a scheme introduced for public protection in 2005. Indeterminate sentences were abolished in 2012 when European judges ruled they breached human rights. Worboys' sentence had a minimum term of eight years at his sentencing in 2009. Although his has now been assessed, there are still thousands of prisoners who were given the indeterminate sentence who have not been given a hearing and are beyond their minimum term. :: What happens next? The Crown Prosecution Service is under pressure to bring the other allegations against him to court, which emerged after he was sentenced. It is believed there could be as many as 100 further victims of Worboys, and the CPS would have to assess each claim for evidence if it is to bring further charges to court."

It emerged this week that developers have been trying to prevent hackers taking advantage of the flaw in microprocessors built by Intel and ARM. There has been no evidence so far the flaws have been exploited by hackers. However, as developers try to fix the flaws this is causing devices to slow down by up to 50% when performing computer tasks requiring a lot of storage or network usage.

I was on arena duties with an officer I was training. Just after 10.30pm we heard a huge bang. I knew it was an explosion. Time stopped that night. People were running out of the arena. The automatic alarm was going off. There were that many people coming out I was struggling to get up the stairs. I was like a salmon swimming against the tide. I arrived in less than a minute. It was about 40 seconds after the explosion went off that I was helping the first lady. People were telling me that people needed help in the car park. I went over and there were injured people with shrapnel injuries and leg injuries. Bystanders were coming up to me and asked if there was anything they could do to help. They got me the first aid kits I needed. I was even given two nappies which were priceless. I helped nine people with lots of different injuries. There were lower leg wounds. One man had a knee injury. His wife had an injury to her Achilles heel. There was a little girl about eight years old who needed treatment. The night went on and on. :: The victims of the Manchester terror attack Most of the people I treated were very calm. I'd like to think I gave them the assurance they needed in a really dire time. On the night it was just what needed to be done. People needed help. With me being ex-military and joining the police, it was just something that I knew I needed to. I did the best I could. Since then I've learnt to cope in my own way. My girlfriend Kat has been a huge help. We go out for walks which has helped clear my head. A lot of my friends who are still in the military have also been there to talk to if needed. Friday's ceremony is closure for me. It's nice to be appreciated for what BTP did on the night. We still get people coming up to us thanking us for what we did. They really do appreciate what we do when we put the uniform on. Far from putting me off the job, it's made me more proud of what I do for the force. I'm always proud when I put my uniform on and always will be."
2018-01-05,A London doctor tells Sky News what it is like to work in an overstretched NHS hospital where he says medics are desperately trying to treat hundreds of patients with not enough space to do so.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-frontline-doctor-reveals-reality-of-overstretched-hospitals-11194127,"Working as a senior doctor in an A&E department this winter means one very simple thing: providing care to more people than we have the resources or capacity to treat. It does not require a brain surgeon to work out that we cannot look after you on a trolley in a corridor as well as we could in a specifically designed patient area. Corridors don't have the correct equipment and they certainly don't come with the appropriately trained staff, but corridors are where patients are parked while they wait for beds in the hospital and the emergency room continues to fill. The numbers will increase as the winter crisis deepens. The cuts to beds, funding and social care, as well as problems recruiting healthcare professionals to staff A&E make this inevitable. :: Hospitals told to cancel all non-urgent operations after hectic festive period Our only option is to make do and hope. Hope that in a few days some bed space in the hospital will become available to move you to. Hope that some patients will be able to get the care they need in the community so that they can be at home. Hope that, in a few months time, the pressure may ease a little so that we can give patients the attention, the dignity and care that they need. Hope that Government funding may start to match the resources we need to care for patients' safely. Make no mistake, we are appalled by the level of care we can provide. Our attention, our decision making, our compassion and our energy all have limits and working consistently beyond capacity means mistakes can be made and the care we provide for our patients suffers. The end of each of my shifts is greeted with relief that it is over; my off-duty is then spent worrying about whether my decisions were correct, whether I missed an infection, a heart attack or a cancer. No doctor wants to work like this. No patient should have to experience it. That there are more patients who are older, sicker and more complex is completely predictable. A few million 70 year olds were not suddenly born in 2015. When politicians tell you that ""demand"" is too high or that ""too many patients"" are presenting to emergency departments, doctors roll their eyes, exasperated at the ministerial hogwash trotted out to excuse the fact that those in charge are failing the healthcare of this country. The crisis we are facing in our departments could have been prevented if the Government had provided the appropriate resources and planned for it. This is incredibly frustrating for those of us who work on the front line of the NHS. We cannot do more with less. We simply cannot. My patients are angry. I want to tell them that so am I. So are all healthcare workers. There is no health minister standing in our waiting room apologising for the seven-hour wait. The corridors of Westminster are not stacked with trolleys of patients waiting for a bed. And so it is left to doctors like me to assess, care for and treat patients as best we can, alongside apologising for the failings of the health service. Failings that we have no control over. And so as well as providing care, I now feel that it is also my job to speak out. To stand with our patients to demand better. It is a matter of life and death."

The 61-year-old man was jailed for five weeks, and has since been diagnosed with prostate cancer. According to campaign group Detained in Dubai, customs officers thought he had ""too many pills"" and did not accept his reason of needing enough for a six-month journey. The British-based human rights organisation explained Mr Coppins suffers from anxiety and for 21 years has been taking prescribed Temazepam, Clonazepam and Citalopram, which he cannot ""function without"". The group says the maritime security officer had been denied his medication in jail, and is suffering with hallucinations, weight loss, and bouts of blindness. It is claimed the UAE is denying him cancer treatment and he will need life-saving surgery. He has two daughters, Pia, 24, Mia, 10 and a 21-year-old son, Cameron. Pia said: ""Nobody should be treated like this. He is not a young man and he needs medical help to cope with his anxiety. ""Not being allowed his cancer treatment is like giving him a death sentence. Does human life mean nothing to those people?"" Mr Coppins, from Nottingham, has lost his job and his passport has been taken from him. His next court hearing is 15 January. His children fear his savings will soon run out, and he has nowhere to stay while he awaits trial. Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, which is representing Mr Coppins, said: ""UAE laws on medicines are often vague and frontline law enforcement officials are frequently unaware of exactly what the rules permit or prohibit, so they make uneducated, arbitrary judgement calls. ""Perry needs urgent treatment for his prostate cancer. To deny him this in a timely fashion is an absolute violation of his human rights. ""We hope that the UAE will show compassion to Perry and his children and release him immediately, so that he can return home for the medical treatment he needs."" It comes after a second man, Connor Clements, was jailed for two years when he was found to have traces of marijuana in his system, despite it being taken legally in the UK. The British man spent Christmas in jail and has to wait until February for an appeal. He has a medical form explaining he was using CBD oil for anxiety."

Nicky Morgan, who backed Remain in the EU referendum and chairs the influential Treasury select committee, asked Mr Hammond to ""explicitly rule out"" a customs union deal with Brussels. But he only pointed out that Britain will leave the current customs union, adding Britain would ""need to seek a new customs arrangement"". The reply will spark questions over whether a deal will be struck that limits the UK's ability to trade with other countries outside the EU. Publishing the letter, Ms Morgan said: ""It was widely thought that being in a long-term customs union with the EU had been ruled out by the Government. But the Chancellor's letter confirms that this is not the case. ""It is vital that the Cabinet reach agreement on these central questions about the UK's future relationship with the EU, as a matter of urgency."" Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable added it gave ""some reassurance that the Chancellor does understand the economic advantages of being part of a customs union with the EU"". But one Tory MP told Sky News the move by Ms Morgan was ""remoaner c**p"" and added: ""The Prime Minister beats the Chancellor in political top trumps."" Negotiations are currently under way over the UK's access to the EU's customs union - the current trade agreement that imposes no internal tariffs in exchange for a commonly-agreed external one. Brussels wants Britain to remain a member for the two-year transition, but Theresa May has promised Brexit will happen in March 2019."
2018-01-05,A vicar is hoping to change a tradition of the bride being late for her wedding with a £100 fine.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/vicar-in-kent-fines-brides-100-if-late-to-own-wedding-11196040,"Reverend John Corbyn, of the Holy Cross Church in Bearstead, said couples who are on time will get their £100 deposit back along with their wedding certificate at the end of the ceremony. But those who are 20 minutes late will lose their money, and it will be distributed to the staff who were kept waiting for the happy couple to begin the service. There will be no fine if the delay was unavoidable - so those who get stuck in traffic need not fear. Rev Corbyn explained he came up with the idea after visiting a church in Uganda where services were performed back-to-back, with couples getting an incentive to arrive on time. He said he wanted to show he was taking his staff and their time seriously, as many were not doing it for the money. He told The Times: ""I came back to find that in my absence two weddings had been very late, by up to 25 minutes, with no explanation or apology. My team was feeling a bit ill-used. ""It has had the desired effect. In 2017 everyone started within 10 minutes [of their designated time]."" It also applies at St Mary the Virgin in Thurnham, where he is also a reverend. Rev Corbyn explained that of the dozen ceremonies a year, no more than one couple had their deposit taken. Clara Hubbard, who got married at the church last September, told The Daily Telegraph: ""I was totally okay with the 'fine'.

2018-01-05,"The number of new cars sold in the UK fell for the first time since 2011 in the last year, hurting the battle to combat carbon dioxide emissions.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/diesel-drop-off-drives-biggest-annual-drop-in-car-sales-since-2009-11195903,"The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said its figures suggested a ""backlash"" against diesel cars had resulted in an own goal for the environment. It reported a drop of 5.7% in new car sales during 2017 - the biggest fall since 2009. It said 2.54 million new cars were registered in 2017 compared with 2.69 million the previous year - with diesel sales providing the main drag. Demand for diesels fell by 31% last month and 17% over the year, the SMMT said, arguing it had dented progress in cutting tailpipe CO2 emissions. Its figures measured the first annual increase since 1997. :: Biggest drop in cars produced for UK since 2011 It blamed a change in attitudes against cleaner diesel technology. It did not provide figures for NOx, or nitrogen oxide, gases that are produced by diesel engines. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said 2017 sales had proved ""very, very volatile"", with ""confusion"" over the fate of diesels combining with Brexit-linked uncertainty to hit consumer and business confidence. He said Government plans to ban the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars from 2040, along with a car tax hike on new diesel models in November's Budget, had damaged demand. New car sales to private motorists were down 6.8%, fleet down 4.5% and business down 7.8%. The SMMT admitted it was not all doom and gloom for the industry as 2017's figures still represented the third best year for new car registrations in the past decade and market share for electric or hybrid vehicles continued to grow strongly. But it said it was expecting a similar fall in volumes in the current year - of between 5-7% - with diesels likely to face further pain. Mr Hawes said: ""Keeping older vehicles on the road will not only mean higher running costs but will hold back progress towards our environmental goals. ""Consumers should be encouraged to buy the right car for their lifestyle and driving needs irrespective of fuel type - whether that be petrol, electric, hybrid or diesel as it could save them money. ""2017 has undoubtedly been a very volatile year and the lacklustre economic growth means that we expect a further weakening in the market for 2018. The upside for consumers, however, is some very, very competitive deals."""

It has emerged that the latest shark carcass was discovered on New Year's Eve in an ice pack near Wellfeet, towards the northern hook of Cape Cod. Rough conditions prevented researchers from recovering the body, Atlantic White Shark Conservancy (AWSC) programme director Michelle Wcisel told the Cape Code Times. :: Deadly bomb cyclone leaves 100,000 without power in US Another frozen shark, measuring 14ft, was found on 29 December in Brewster and had to be thawed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries service before researchers could examine it. The discovery came two days after a pair of male thresher sharks were found stranded on a nearby beach. Authorities believe all four sharks died from cold shock. Thresher sharks, a solitary species which breach like dolphins, are commonly spotted offshore in Cape Cod during the summer. They usually migrate to warmer waters in the south, but the AWSC says some may have got caught in the hook of Cape Cod before being trapped in the peninsula's bay. Scientists believe threshers are impaired when exposed to waters below 44F (6.7C). Cape Cod Bay's water temperature fell to 2.6C on Thursday, according to the NOAA. New England, which includes Massachusetts, experienced a severe cold snap in December which developed into a bomb cyclone this week. Storm Grayson has brought heavy snow and freezing temperatures to eastern parts of the US, including the usually tropical Florida. A bomb cyclone is caused by a storm's central low pressure dropping at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, bringing in hurricane-force winds."

The money raised from those who refused would be used to increase the number of recycling plants able to handle plastic-lined take-away cups. Mary Creagh MP, the committee chairperson, told Sky News: ""We have seen, with the plastic bag charge, an 83% reduction in use. ""We think a latte levy will be the kind of charge that will make people think 'I need to bring my cup to work today', in the same way that they are moving more and more to reusable plastic bottles."" At least 2.5 billion disposable cups are thrown away every year. But just four recycling companies in the UK can separate the plastic film lining the inside of the paper cup. As a result just six million - 0.25% - are recycled. The MPs say that all of these cups should be recycled by 2023 - or the Government should step in and ban them. Edwin Harrison, owner of the independent Artisan coffee shop in West London, fears many of his customers would stay away if a charge was brought in. He said he had tried, but failed, to source easily recyclable cups. ""It's out of our hands,"" he said. ""With all the will in the world we can't make that change and we wish we could. ""I am an expert in making fantastic coffee, but they (the cup manufacturers) are the ones with the knowledge and resources to be able to change."" Some coffee shops give customers discounts for bringing their own refillable cups. But just 1 to 2% of customers do this. Research by psychologists suggests charging customers 25p for a disposable cup would have a greater impact, reducing the number sold by up to 30%. Chef and environmental campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall said: ""The committee has recognised that the huge mountain of disposable coffee cups is effectively unrecyclable, and is overwhelming and disrupting the nation's waste disposal systems, ultimately polluting our rivers and seas, and needs urgent action. ""But in the end, finding that solution needs to be a matter for law, not just financial incentive. Legislation needs to set a date after which the continued production of unrecyclable coffee cups is banned by law."" A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the committee's recommendations would be carefully considered. But they added: ""We are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups, with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups."" :: Sky has been running a campaign to make people more aware of the effect plastic has on the world's oceans and to share ways of tackling the problem.

The 51-year-old grandmother was found dead in his living room, having been hit over the head with a claw hammer and throttled with her dressing gown belt. The pair had broken up and Ms Best was in a new relationship, but had gone to help him with an appointment at the Jamaican embassy. After he killed her, Johnson, 64, fell into the path of a train at Cheshunt station. He survived, but was left wheelchair-bound, and his arms were severed. Ms Best's body was discovered by officers searching his flat as he was treated in hospital. Johnson has previous convictions for manslaughter, relating to the deaths of his wife, and another former girlfriend. During his sentencing, it was revealed that Johnson had kept his relationship with Ms Best a secret from authorities. It was heard the couple broke up after Ms Best discovered letters about the 64-year-old's past and confronted him. :: Triple killer murdered ex-partner with hammer after she started new relationship Mark Heywood, prosecuting, told the court Johnson had a violent history towards women. In November 1981, he was convicted by a jury of killing his wife Yvonne Johnson. He hit her over the head with a vase before pushing her over the balcony of their ninth-floor flat in Wolverhampton. In March 1993, he was convicted of killing his partner Yvonne Bennett, with whom he had a child. He strangled her with a belt after he discovered she had an affair. He was found to be suffering from depression and a personality disorder after her death. He was handed a hospital order with restrictions by the Old Bailey. By mid-1995, he was given unescorted leave to spend two days a week at a City and Guilds course on furniture restoration. He met Ms Best there in 1996, but kept his past secret from her. Johnson was released following a tribunal in October 1997. The tribunal recorded that he was ""well aware of the need for caution"" for any future relationship, though he'd effectively been in one with Ms Best for more than a year. He continued to deny being in a relationship, even up to 8 December, a week before he killed Ms Best. The pair broke up in September 2016, with Ms Best describing herself as the ""happiest"" she had been, having found love with someone else. Johnson continued to message her daily. Mr Heywood described the attack as ""brutal and merciless"". ""(Johnson) struck her repeatedly around the head even as she tried to protect her head with her hands,"" he added. ""He then tied a dressing gown cord around her head and knotted it. ""He did it, the prosecution say, for a simple reason - because after all that time that had gone before she was no longer prepared to stay with him."" A post-mortem examination found Ms Best suffered at least six blows to the head . In mitigation, his lawyer Annette Henry said he may die behind bars, adding: ""He does not wish to be alive. He hates himself for what happened."" She admitted the ""self-reporting"" of his relationship status was a flawed process. Sentencing him to 26 years in prison, Judge Richard Marks QC said: ""The attack by you on Angela Best was sustained, vicious and utterly brutal. She suffered an unimaginably terrible death. ""Such repeated offending, resulting in three separate court cases, must be almost unprecedented."" Ms Best's son said: ""My mother was the type of person who was always going out of her way to help people and unfortunately that was the reason she met her demise."" Her sister, Valerie Archibold, described the impact of her loss as ""immeasurable"". Outside court, her sister Lorraine Jones said: ""This convicted murderer tried to play the system as he has successfully done before. ""He knew what he was doing when he planned and executed the horrific murder of our beloved Angela."""

The 42-year-old, who was pursued by police for shoplifting in a Sainsbury's and assaulting a security guard, claimed excessive forced had been used against him when he was surrendering. He said the incident left him feeling suicidal. An internal police investigation rejected the allegation and concluded that McClelland was a danger to the officers and the public. Throwing out the case at Brighton County Court, High Court judge Jonathan Simpkiss said McClelland had ""considerable antipathy"" towards the police and was ""squaring up for a fight"". He said it was ""quite clear the claimant posed a threat to officers"". :: Taser stun gun a 'less lethal' option for police forces McClelland's solicitor Sophie Khan called the decision ""bizarre"" and ""perverse"" and said he was considering an appeal.

In footage from a camera worn by PC Charlotte Grant, a shirtless McClelland is seen with officers in the car park. PC Grant shouts: ""Get on the floor, there is a red dot on your chest."" ""Taser, Taser, Taser,"" the officer then shouts as the stun gun is used. In the clip, McClelland can be seen falling to the ground before another officer kicks him in the leg. PC Grant says: ""There are two barbs in your back, which will be removed. There will be no lasting effects from the Taser."" McClelland was asked how he was feeling after he was handcuffed. He was later convicted of theft, common assault and admitted obstructing a police officer, and was given a community order. According to court papers, he admitted he was drunk during the incident and that he wanted to ""fight them all"" as he was confronted by officers. Judge Simpkiss said it was ""objectively reasonable"" for the officers to use a Taser and that McClelland was not seriously injured. The judge said there was no evidence to support claims about any psychological trauma."

Blizzard warnings are also in place from Virginia to Maine. The extreme weather phenomenon - known as a ""bomb cyclone"" - is caused by a massive drop in pressure bringing with it hurricane force winds. Seventeen deaths have so been blamed on the extreme weather, including two men killed when their pick-up truck overturned in North Carolina and a passenger who was unable to escape a vehicle that crashed through a railroad crossing 20 miles north of Philadelphia. Hurricane force winds have led to power cuts in more than 100,000 homes and businesses across the north east of America.

The chain, which is privately owned by Sanpower, a Chinese conglomerate, is understood to have made the ""informal"" request in recent weeks, although it was unclear on Friday whether it had been communicated to landlords before or after its Boxing Day sale got underway. HoF is expected to publish details of its Christmas trading performance next week, when rival chains including Marks & Spencer and the John Lewis Partnership are also due to update investors and analysts. While Next, the clothing retailer, kicked off the flurry of festive trading statements with news on Tuesday, it was quickly overshadowed by a drastic profit warning from Debenhams, one of HoF's biggest competitors. A seasonal cold snap aided fashion chains but appears to have done little for general merchandise retailers amid cost pressures arising from increasing business rates, In a statement issued to Sky News on Friday evening, a HoF spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that we have contacted some of our landlords asking for their support as we drive forward with our transformation programme."" The state of HoF's finances has been the subject of speculation for months, and was not aided by Moody's, the ratings agency, which described the chain as ""a very high credit risk"" last month. That analysis partly explains why the company's bonds have been trading at around 90p in the pound, while The Times reported on Boxing Day that hedge funds have placed big bets on the value of listed retailers falling. The precise details of HoF's request to landlords, which was described by one source as ""informal"", was unclear on Friday. HoF declined to provide additional information about the revised terms it was seeking, or how many landlords or stores it affected. One industry source described it as ""a backdoor CVA"" - a reference to the formal court process through which retailers can secure rent reductions and shut loss-making stores. Toys R Us, the toy retailer, won approval for a CVA days before Christmas with landlords and other creditors agreeing to a plan that will see roughly a quarter of its British stores closing. Next and M&S are among other retailers who have grappled with their cost-bases by seeking rent reduction. Some analysts expect HoF to draw up plans for a number of store closures in the coming months. HoF announced in September that it had been handed an additional £15m of funding by Sanpower, with a further £10m committed by it towards a new distribution centre. Alex Williamson, who was recruited as the chain's chief executive from the Goodwood Estate last year, insisted in the autumn that he had ""high expectations"" for HoF's turnaround. ""My observations after a few weeks are that since Sanpower acquired the business in 2014 the primary focus has been on stabilising an enterprise that had been starved of investment for many years,"" he said. HoF is one of the high street's biggest employers, with a direct workforce of 5000 and 12,500 concession staff."

Increased pressures on front-line services were mirrored in the NHS 111 service, which received a record 480,400 calls - up 21% from 396,300 in the previous week. Chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Janet Davies said the figures showed ""that almost every day last week, NHS hospitals in England were at bursting point"". She said: ""Lack of beds for new patients is a major factor contributing to the current severe pressure on the NHS, but it's impossible for trusts to open extra beds without more nurses to staff them.

He tweeted: ""It is not good enough for @Theresa_May to say NHS problems are ""frustrating"" and ""disappointing"" when the Tory Government has caused this crisis. ""Nurses, doctors and patients are pleading with her to properly fund our health service, but she is ignoring them."" Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth told Sky News the Government had been ""utterly complacent' with its handling of the crisis and that ""eight years of severe under-funding"" for the NHS had contributed to it. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to patients for the wave of cancellations, saying it was ""absolutely not what I want"". He hit back at criticism of the Government's handling of the winter crisis from former prime minister Tony Blair, who claimed ministers' focus was on Brexit. Mr Hunt tweeted: ""Tony Blair's memory is as selective in office as out of office: does he not remember his own regular NHS winter crises? Perhaps he was too focused on joining the euro to give his full attention to the NHS..."""
2018-01-05,A winter crisis in the NHS feels like an annual tradition - but it hasn't always been this way.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/why-is-there-always-a-winter-crisis-in-the-nhs-11195502,"In the first four days of 2018, there have been more mentions of ""NHS"" with ""winter crisis"" in British newspapers than in the entire period from 2003 to 2009. :: May apologises for NHS winter crisis The NHS Winter Crisis hasn't always been an annual media event - it's been mentioned in newspapers more times in the first four days of 2018 than all of 2003-2009 pic.twitter.com/nuAJGPtFJn More concerning, that trend matches with a vast increase in the number of people waiting more than four hours for treatment at A&E - a key Government target. And it's not just the media - there's been a parallel spike in A&E attendances lasting more than four hours pic.twitter.com/WAEzkBxGvx Why? Well, analysis from the health think tank the King's Fund highlights two key factors. Firstly, people are using NHS services more. That's partly due to a growing and ageing population, though that doesn't explain all of it - people are also simply using services more than they used to. Secondly, NHS funding is no longer keeping pace with the rising demand. In the years where the ""Winter NHS Crisis"" slipped off the agenda, funding for the Department of Health increased roughly in line with increases in hospital admissions. In the years since - and in particular over the last couple of years, where the increase in NHS service users has been particularly acute - it simply has not. Prior to 2010, NHS funding rose roughly in line with increasing demand. Since then, it hasn't. pic.twitter.com/R19z24IGBc Estimates from the King's Fund, Health Foundation and Nuffield Trust suggests NHS funding is at least £4bn below what is needed this year - and that's set to rise to at least £20bn by 2022/23. So what's the solution? The choice appears to be between a fundamental change to the way the NHS works, decreasing the range of services provided or having at least some people pay for the cost of their care at the point of use - or a marked increase in funding which will ultimately have to be paid by the taxpayer. Public opinion is very clear on Britons' preference - they say they would be willing to pay more in tax if it goes towards the NHS. A Sky Data poll last year showed some 68% would support a 1% increase in income tax across the board if it was guaranteed to go to the NHS. The risk for politicians is if that support softens when the money comes out of voters' payslips. But allowing the current lurch from winter crisis to winter crisis in Britons' most beloved and trusted institution to continue is also a deadly risk of its own."
2018-01-05,"It always looked premature to assume, as some commentators did, that the festive season on the high street was all right simply because Next's Christmas trading was not as bad as feared.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/debenhams-is-largely-to-blame-for-its-christmas-trading-woes-11195140,"So it has transpired. Rumours have been swirling in the City for weeks that Debenhams is struggling - ""the share price at 32p tells you something's wrong"", one rival retailer told me just before Christmas - and sure enough, the UK's second-biggest department store chain has issued a profits warning. And an absolute lulu of a profits warning it is too. Debenhams is now guiding the market to expect profits during the current financial year of between £55m-65m. That compares with previous guidance of £83m and an out-turn of £95m last year, and reflects the extent to which the retailer had to cut prices in order to remain competitive. :: How the major retailers have fared over Xmas Shoppers did come out during the final few weeks before Christmas, with most of the damage done during the start of the 17-week period to 30 December on which the company reported today, but ominously trading then fell away in the immediate post-Christmas sales period despite more markdowns. Those markdowns have eaten into profit margins. The question is how much of this reflects general weakness on the high street due to weakening consumer spending and how much of it reflects problems specific to Debenhams. The surprising update from Next, along with indications that John Lewis did well over Christmas, suggests it is the latter - although Debenhams was at pains to point out that comparisons with Next are wide of the mark as the latter derives a far greater proportion of its sales from clothing. The truth is that Debenhams has structural issues that are inhibiting its ability to trade its way through the current tough retail climate. It has too many stores and was not as fast into digital as some of its competitors. Recognising that, the company hired Sergio Bucher, the former head of Amazon's European fashion business, as its new chief executive just over a year ago. He has already unveiled his strategy for turning around the business but clearly this is going to be a long job. However, progress seems to be being made in digital, where sales during the period were up by just under 10%. Mr Bucher has also pointed out that Debenhams grew sales in both beauty products and food, two areas he has targeted as crucial to the future growth of the business. One specific problem for Debenhams during the pre-Christmas trading period appears to be that competition was particularly intense in gifts where, Mr Bucher has admitted, the retailer's ranges were not sufficiently distinctive or sufficiently premium. This may have been something beyond his control as, given the lead times involved, he and his colleagues may well have been trying to shift lines that were ordered and bought under the previous managerial regime. Financially speaking, Debenhams has high 'operational gearing', which means that it has a very high fixed cost base. This means that a slight rise or fall in sales can translate into a big rise or fall in profits. Accordingly, the drop in profit margins that Debenhams has reported - some 1.5 percentage points - has been enough to wipe out a fifth of this year's expected profits. It means Mr Bucher is likely to have to accelerate his turnaround plans. Contrary to some reports, all of the stores in the Debenhams estate are profitable, although some are more profitable than others. That may mean, depending on the leases of individual outlets - the retailer owns few of its own sites - some stores may close, although Mr Bucher's solution to date has largely involved allowing other operators to take space in sites where he has felt Debenhams has too much. After the sharp share price reaction some will speculate that Debenham, whose stock market value is now down to just £440m, may now be a takeover target. This seems somewhat unlikely given the challenges facing the business and its relative lack of assets. Any would-be buyer is likely to sit back and wait to see how Mr Bucher's turnaround progresses during coming months."

It emerged earlier this week that Intel was notified by Google last June of a flaw in its processor chips that could leave memory and data vulnerable to theft - leaving the company, and its rivals, scrambling to mitigate the risk. :: Apple warns on chip security flaw Intel's shares have tumbled by 5% since the hardware issue came to light - the two known bugs named Meltdown and Spectre affecting not only Intel's processors but also those of AMD and ARM Holdings. It is now understood that, following the sale of his shares in November, Mr Krzanich currently holds just above the minimum level of stock required of him by Intel. Intel released a statement to insist there was no impropriety, saying the sale was ""unrelated"" and that he ""continues to hold shares in line with corporate guidelines."" Market commentators said the activity mirrored a divestment path for Mr Krzanich that had been laid out in October. GBH Insights chief strategy analyst Daniel Ives told the AP news agency the stock sale was ""cookie cutter"" and not of concern."

Abdulhadi Al-Rabie, Taif Health Affairs spokesman, confirmed the women had been fired for mistreating the baby. The baby's father told reporters that he had been shocked by the video, which racked up 57,000 views in two days. He called on the Ministry of Health to take tough action on the nurses and those who had circulated the video, according to a report in the Saudi Gazette. The nurses have not been publicly identified but have had their licences revoked. Al-Rabie said the nurses would face severe penalties if investigations found them guilty of abuse."
2018-01-05,Scotland Yard is to ask the Government for £38m to help pay for the investigation into the Grenfell Tower fire. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/grenfell-tower-scotland-yard-asks-for-38m-to-pay-for-investigation-11195641,"The force says the demands on police time could leave it facing unreasonable costs because of the complexity of the investigation. About 200 Metropolitan Police officers have been working on the criminal probe into the fire which killed 71 people in June 2017. Millions of documents have been seized and months have been spent removing potential evidence from the ruined tower block in west London, which remains a crime scene. Many suspects have been interviewed, and detectives have been investigating potential offences including misconduct in public office, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and breaches of fire safety regulations. The force is asking the Home Office to fully fund the £27m cost of the inquiry in the coming financial year, its head of finance has said. Another £11.1m is also being sought to cover the extra hours put in by detectives so far. A police force can apply for a special grant to help foot the bill of an investigation once it exceeds 1% of their budget under current rules. But because the Met's investigation into the fire is likely to involve many officers for a second year, it has asked the Home Office for more cash. The London Assembly's budget and performance committee was told the department had provided assurances their request was being given ""serious consideration"". Lynda McMullan, the Met Police's director of finance, told the hearing: ""The impact of Grenfell, that has had a very significant impact and we've put in a special grant claim for the current year for £11.1m, in terms of the additionality of cost to do with the incident for the current financial year. ""We have also indicated that we would like - we estimate that we will be spending - close to £27m on that particular investigation. ""We are asking whether or not we can have dispensation, not just simply the 1% referenced, but we also want to claim the full cost of our officer time for that investigation, not just the additionality, the overtime, in effect. ""We don't think it would be reasonable for us to pick up the full costs, as we know that the investigation will go on for some time."" The force has been told by Home Office officials that the matter will be put before ministers to decide whether to sign off on the additional funding, the committee heard. Ms McMullan added: ""We would like to have full costs rather than incremental costs for the next year because of the fact given, after a reduction in the number of officers, it doesn't seem reasonable we would absorb that full cost of those 200 officers. ""We have got assurances it is being given serious consideration."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""Given the unique and tragic circumstances of this event, we will consider any application we receive for funding from the Metropolitan Police as a matter of priority."""

The journalist's claim that Sir Michael Fallon lunged at her and tried to kiss her on the lips led to the former Defence Secretary being forced to step down in November. He apologised for ""falling below"" acceptable standards. Ms Merrick said the panel set up after to create an independent complaints procedure to root out abuse in Parliament would not go far enough to help staff working there. Proposed sanctions against MPs, such as e-learning, being sent on a training course or forced to apologise were ""very limited"", she said, adding: ""I think what people who've been involved and caught up in this want to hear are tougher sanctions."" Ms Merrick voiced concerns that a delay in setting up the new independent complaints procedure would still create problems for Westminster workers scared of raising incidents with their political party. ""I have spoken to women, who have not been able to come forward, but have complaints about politicians, who are concerned that if they go to the political parties that they won't be understood or listened to - or that it will be covered up in some way,"" she said. Ms Merrick highlighted the case of Bex Bailey, a Labour activist who claimed she was discouraged from reporting a rape allegation by a party official. Labour launched an investigation after Ms Bailey went public with the claim at the height of the Westminster harassment scandal. In that incident, Ms Merrick said, the draft report also failed because it did not apply to those outside Parliament. It reads: ""The working group recognises that visitors to constituency offices and advice surgeries are in scope but has not taken sufficient evidence to propose how they should best be included in these new arrangements. ""This needs to be properly considered and has been identified as an area for early future action."" In a statement to Sky News, panel convenor and Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said: ""This is a very serious matter that the working group are determined to get right, and as the chair, I will not comment on the content of leaked documents. ""We all recognise the need to change the culture in Westminster. ""The working group will meet as soon as Parliament returns to make further progress in creating an independent complaints procedure. In the meantime, interim support has been put in place by the House authorities."""

Officers pursued Dempsey, catching up with him on the M271, but he failed to stop, and did everything he could to evade capture. Footage from police car dashcams and the National Police Air Service shows that he even tried to drive the wrong way down the M3. The 13-minute chase came to a sudden end in the village of Chilworth, near Southampton after one officer decided he would crash into Dempsey's car. No one was hurt in the smash. In court, Dempsey, from Eastbourne, admitted dangerous driving, escaping lawful custody, driving while disqualified and criminal damage. He was sentenced to two years in prison in total, made up of 16 months for dangerous driving, six months for escaping custody, and two months for criminal damage. The sentences will run consecutively. Dempsey is disqualified from driving for more than five years and will have to take an extended test to get back on the roads. Chief Inspector Mark Lewis, from the Joint Roads Policing Unit, said: “Thanks to the bravery and courage of our highly-trained officers this pursuit ended without injury and with the man responsible detained. “If Dempsey had not been stopped at that point, he would have got onto the M3, driving the wrong way, which would have been potentially fatal for him and any other innocent road users. “Our roads policing officers are specially trained to carry out a range of different tactics, such as the one used in this incident, in order to stop those posing a danger to others. “I am proud of the actions our officers took that day, putting themselves in harm’s way for the protection of others.”"
2018-01-05,"The chairman of the Parole Board has ""apologised unreservedly"" to the victims of rapist John Worboys for not being told of his imminent release.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180105182752/https://news.sky.com/story/london-cabbie-rapist-john-worboys-to-be-released-from-prison-11195483,"Professor Nick Hardwick said the Parole Board was told Worboys' victims had been informed he was to be released so revealed the decision on that basis. He said the women had been ""failed by the system"". Prof Hardwick added the process must have been ""very distressing"" for victims and said he would launch a public consultation as he recognises there is a ""lack of transparency"" in the Parole Board. He called on MPs to back his call to change Parole Board Rules which prevent the decision-making process for specific cases to be discussed. Worboys, who became known as London's black cab rapist, was convicted of rape and several sexual assaults. He was jailed indefinitely in 2009 and police have since linked him to more than 100 further rapes and sexual assaults after other alleged victims came forward. On Wednesday, it was revealed he will be released soon after serving his minimum sentence of eight years. Labour's Keir Starmer, director of public prosecutions in 2009 and the current shadow Brexit secretary, refused to answer questions about the case when approached by Sky News. Asked whether he thought the right decision was made by prosecutors not to pursue further allegations against Worboys, Sir Keir said: ""These decisions were nine years ago. ""It's very important you go to the Crown Prosecution Service and get an accurate read out of the decisions that were made, particularly if further allegations have been made now."" Prof Hardwick's comments came after Labour MP Yvette Cooper called for the Parole Board to publish the reasons behind its decision to release John Worboys from prison. Ms Cooper said: ""There are many serious questions why this dangerous man has been given parole after serving such a short sentence for his attacks against women. ""Given the seriousness of this case, the Parole Board should publish their reasons immediately so both the decision and the process can be scrutinised before this man is released. ""We also need to know what information and support was given to all the victims before this decision was taken."" This could mean that senior members of the Parole Board are brought before MPs to be questioned about their decision. Labour MP Stella Creasy also called for further investigation, tweeting: ""If true that no notice of parole hearing given to the 100 victims then no chance to have their voices heard = no justice. ""Hope (Secretary of State for Justice David Lidington) will investigate if this is the case and show #VAWG (violence against women and girls) a priority across government."" Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith also tweeted: ""How are people supposed to have confidence in the system when the system treats victims with such contempt?"" Worboys, 60, carried out his attacks between 2002 and 2008. Many of his victims had been drinking in trendy West End and Chelsea bars. The cab driver, who is also a former stripper, would offer them champagne spiked with powerful sedatives to celebrate a made-up lottery win, which he would attempt to prove by showing his victims a carrier bag stuffed with cash. Worboys would then pounce on his victims in the back of his vehicle as they were left insensible and unable to protect themselves. In a statement, the Parole Board said: ""We can confirm that a three-member panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of Mr John Worboys, following an oral hearing. ""The arrangements for Mr Worboys' release will be managed by the Ministry of Justice."" When he was sentenced, Worboys was told he must serve at least eight years in prison and that he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he no longer posed a threat to women. One of his victims, whose identity is protected, told Sky News: ""I feel shaken up and very upset at the decision."" Worboys' ex-wife, Jean Clayton, 60, said he should never be let out of prison. She warned his ""next step would have been murder"". ""I feel utter disgust. If he hadn't been caught and taken to court he would have murdered somebody. It's very scary,"" she told The Sun. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Rape Crisis South London has criticised the decision to release Worboys, saying his victims would ""never be totally free from his despicable actions"". Yvonne Traynor added: ""It feels far too soon for this dangerous and manipulative perpetrator to be released into the public having served this woefully short time in prison."""

US publishers Henry Holt & Co brought forward the release date by four days after the US President's legal team attempted to block the publication, and bookshops have reported people queuing up outside. Little, Brown has done the same in the UK because of ""unprecedented demand"". Wolff joked: ""Where do I send the box of chocolates?"" In an interview with NBC News' Today talk show, he said: ""I will tell you the one description that everyone gave, everyone gave, everyone has in common. They all say he is like a child. ""And what they mean by that is he has a need for immediate gratification. It's all about him...they say he's a moron. An idiot."" Asked if he had interviewed the President about the book, Wolff replied: ""I absolutely spoke to the President. ""Whether he realised it was an interview or not, I don't know, but it certainly was not off the record."" Wolff said he spoke to Mr Trump after his inauguration and ""spent about three hours with the President over the course of the campaign in the White House, so my window into Donald Trump is pretty significant"". He added: ""I spoke to people who spoke to the President on a daily, sometimes minute-by-minute basis."" :: Comb-overs and cheeseburgers: Top Trump revelations from explosive book The book, Fire And Fury: Inside The Trump White House, caused a storm of interest when excerpts were released. There was a queue at the door at midnight at one bookshop in Washington DC, which reportedly sold all its copies in less than 20 minutes. One buyer said: ""I think a lot of people are interested because it blew up so quickly. Everyone has heard about it."" The book includes alleged accounts of how the President lives and what his colleagues think of him. In the book, Wolff claims Mr Trump's former ally and chief strategist Steve Bannon questioned his fitness for office. Mr Bannon, who was sacked by Mr Trump in August, is also quoted as saying a meeting between Mr Trump's son, Don Jr, and a group of Russians was ""unpatriotic"" and ""treasonous"". Around an hour before the book went on sale, the President tweeted: ""I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! ""I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist. ""Look at this guy's past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!"" According to the book, the President is regarded as an ""idiot"" by treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and former chief of staff Reince Priebus. Wolff writes that chief economic adviser Gary Cohn labelled the President ""dumb as s***"", while national security advisor H.R. McMaster allegedly considers him a ""dope"". The book also claims to reveal an insight into Mr Trump's bedroom habits. He and Melania are said to have separate bedrooms; Mr Trump has three TV sets in his; he strips his own bed; and the President prefers going to his room at around 6.30pm to watch his screens and call friends. Wolff also alleges Mr Trump did not want to win the 2016 election because he thought losing could offer ""a far more powerful brand and untold opportunities"". However, the White House rubbished the book, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissing it as ""ridiculous"". She added that Mr Trump and his family ""would not have put themselves through"" the campaign if they did not believe they could win, or want to win. The President immediately distanced himself from Mr Bannon as the allegations started to emerge on Thursday, saying: ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. ""When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind."" The President's legal team sent a ""cease and desist"" letter to Wolff and his publisher, threatening libel action.

2018-01-06,The extent of the pay gap between male and female employees has been revealed at the first groups to provide data to the Government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/gender-pay-gap-at-500-large-organisations-revealed-11197326,"The figures show that men are paid nearly 65% more per hour at high street fashion store Phase Eight and nearly 52% more at EasyJet. Organisations with 250 or more workers must publish their figures by April, and so far 527 firms have done so. Nearly half of the organisations pay men at least one tenth more per hour and 426 of them pay men more, on average, per hour. Thousands more firms, public sector bodies and other organisations are expected to reveal their gender pay gaps in the next few months. EasyJet, which has been reporting on its pay gap since 2015, says the reason for the difference in hourly rate is because its best paid staff tend to be male pilots, while lower paid cabin crew are more often women. A statement on its website says: ""easyJet's gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the salaries and gender make-up of its pilot community, which make up over a quarter of its UK employees. ""Pilots are predominantly male and their higher salaries, relative to other employees, significantly increases the average male pay at easyJet ""easyJet is seeking to encourage more women to become pilots through its Amy Johnson Initiative. It has set a target that 20% of new entrant pilots should be female by 2020."" A statement on the Phase Eight website said: ""The figures result from the fact that, as a women's fashion retailer, the staff in our stores are overwhelmingly female, whilst our corporate head office staff (whose pay rates are typically higher) are more evenly split between men and women. ""We are confident that women and men are paid equally for doing the equivalent jobs across our business."" Public sector bodies that show a wide divergence in pay per hour include the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham (men paid 34.8% more than women), and the Office for Nuclear Regulation (32.9%). Many of the firms in the top 20 in terms of those with biggest gaps are in financial services, including Virgin Money (32.5%), PriceWaterhouseCoopers (33.1%) and asset management firm Octopus Capital (38.1%). Virgin Money says on its website: ""We are passionate about fairness, equality and inclusion and are committed to reducing our gender pay gap. We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across our business."" PriceWaterhouseCoopers said: ""Our analysis of our gender pay gap shows that it is largely driven by the fact that there are more men in senior higher-paid roles within the business. We continue to take action to address any gaps and to make sure our policies and practices are fair."" Two utility firms, which were part of the state sector until they were privatised in the 1980s and 1990s, are also in the top 20. United Utilities pays men 36.7% more and Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission pays them an extra 33.4%. United Utilities says: ""We have a single pay and grading structure for all employees and use market-benchmarked rates for all roles. We have robust processes in place to ensure that pay is reviewed fairly for all employees."" The full list can be found here."

Winds of up to 70mph hit, while some parts saw as much as 18 inches (46cm) of snow. Southeast Georgia saw a rare half foot of snow and iguanas in South Florida were left so lethargic that they began falling from trees. :: Frozen sharks wash up on icy beaches amid storm At least 10 people were killed, including four in North Carolina and South Carolina who died after their vehicles ran off snowy roads. I just love this weather so much 💓❄️ pic.twitter.com/nkyKFBm2X1 Near Philadelphia, a driver was killed after his vehicle failed to stop on a snow-covered hill and crashed into a commuter train. A girl in Virginia was sledging when she was hit by a truck, while an elderly man was hit by a snow plough. Eastern Canada has also had extreme winter weather. There were winds of up to 105mph in some parts of Nova Scotia, and a temperature of -23C was recorded at Toronto's international airport on Friday morning - the coldest 5 January on record, beating the record set in 1959. :: What is a bomb cyclone - and how do they happen? Toronto's armouries have been opened to homeless people for the next two weeks, as the usual shelters ran out of space and some officials expressed concerns that people would freeze to death on the streets. An elderly couple died on their property in the town of Bluewater, about 120 miles west of Toronto. Grant Triebner, 90, was found dead inside a barn and his wife Ada, 83, died outside while looking for him. Eastern parts of Quebec saw up to 20 inches of snow and hundreds of thousands of Canadians had their power cut, much of it restored by late on Friday."
2018-01-06,Stock markets around the world have started 2018 where they left off in 2017.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/record-highs-on-the-stock-market-but-will-it-last-11196759,"On Wall Street, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are all trading at all-time highs. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 is at levels last seen at the end of 1991, while elsewhere in Asia the Hang Seng in Hong Kong is just 4% below its all-time high and the Kospi Composite index in South Korea just 2% off its record close. The ASX in Australia is also at an all-time high. And in Europe, the Dax in Germany is close to its all-time high, the Cac 40 in France has today hit a new record, as has the FTSE 100 in Britain. In short, the picture is buoyant almost everywhere. The FTSE World All-Share Index, which rose by 22% last year, has already risen by a further 2% in 2018 while the MSCI World Index, which rose by 20% last year, is also up by almost 2% so far this year. But what is behind these record-breaking moves - and can the good times continue to roll? The main reason for the spectacular run has been solid economic growth around the world. For the first time since the financial crisis, the economies of the US, China, Japan and Europe have enjoyed a period of synchronised growth that, crucially, also looks reasonably sustainable. That has translated into stronger earnings growth - optimism over which is the key factor that drives share prices higher. Another factor driving markets, again resulting from greater optimism, is mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. The end of 2017 in particular saw three enormous deals that touch all parts of the globe, with the US health store chain CVS paying $69bn (£50.9bn) for the US health insurer Aetna; Disney agreeing to buy the filmed entertainment and TV assets of 21st century Fox for $66bn (£48.6bn) and the Westfield shopping centre empire being acquired for $25bn by Franco-Dutch rival Unibail-Rodamco. There's also an enormous hostile takeover in the works at the moment, with the chipmaker Broadcom seeking to buy its rival Qualcomm for a jaw-dropping $130bn (£95.8bn), while all the signs are that M&A activity will continue to be strong in 2018. This is particularly the case in the US, where the Trump tax cuts have given companies a lot more money to play with, while Chinese companies continue to be acquisitive everywhere. In Europe, where M&A in 2017 grew even more strongly than in the US, continued economic growth should also ensure a continued appetite from businesses to buy competitors. However, with many stock indices already at record levels and valuations looking stretched, it is easy to see why there is a lot of anxiety among investors. In fairness that has been the case for quite a while, with the bull market in the US shortly to enter its tenth year, making it one of the longest in history. In the UK, while markets have not enjoyed quite the same meteoric growth - the FTSE 100 actually suffered reverses in each of 2011, 2014 and 2015 - there is also unease at the strength of the rally during the last two years and whether it can be sustained. This is not all that surprising. Markets, in the jargon, always climb a ""wall of worry"" and it is perfectly rational for investors to be wary after such a long period of gains. Mark Dampier, head of research at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, was saying as long ago as October 2016 that this was the ""most hated"" bull market he had seen in his near 35 years in the investment industry. Investors who decided to head for the sidelines at that time have since missed out on 15% gain for the FTSE 100 - even more if dividends are taken into account. It is not just investors in the UK who have been warily sitting out the rally. The Wall Street Journal reports today that, since 2012, American investors have withdrawn $1tn (£740bn) from mutual funds. It says the proportion of Americans who own shares has fallen from 62% prior to the global financial crisis to just 54% today. Intriguingly, fewer companies have been coming to market as well, pointing to possible wariness among the owners of businesses as well. The last year in which the number of shares in publicly listed US companies actually rose was as long ago as 2010, since when, the number of shares in issue has shrunk. That partly reflects M&A activity and record amounts of share buy-backs, but also points to company owners preferring to stay private. Yet the rally, particularly in the US, is clearly in its late stages. After nine years of a bull market, some kind of reversal is inevitable. Central banks around the world are beginning to tighten monetary policy everywhere, gradually bringing the age of ultra-cheap money to an end, although interest rates will still remain at very low levels, by historic standards, until at least the end of the current decade. Likewise, valuations do look stretched and will require meaningful improvements in company earnings to remain justified, although respected commentators such as David Kostin, the chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, argue that a combination of above-trend growth in the US and elsewhere, coupled with the Trump tax cuts, mean the US bull market will continue in 2018. Valuations are equally stretched in bond markets and, without quantitative easing to support the latter, they are likely to lurch downwards in sympathy if equity markets take a tumble. However, you want a really worrying sign, it is this. The renowned British investor Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of US fund manager Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, has just said there could be spectacular ""melt-up"" that might push up stock prices by a further 50% at some point during the next six months to two years before the bubble finally bursts. Mr Grantham, who is famed for getting out before the end of the dot-com boom in 2000 and the global financial crisis in 2008, has long argued that markets are over-valued. Bull markets tend to end when the final bear turns bullish."
2018-01-06,"Sarah Brisdion explains why she is pushing for businesses to ""do the right thing"" and install toilets with an adult-sized bench and hoist to stop the ordeal that many disabled people have to go through when the want the loo.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/undignified-and-painful-mums-battle-to-change-horrendous-disabled-toilet-facilities-11197880,"Would you lie on a urine-soaked public toilet floor? Or would you lie a newborn baby on one? Of course not. But currently, many businesses are allowing hundreds of thousands of disabled people in the UK, along with my seven-year-old son, Hadley, to endure just that. Hadley, has cerebral palsy and is a full-time wheelchair user. His disability means that he cannot stand unaided and is not always able to control his bowel and bladder. He needs to lie down to have his clothes and underwear prepared before being transferred to the toilet or to have his continence items changed. Without a safe, clean, changing bench to do this, there is little option but to use a toilet floor. This is a heart-wrenching thing for any parent to subject their child to. It is undignified, dangerous and painful for both of us and regularly reduces us to tears. The only other option is to let him sit in his own bodily waste! What is just as upsetting, is that there is an answer to this widespread problem that huge multinational businesses are refusing to provide for their customers: a Changing Places toilet - a large accessible toilet with an adult-sized changing bench and hoist. By not including these facilities in restaurants, shopping centres, supermarkets, sports venues, cinemas, leisure attractions etc, businesses are choosing to exclude us. The stress that this puts on my family is tremendous. Petition calling on UK's largest supermarkets to take responsibility & commit to providing #changingplaces toilets in ALL their stores has almost 150,000 supporters but still none of have agreed to make changes. #journorequest #prrequest https://t.co/2Wh3sOtF7t We have to plan every outing with military precision, knowing exactly where we are able to use a toilet at any given moment. There are only just over 1000 Changing Places toilets in the UK. Which sounds like a lot, until you find out that there are millions of toilets in the UK that other members of the public can use - 600 in The Shard alone! We have to miss out on many activities that most people take for granted because if there isn't a toilet my son can use, we know we are likely to have to leave early or not visit at all. Or what should be a pleasant day out, is ruined because of another horrendous toilet floor. Hadley is very aware that this is grossly unfair and that is he being treated terribly. When you witness your child sobbing and begging you not to lay him down on a stinking toilet floor, it is very hard to stay positive. I lay awake at night worrying about what this is doing to his mental health and mine. The harsh reality is, we now rarely go out at all for fear of the conditions we will find. A story that is all too common for so many. As a nation, we don't like talking about wee, poo or periods and I believe this is making the battle for Changing Places one of the most ignored fights for equality in recent times. I wanted to do something to try to break the taboo around toileting and get these issues further into the public eye. After all, we all have to pee (on average eight times per day). Some people just need a little more help than others. So, on 1 December 2017, #LooAdvent was born. For 24 days, I posted a photograph of myself using the toilet, dressed in different festive costumes, trying to reach as many people as possible with our message. Some said I have no dignity. I say, lying on a toilet floor covered in other people's urine is way more undignified and I'm willing to do anything to stop that! I hoped that it would reach decision makers, MPs, businesses and other people who need Changing Places, and that in turn, that might result in more toilets my son and others can use. The reaction was incredible. Whilst there have been no new facilities as a result as yet, the reach was beyond my expectations. Media coverage across press, radio and TV and numerous celebrity supporters. Even some toilet selfies from the team at The Last Leg and from Paralympians, Hannah Cockcroft MBE and Anne Wafula Strike in solidarity. It was so successful, that I've decided to embark on a new social media challenge. #ShameOnLoo will see me taking selfies on some of the worst toilet floors I've had the displeasure to experience. The first of which was taken in a McDonald's restaurant. A small, cramped, inadequate and vile accessible toilet with a door that didn't even close. In a statement, McDonald's said: ""We're sorry for this customer's experience. Hygiene and safety is of paramount importance to us; all of our toilets are checked frequently and cleaned whenever necessary and the floors are mopped regularly throughout the day."" It's clear that disabled people are not valued by so many businesses. But why not? The purple pound is worth £2.49bn per year. So if businesses won't install Changing Places because it is the right thing to do, why are they not installing them because it makes business sense?"

The 31-year-old suspect has been released under investigation. Officers are trying to work out whether the deaths, in the Duston and Kingsley Park areas, are connected to the so-called Croydon cat killer. Northamptonshire Police said it was working closely with the Metropolitan force, whose investigation is known as Operation Takahe. While the attacks are similar to those in London, officers remain unsure whether they were carried out by the same person. :: 'Croydon cat killer' aims to 'horrify' people, animal charity says A group which has been helping police with the inquiry, and cataloguing the attacks, said it did not believe the arrested man was the culprit. ""The killer has not been caught,"" said South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty (Snarl) co-founder Boudicca Rising. Nevertheless, Ms Rising believes the most recent killings could be useful to the investigation. ""What is really clear from the timeline over Christmas is that he was in south London and then started travelling again,"" she said. ""We have always thought he is a south London resident. ""He seemed at ease with getting around and the killings seemed more confident."" Attacks over the festive period were reported in south London, north London, Aylesbury and Tunbridge Wells. :: Cat killer could escalate crimes to attacking vulnerable women and girls, police say Snarl believes that up to 400 cats and other small animals may have been slaughtered across the country. It is thought the killings began in the south London area in around October 2015, leading to the attacker being dubbed the Croydon cat killer. However other small animals, such as rabbits and foxes, have also been found dead and mutilated across the country. A £10,000 reward is on offer to anyone with information that could lead to the killer's arrest."

However, when an ambulance finally arrived another two hours later, at 11.46pm, paramedics had to break into the woman's home in Clacton, Essex, and found that she had died. East of England Ambulance Service says it has launched an internal investigation into the incident. ""Our sincere condolences and apologies go out to the patient's family and friends and we are truly sorry for the ambulance wait that occurred at this incident,"" deputy chief executive Sandy Brown said. ""We have very publicly expressed how stretched the ambulance service is and the pressures our staff and the NHS as a whole have been under the past few days. ""As a trust, we have experienced our busiest days ever and we know our partners in the hospitals are in the same situation."" The East of England Ambulance Service said it received more than 4,200 calls on the day of incident and was also facing hospital handover delays. Dave Powell, regional officer for the GMB union, said paramedics were ""devastated"". ""They're devastated because they're not in the job to find people dead, they're in the job to help people and keep them alive,"" he said. ""It puts enormous strain and stress on people who are working really hard as it is. Something has got to be done and the Government has got to wake up to this crisis."" Commenting on the woman's death, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This should not be happening in our country"". In a separate incident on New Year's Day, an 88-year-old woman in Portsmouth died following a seven-hour wait for a bed. Josephine Smalley spent five hours in an ambulance and another two hours on a trolley in a corridor at Queen Alexandra Hospital. She died after suffering a stroke and then a heart attack. On Thursday, Theresa May apologised for delays to thousands of NHS operations and hospital admissions. Her apology followed official figures which revealed 16,893 patients waited more than 30 minutes on ambulances at A&E departments in England during the week up to New Year's Eve - up 42% from 11,900 in the previous week. Mrs May said she recognised the situation was ""difficult"", ""frustrating"" and ""disappointing""."

Mr Young, a free school pioneer, was named as a board member on the new Office for Students (OfS) watchdog on Monday, but has since come under fire for comments he made on Twitter. Writing to Theresa May, the Labour MPs say: ""The virulence of Mr Young's misogyny is disturbing; furthermore, he has offered no apology for his remarks. ""Instead, Mr Young has said that it would be a 'shame if people who have said controversial things in the past, or who hold heterodox opinions, are prohibited from serving on public bodies'."" On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson condemned criticism of Mr Young's appointment, tweeting: ""Ridiculous outcry over Toby Young. He will bring independence, rigour and caustic wit. Ideal man for job."" However the two frontbenchers also criticise Mr Johnson's argument. They write: ""Instead of apologising for causing offence Mr Young has instead indulged in gaslighting many of those who have objected; rounding on them and questioning their sanity. This is not evidence of what the Foreign Secretary termed 'caustic wit', it is simply misogyny."" Ridiculous outcry over Toby Young. He will bring independence, rigour and caustic wit. Ideal man for job In a blog post on Facebook, Mr Young, whose appointment suggested it would be a ""shame"" if people who have made controversial comments, or hold non-conformist opinions, were banned from serving on public bodies. He noted that the OfS will have some responsibility for ensuring universities protect free speech on campus, which he said he has been a defender of since the age of 16. Mr Young added: ""Given that defending free speech will be one of the OfS's priorities, there's a certain irony in people saying I'm 'unfit' to serve on its board because of politically incorrect things I've said in the past. ""Some of those things have been sophomoric and silly - and I regret those - but some have been deliberately misinterpreted to try and paint me as a caricature of a heartless Tory toff. ""For the record, I'm a supporter of women's rights and LGBT rights. ""I'm also a defender of teaching children with disabilities in mainstream schools."" Some of those things have been sophomoric and silly – and I regret those – but some have been deliberately misinterpreted to try and paint me as a caricature of a heartless Tory toff.  23/ Mr Young's previous Twitter posts include a 2012 tweet when he wrote watching Prime Minister's Questions: ""Serious cleavage behind Ed Miliband's head. Anyone know who it belongs to?"" A 2009 post also read: ""What happened to Winkleman's breasts (sic) Put on some weight, girlie #comicrelief."" The shadow secretaries argue that his appointment is at odds with the Prime Minister's ambition to create a ""truly meritocratic country"" and point to a petition to reverse the appointment which has attracted more than 120,000 signatures."

Speaking at Camp David, Mr Trump attacked Wolff's version of events. ""I consider it a work of fiction,"" he told reporters. ""He said he interviewed me for three hours in the White House - it didn't exist. It's in his imagination."" But the President did concede that he did a ""quick interview with him a long time ago"".

2018-01-06,"Carillion, the troubled construction services group which is embedded in the HS2 high-speed rail link and other critical Government infrastructure projects, is racing to secure new funding within weeks to avoid collapse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/stricken-hs2-contractor-carillion-in-urgent-fight-for-survival-11197537,"Sky News has learnt that Carillion, which has been sliding deeper into financial difficulty for months‎, is due to present a revised business plan to its syndicate of lenders in the coming days. The plan, which has been drawn up by the company and its advisers over recent weeks, is said to have exposed‎ a funding gap running to hundreds of millions of pounds. Carillion, which employs 19,500 people in Britain, has come up with a rescue plan which would involve handing back some loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and potentially accepting financial support from the Government if it cannot secure it from private sector sources. One insider said the company had been due to present the blueprint to lenders including Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK on or around 17 January but that that was now likely to be brought forward given the urgency of the situation. ""The next two weeks are critical,"" the source added. The company has said it expects its full-year average net borrowing to be up to £925m, while it also has ‎a pension deficit of about £600m. Those figures dwarf its stock market value, which now stands at just over £80m. Carillion is understood to require an unspecified amount of new money from next month, with its banking syndicate largely reluctant to provide it. Santander UK, the Spanish-owned lender, is said to have adopted a particularly aggressive stance with the company just days before Christmas, triggering fears that Carillion was on the verge of collapse. The attitude of the lenders is said to have prompted senior figures close to Carillion to discuss the possibility of emergency financial support from the Government. That could be either as a loan on commercial terms, an agreement to reprice some contracts or to allow Carillion to hand back loss-making work to Whitehall departments. A Government source ‎insisted that there were no live talks about ministers bailing out Carillion, but several people close to the situation said that it remained an option if the banks refused to provide additional funding in the next ten days. Talks are set to continue with the lenders next week, with the precise size of the funding gap dependent upon whether Carillion is able to unshackle itself from loss-making contracts, insiders said. A number of disposals aimed at raising cash, including that of its Canadian operations, are progressing more slowly than originally anticipated. Its only asset sale since the crisis erupted has been to offload a portfolio of healthcare contracts to rival outsourcer Serco for £50m. If it survives in the short term, Carillion is working on a plan to swap £1bn or more of its borrowings for new shares in the company, which is one of the Government's most important infrastructure delivery partners. Such a plan would leave its pension scheme, or the Pension Protection Fund, as a major shareholder. The Wolverhampton-based group is the second-largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains approximately half of the UK's prisons as well as roughly 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. It is also engaged in building the Aberdeen Bypass and was responsible for constructing the Tate Modern art gallery in London and the Channel Tunnel. This week, the company was dealt a fresh blow when the City watchdog launched a probe into the ""timeliness and content"" of statements it made to the‎ stock market about is financial position between December 2016 and July last year, when a massive profit warning sent its shares crashing by 75%. Since then, the company has cleared out its executive team, including chief executive Richard Howson and finance director Zafar Khan. Mr Howson was replaced on an interim basis by Keith Cochrane, the former Weir Group boss, with Andrew Davies due to arrive from Wates Group as his permanent successor on 22 January. Carillion reported a first-half pre-tax loss of £1.15bn in September, while its most recent market update - three days before Christmas - was to inform investors that its lenders had agreed to defer a test of its borrowing agreements from 31 December to 30 April. ""Carillion is in continuing discussions with stakeholders regarding its options to reduce net debt and recpaitalise and/or restructure the group's balance sheet,"" the company said on 22 December. ""These discussions are progressing well, and the board still expects to determine the approach and to commence steps to implement the chosen opti‎on during the first quarter of 2018."" A Government spokesperson said: ""Carillion is a major supplier to the Government with a number of long-term contracts. ""We are committed to maintaining a healthy supplier market and work closely with our key suppliers. ""The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. ""We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress."" Carillion and Santander UK declined to comment."

Temperatures are forecast to fall on Saturday night due to ""cold air and clear skies"". A Met Office spokesman said that across parts of Scotland temperatures could drop as far as -10C (14F), which is much colder than average for the time of year. NHS England urged people to stock up on medicines, check on vulnerable or elderly neighbours and get the flu jab. The comments came after it emerged that tens of thousands of planned operations could be delayed for at least a month, as the norovirus and rise in flu levels put pressure on hospitals. A spokesman said: ""Freezing conditions are forecast in some areas and evidence shows that the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other serious breathing problems increases as temperatures plummet."" He added that two-and-a-half times as many flu sufferers have been admitted to hospital than at this point last year. And Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said a ""real crisis"" had developed since New Year's Eve. He said: ""There has been debate as to what constitutes a crisis but to all those working at the front door the last four days has definitely been at that level. ""The temperature is set to drop again and looks like it will be below the 5C mark, which statistics show means more illness and more hospital attendances to come."" He added that while some of the claims by medics had been ""overzealous and hyperbolic"", he urged the Government to listen to doctors' concerns and act on them."

Fire And Fury: Inside The Trump White House quotes aides as saying Mr Trump has a short attention span, often repeats himself and refuses to read briefing notes. Mr Wolff told BBC radio that ""one of the interesting effects of the book so far is a very clear emperor-has-no-clothes effect."" Speaking on Radio 4, he added: ""The story that I have told seems to present this presidency in such a way that it says he can't do his job."" ""Suddenly everywhere people are going, 'Oh my God, it's true, he has no clothes'. That's the background to the perception and the understanding that will finally end ... this presidency."" :: Top Trump revelations from explosive new book Mr Wolff has said he wrote the book after conducting about 200 interviews. But Mr Trump has criticised the book as inaccurate and its author as a ""loser"" who had little access to the President and mostly relied on Steve Bannon, his former top aide and chief strategist. The US President wrote: ""Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book."" ""He used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!"" Mr Wolff said many of those close to Mr Trump describe him as a ""moron"", an ""idiot"" and ""like a child"". He told NBC: ""They all say he is like a child. ""And what they mean by that is he has a need for immediate gratification. It's all about him... they say he's a moron. An idiot."" Mr Wolff claims Mr Bannon - who was sacked by Mr Trump in August - questioned Mr Trump's fitness for office. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson defended Mr Trump's mental fitness, responding to claims in the book. In an interview with CNN, Mr Tillerson said: ""I've never questioned his mental fitness. I've had no reason to question his mental fitness. ""He is not a typical President of the past, I think that's well-recognised. That's also why the American people chose him."" Mr Tillerson dismissed suggestions that his stint as top US diplomat is coming to an end, amid reports of a rocky relationship with Mr Trump. ""I intend to be here for the whole year,"" he said. Last year, he reportedly described the President as a ""moron"" after a national security meeting, a claim denied by his office. According to the book, the President is regarded as an ""idiot"" by treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and former chief of staff Reince Priebus. :: Hannah Thomas-Peter - Explosive book claims and what they mean for Trump Mr Trump's lawyers tried to block publication of the book, before publishers brought the release date forward. Wolff also says Mr Trump, 71, did not want to win the 2016 presidential election because losing would offer ""a far more powerful brand and untold opportunities"". But Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said this was ""ridiculous"", adding that Mr Trump and his family ""would not have put themselves through"" the campaign if they did not want to win. Wolff said he spoke to Mr Trump after his inauguration and ""spent about three hours with the President over the course of the campaign in the White House, so my window into Donald Trump is pretty significant"". He added: ""I spoke to people who spoke to the President on a daily, sometimes minute-by-minute basis."""

2018-01-06,An MP has apologised after filming himself with a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head on the anniversary of the Kingsmill massacre.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/sinn-fein-mp-barry-mcelduff-apologises-over-kingsmill-tweet-on-massacre-anniversary-11197614,"Sinn Fein's Barry McElduff said he never realised or imagined the footage would be linked with the sectarian attack. Ten Protestants on their way home from work were shot dead on 5 January 1976 in what later became known Kingsmill massacre. A 2011 report by a branch of the Northern Ireland police found that members of the Provisional IRA carried out the killings. On Friday, West Tyrone MP Mr McElduff posted a tweet in which he wrote: ""Hey Fred, where do the McCullaghs keep the bread?"" It is believed ""McCullaghs"" was reference to the shop he was in at the time. Some accused the MP of making a tasteless reference to the massacre, with a number of unionist politicians calling for him to resign. On Saturday, Mr McElduff tweeted: ""Have deleted video post. Had not realised or imagined for a second any possible link between product brand name and Kingsmill Anniversary. ""Further, I apologise for any hurt or offence caused. Never my intention to offend anyone who has suffered grievously."" Kingsmill shares its name with the south Armagh village that witnessed one of the worst atrocities of the Troubles. A group of gunmen stopped a van carrying textile workers on their way home and told the only Catholic to leave. They then lined up the remaining Protestants at the side of the road and opened fire. Only one of the 11 men hit by gunfire survived the attack. Democratic Unionist Assembly member William Irwin said the timing and product used by Mr McElduff ""raises many questions about the motivation behind this video"". He added: ""Given Sinn Fein's repeated insensitivity to victims and glorification of terrorists, PIRA victims throughout the United Kingdom have interpreted this video as a calculated and deliberate insult."" TUV leader Jim Allister said: ""Sinn Fein's utter contempt for victims is clearly on display here. ""Any talk of equality or human rights from that party is once again exposed as so much cant and hypocrisy."" Ulster Unionist councillor David Taylor added: ""Barry McElduff really is beyond contempt and should be truly ashamed of himself for his actions."" Meanwhile, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long tweeted Mr McElduff, saying: ""I see you have deleted your video. ""Will you also explain what on earth you were thinking of, posting this on the anniversary of the Kingsmills Massacre? ""Have you any apology to make to those victims & survivors deeply hurt by your antics whether deliberate or not?"""
2018-01-06,"Theresa May's long-awaited Cabinet reshuffle is expected finally to go ahead as MPs return to Westminster on Monday, with around half a dozen ministers changing jobs.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-expected-to-keep-top-four-ministers-in-cabinet-reshuffle-on-monday-11198786,"The Prime Minister needs to replace her former de-facto deputy, Damian Green, who she sacked nearly three weeks ago after he admitted lying about computer porn allegations. It is also thought the PM is keen to restore some gender balance to her Cabinet and boost the number of women, as well as trying to balance the Tories' pro-Brexit and Remain factions. :: Sky Views: Bring on the Cabinet reshuffle! It has been suggesed that Mr Green's old job of First Secretary of State could go to the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, though the current NHS winter crisis could now thwart his promotion hopes. Another candidate who has been tipped for Mr Green's job, which involved chairing several Cabinet committees, is the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, a long time ally of the PM. Although he was attacked for visiting Qatar during New Year rail fare increases and by Labour peer Lord Adonis over rail franchises, Mr Grayling and Mrs May were local councillors together before becoming MPs. Senior Whitehall sources have told Sky News they expect the four most senior members of the Cabinet - Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Boris Johnson and David Davis - to stay in the same job. Mr Hammond's survival as Chancellor will dismay and infuriate Brexiteer Tories, who claim his pro-Remain sympathies are leading him to do everything he can to sabotage Brexit negotiations. Amber Rudd is expected to stay at the Home Office, even though she is a close ally of the PM and could be a candidate to replace Mr Green, because it is claimed Mrs May sees her as protecting her own Home Office legacy. Boris Johnson is likely to survive at the Foreign Office despite a succession of blunders. Attempts to demote him to a new Brexit role have been dropped because of fears that he would quit and become a dangerous assassin. David Davis is said to be safe because, despite claims that he has grown weary and also fears he is being sidelined in Brexit negotiations, to move him mid way though his battles with the EU's Michel Barnier would cause massive disruption. It is known that Sir Patrick McLoughlin, widely blamed for the Tories' poor general election performance in June, is to step down as Conservative Party chairman. The favourite to succeed him is the Home Office minister Brandon Lewis, who already attends Cabinet and is a local government protege of Tory chairman Sir Eric Pickles. A fierce battle is raging, however, over the future of the Education Secretary Justine Greening, a comprehensive-educated opponent of the PM's flagship policy to bring back grammar schools. Ms Greening, along with Business Secretary Greg Clark and the Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom, are thought to be vulnerable, but could be shuffled to new jobs rather than sacked. The Sunday Telegraph reports that Ms Greening is fighting to hold on to her position, posting a series of tweets highlighting her achievements and twice declaring ""school standards are rising"". Mrs May is known to reward ministers she believes she can trust and who are reliable, which could mean promotion for allies like the Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire and the Culture Secretary Karen Bradley. Both were junior ministers under Mrs May at the Home Office. After Cabinet changes on Monday, the PM is expected to freshen up the junior ranks of the Government on Tuesday, letting go of some older and long-serving stalwarts and bringing in some MPs elected in 2015. The Prime Minister is also likely to promote a number of women MPs and some from ethnic minorities, in a bid – it is claimed - to give the Government a more modern image that better reflects UK society as a whole."

He was jailed indefinitely in 2009, but the Parole Board has now decided that he would soon be released - despite police saying that more than 100 alleged victims had come forward following his conviction. A day after his release was confirmed, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) defended the decision by saying it had charged Worboys with offences ""where it was deemed there was a realistic prospect of conviction"". :: How the Parole Board decided to release black cab rapist John Worboys One victim said: ""I never thought Worboys would see the light of day after the terrible offences he committed. I honestly thought he would never be allowed out of prison. ""So I was shocked, shaken and tearful when a friend sent me an email with a link to the story of his imminent release. ""I hadn't been told by the Parole Board and had to find out by looking at a news website, which is completely out of order. ""I felt cheated and betrayed. They could have at least sent me a letter. "" The woman said: ""I am really concerned that he could offend again. How can he carry out so many horrific crimes and then suddenly be ok? ""I feel like we need to know the reasons why the Parole Board think he is safe enough to release and whether he has admitted to any of the offences he wasn't convicted of. ""I think the police also need to investigate any other claims of women who have come forward so they too can get justice."" In a comment piece for the i newspaper, Hannah Roberts went public with a story of her narrow escape from the sexual predator. She said police dismissed her when she told them of her ordeal in 2002. It took six years before she had the opportunity to identify Worboys and make a statement, she said. Criticising the CPS, Ms Roberts said: ""Many of the women who came forward to accuse Worboys were ignored or not believed by police at the time of their attacks. ""Now the same unheard women whose cases did not get to trial may feel slighted for a second time by suggestions that their cases did not meet the evidential test. ""The reality was that the police had accumulated a mountain of evidence that was not all needed for a successful outcome at trial and the CPS has to strike a balance between justice for victims and clogging up the courts for years."" According to the CPS, 83 women had reported allegations up to the point of conviction, and a further 19 afterwards. The CPS said it had advised officers to refer any allegations of rape. One file was submitted in relation to an allegation of sexual assault but it ""did not pass the evidential test"", the CPS added in a statement. The Metropolitan Police said there is currently no live investigation into Worboys."
2018-01-06,Sales of products containing dangerous levels of acids and corrosive substances have been banned for under 18-year-olds under a new voluntary government plan aimed at stopping acid attacks. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/stores-sign-up-to-voluntary-ban-on-acid-sales-to-teenagers-11198749,"Some of the country's largest retailers including Wickes, B&Q, Screwfix and Tesco have signed the list of commitments, which include checking the age of buyers both in store and online. Under the ban - which is not legally binding - the following products will not be sold to those under 18: :: Products that contain 12% or above of sodium hydroxide, such as some drain cleaners and paint strippers:: Any liquids with 10% or more of hydrochloric acid, which includes brick and patio cleaners:: Products containing 10% or above of ammonium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite, which includes many cleaning products. Shops are also being recommended to comply with the Poisons Act and promote awareness to staff. Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, Victoria Adams, said: ""Acid attacks have a devastating impact on their victims, leaving both emotional and physical scars. I'm pleased that so many of the UK's major retailers are joining our fight to combat this scourge and signalling they are committed to selling acids responsibly."" The move has been welcomed by Jabed Hussain, who had a corrosive substance thrown in his face last summer. He was one of five victims to be burned in London on a single night of attacks and told Sky News the attack hurt him both physically and mentally. ""I'm scared to get out of my house, I'm scared to go to see my friends, I'm totally different after the incident,"" he said. He says more police are needed on the street to tackle the rise in acid attacks. ""The Government should go and chase them - who's doing this - the Government should provide enough police on the street and give them the power to chase them."" As well as national hardware and supermarket chains, smaller hardware stores are also being encouraged to sign up. Alan Hawkins, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association, told Sky News it is more of a challenge for smaller independent stores to control. ""It's harder for the smaller independents because if you're a larger company you're more likely to have computerised stocks and tills. On an independent level it is the shop owner who is going to have to understand the terms so it's about staff training."" Labour has welcomed the voluntary ban on under-18 sales - but Stephen Timms MP, who has led calls to do more to tackle acid attacks, says the Government must go further. ""I think what's happened is some people who're intent on committing crimes have worked out that it's less risky for them to do it with the help of an acid bottle that they're carrying than if they were carrying a knife or a gun because there are much clearer and stronger laws in place against carrying knives or guns than there are against carrying acid."" The Home Office says it is consulting on plans to make it illegal for under-18s to get hold of acids and an offence to carry such substances in public without good reason."

The man, whose name was not released, spread his excrement around the toilet facilities on Flight 895. FBI spokeswoman Staci Feger-Pellessier said there were no indications the incident was terror-related, and no injuries were reported. Ms Feger-Pellessier had initially stated that ""an unruly passenger had caused some kind of disturbance"" on the plane. According to Anchorage airport police lieutenant Joe Gamache, the man did not attempt to interfere with the flight crew or resist them, and was not expected to be arrested. ""We received a report of a passenger who had messed up the bathrooms with his own faeces,"" said Lt Gamache. Upon landing the man, who was shirtless, was interviewed. ""After the interviews were done, there were no appropriate charges for anything criminal,"" Lt Gamache said. A translator was needed to interview the 22-year-old, who was travelling on a Vietnamese passport and possessed a US permanent resident card. Lt Gamache said that the man's speech was either nonsensical or unintelligible to the translator. He has now been taken to a hospital for a mental health assessment. Hotel accommodation was provided for the other passengers on the flight, said United Airlines."
2018-01-06,Tens of thousands of addicts and vulnerable people are being warned about joining support groups on Facebook that claim to be anonymous but aren't.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180107063837/https://news.sky.com/story/addicts-warned-facebook-groups-are-not-anonymous-11197078,"Dozens of recovery groups for afflictions such as gambling addiction, sex addiction, alcoholism and drug abuse describe themselves as ""anonymous"" but are far from it, as entire membership lists are easily accessed by outsiders. ""Closed groups"" on Facebook can be found but you have to be a member to read posts or contribute to the community. A Sky News investigation found that ""anonymous"" recovery groups are not warning users that their profiles are on members lists, which are free to view and even searchable. Depending on a person's security settings, it is possible to see names, pictures, where a person lives, where they went to school and even where they work. In many cases the people that set them up were not aware of the privacy flaw. Many have since warned their communities and are calling for Facebook to create a new type of group. For members of the official Alcoholics Anonymous fellowship, the news is shocking and further vindicates their decision not to start a Facebook Group themselves. They are now warning addicts about the dangers of losing anonymity and how that can affect recovery. Peter, a spokesman for the fellowship and a former alcoholic, told Sky News: ""We don't condone [these groups] at all. ""We advise members that if they want to join a social media group they deliberately join one that doesn't have 'alcoholics anonymous' or any mention of our fellowship. ""Preferably not alcoholism in it at all. ""So the individual can protect their anonymity which we think is absolutely critical to an individual's recovery."" There are also concerns from the world of recruitment and business as people may not realise that companies or clients can find out this sensitive information. Corrine Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management, said: ""A third of HR people have said that they have rejected people precisely because of things that they've found on social media. So we know it affects people's chances. ""I think if you're on a self-help group, it's just giving an employer who doesn't know you, or have any relationship with you, a note of caution. ""They'll be thinking ""is this person troubled, are they distressed, does this affect their ability to do the job?'."" In some cases there can be legal implications. Groups for victims of rape and serious sexual assault are also claiming to be anonymous but aren't. Some experts say this can affect a person's legal right to anonymity. Facebook told Sky News it takes feedback very seriously. The company reiterated that there are three different types of group and the security for each is made clear online. But it also said it welcomes group administrators to next month's Facebook Communities Summit Europe, which will be held in London, and hoped the issue could be raised then for potential changes."

Coutinho will sign a five-and-a-half year contract and will have a buyout clause of €400m. He will fly to Barcelona and is expected to have a medical on Monday. The 25-year-old did not travel with the Liverpool squad for a winter training camp in Dubai and has not played in either of the side's games since the January transfer window opened because of a minor thigh problem. The Brazilian was the subject of three failed bids from Barcelona in the summer, the largest of which was worth £113m, and he handed in a transfer request in an attempt to force a move but was unsuccessful. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said it was ""no secret that Philippe has wanted this move to happen since July"". ""Philippe was insistent with me, the owners and even his teammates this was a move he was desperate to make happen,"" he added. ""Despite that, we managed to keep the player here beyond the summer window, hoping that we would be able to persuade him to stay and be part of what we are looking to do. ""I can tell the Liverpool supporters that we, as a club, have done everything within our means to convince Philippe that remaining part of LFC was as attractive as moving to Spain, but he is 100% certain his future - and that of his family - belongs at Barcelona."" Announcing Coutinho's transfer, Barcelona said the midfielder arrives at the Nou Camp ""after demonstrating his class as a player with Liverpool and the Brazilian national side"". Coutinho made 20 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool this season, scoring 12 goals. He was bought by Liverpool from Inter Milan for £8.5m in 2013."

The Historical Railways Estate which manages the tunnel on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT) has planned to block up the tunnel for good this summer because of its dangerous state. But local cycling enthusiasts have persuaded the DfT to hand over the £3m cost of concreting the tunnel shut if Bradford City Council can be persuaded to take it off their hands. Graeme Bickerdike from the Queensbury Tunnel Society believes the deal can be done. ""Is it sensible to take £3m of taxpayers money, covert it into concrete, and pour it into a black hole?"" he asked. ""Or do you use that money and invest it into transforming this structure into an asset that can be used to generate money?"" The group claims that the DfT cash will cover almost all of the cost of re-opening the tunnel, while the walking and cycling charity Sustrans has calculated that using it for recreation would boost the local economy by almost £40m over the next three decades. Norah McWilliam, the campaign leader and a keen cyclist, said linking the tunnel to a longer cycle network in the area would reduce car traffic and air pollution. ""And on top of that it's going to be exciting and somewhere where families want to visit,"" she added. A spokesman for Bradford Council said it is working out exactly what it will cost to reopen the tunnel. ""We appreciate the passion and commitment of the groups who want to see the tunnel re-opened as a cycleway and we hope to be in a better position to understand what would be involved financially in re-opening the tunnel later this year,"" he said."

The chain, which is privately owned by Sanpower, a Chinese conglomerate, is understood to have made the ""informal"" request in recent weeks, although it was unclear on Friday whether it had been communicated to landlords before or after its Boxing Day sale got underway. HoF is expected to publish details of its Christmas trading performance next week, when rival chains including Marks & Spencer and the John Lewis Partnership are also due to update investors and analysts. While Next, the clothing retailer, kicked off the flurry of festive trading statements with news on Tuesday, it was quickly overshadowed by a drastic profit warning from Debenhams, one of HoF's biggest competitors. A seasonal cold snap aided fashion chains but appears to have done little for general merchandise retailers amid cost pressures arising from increasing business rates, In a statement issued to Sky News on Friday evening, a HoF spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that we have contacted some of our landlords asking for their support as we drive forward with our transformation programme."" The state of HoF's finances has been the subject of speculation for months, and was not aided by Moody's, the ratings agency, which described the chain as ""a very high credit risk"" last month. That analysis partly explains why the company's bonds have been trading at around 90p in the pound, while The Times reported on Boxing Day that hedge funds have placed big bets on the value of listed retailers falling. The precise details of HoF's request to landlords, which was described by one source as ""informal"", was unclear on Friday. HoF declined to provide additional information about the revised terms it was seeking, or how many landlords or stores it affected. One industry source described it as ""a backdoor CVA"" - a reference to the formal court process through which retailers can secure rent reductions and shut loss-making stores. Toys R Us, the toy retailer, won approval for a CVA days before Christmas with landlords and other creditors agreeing to a plan that will see roughly a quarter of its British stores closing. Next and M&S are among other retailers who have grappled with their cost-bases by seeking rent reduction. Some analysts expect HoF to draw up plans for a number of store closures in the coming months. HoF announced in September that it had been handed an additional £15m of funding by Sanpower, with a further £10m committed by it towards a new distribution centre. Alex Williamson, who was recruited as the chain's chief executive from the Goodwood Estate last year, insisted in the autumn that he had ""high expectations"" for HoF's turnaround. ""My observations after a few weeks are that since Sanpower acquired the business in 2014 the primary focus has been on stabilising an enterprise that had been starved of investment for many years,"" he said. HoF is one of the high street's biggest employers, with a direct workforce of 5000 and 12,500 concession staff."

A spokesperson for the inquiry said KPMG had been appointed to provide ""limited planning and programme management"" during its ""start-up phase"". A statement released by the inquiry said: ""Following concerns expressed by some core participants, the inquiry team has discussed the contract with KPMG which has agreed that its work should now cease. ""The support and confidence of all core participants is integral to the work of the inquiry."" KPMG said it was confident there were no conflicts of interest between its work for the inquiry and its other clients, although the firm recognised that ""strength of opinion about our role risks undermining confidence"". A spokeswoman for the firm said: ""We have therefore mutually agreed with the inquiry that we will step down from our role with immediate effect. ""We were appointed to advise on structuring a project management office for the Grenfell Tower public inquiry. ""Our role was purely operational and advised on project management best practice and had no role advising on the substance of the inquiry. We will waive our fees for our work undertaken to date."" Pop star Lily Allen, politicians and academics, had earlier sent an open letter to Theresa May urging her to reverse the decision to appoint KPMG. They said they did not speak on behalf of Grenfell victims, but were ""deeply concerned over the obvious conflicts of interest"" posed by KPMG's involvement in the inquiry. The public inquiry into the fire, which killed 71 people, has been dogged by controversy since the appointment of retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick as its chairman. Survivors and bereaved families have lobbied for an overhaul of the inquiry's shape due to lingering doubts about his suitability for the role. It is hoped that evidence hearings will begin after Easter."

On the subject of the delays to NHS services, the PM told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show cancelling operations was ""part of the plan"". ""Of course we want to ensure that those operations can be reinstated as soon as possible, but it’s about making sure that those who most urgently need care are able to get that treatment when they need it,"" she said. Mrs May was challenged about the case of Leah Butler-Smith, who waited more than four hours in an ambulance with her mother - who had suffered a stroke - at Broomfield Hospital in Essex. She said she said that ""of course nothing's perfect and there is more for us to do"". :: NHS doctor: We are appalled by our own care ""We have planned for the winter pressures this year,"" she continued. ""We did put some more money in and there has been planning and hospitals have been dealing with it in different ways.""

NHS England figures showed the bed occupancy rate in hospitals reached 91.7% during the festive period - 85% is considered safe. Increased pressures on front-line services were mirrored in the NHS 111 service, which received a record 480,400 calls - up 21% from 396,300 in the previous week. Chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Janet Davies said the figures showed ""that almost every day last week, NHS hospitals in England were at bursting point""."

Michael Wolff, who has written the bestselling Fire and Fury: Inside The Trump White House, told the Mail on Sunday the 45th President's approach to foreign policy was ""simple"". :: Comb-overs and cheeseburgers: Top revelations from new book He said: ""You Brits suck up to him and enlist in whatever geopolitical fantasy he has going, he'll give you what you want - though only if it doesn't hurt him. ""It is not so much vengeance, rather 'you flatter me and I'll flatter you'. If the Brits give him what he wants he will value the Brits."" Speculation that Mr Trump could be snubbed for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's May wedding in Windsor has been rife since the couple announced their engagement. Ms Markle has previously described the President as ""divisive"" and a ""misogynist"", while Prince Harry is good friends with Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama. The Royal wedding claim is the latest in a string of extraordinary disclosures from Mr Wolff, who has been dismissed by Mr Trump as a ""fraud"" peddling a work of ""fiction"". In the Mail on Sunday interview, Mr Wolff also suggested the President did not know what Brexit was until two weeks before the 2016 referendum. And he raised the prospect of potentially awkward scenes if Mr Trump does come to Britain on his controversial proposed state visit, saying the Republican would ""try to Trumpalise the Queen and Buckingham Palace"" and that he saw the Queen ""in reality TV show terms"". Mr Wolff made fresh claims about the President's mental state in the interview, claiming some White House officials wondered whether he had learning disabilities, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or even dementia. ""They discuss it at the White House: his apparent inability to read one page or one paragraph. He can't even follow a PowerPoint,"" he told the newspaper. ""Everyone around him says the symptoms have got worse in the year he has been in office - his attention span has lessened, his verbal patterns are more peculiar."" The President has dismissed allegations he is unfit for the Oval Office and in a Twitter tirade on Saturday proclaimed himself to be a ""very stable genius"". On Sunday, he continued to attack Mr Wolff, describing his tome as a ""Fake Book"" from a ""totally discredited author"". It comes as British Prime Minister Theresa May brushed off concerns about Mr Trump's mental state. Mrs May said that in her dealings with him she had always found the President determined to act in the best interests of the US. On the subject of a visit to the UK by Mr Trump, she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""He will be coming to this country."" The PM did not say whether it would be a full state visit or simply a working trip to mark the opening of the new US embassy in London, which is expected to happen in February."

On Saturday, it had fallen to -38C (-37F), with a wind chill equivalent of -69C (-93F), tying it with Armstrong, Ontario, in Canada, as having the lowest temperature in the world. The coldest air temperature was recorded at -39C (-38F) in Eureka, Nunavut, in Canada and Jakutsk, Russia, but those places are not thought to have had low wind chills. Other New England locations also saw record lows. Burlington, Vermont, was -18.3C (-1F) and -34.4C (-30F) with wind chill; and Hartford, Connecticut, was -12.2C (10F) and -29C (-20F) with wind chill. The north eastern cities of Philadelphia and New York went down to -13.3C (8F) and Boston was a relatively balmy -12C (10F). Airports have been struggling to cope with a backlog of flights, as the record-breaking temperatures have frozen parts of the US and Canada. The region is in the grip of an Arctic blast with a storm that has brought snow, hurricane-force winds and coastal flooding. Temperatures in many places have been so cold that authorities have warned residents that they risk frostbite if their skin is exposed for just 10 minutes. The weather has also caused chaos at some of the region's airports, with more than 3,420 flights (within, into or out of the US) delayed on Saturday. One of the worst-affected was New York's John F Kennedy Airport, which struggled to cope with the backlog of planes and passengers. People on an Air China flight from Beijing had to wait on the tarmac for seven hours before being allocated a gate, according to a tweet from flight tracking site Flightradar24.

Some flights did not even try to get that far - at least two (from Vienna and Frankfurt) turned back over the UK and Ireland due to the problems at JFK, according to FlightRadar24. A flight from Moscow turned back over Iceland and other flights diverted to other US airports.

Later it said that flights were being limited into JFK for the rest of the evening, adding that the surge in flights rescheduled after the storm had combined with the weather-related damage to equipment to delay passengers and flights.

Worboys, a former stripper and adult film star, was convicted of 19 counts of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 female passengers, in one case raping a woman, between 2002 and 2008. The Parole Board's decision has caused dismay among victims, with some only finding out about his release through media reports. Questions have also been raised as to why all of the 102 complainants did not see their cases brought to court. In the wake of the decision, a victim told Sky's Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt that after the trial victims were assured Worboys would never be released. The Prime Minister said she knew one of his victims, who like many others had not been told about the Parole Board's judgement beforehand. ""So I recognise why people are so concerned about this,"" she said during an appearance on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""Obviously the Parole Board operates independently, but I think it's right that we as a Government are saying that we should look at the question of openness and that we should look at this whole issue too of how victims are kept in touch with what is happening."" The PM added: ""We want to ensure that victims feel confident enough to come forward so that they feel confident that the police will take action and confident that they will get justice. ""The Justice Department will be looking at that over the next couple of months, they'll be asking the question, 'Do we need to do things in a different way?' And, whatever the answer is, we'll do what is necessary."" Justice Secretary David Lidington has said he will look at ways to increase transparency. He said: ""While it is right that the Parole Board should remain an independent body, I believe that there is a strong case to review how to allow greater openness about the decision-making process. ""We also need to make sure arrangements across the criminal justice system ensure victims are both heard and, if they wish, kept informed about their case."" He said talks had been held ""about what changes we could make to help victims of crime and provide greater transparency about the Board's work"". Victims' groups would be spoken to as part of the review, Mr Lidington said, adding that work would start right away to make sure any decisions on changes can be taken before Easter. The Crown Prosecution Service has defended its decision not to pursue dozens of complaints against Worboys, saying many of them ""did not pass the evidential test"". Professor Nick Hardwick, chairman of the Parole Board, apologised ""unreservedly"" to victims who were ""failed by the system"". He is to face questions from MPs over the ""disturbing"" release of Worboys."

The network is used by MPs, peers and staff. It comes amid a sex scandal engulfing Westminster, which has seen Prime Minister Theresa May sack her de facto deputy Damian Green after an investigation found he made ""misleading"" statements about claims police found pornography on computers in his Commons office in 2008. Mr Green continues to deny ""unfounded and deeply hurtful"" claims he downloaded or watched the material. The figures have emerged following a freedom of information request by the Press Association. A spike in attempts to visit such sites was recorded in September, with 9,467 requests from both the Lords and Commons in that month. Despite the high numbers, parliamentary authorities say the majority of the attempts are not deliberate. The figure for the majority of 2017 is also a marked decrease on recent years. There were 113,208 attempts blocked by parliament's filtering system in 2016, down from 213,020 in 2015. Parliamentary authorities said they were unable to provide figures for January and February 2017 because of changes in technology and the way the data is held. The available data showed 30,876 attempts to access pornographic material from March to October 2017. During this time, parliament was dissolved from the end of April to early June before the snap election and MPs were away for the summer recess from the end of July to early September. A Parliamentary spokesman said: ""All pornographic websites are blocked by Parliament's computer network. ""The vast majority of 'attempts' to access them are not deliberate. The data shows 'requests' to access websites, not visits to them. ""There are 8,500 computers on the parliamentary network, which are used by MPs, peers, their staff and staff of both Houses. ""This data also covers personal devices used when logged on to Parliament's guest Wi-Fi."" A separate freedom of information request discovered that there were also at least 2,751,755 attempts to access blocked websites on the parliamentary network from January to October 2017."
2018-01-07,A 25-year plan to plant 50 million trees across the North of England has been backed by the Government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180108065129/https://news.sky.com/story/millions-of-trees-to-be-planted-to-create-north-of-england-forest-11198900,"The Northern Forest will connect five community forests across the north of the country, creating a band of native broadleaf trees such a oaks, and conifers like spruce and pine. Planting will span a 120-mile stretch along the M62 corridor between Liverpool and Hull, totalling 25,000 hectares of forest. With a Government contribution of £5.7m, the project is expected to cost a total of £500m with charities making up the rest of the sum. The woodlands will create a new habitat for wildlife including birds and bats, as well as endangered red squirrels. The project's backers say it could bring economic benefits, generating £2bn through boosting tourism and rural business, increasing property values and reducing the impacts of flooding. England is one of the least wooded countries in Europe. Forest coverage across the country is about 10%, according to the Woodland Trust, compared to about 36% across the continent. The organisation warned last year that the UK could be felling more trees than it was planting - the first time the balance had been tipped for decades, spelling bad news for climate change and conservation. It welcomed the Government's contribution to tree planting over the next decades. ""The Northern Forest will accelerate the creation of new woodland and support sustainable management of existing woods right across the area,"" Austin Brady, director of conservation at the woodland trust, said. ""Planting many more trees, woods and forests will deliver a better environment for all - locking up carbon on a large scale, boosting wildlife habitat and greening our towns and cities."" Trees have been lost to infrastructure and development projects, and a lack of tree-planting projects have meant few new woodlands are growing to replace them. The scheme's backers hope the project - part of the Government's 25-year environment plan - will help meet targets to cuts climate change emissions. The scheme will connect the five Community Forests in the north of England, the Mersey Forest, Manchester City of Trees, South Yorkshire Community Forest, the Leeds White Rose Forest and the HEYwoods Project. Woodland will be created in and around major urban centres such as Chester, Liverpool, Leeds, and Manchester. Planting will begin in March, at the Northern Forest's flagship site in Bolton."
2018-01-07,"An estimated 100,000 people lost their lives during the Battle of the Atlantic in World War Two, but the event does not have a dedicated national memorial in Britain.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180108065129/https://news.sky.com/story/opinion-why-the-battle-of-the-atlantic-needs-a-memorial-11199736,"Now, a charity - The Battle of the Atlantic Memorial - is launching a £2.5m fundraising campaign to build a memorial in Liverpool dedicated to those who died, as well as those who served and survived. The charity's chairman, Vice-Admiral Mike Gretton, whose father Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Gretton served during the battle as an Atlantic Escort Group commander, tells his story: I have been passionately involved in the scheme to erect a memorial to the Battle of the Atlantic for four main reasons. The campaign was absolutely critical to the outcome of World War Two as the merchant ships involved brought the food, fuel and other necessities to Britain, enabling the island to survive the U-Boats' blockade. They also carried the troops, weapons and ammunition to allow the Allies to use Britain as the base for recovering Continental Europe through Operation Overlord in Normandy. Churchill wrote: ""The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war. ""Never for one moment could we forget that everything happening elsewhere, on land at sea or in the air, depended ultimately on its outcome."" The Battle of Atlantic was also the longest campaign of the war, lasting from the outbreak until Victory in Europe. The toll was high on all sides; some 3,500 ships were sunk. 26,500 merchant sailors and 23,000 naval personnel lost their lives. Sixty percent of German submariners did not return to their home bases. Second, despite the vital importance of the campaign, there is no memorial to the Battle of the Atlantic in the UK, and the project team and I are determined to put that right. And to put it right while we still have some veterans with us - all in their 90s - as well as for the sake of the thousands of family members whose forebears fought in the Atlantic. Indeed, thirdly, I am one of those family members. My father, then Commander Peter Gretton, commanded a group of warships which escorted convoys to North America and back. Aged just 30 and 31, he commanded his B7 Escort Group from November 1942 to February 1944: This spanned the time in the spring of 1943 when he and his colleagues turned the tide against the U-Boats, resulting in their commander, Admiral Doenitz, having to withdraw his submarines - albeit temporarily - from the Atlantic. I am immensely proud of what my father achieved at such a young age, resulting in the award of three Distinguished Service Orders - one of which was for ramming a submarine on the surface earlier in the Mediterranean. The Allies' success could not have been achieved without people like him and countless others in merchant ships, naval vessels and maritime aircraft. And finally, we also believe in the importance of educating the public, and particularly the young, about the Battle of the Atlantic and its vital significance. It is also worth remembering that it was a campaign involving not only the British and Allied Merchant Navies, as well as all three Services from the British Armed Forces, but also Allied Armed Forces from countries such as Canada, Norway, Australia, the Soviet Union and the United States. However, adversaries Germany and Italy also suffered huge losses in the Atlantic, so more than 70 years on we feel it is right to commemorate those brave young sailors as well.We have chosen Liverpool as home for the memorial. It was from this city that the Battle of the Atlantic was coordinated. As well as the command Headquarters being there, many of the warships and merchant ships were based there too. It's against this backdrop that we embark on the challenge of raising the £2.5m needed to construct and establish the memorial on site, which will be between the western side of the Museum of Liverpool and the River Mersey. The time has come to finally recognise the defining battle of World War Two and those who fought in it. We hope the public will support us in our quest."
2018-01-07,"Theresa May is reportedly poised to appoint a ""Cabinet minister for no deal"" in a move that will delight hard-line Tory Brexiteers but dismay pro-Remain MPs.

Although the new minister is likely to be based in David Davis's Brexit department, the appointment is likely to be seen as another move to sideline him in Brexit negotiations. The veteran Brexit Secretary, 69, has already seen his top civil servant and chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, poached from his department by the PM and transferred to 10 Downing Street. Tipped for the new ministerial role is Steve Baker, an uncompromising Eurosceptic MP and leading figure in the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, who is already a junior minister in Mr Davis’s department. Although the holder of the new post would not be a full member of the Cabinet, he or she would attend Cabinet, in a move which Mr Davis’s allies are likely to see as a move to undermine him. The new ministerial appointment is said to be aimed at showing other European leaders and Tory Brexiteers that the UK is serious about leaving the EU without a deal if talks fail. Eurosceptics believe that appointing a “no deal minister” would help to win the UK a better Brexit deal, as it would show the EU that Mrs May is serious about walking away. But it is likely to infuriate the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, and other leading pro-Remain MPs, who are battling to avoid the UK’s economy falling off a ""cliff edge"" after Brexit. Senior Tories claim the PM will use her long-delayed reshuffle to promote more women and MPs from a black and minority ethnic background. The most senior ministers - Mr Hammond, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, recently appointed Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Mr Davis - will keep their jobs. But half a dozen other Cabinet ministers are expected to be sacked or moved and the aim is that the new Cabinet will meet for the first time in 10 Downing Street on Tuesday morning. Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, has been tipped to take the job of Damian Green, the former First Secretary of State who was sacked by Mrs May before Christmas after admitting lying about computer porn allegations. Justine Greening – comprehensive school-educated and anti-grammar schools - is widely expected to lose her job as Education Secretary. The Business Secretary Greg Clark is also thought to be on the move. In a shake-up of the junior ranks, Tory MPs are predicting promotion for women and MPs from ethnic minorities in what politicians claim is a move to throw off the ""pale, male and stale"" image of the Government. One minister told The Telegraph: ""If you are a woman in the 2015 intake stand by your phone - if you have been a minister of state since 2010 be prepared for bad news."""

Amid claims that Mr Maier did not actually write the tweet himself, Becker responded in the pages of German newspaper Welt am Sonntag: ""Now a party staff member is supposed to have written the tweet. ""That's what the AfD always does; it's their trick: put something out there in the world and then distance yourself from it."" Becker accused Mr Maier of deliberately abusing his son for his own political advantage. He said: ""An AfD official like Jens Maier doesn't say such things out of stupidity or fear"", adding that the tweet was designed to target those who would vote for him, who would ""lap it up."" Becker also called on the German public to fight against such comments. ""Racism can no longer be tolerated,"" he said. ""No one is punished, no one has to pay for it, and in the end, unfortunately, we hush it up. This must stop!"" Noah's mother, Barbara Becker, was married to Boris from 1993 to 2001. Bild newspaper reported on Thursday that Boris Becker was preparing to sue over Mr Maier's comments. So much love/respect for this guy...#NoahBecker pic.twitter.com/qJ1WZH0LOs His lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser told the newspaper: ""I have been retained to quickly take the necessary steps under criminal and civil law against MP Jens Maier on the basis of this clearly racist tweet."" Noah Becker told the German version of Vice magazine that it was far from the first time he had been called the word. He said: ""Something like that happens often - in the club or on the street. If the person is in front of me, then it hits me harder. ""Still, it is frustrating to see that people in positions of power today can still offend others like that. Others do it and it is scary."" The post prompted an outcry on social media and has since been deleted. According to German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, sources from within the AfD party have claimed Maier regrets the tweet being posted and intends to apologise to Noah Becker."

Gracie claims to have discovered that male international news editors were being paid 50% more than women in the same role. She writes: ""I am not asking for more money. I believe I am very well paid already - especially as someone working for a publicly funded organisation. I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally."" Based in China, Gracie says she was offered a ""big pay rise"" when she raised the issue but that it was still less than men in the same role. She claims that managers explained the disparity as being down to ""differences between roles"". ""I have been subjected to a dismayingly incompetent and undermining grievance process which still has no outcome,"" writes the journalist. Gracie - who revealed live on air in 2009 that she was paid £92,000 - says she intends to return to her former job in the BBC's TV newsroom ""where I expect to be paid equally"". The BBC published salaries of some of its biggest stars in July.  It revealed disparities between some presenters in similar roles - for example a £200,000 gap between Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce, who both present evening news programmes. Director general Tony Hall said at the time the BBC needed ""to go further and faster on issues of gender and diversity"". Gracie's letter claims many staff have since been negotiating internally for equal pay ""but managers still deny there is a problem"". She warns: ""This bunker mentality is likely to end in a disastrous legal defeat for the BBC and an exodus of female talent at every level."" Responding Gracie's claim, the BBC said: ""Fairness in pay is vital. A significant number of organisations have now published their gender pay figures showing that we are performing considerably better than many and are well below the national average. ""Alongside that, we have already conducted a independent judge led audit of pay for rank and file staff which showed 'no systemic discrimination against women'. ""A separate report for on air staff will be published in the not too distant future."""

It is also thought the PM is keen to restore some gender balance to her Cabinet and boost the number of women, as well as trying to balance the Tories' pro-Brexit and Remain factions. Around half a dozen ministers are expected to change jobs on Monday. :: Sky Views: Bring on the Cabinet reshuffle! Ahead of refreshing her top team, the PM was pressed on her own future, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr show that she wants to fight the next general election, due in 2022. When quizzed on whether she will still be in position the next time the country goes to the polls, she said: ""Obviously I serve as long as people want me to serve."" It has been suggested that Mr Green's old job of First Secretary of State could go to the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, though the current NHS winter crisis could now thwart his promotion hopes. Another candidate who has been tipped for Mr Green's job, which involved chairing several Cabinet committees, is the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, a long time ally of the PM. Although he was attacked for visiting Qatar during New Year rail fare increases and by Labour peer Lord Adonis over rail franchises, Mr Grayling and Mrs May were local councillors together before becoming MPs. Senior Whitehall sources have told Sky News they expect the four most senior members of the Cabinet - Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Boris Johnson and David Davis - to stay in the same job. Mr Hammond's survival as Chancellor will dismay and infuriate Brexiteer Tories, who claim his pro-Remain sympathies are leading him to do everything he can to sabotage Brexit negotiations. Amber Rudd is expected to stay at the Home Office, even though she is a close ally of the PM and could be a candidate to replace Mr Green, because it is claimed Mrs May sees her as protecting her own Home Office legacy. Boris Johnson is likely to survive at the Foreign Office despite a succession of blunders. Attempts to demote him to a new Brexit role have been dropped because of fears that he would quit and become a dangerous assassin. David Davis is said to be safe because, despite claims that he has grown weary and also fears he is being sidelined in Brexit negotiations, to move him mid way though his battles with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier would cause massive disruption. It is known that Sir Patrick McLoughlin, widely blamed for the Tories' poor general election performance in June, is to step down as Conservative Party chairman. The favourite to succeed him is the Home Office minister Brandon Lewis, who already attends Cabinet and is a local government protege of former Tory chairman Sir Eric Pickles. A fierce battle is raging, however, over the future of the Education Secretary Justine Greening, a comprehensive-educated opponent of the PM's flagship policy to bring back grammar schools. Ms Greening, along with Business Secretary Greg Clark and the Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom, are thought to be vulnerable, but could be shuffled to new jobs rather than sacked. The Sunday Telegraph reports that Ms Greening is fighting to hold on to her position, posting a series of tweets highlighting her achievements and twice declaring ""school standards are rising"". Mrs May is known to reward ministers she believes she can trust and who are reliable, which could mean promotion for allies like the Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire and the Culture Secretary Karen Bradley. Both were junior ministers under Mrs May at the Home Office. After Cabinet changes on Monday, the PM is expected to freshen up the junior ranks of the Government on Tuesday, letting go of some older and long-serving stalwarts and bringing in some MPs elected in 2015. The Prime Minister is also likely to promote a number of women MPs and some from ethnic minorities, in a bid - it is claimed - to give the Government a more modern image that better reflects UK society as a whole."

The writer and free schools pioneer has faced calls to quit after a string of crude and sexist comments on social media surfaced. He has been backed by the likes of Cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, but senior Labour MPs have called on Mrs May to act over his ""virulent misogyny"". When asked about Mr Young on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the PM said: ""Toby Young has done exceedingly good work in relation to free schools and that's what has led to him being appointed to the Office for Students. ""When he was appointed I was not aware of these comments that he had made. Frankly I'm not at all impressed by those comments. ""He's now in public office and as far as I'm concerned if he was to continue to use that sort of language and talk in that sort of way he would no longer be in public office."" Mr Young was named as a board member on the new watchdog by Mr Johnson's brother, Universities Minister Jo Johnson, on Monday. His previous posts include a 2012 tweet when he wrote watching Prime Minister's Questions: ""Serious cleavage behind Ed Miliband's head. Anyone know who it belongs to?"" A 2009 post read: ""What happened to Winkleman's breasts (sic) Put on some weight, girlie #comicrelief."" Mr Young said earlier this week that he regretted the ""sophomoric, politically incorrect remarks"", adding: ""I hope people will judge me on my actions."" There were more headlines about Mr Young in Sunday's newspapers, with the Mail on Sunday reporting that his social media comments included a sexual ""joke"" about starving children on Comic Relief. Mr Young told the paper that he had been a ""provocative journalist"" for three decades and part of that was saying ""controversial, sometimes outrageous things"" and that it was not surprising people were able to find material to embarrass him. He said all of the offensive messages were at least five years old and most much older, and that he was a changed man now, adding: ""I'm a more serious person now."" Sir Vince Cable said Mr Young's appointment was ""completely unsustainable"". ""This is a man who has a record of misogyny and backs eugenics, screening out people of supposedly low intelligence,"" the Lib Dem leader said. ""This shows bad judgement and, as the Prime Minister effectively admitted, a lack of due diligence. It seems all you need to survive is be a friend of Boris Johnson."""

The Prime Minister included a vow in the Conservative party's manifesto at the most recent general election to give the Commons the chance to have its say on the issue in a free vote. But speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mrs May said she had received a ""clear message"" on the subject and there will now not be a vote in this parliament, scheduled to last until 2022. ""As Prime Minister, my job isn't just about what I think about something, it's actually about looking at what the view of the country is. ""I think there was a clear message about that and that's why I say there won't be a vote on fox hunting during this Parliament."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove has made animal welfare issues a top priority since being appointed by the PM in the aftermath of June's election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly criticised Mrs May for saying she was in favour of fox hunting during the election, which dealt a near-fatal blow to her authority after the Tories lost their Commons majority. Anti-hunt Conservatives warned against offering a free vote during the campaign, with North Thanet MP Sir Roger Gale insisting politicians would have ""more than enough to occupy"" their time without considering ""yesterday's argument"" of repealing the Hunting Act. The animal protection campaign group Humane Society International welcomed Mrs May's decision. Its UK director Claire Bass said: ""It can never be acceptable in a modern, progressive society to sanction the chasing and ripping apart of a live animal for the sake of entertainment, and it is heartening that that message has been heard loud and clear. ""However, we cannot be complacent, so we encourage animal lovers to keep telling their MPs that they won't vote for cruelty, and to urge action by the government to clamp down on the illegal hunts still taking place."""

A survey of 2,000 married adults found more than a third (37%) said financial pressures were the biggest challenge to their marriage, while 22% said most of their arguments centred on money. Of those who said they had considered leaving their partner, a quarter (25%) said they stayed together because they were worried about their children and 24% were concerned about losing their home. Shockingly, more than a quarter (27%) of those surveyed admitted they had cheated but not told their partner, while 7% said they had carried the secret for more than 10 years. Nearly one in 10 (8%) said they were likely to sleep with someone other than their partner in 2018. Recent data from the Office for National Statistics showed there was a 5.8% increase in divorces between heterosexual couples in 2016 compared with the previous year. Overall, 42% of marriages now end in divorce, with the average marriage now lasting 12 years. Relate, one of the UK's biggest relationship charities, said it receives a peak in calls in January as issues within a marriage or a long-term relationship come to a head over Christmas. In January 2017, Relate received a 24% increase in calls to their helpline compared with the average month, and councillors expect to see a similar peak this year. Relate's chief executive Chris Sherwood said: ""The reality is that many of the calls we receive in January are from couples who are already at crisis point after existing relationship tensions have come to a head over Christmas. ""With one in five people in the UK in a 'distressed relationship', we'd urge anyone who isn't getting on with their partner to seek support as early as possible."""

At the Sydney Cricket Ground, spectators removed their shirts as they watched the fifth Ashes Test between Australia and England. The greater Sydney area was given a severe fire danger rating, local media reported, while much of the rest of the state was issued with a very high rating.

Or would you lie a newborn baby on one? Of course not. But currently, many businesses are allowing hundreds of thousands of disabled people in the UK, along with my seven-year-old son, Hadley, to endure just that. Hadley, has cerebral palsy and is a full-time wheelchair user. His disability means that he cannot stand unaided and is not always able to control his bowel and bladder. He needs to lie down to have his clothes and underwear prepared before being transferred to the toilet or to have his continence items changed. Without a safe, clean, changing bench to do this, there is little option but to use a toilet floor. This is a heart-wrenching thing for any parent to subject their child to. It is undignified, dangerous and painful for both of us and regularly reduces us to tears. The only other option is to let him sit in his own bodily waste! What is just as upsetting, is that there is an answer to this widespread problem that huge multinational businesses are refusing to provide for their customers: a Changing Places toilet - a large accessible toilet with an adult-sized changing bench and hoist. By not including these facilities in restaurants, shopping centres, supermarkets, sports venues, cinemas, leisure attractions etc, businesses are choosing to exclude us. The stress that this puts on my family is tremendous. Petition calling on UK's largest supermarkets to take responsibility & commit to providing #changingplaces toilets in ALL their stores has almost 150,000 supporters but still none of have agreed to make changes. #journorequest #prrequest https://t.co/2Wh3sOtF7t We have to plan every outing with military precision, knowing exactly where we are able to use a toilet at any given moment. There are only just over 1000 Changing Places toilets in the UK. Which sounds like a lot, until you find out that there are millions of toilets in the UK that other members of the public can use - 600 in The Shard alone! We have to miss out on many activities that most people take for granted because if there isn't a toilet my son can use, we know we are likely to have to leave early or not visit at all. Or what should be a pleasant day out, is ruined because of another horrendous toilet floor. Hadley is very aware that this is grossly unfair and that is he being treated terribly. When you witness your child sobbing and begging you not to lay him down on a stinking toilet floor, it is very hard to stay positive. I lay awake at night worrying about what this is doing to his mental health and mine. The harsh reality is, we now rarely go out at all for fear of the conditions we will find. A story that is all too common for so many. As a nation, we don't like talking about wee, poo or periods and I believe this is making the battle for Changing Places one of the most ignored fights for equality in recent times. I wanted to do something to try to break the taboo around toileting and get these issues further into the public eye. After all, we all have to pee (on average eight times per day). Some people just need a little more help than others. So, on 1 December 2017, #LooAdvent was born. For 24 days, I posted a photograph of myself using the toilet, dressed in different festive costumes, trying to reach as many people as possible with our message. Some said I have no dignity. I say, lying on a toilet floor covered in other people's urine is way more undignified and I'm willing to do anything to stop that! I hoped that it would reach decision makers, MPs, businesses and other people who need Changing Places, and that in turn, that might result in more toilets my son and others can use. The reaction was incredible. Whilst there have been no new facilities as a result as yet, the reach was beyond my expectations. Media coverage across press, radio and TV and numerous celebrity supporters. Even some toilet selfies from the team at The Last Leg and from Paralympians, Hannah Cockcroft MBE and Anne Wafula Strike in solidarity. It was so successful, that I've decided to embark on a new social media challenge. #ShameOnLoo will see me taking selfies on some of the worst toilet floors I've had the displeasure to experience. The first of which was taken in a McDonald's restaurant. A small, cramped, inadequate and vile accessible toilet with a door that didn't even close. In a statement, McDonald's said: ""We're sorry for this customer's experience. Hygiene and safety is of paramount importance to us; all of our toilets are checked frequently and cleaned whenever necessary and the floors are mopped regularly throughout the day."" It's clear that disabled people are not valued by so many businesses. But why not? The purple pound is worth £2.49bn per year. So if businesses won't install Changing Places because it is the right thing to do, why are they not installing them because it makes business sense?"

The SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch told The Sunday Times Scotland that, while an outright ban is the answer to combating the items' environmental damage, a levy would go some way towards solving the problem. ""In the battle against plastic straws I certainly think that a disincentive, such as a levy, should be considered,"" she said. ""The problem won't go away on its own. We have already seen how a levy works on plastic bags and there's been more attention recently on MPs' call for a levy on plastic cups."" :: Ocean Rescue: UK needs plastic bottle deposit return scheme, MPs say Ms Forbes added: ""Retailers such as Starbucks have committed to trialling a levy on plastic cups in certain stores, so I can't see why they couldn't do the same with plastic straws. ""The vast majority of people don't need and don't want a plastic straw with their drink, but pubs and restaurants automatically give them one. ""Alternatives to plastic straws exist for those that need to use a straw so in the long run a levy will not disadvantage anybody and could be the fastest way to ban plastic straws."" :: Disappearing sea ice could lead to collapse of vital polar food chain The Scottish Government is looking at options to reduce single-use plastic items like straws. It follows its decision last year to implement a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles to encourage their recycling. Last week, Westminster's Environmental Audit Committee called for a ""latte levy"" - a 25p surcharge on a disposable coffee cup. The campaign to phase out the use of plastic straws has gained momentum around the world, prompting a review of their use, particularly in bars and restaurants. :: Call to scrap 490 tons of plastic wrap on supermarket cucumbers JD Wetherspoon and All Bar One are among the chains that no longer put a plastic straw in a drink automatically. From this month, Wetherspoon is using biodegradable paper straws to replace the plastic versions, which it claims will prevent up to 70 million plastic straws ending up in landfill or in the world's oceans. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the move, pointing out that a plastic straw takes up to 500 years to decompose."

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Every single effort that RMT has made to reach negotiated settlements in these separate disputes with the different train operating companies over safe operation and safe staffing has been kicked back in our faces and we are left with no option but to press ahead with the action. ""No one should be in any doubt, these disputes are about putting the safety of the travelling public before the profits of the private train companies."" The disruption to services is as follows: :: Northern says it will run around 1,350 services on strike days, more than half its normal timetable, with most running between 7am and 7pm. :: SWR plans to run more than 70% of its normal weekday service of 1,700 trains, although there will be rail replacement buses and arrangements to have tickets accepted on other train companies. :: Greater Anglia plans to run a normal service with no alterations. :: Merseyrail will run a reduced service, mostly between 7am and 7pm, with a break during the middle of the day and no trains on the Kirby, Ellesmere Port or Hunts Cross lines. Arriva Buses will accept Merseyrail tickets on all three strike days covering the Northern and Wirral lines. Southern, which is facing its 39th RMT strike today, plans to run a normal service on most routes, but advised passengers to check for any last-minute changes before they travel. Mr Cash, of the RMT, has written to Transport Secretary Chris Grayling proposing a summit with the Department for Transport, the train companies and the union. The RMT said the meeting could consider how the principles of the agreements the union has reached in Scotland and Wales, which will keep guards on new trains, can be applied to the current disputes while meeting any concerns the Department for Transport and train companies have about future train services. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald called on Mr Grayling ""to take up"" the proposal for a summit ""in the interests of passengers"". A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""This is a dispute between a private company and the RMT. ""However, the Transport Secretary recognises the disruption caused to passengers and has met with union leaders on several occasions, including as recently as December, to help bring an end to the strikes. ""He offered guarantees of employment to members who currently fulfil the role of the second person on the train beyond the length of the franchises - instead the RMT called strikes on five train companies to cause maximum disruption to passengers. ""Nobody is losing their job as a result of driver-controlled operation trains - employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries for several years."""
2018-01-07,Stock markets around the world have started 2018 where they left off in 2017.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180108065129/https://news.sky.com/story/record-highs-on-the-stock-market-but-will-it-last-11196759,"On Wall Street, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are all trading at all-time highs. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 is at levels last seen at the end of 1991, while elsewhere in Asia the Hang Seng in Hong Kong is just 4% below its all-time high and the Kospi Composite index in South Korea just 2% off its record close. The ASX in Australia is also at an all-time high. And in Europe, the Dax in Germany is close to its all-time high, the Cac 40 in France has today hit a new record, as has the FTSE 100 in Britain. In short, the picture is buoyant almost everywhere. The FTSE World All-Share Index, which rose by 22% last year, has already risen by a further 2% in 2018 while the MSCI World Index, which rose by 20% last year, is also up by almost 2% so far this year. But what is behind these record-breaking moves - and can the good times continue to roll? The main reason for the spectacular run has been solid economic growth around the world. For the first time since the financial crisis, the economies of the US, China, Japan and Europe have enjoyed a period of synchronised growth that, crucially, also looks reasonably sustainable. That has translated into stronger earnings growth - optimism over which is the key factor that drives share prices higher. Another factor driving markets, again resulting from greater optimism, is mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. The end of 2017 in particular saw three enormous deals that touch all parts of the globe, with the US health store chain CVS paying $69bn (£50.9bn) for the US health insurer Aetna; Disney agreeing to buy the filmed entertainment and TV assets of 21st century Fox for $66bn (£48.6bn) and the Westfield shopping centre empire being acquired for $25bn by Franco-Dutch rival Unibail-Rodamco. There's also an enormous hostile takeover in the works at the moment, with the chipmaker Broadcom seeking to buy its rival Qualcomm for a jaw-dropping $130bn (£95.8bn), while all the signs are that M&A activity will continue to be strong in 2018. This is particularly the case in the US, where the Trump tax cuts have given companies a lot more money to play with, while Chinese companies continue to be acquisitive everywhere. In Europe, where M&A in 2017 grew even more strongly than in the US, continued economic growth should also ensure a continued appetite from businesses to buy competitors. However, with many stock indices already at record levels and valuations looking stretched, it is easy to see why there is a lot of anxiety among investors. In fairness that has been the case for quite a while, with the bull market in the US shortly to enter its tenth year, making it one of the longest in history. In the UK, while markets have not enjoyed quite the same meteoric growth - the FTSE 100 actually suffered reverses in each of 2011, 2014 and 2015 - there is also unease at the strength of the rally during the last two years and whether it can be sustained. This is not all that surprising. Markets, in the jargon, always climb a ""wall of worry"" and it is perfectly rational for investors to be wary after such a long period of gains. Mark Dampier, head of research at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, was saying as long ago as October 2016 that this was the ""most hated"" bull market he had seen in his near 35 years in the investment industry. Investors who decided to head for the sidelines at that time have since missed out on 15% gain for the FTSE 100 - even more if dividends are taken into account. It is not just investors in the UK who have been warily sitting out the rally. The Wall Street Journal reports today that, since 2012, American investors have withdrawn $1tn (£740bn) from mutual funds. It says the proportion of Americans who own shares has fallen from 62% prior to the global financial crisis to just 54% today. Intriguingly, fewer companies have been coming to market as well, pointing to possible wariness among the owners of businesses as well. The last year in which the number of shares in publicly listed US companies actually rose was as long ago as 2010, since when, the number of shares in issue has shrunk. That partly reflects M&A activity and record amounts of share buy-backs, but also points to company owners preferring to stay private. Yet the rally, particularly in the US, is clearly in its late stages. After nine years of a bull market, some kind of reversal is inevitable. Central banks around the world are beginning to tighten monetary policy everywhere, gradually bringing the age of ultra-cheap money to an end, although interest rates will still remain at very low levels, by historic standards, until at least the end of the current decade. Likewise, valuations do look stretched and will require meaningful improvements in company earnings to remain justified, although respected commentators such as David Kostin, the chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, argue that a combination of above-trend growth in the US and elsewhere, coupled with the Trump tax cuts, mean the US bull market will continue in 2018. Valuations are equally stretched in bond markets and, without quantitative easing to support the latter, they are likely to lurch downwards in sympathy if equity markets take a tumble. However, you want a really worrying sign, it is this. The renowned British investor Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of US fund manager Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, has just said there could be spectacular ""melt-up"" that might push up stock prices by a further 50% at some point during the next six months to two years before the bubble finally bursts. Mr Grantham, who is famed for getting out before the end of the dot-com boom in 2000 and the global financial crisis in 2008, has long argued that markets are over-valued. Bull markets tend to end when the final bear turns bullish."
2018-01-08,"It was, predictably enough, in a pub opposite the EU headquarters where Nigel Farage 'debriefed' the media.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/nigel-farage-reveals-details-of-meeting-with-eus-brexit-negotiator-michel-barnier-11200281,"A significant number of us (also predictable) had gathered to hear the outcome of what was, on the face of it, an unusual meeting. Mr Farage had spent the previous 45 minutes inside the nerve centre of the European Union, the organisation he's spent decades trying to destroy, meeting a man for whom the EU is a fundamental force for good - Michel Barnier, the bloc's Brexit negotiator. He'd written to Mr Barnier back in October requesting the meeting. ""As you appear to be conducting a series of meetings with UK political figures on the issue of Brexit, I wish to make a request,"" he wrote. ""It seems that you are listening to a group of people who want to stop or delay Brexit. I will come to speak for the 17.4 million who did not vote for a transition deal or any further delays and whose resolve is getting stronger."" :: Farage meets Barnier: 'Brexit talks will continue to be difficult Mr Farage was worried that Mr Barnier was hearing only one side of the Brexit story - and it wasn't the Brexit side. Meetings with high-profile remainers like Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis, Ken Clarke and others helped to push that fear. In truth, Mr Barnier does meet people and hear the views of people on both sides of the Brexit divide - not least his opposite number David Davis, the Brexit Secretary and a firm Brexiteer. Still, the meeting was duly granted at the start of a week when Mr Barnier will also meet other Brexiteers including Steven Woolfe MEP (formerly of UKIP, now independent), Lord Digby Jones (former director of the CBI), John Mills (chair of Labour Leave) and John Longworth (co-chair of Leave Means Leave). It was off-camera and Mr Farage said no photos were taken. So, how did it go? ""I always said he would be very civil and indeed he was very civil. Coffee was offered which I thought was very nice…"" said a beaming, trilby-sporting Mr Farage, as he emerged from the meeting. ""I genuinely don't think he understands why people voted for Brexit, I really don't think he gets it. When I suggested to him that it might be something to do with open door immigration from within the EU, he almost looked at me with incredulity as if to say 'well surely wasn't it outside the EU migration that was the issue'. He didn't understand that. ""Was it a fruitful meeting?"" I asked him. ""Well I genuinely thought that the views of the 17.4m had not been expressed before to Mr Barnier and the meeting confirmed that, yes,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody has been to see him to really make that point that immigration was front and centre of that campaign. It was what motivated millions of people who don't normally vote to go out in the referendum and basically, where have we got to in terms of our debate in terms of our debate, our negotiations - I'll tell you, nowhere."" Mr Farage continued: ""I asked him - 'Who do you represent? Do you represent Brussels?' Do you represent these glass and steel structures? ""Do you represent the people here - you know, 10,000 people here earning more than the British Prime Minister with pensions and all the rest of it? Is that what you represent or do you represent the workers in the member states?' Of course he said, they are both the same thing. I am not so sure they are."" A German reporter snapped back: ""Who do you represent then? What are you doing?'"" ""Well, umm, I am trying to represent the view of those who voted Brexit because it's not really being heard. You know we didn't vote for transition deals. ""We didn't vote to sort of kick this into the long grass so that it's at least going to be six years from Brexit that we can sign a trade deal with anyone else or have any degree of control over our borders with the rest of the EU."" We don't know what Mr Barnier thought of the meeting. He's said nothing."
2018-01-08,Officials from both North and South Korea have begun their first formal talks in more than two years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/north-and-south-korea-begin-efforts-to-thaw-relations-in-formal-talks-11200813,"The meeting is being held at the village of Panmunjom, which sits on the border between the two nations. On the agenda is the North's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and efforts to thaw relations between the two countries. The meeting comes at a time of heightening tensions that has seen the most bellicose rhetoric from both the North and the US in living memory. Recently, leaders have openly compared the size and effectiveness of their nuclear ""buttons"" to the dismay and alarm of hundreds of millions. :: The questions South Korea really wants to ask North Korea Those expecting an easing of tensions to follow these talks may need to manage their expectations. They follow an olive branch invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in an unusual New Year address in turn accepting a conciliatory gesture from the South's new President Moon Jae-in, who invited Pyongyang to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics. But a lot more than sport may be motivating Mr Kim. He may be seeking to exploit tensions between the South and its patrons, the US, under Donald Trump. Mr Moon has openly differed with Trump by arguing for economic and diplomatic co-operation with North Korea, as the American president pushed for the opposite, over the isolated state's continuing missile and nuclear tests and progress towards a nuclear missile capable of hitting the US mainland. South Korea's President also angered the Americans by claiming they had given him a veto over any US military action against the North. Kim Jong Un will use these talks to drive a wedge between the South and the US hoping to divide them further. He will hope that will make it harder for sanctions to be tightened against his regime. Sanctions, in particular Chinese restrictions on some fuel imports, are thought to be making life increasingly difficult for the Kim regime. But he will also hope it makes preemptive military action against the North less likely. Reports from Washington suggest policymakers and military planners are now preparing for what was previously unthinkable, a first strike US military operation against the North. That would most likely lead to a North Korean retaliation that would in turn kill tens of thousands in South Korea. Some Trump officials have indicated that may be a price they are prepared to pay. A rapprochement between the North and South may ironically increase tensions over the by alienating an easily offended President Trump."
2018-01-08,Morrisons said it enjoyed strong Christmas and New Year trading as like-for-like retail sales rose 2.1% in the ten weeks to 7 January.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/morrisons-reports-strong-trading-over-christmas-period-11200888,"The Bradford-based retailer - the first major supermarket to reveal how it performed over the recent festive period - said it had kept a lid on prices for shoppers despite higher commodity costs. It added that sales of its ""Best"" premium products were up by a quarter, new home and leisure ranges were proving popular and online sales grew 10%. Shares opened 4% higher. The figures come after monthly data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed a stark disparity between the performance of supermarkets and non-food retailers, as squeezed shoppers prioritised essentials such as food leaving less left over for Christmas gifts. In its update, Morrisons said overall group like-for-like sales were up by a better-than-expected 2.8%, boosted by a wholesale deal with convenience store chain McColl's. The company said performance was ""especially strong over the Christmas and New Year period"" with store sales up 2.8% and group sales up 3.7% in the six weeks to 7 January. Morrisons said it had become more competitive despite the increase in its buying costs - which have risen for many UK businesses after the collapse in the pound following the Brexit vote made imports more expensive. ""Despite input cost pressures on many commodities, the price of a basket of key Christmas items was the same as last year,"" the company said. Chief executive David Potts - who has been credited with turning around the performance of the business - said: ""More and more customers found more things they wanted to buy at competitive prices at Morrisons this Christmas."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said by keeping down prices it was likely to have taken a hit on profit margins or squeezed its suppliers. Elsewhere, Majestic Wine's chief executive Rowan Gormley said it had performed ""brilliantly"" over the key Christmas period, with like-for-like retail sales up 1.3% while it maintained its profit margin at the same level as last year. He said it showed the business's ""winning formula"" worked ""even when times are tough"". Those comments reflect a difficult environment for retailers as consumers are squeezed by higher inflation and weak wage growth - meaning that in real terms, their pay is falling. Figures from the BRC also out on Tuesday showed UK retailers saw a 0.6% like-for-like sales rise in December but the report highlighted how the ""severe pressure"" on spending was weighing heavily on some firms much more than others. It said that for the three months to December, food sales were up 2.6% but non-food sales saw their worst decline since March 2009 - at the height of the financial crisis - with a fall of 1.9%. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark. ""With inflation outpacing income growth, shoppers continued to see more of their spending power absorbed by essential items, including food, leaving less left over for buying Christmas gifts."" Tesco and Sainsbury's are due to report Christmas trading figures later in the week. Their share prices were both ahead after the Morrisons update. Investors were also responding to industry data from Kantar Worldpanel showing that shoppers spent an additional £1bn in grocery stores over the 12 weeks to 1 January - trading up to more expensive items despite tightening budgets. Tesco was the fastest growing of the major supermarkets, according to Kantar."
2018-01-08,"Unless you have a spare £810 for an asymmetric cardigan by Stella McCartney, a flick through the Sunday style supplements has the potential to enrage most of us.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/hypebeast-teens-making-a-fortune-from-fashion-11200820,"High fashion is often overpriced and impractical - and few of us can afford it. As a result, over the past decade, brands like Givenchy and Louis Vuitton have been keen to try and tap into new audiences, and the ""hypebeast"" scene is a designer label's dream. For those unfamiliar with what a ""hypebeast"" is, the hype part refers to wearing the most exclusive clothes that everyone's talking about. The beast part is meant to indicate an obsession. The term was originally meant as an insult among teenagers for those who looked faintly ridiculous dressed top-to-toe in expensive designer gear. Supreme, Palace, BAPE, Kanye West's brand Yeezy and Off-White are the key names to be seen in; all street-wear brands that produce limited-edition runs which are hard to get your hands on. For those who do not understand this world, spending hundreds on a white T-shirt with a small logo on it might sound like a vain waste of money, but it is the hypebeasts that might be having the last laugh. Many savvy young teenagers are making fortune online, often queuing in the rain for hours to buy items on the day they're released in store, showing their ""garms"" off by posing in them that day on Instagram, then immediately selling them on at a profit on eBay. Ari Petrou has made a career out of it. He has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and calls himself the UK's biggest hypebeast.  Got Bape on my back with some Act on me 🦍✨ Today’s denim @dsrcv petrou10 for a discount 💰 📸 @bxnmxclean A post shared by  UK’s Biggest Hypebeast 🇬🇧 (@aripetrou) on Jan 7, 2018 at 8:00am PST He said: ""Basically I take pictures, promote clothes and buy and sell clothes for a living. ""I started doing it because I wasn't making enough money out of my job and someone told me I could make money by buying shoes. ""I ended up making more doing that once or twice a week then working my job - so I quit. ""I have multiple sponsors from companies in Hong Kong now and massive companies in the States who pay me thousands to post pictures in their clothes and say 'this is what I'm wearing today'. ""It's got to the point where now I can just pay a kid to queue to get me the latest stuff, maybe £10, while I stay at home in my bed. ""The younger generation, they are just all doing it because it's like a hobby and you make money from it. ""Now I see so many groups of school kids that will go to shops like Supreme all together, it's like their day out, and they've all made like £100 or £200, and they are 13-year-old kids. ""There are people that are like from bad backgrounds that have gone from selling drugs to selling clothes. It is a legitimate business."" In truth, those who can be bothered with the effort often earn their money. In order to buy Supreme's latest collection on the day it is released, you first need to understand where to queue and when. On Monday, those in the know will be emailed about a secret location where they will go to be given a number which determines their position in the queue for the ""drop"" on Thursday. It is a complicated system but the only fair way the shop has found to stop kids from camping out overnight to be first in line. Supreme, in particular, enjoys making fun of how obsessed people are buying its limited runs. A basic clay brick - which went on to sell for £1,000 on eBay - is one of the more ridiculous items it has sold. As Ari explains, it is fun but also an investment. ""I have Supreme toothbrushes, torches, shovels even, which obviously I don't care but I know I am pretty much one of the only people to have it,"" he says. ""Stuff like that, it is worth way more than I paid for it. Maybe I pay £1,000 for my collection and in two years' time it is worth three, four, five thousand."" The roots of this scene started out with trainers. Influencer Vivian Frank has made a career out of buying and selling them. He is the man behind two of the biggest Facebook groups in the UK for buying and selling sneakers: Sneaker Myth, which has more than 60,000 members, and Yeezy Talk, which has 150,000. ""I was into trainers and social media, I started buying a few shoes and eventually ended up creating my own platform,"" Vivian says. ""Reselling is like a culture, there is a community around it. There are sneaker events, Facebook groups, I made most of my friends through sneakers, it's like a family sort of thing."" Vivian says the key to making money is understanding which brands to invest in. ""For example, when I was in high school, I got a pair of shoes for £220 and they are like £7,000 now,"" he adds. ""I don't come from a rich background, now I can buy a nice car and whatnot. I even help my parents out when they need money.""

2018-01-08,Theresa May's mostly unchanged Cabinet will meet today after a reshuffle that did not quite go to plan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-to-meet-cabinet-after-reshuffle-plans-backfire-11200817,"A notable absence will be Justine Greening, who quit the Government after refusing to shift from her role as Education Secretary to the Department for Work and Pensions. Later, she tweeted: ""Social mobility matters to me and our country more than my ministerial career."" Sources close to the departing minister told Sky News: ""She should have absolutely expected to continue. She saw people who've been massively disloyal, others not competent, allowed to stay in Cabinet and even get expanded briefs."" The PM's attention will now turn to junior ministers, as last night some within her party questioned what the point was of the changes thus far. Nicholas Soames, MP for Mid Sussex, tweeted: ""Is that it? I don't mean to be rude or to be seen to be disloyal but there needs to be a major improvement to the reshuffle tomorrow."" :: Cabinet reshuffle - Who's in and who's out Today's more junior appointments will signal who the Prime Minister sees as rising stars within the party. These supporting roles are coveted by new intake MPs wanting to get a foot on the ministerial ladder. Ms Greening's departure was the biggest upset yesterday after the Prime Minister kept all the political big beasts in her Cabinet in place, including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Even the replacement of Damian Green as First Secretary of State did not happen as David Lidington took on many of his responsibilities without the title. Jeremy Hunt was another minister who refused to budge after being offered a swap to Business Secretary. Instead, he increased his role - his job title changed from Health Secretary to Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. :: What the newspapers say about the Cabinet reshuffle Critics will regard it as a sign of weakness that the PM did not feel able to impose any significant change in the most senior ranks. Business Secretary Greg Clark, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom were all tipped for demotions but kept their roles. Newspapers were also over-briefed for changes that so far have not transpired, such as a ""no deal"" Brexit minister. The adjusting of titles added to the sense of tinkering. Sajid Javid expanded his job title, adding the housing to his role as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Last night, Jeremy Corbyn told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party: ""You can't make up for nearly eight years of failure by changing the name of a department."" :: Analysis from Sky's Political Editor on May's reshuffle However, leading doctors have welcomed Downing Street's decision to merge health and social care. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""We support the bringing together of health and social care into the portfolio of one minister as we recognise that what happens to patients in the NHS is profoundly impacted by the state of social care."" In an embarrassing twist, Mr Hunt was forced to explain why he had ""liked"" a tweet stating that Ms Greening had left the Government. Mr Hunt tweeted: ""Like button pressed by accident. Justine was an excellent minister and will be a great loss to govt."" Other changes included David Gauke taking over the role of Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary. Esther McVey was eventually given the vacancy at the Department of Work and Pensions. Karen Bradley took on the role of Northern Ireland Secretary vacated by James Brokenshire for health reasons. Digital minister Matt Hancock takes over as Culture Secretary. Brexit Secretary David Davis, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox all remain in the same jobs. Downing Street said the reshuffle was seen by Mrs May as ""an opportunity to refresh the Government and to give added impetus to the PM's reform agenda while continuing to deliver on Brexit"". But Liberal Democrat chief whip Alistair Carmichael said the whole affair could be summed up in the PM's previous comment that ""nothing has changed"", adding: ""Theresa May wanted to reassert her authority but has come out of this looking weaker than ever."""
2018-01-08,"Bristol Zoo is celebrating after an endangered insect has laid eggs, raising hopes for the future of the species. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/endangered-stick-insects-breed-at-bristol-zoo-11200334,"Two Lord Howe stick insects - which were once thought to have gone extinct - have produced eggs. The pair were themselves the product of a breeding programme, despite the species being ""incredibly difficult"" to look after. The zoo says its is first time a second generation of eggs has ever been laid outside of the creatures' native Australia. Bristol Zoo were sent the first batch of eggs of the insect, nicknamed 'tree lobsters', in 2015, when 300 arrived from Melbourne Zoo. The eggs were flown in carefully packaged batches of 50, placed in sterilised sand, and transported in a climate-controlled part of a cargo hold. In three years, zoo keepers have worked with San Diego Zoo and Toronto Zoo to save the species. The larvae of six of the 300 eggs managed to reach adulthood. Those six then produced larvae of their own. Five of these subsequent babies also reached adulthood, and two of those have now produced eggs of their own. Fully grown adults are wingless and nocturnal and can only eat one species of a plant which has to be specially grown by horticulturists at the zoo. Since 2002, the insect has been categorised as 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) whose red list tracks species numbers in the world. It originates on Lord Howe Island, a remote island about 300 miles off the coast of eastern Australia. They were thought to have been driven to extinction after black rats invaded their habitat from a British supply ship stranded in 1918. A small colony was found in 2001 on Ball's Pyramid, a volcanic outcrop 12 miles offshore from Lord Howe Island. There are now an estimated 20-30 of the insects left. Mark Bushell, Curator of Invertebrates at Bristol Zoo, called the new eggs ""one of our biggest achievements"". He said: ""We had our suspicions that the females might soon lay eggs, but to find eggs on New Year's Eve is a great end to an already successful year, and a fantastic start to 2018. ""We have been tirelessly working with this critically endangered species for two years now, and to have achieved this success after such a lot of hard work and dedication is truly fantastic."""

Mohammed, a Sudanese asylum seeker who arrived in the back of a lorry in February 2014, was arrested in December 2016 at his home in Leopold Street, Derby. Police found two of the three components for the explosive TATP, manuals on how to make explosives, mobile phone detonators and ricin, a deadly poison. Both he and Hassan, 33, of Willesden Lane, northwest London, denied preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016. An Old Bailey jury on Monday found the pair guilty of the plot and Judge Michael Topolski QC remanded the pair in custody, warning therm they face jail when they are sentenced on 22 February. Following the verdicts, he said: ""Munir Mohammed, you have been convicted of planning a potentially devastating terrorist attack by creating an explosive device and deploying it somewhere in the UK, targeting those you regarded as enemies of the Islamic State. ""Rowaida El-Hassan, you share the extremist mindset with Munir Mohammed and you were ideologically motivated to provide him with support, motivation and assistance. ""You knew he was engaging and planning an attack. You knew he was planning an explosion to kill and maim innocent people in the cause of Islamic State."" Mohammed, who was living in Derby, used Facebook to get in touch with an IS commander, asking him for a bomb-making recipe and further instructions. He had also researched the deadly poison ricin while working illegally in a Kerry Foods factory making sauces for supermarket chains. Hassan, a former Boots pharmacist, ""rapidly formed an emotional attachment"" after meeting Mohammed online, prosecutors said. He sent her gory videos of IS executions, including some carried out by children. She asked him to ""send more"" and helped guide him to the right chemicals for his bomb. He bought two of the three ingredients required to make the explosive called triacetone triperoxide (TATP), known as Mother of Satan, and thought he had a third. Investigators believe that it was only his lack of English that meant he had accidentally bought the wrong third ingredient. He needed Hassan's help because hydrogen peroxide, one of the bomb's components is a ""p-line"" product, which means that customers have to speak to the pharmacist before it can be purchased. But evidence suggested that Hassan was also discussing targets, at one point searching for: ""Why is UK not fearful of attacks like Germany and France."" Anne Whyte QC, prosecuting, told the jury at the Old Bailey: ""Rowaida Hassan was the educated assistant with a rallying cry when he needed it and the pharmaceutical knowledge to help. ""Munir Mohammed was the active heavy lifter. They were both assets to ISIS in their different ways."" DCI Paul Greenwood of the North-East Counter-Terrorism Unit, said: ""We consider that Mohammed was in the later stages of a plot. He had bought the chemicals and although he had not had the tasking, there was a high risk that he could have launched an attack by Christmas."" Ms Whyte said: ""This is a case which reflects the age in which we live. It demonstrates the relative ease with which acts of terrorism can be prepared, thanks to the internet. ""The prosecution allege that Munir Mohammed had resolved upon a lone wolf attack and that Rowaida el-Hassan was aware of his engagement with such a plan."" The jury was told that Mohammed was in contact over Facebook with an IS commander, who used the online identity Abubakr Kurdi. ""Kurdi was the one to give instructions and Mohammed was to carry them out"", prosecutors said. At one point, Rowaida el-Hassan messaged Munir Mohammed: ""Oh you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you and let them find harshness in you. ""Perform jihad in Allah's cause for jihad is a tremendous door leading to paradise, through it Allah saves one from sadness and grief."" Mohammed accessed a video on how to make a crude version of ricin, titled: ""Jihadi ideas for Lonely Lions."" In the space of three months Mohammed also downloaded three separate videos which showed how to make a bomb. He had an IS video which showed how to make TATP, a YouTube video showing how to make TATP into a plastic explosive and an Arabic video which showed how to make a shaped charge."
2018-01-08,"""Do no harm"" should probably be the top aim of a reshuffle.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/cabinet-reshuffle-analysis-greening-departure-gives-pm-a-putney-problem-11200812,"In the end, it was relatively minor. There were five new faces at the Cabinet table, some rebranded departments and a shift around of jobs at Justice, Work & Pensions, Northern Ireland, Education and the Cabinet Office. The first problem with the reshuffle was it was over-hyped, presumably by some people who thought they were being helpful to Theresa May. This was not helped by the Conservatives' official Twitter account wrongly heralding Chris Grayling as Sir Patrick McLoughlin's replacement as party chairman. The second problem was that it did not assert the Prime Minister's post-Brexit negotiation authority. In allowing Jeremy Hunt, Greg Clark, Justine Greening and Damian Hinds to hang around Downing Street for hours in total - with at least two of them pushing back against the PM's decision-making - it made for a rather public display of a lack of authority. But above all, the principal consequence - along with the decision of Mrs May's allies to brief against Ms Greening and Mr Clark - is the PM now has a ""Putney problem"". Ms Greening, the Putney MP and now former education secretary, is not going quietly and her friends are furious with her treatment. One told me: ""She should have absolutely expected to continue. She saw people who have been massively disloyal, others not competent, allowed to stay in Cabinet, and even given expanded briefs."" A Tory MP told me that Ms Greening was a ""damaging loss"" and Mrs May made a ""dreadful error... caving into boys but not a woman"" - a reference to Jeremy Hunt staying in post. Ms Greening's constituency voted 75% in favour of remaining in the EU. She has argued in Cabinet for a ""pragmatic"" Brexit and her friends say she achieved some progress with the teaching community, few of whom voted Tory, but who proved influential in driving the electoral decisions of important swing voters. :: Cabinet reshuffle: Who's in and who's out Now, there is an extra backbencher whose inner scepticism about elements of Mrs May's Brexit strategy has so far been held in check by Governmental loyalty. Number 10 pointed out that the PM was disappointed by the departure of Ms Greening, who was offered the position as Work and Pensions Secretary. But the briefing against Ms Greening, and the feeling that Mrs May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy is still influencing events, has left a bad taste. And there is a bigger canvas from a seat that saw a collapse from a five-figure majority to become a marginal last year. The long-standing, modernising wing of the Conservative Party believes that the PM actively unlearned successful Cameron-era lessons that won the Conservatives a swathe of middle-class liberal England less than three years ago. The slightly odd and unannounced silent photo op of Mrs May outside Downing Street with her new, diverse party vice-chairman only showed up the fact that the Cabinet appointments did not live up to that billing. The ""Putney problem"" is that the PM's 2017 election strategy of reuniting the Conservative and UKIP vote may not be reconcilable by winning swathes of liberal England previously won by David Cameron. The PM is trying to reinvent a wheel that she broke last year. The upcoming local elections across Greater London will be extremely difficult for the Conservatives. All this occurs before more parliamentary fireworks on the EU Withdrawal Bill, in the Commons and the Lords, and as the tougher part of Brexit negotiations hit home. Mrs May needs the shuffle of more junior ministerial ranks to go more smoothly than this."
2018-01-08,"A UK-wide ban on manufacturers making products containing microbeads has come into force, in an attempt to cut down on plastics in our oceans.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-bans-microbeads-in-beauty-products-in-bid-to-cut-plastic-in-oceans-11200818,"The beads are used in hundreds of different cosmetic products such as face washes and shower gels. It is estimated up to 51 trillion microbeads are currently in our oceans, while a single shower can flush away an estimated 100,000 microbeads. They are then ingested by marine life and even end up entering our food chain. Environment minister Therese Coffey told Sky News that the ban is part of a wider plan to cut down on plastic pollution. She said: ""We know that any plastic in the marine environment is not good and we know that animals consume this. ""They can be ingested directly into the fish and while we're still looking for extra evidence on the impact on human health, the point is that they don't need to be there and that's why we've taken the steps to have this ban."" :: SNP politician calls for plastic straw tax The ban has been welcomed by campaigners and cosmetic companies which already use natural alternatives to microbeads. Tipper Lewis, from organic skincare company Neal's Yard, said: ""We think the ban is absolutely fantastic. ""We use all sorts of things instead of plastic; rosehip seed powder which we can use for facial products, we've got pumice powder which we use in body products, it's a bit more exfoliating… and we've got ground rice powder which we use in our facial scrubs as well. ""The benefits of these is they're all biodegradable so they break down in the oceans, they don't get into the food chains and we don't end up eating them."" :: 'Latte levy' would boost recycling rates - MPs Mary Creagh, who chairs the Environment Audit Committee, said the ban was a ""good thing"" but the Government must go ""much further, much faster"". The MP said: ""We need to look at how plastic has invaded every area of our life. ""Since the ban recommendation, my committee has also recommended that we should have a deposit return scheme, the latte levy because of the recyclability of coffee cups and we've also recommended that producers who make hard to recycle products are forced to pay more for them."" Although manufacturing microbead products has been banned, they will not be removed from shop shelves completely until July."
2018-01-08,"Bailiffs have been unleashed on almost 41,000 companies struggling to pay higher business rates since last year's controversial revaluation, an investigation has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/bailiffs-target-41000-companies-struggling-to-pay-rising-business-rates-11200634,"An estimate by Altus Group suggests English and Welsh councils have referred tens of thousands of businesses to bailiffs that were given the power to enter premises, seize goods and sell them at public auction to settle debts. The projection is based on a Freedom of Information Request, and the figure only covers the number of referrals from April to September 2017 - the first five months when the revaluation was in force. The Government introduced the revaluation to account for property price changes over the last seven years. Many companies operating in London and the South East faced the biggest increases - with businesses in Hounslow seeing rateable values soar by 25.09%, and by 31.83% in Lewisham. Those two London boroughs also had the highest referrals for debt collection, with one in 11 premises in those areas assigned bailiffs for enforcement. Following the report, the Government has urged councils to be ""proportionate in enforcement and use bailiffs only as a last resort"". Alex Probyn, president of business rates at Altus Group, said: ""It isn't only those whose values have increased that are struggling. ""The current, deeply unfair, system of transitional adjustment severely limits the amount by which bills can go down, meaning many businesses are paying disproportionately high bills in locations where local economies areunderperforming and values are falling."" The Chancellor has responded to concerns about rising business rates bills by switching the rate used to calculate annual increases from the higher Retail Price Index measure of inflation to the lower Consumer Price Index - a change that will come into force in April. Philip Hammond used his Budget to claim the shift would save firms £2.3bn over five years. A Government spokesman added: ""Following the revaluation, the majority of businesses saw no change or a fall in their business rates liability and a £3.6bn transitional relief scheme is providing support for the minority of businesses who face increases."" The Local Government Association, which represents the 348 councils in England and Wales which issue the bills, did not deny the report's findings in its response. Claire Kober, the chairwoman of its resources board, said: ""Other businesses and the services that local communities rely on will suffer if councils are unable to collect business rates owed to them. ""While councils do not set business rates, they do what they can to help businesses struggling to pay."""

In the pictures, the fourth in line to the throne is wearing a coat and scarf and what appears to be a rucksack. The nursery, which she will be attending full-time, uses lots of play to help children learn. Founded in 1964, it offers a range of classes including French, dance, sport and music. Each child's development is monitored by an allocated member of staff. It is rated outstanding by Ofsted and described by Tatler magazine as a ""hidden gem"". It is not the first time that pregnant Kate, 36 on Tuesday, has taken official photographs herself. The Duchess released pictures of her newborn daughter in 2015, taken at her and William's home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. Kate, who accepted a lifetime honorary membership of the Royal Photographic Society last year, is a keen amateur photographer. The society recognised her ""talent and enthusiasm"". In September, Charlotte's older brother, Prince George, started at Thomas's Battersea, a fee-paying independent school in south London.

God forbid, unless a plane crashes through his roof, he'll be there one way or the other. ""So any rumour to the contrary is... my favourite new word is becoming 'oh rubbish'. Yeah, so he will be there."" Samantha, from her father's first marriage, also swerved questions on a tweet she posted, which had been interpreted as criticising Prince Harry. The tweet was thought to be in reaction to a comment by Harry that his fiancée was gaining a family she ""never had"". :: Trump Royal wedding snub 'could hit post-Brexit trade deal' She insisted Harry's comments were not ""hurtful"" and added: ""My response was very positive, verbatim, and taken far out of context.

The response follows Harry's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme after the couple spent Christmas together with the royal family. He told presenter Sarah Montague: ""She's done an absolutely amazing job. She's getting in there and it's the family I suppose that she's never had.""

Murray said: ""Today I underwent successful right hip surgery at the St Vincent Hospital in Melbourne. ""I'd like to thank Dr John O'Donnell and all of the staff for looking after me. ""I look forward to returning to competitive tennis during the grass court season. ""Thanks to everyone for all the well wishes and support over the last few days. I'll come back from this."" Murray is no stranger to the doctor's knife, having undergone surgery on his lower back at the end of 2013. :: Is this it for Andy Murray after injury forces him to pull out of Australian Open? He recovered well following the operation and went on to win a second Wimbledon title in 2016. However, in 2017 his hip injury became apparent at the French Open, and he was seen walking with a limp at Wimbledon. Following his latest operation, his outlook seems hopeful, although he says he will now focus his attentions on winning big tournaments rather than concentrate on gaining ranking points. ""I'm very optimistic because, having spoken to the surgeon after he did the surgery, he was very happy about how it went,"" world No 19 Murray said, quoted by several national newspapers. ""He felt that my hip will be feeling better than it did a year ago and, obviously, I was still doing fine a year ago, I was ranked number one in the world. ""Moving forward I'll certainly be playing a reduced schedule, and then focusing more on trying to win major events and big tournaments rather than trying to achieve certain ranking goals."" Murray also said he underwent some minor surgery on his groin on 18 December. He concedes he may only ever reach 95% fitness but believes that would still be enough to challenge for Grand Slam titles. Murray said: ""I've been fairly competitive with top-50 players in the world practising in Brisbane when I was struggling to move. ""And I made the quarter-finals at Wimbledon when I literally couldn't walk and was in so much pain."" He added: ""So if I can get myself to 95% of my best, I believe that's enough to compete at the highest level. No question."""

It said the latest decision amounted to an extension of the voluntary redundancy scheme revealed in the autumn - launched in response to falling sales. Vauxhall said: ""At a meeting held on Thursday 4 January 2018 between representatives from Vauxhall Motors and Unite the Union, the company explained that although the initial voluntary separation programme at its Ellesmere Port plant announced in October (aligned to adjustment of production volumes in order to protect its future) has been successful, it needs to initiate a further voluntary programme for eligible employees of a further 250 heads in the period from April to the end of September 2018. ""The teams are conscious of the need to accelerate the recovery of plant productivity in order to meet the challenges ahead and as an important element of this recovery, this additional separation programme will support the planned move to a single production shift at Ellesmere Port during April 2018."" The statement added: ""Vauxhall Management affirmed the company's continued commitment to the Astra plant at Ellesmere Port. ""The company remains confident in the ability of the Ellesmere Port workforce to deliver the necessary improvements in financial performance."" Sales of the Astra - built at the factory since 1979 - slowed to just shy of 50,000 cars in 2017 from more than 60,000 in the previous year. It was the UK's sixth-favourite new model but has traditionally trailed Ford's most popular competitors and the likes of the VW Golf. Ellesmere Port has been producing 680 models daily in recent times - before the decision to cut down the workforce. At the time of Vauxhall's £1.9bn sale to PSA, the buyer made clear its plant network across Europe was in a race for competitiveness because future investment would depend on ""performance"". The car industry in the UK has distanced itself from suggestions it has benefited from the collapse in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote - insisting it is having to pay suppliers outside the UK more for parts. Commenting on Vauxhall's plans, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""This is an additional blow to a world-class workforce that is one of the most efficient in the industry. He added: ""PSA must provide investment guarantees on new models for Ellesmere Port as a matter of urgency. ""The government must play its part too and provide guarantees on frictionless trade after Brexit. ""Unite's priority is to support our members and protect this plant. We will not tolerate compulsory redundancies and Unite will leave no stone unturned in securing the long term future of Ellesmere Port and the highly skilled workforce."""
2018-01-08,Health minister Philip Dunne has been criticised for appearing to suggest that patients denied a bed by the unfolding NHS winter crisis should sit down instead.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/health-minister-criticised-for-saying-patients-can-sit-when-beds-are-unavailable-11200670,"Mr Dunne, who is responsible for NHS performance, was speaking in the House of Commons in response to urgent questions about the health service, which has postponed thousands of operations to help it cope with winter pressure. Responding to a question from Labour MP Tracy Brabin about a constituent who photographed patients sleeping on the floor in hospital, he said: ""The honourable lady will have heard last week the apology from the Secretary of State to those patients who are having operations postponed, and I absolutely am prepared to apologise today to those patients who are not able to be treated as quickly as we would like them to be. ""There are seats available in most hospitals where beds are not available, and I can’t comment individually on what happened in her case, but I agree with her it is not acceptable."" Many hospitals are facing bed shortages, with some operating at close to 100% capacity, and thousands of patients have endured long waits to be handed over on ambulances, or in hospital corridors. Mr Dunne, who was standing in for Jeremy Hunt, who was in Downing Street discussing his role with the Prime Minister, also became the first minister to concede that the NHS is facing a crisis. ""We have a crisis in winter of some sort more or less every year,"" he said. Mr Dunne was criticised by doctors’ groups and political opponents. ""The seats comment sounds flippant and belittling of the problem that exists,"" said Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine. ""If that is what he truly thinks, it shows a worrying lack of appreciation of reality in our emergency departments and acute medical units."" Labour shadow health minister Justin Madders said: ""This is an appalling and ignorant remark from a minister entirely out of touch with the reality of the NHS winter crisis. ""Placing sick patients in chairs because of acute bed shortages is clearly not acceptable in the 21st Century. ""And yet with numerous trusts this winter at times reporting 100% bed occupancy, hospitals simply cannot cope and are being forced into these intolerable situations. ""Patients and staff are currently facing an unprecedented winter crisis. Instead of worrying about reshuffles, the prime minister must urgently sort this mess out."" Mr Dunne later released a statement which said: ""I responded to a question in the House of Commons about Pinderfields Hospital in Yorkshire, which had earlier indicated chairs were available for those patients who were pictured on the floor. ""As the Prime Minister and Secretary of State both have done, I too have apologised for any cases where care has fallen below the high standards we expect."" His boss, Mr Hunt emerged from Downing Street having been told he will remain as Health Secretary and having added social care to his brief, meaning the two areas are overseen by the same department for the first time since the 1990s. Downing Street confirmed that as a consequence of the change, under which he will be known as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the planned Green Paper on social care will move from the Cabinet Office to health. There is widespread approval for health and social care to be considered in concert as the issues they face are interlinked. Many of those in hospital are there because of a shortage of the social care provision that would allow them to be cared for at home. Around 20% of those currently admitted have been there for more than three weeks."

The trio are thought to have had a child of around seven years old with them when the animal cruelty took place. Witnesses told police the suspects released a rabbit before setting the dogs, believed to be a cream-coloured adult greyhound and two young greyhounds, on it in Poole. At around 11.15am on Saturday 6 January, the men were seen at the Broadstone Recreation Ground with two cages of rabbits and three dogs. The rabbits were believed to be wild, and grey or brown with white tails. Police said the men were described as white and in their 30s or 40s; one was large and two were slim.

When women received all the treatments recommended, the gap in deaths between the sexes ""decreased dramatically"". The British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said women who suffered a STEMI, the most serious form of heart attack, were more than a third less likely than male patients to undergo bypass surgery or get stents. Women were almost a quarter less likely to be given statins, and 16% less likely to be prescribed aspirin. The charity said: ""Critically, when women received all of the treatments recommended for patients who have suffered a heart attack, the gap in excess mortality between the sexes decreased dramatically."" Researchers at the University of Leeds and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden looked at 180,368 patients who suffered a heart attack over a 10-year period to 2013. Professor Chris Gale, from the University of Leeds, who co-wrote the study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, said the typical view of a heart attack patient is not always correct. He said: ""We need to work harder to shift the perception that heart attacks only affect a certain type of person. Typically, when we think of a heart attack patient, we see a middle-aged man who is overweight, has diabetes and smokes. ""This is not always the case - heart attacks affect the wider spectrum of the population, including women. ""The findings from this study suggest that there are clear and simple ways to improve the outcomes of women who have a heart attack - we must ensure equal provision of evidence-based treatments for women."" He added that although the study focused on Sweden and showed a disparity, the situation in the UK could be worse. Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said more women die from coronary heart disease than breast cancer in the UK. He added: ""The findings from this research are concerning - women are dying because they are not receiving proven treatments to save life after a heart attack. ""We urgently need to raise awareness of this issue as it's something that can be easily changed. By simply ensuring more women receive the recommended treatments, we'll be able to help more families avoid the heartbreak of losing a loved one to heart disease."""

The patient, Bethany Shipsey, 21, had serious longstanding mental health issues and was on home leave from a psychiatric ward when she took an overdose of diet pills in Worcester last February. Worcestershire Coroner's Court was told one of Bethany's final messages to a friend on the day she died read: ""I have just overdosed... 😢 I'm petrified of telling anyone because it is like my 15th overdose 😥"" Her parents Doug and Carole Shipsey placed an A4 sized photograph of their daughter in front of them as they listened to the evidence on day one of the inquest - they have previously said that the poor care in the ""overstretched"" A&E department contributed to their daughter's death. Bethany was first assessed while she sat on a trolley in a corridor, which Senior A&E Sister Kirsty South told the inquest was something they had to do ""everyday"" because there simply weren't enough beds in her department. She explained that the description of being ""overwhelmed"" related to an official scale whereby the hospital monitored how busy their department was - she said it was not an unusual occurrence. She confirmed the department failed to meet their target of an initial assessment within fifteen minutes in Ms Shipsey's case. A&E medic Dr Reza Niroumand, who had only worked a few shifts in the department in Worcester at the time, said it was ""one of the busiest days I have ever seen"". He assessed Bethany on the trolley and had initially been satisfied she was stable but admitted he had no experience of the type of diet pills that Bethany told him she had taken.

2018-01-08,"Mothers who sing in groups with their baby may be able to overcome symptoms of post-natal depression quicker, a new study suggests.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109085004/https://news.sky.com/story/mothers-singing-in-groups-with-babies-helps-ease-post-natal-depression-11200598,"Researchers worked with 134 mothers to see if singing could help them reduce the symptoms of post-natal depression (PND) for 40 weeks after they gave birth. The mothers were split into three groups. One group received normal post-natal care, the second engaged in group work with creative play workshops, and the final group received 10 weeks of singing workshops. As well as learning and listening to new songs, the musical mothers also had the chance to create their own. The study's authors found those with symptoms of moderate to severe PND reported a quicker improvement in the singing workshops than those in the usual care group. There was no difference between those in the play workshop compared with the usual care group. Gail Barnes told Sky News that singing with her little boy made a big difference to the first few months of his life. She said: ""To say it saved me may be dramatic but it made a massive difference. ""I was very nervous to go out without family, but I was told about this singing group and that was my decision made - I had to get out and go to it. ""Before, it had felt like I was just getting through each day with him, it was monotonous and lonely. ""But here there were other mums, screaming babies, and we were all in it together. I stopped feeling nervous, as did my baby, when we started to learn the songs, and we interacted in a way which was fun."" Ms Barnes added that one of the biggest benefits was attending the sessions with her baby, rather than singing on her own. Elaine Bielby, who runs the Music with Mummy sessions in Lincoln, said she had started the group after suffering with PND herself six years ago. She said: ""One of the best things I could do was get out to as many groups as possible. ""We do lots around it - discussion times and nights out - but singing is so important."" Fellow Music with Mummy member Amelia Foster, who is a singer, said: ""I found that going to music groups was more sociable than your average play group, because we have a group goal, and a structure. ""I found at other play groups you could be isolated, but with singing groups, there's a real team effort. ""As I'm a singer anyway I probably put more into it than your average person, but there's a real sense of achieving something with your baby."" Principal investigator Dr Rosie Perkins, a research fellow at the Centre for Performance Science, said: ""Post-natal depression is debilitating for mothers and their families, yet our research indicates that for some women something as accessible as singing with their baby could help to speed up recovery at one of the most vulnerable times of their lives."" Commenting on the study, Dr Trudi Seneviratne, chairwoman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Perinatal Faculty, said: ""It's exciting to hear about the growing evidence base for novel psycho-social interventions such as singing to facilitate a more rapid recovery for women with post-natal depression."" PND affects approximately one in nine new mothers."

The patient, Bethany Shipsey, 21, had serious longstanding mental health issues and was on home leave from a psychiatric ward when she took an overdose of diet pills in Worcester last February. Worcestershire Coroner's Court was told one of Bethany's final messages to a friend on the day she died read: ""I have just overdosed... 😢 I'm petrified of telling anyone because it is like my 15th overdose 😥"" Her parents Doug and Carole Shipsey placed an A4 sized photograph of their daughter in front of them as they listened to the evidence on day one of the inquest - they have previously said that the poor care in the ""overstretched"" A&E department contributed to their daughter's death. Bethany was first assessed while she sat on a trolley in a corridor, which Senior A&E Sister Kirsty South told the inquest was something they had to do ""everyday"" because there simply weren't enough beds in her department. She explained that the description of being ""overwhelmed"" related to an official scale whereby the hospital monitored how busy their department was - she said it was not an unusual occurrence. She confirmed the department failed to meet their target of an initial assessment within fifteen minutes in Ms Shipsey's case. A&E medic Dr Reza Niroumand, who had only worked a few shifts in the department in Worcester at the time, said it was ""one of the busiest days I have ever seen"". He assessed Bethany on the trolley and had initially been satisfied she was stable but admitted he had no experience of the type of diet pills that Bethany told him she had taken.

2018-01-09,"Bailiffs have been unleashed on almost 41,000 companies struggling to pay higher business rates since last year's controversial revaluation, an investigation has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/bailiffs-target-41000-companies-struggling-to-pay-rising-business-rates-11200634,"An estimate by Altus Group suggests English and Welsh councils have referred tens of thousands of businesses to bailiffs that were given the power to enter premises, seize goods and sell them at public auction to settle debts. The projection is based on a Freedom of Information Request, and the figure only covers the number of referrals from April to September 2017 - the first five months when the revaluation was in force. The Government introduced the revaluation to account for property price changes over the last seven years. Many companies operating in London and the South East faced the biggest increases - with businesses in Hounslow seeing rateable values soar by 25.09%, and by 31.83% in Lewisham. Those two London boroughs also had the highest referrals for debt collection, with one in 11 premises in those areas assigned bailiffs for enforcement. Following the report, the Government has urged councils to be ""proportionate in enforcement and use bailiffs only as a last resort"". Alex Probyn, president of business rates at Altus Group, said: ""It isn't only those whose values have increased that are struggling. ""The current, deeply unfair, system of transitional adjustment severely limits the amount by which bills can go down, meaning many businesses are paying disproportionately high bills in locations where local economies areunderperforming and values are falling."" The Chancellor has responded to concerns about rising business rates bills by switching the rate used to calculate annual increases from the higher Retail Price Index measure of inflation to the lower Consumer Price Index - a change that will come into force in April. Philip Hammond used his Budget to claim the shift would save firms £2.3bn over five years. A Government spokesman added: ""Following the revaluation, the majority of businesses saw no change or a fall in their business rates liability and a £3.6bn transitional relief scheme is providing support for the minority of businesses who face increases."" The Local Government Association, which represents the 348 councils in England and Wales which issue the bills, did not deny the report's findings in its response. Claire Kober, the chairwoman of its resources board, said: ""Other businesses and the services that local communities rely on will suffer if councils are unable to collect business rates owed to them. ""While councils do not set business rates, they do what they can to help businesses struggling to pay."""
2018-01-09,Health minister Philip Dunne has been criticised for appearing to suggest that patients denied a bed by the unfolding NHS winter crisis should sit down instead.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/health-minister-criticised-for-saying-patients-can-sit-when-beds-are-unavailable-11200670,"Mr Dunne, who is responsible for NHS performance, was speaking in the House of Commons in response to urgent questions about the health service, which has postponed thousands of operations to help it cope with winter pressure. Responding to a question from Labour MP Tracy Brabin about a constituent who photographed patients sleeping on the floor in hospital, he said: ""The honourable lady will have heard last week the apology from the Secretary of State to those patients who are having operations postponed, and I absolutely am prepared to apologise today to those patients who are not able to be treated as quickly as we would like them to be. ""There are seats available in most hospitals where beds are not available, and I can’t comment individually on what happened in her case, but I agree with her it is not acceptable."" Many hospitals are facing bed shortages, with some operating at close to 100% capacity, and thousands of patients have endured long waits to be handed over on ambulances, or in hospital corridors. Mr Dunne, who was standing in for Jeremy Hunt, who was in Downing Street discussing his role with the Prime Minister, also became the first minister to concede that the NHS is facing a crisis. ""We have a crisis in winter of some sort more or less every year,"" he said. Mr Dunne was criticised by doctors’ groups and political opponents. ""The seats comment sounds flippant and belittling of the problem that exists,"" said Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine. ""If that is what he truly thinks, it shows a worrying lack of appreciation of reality in our emergency departments and acute medical units."" Labour shadow health minister Justin Madders said: ""This is an appalling and ignorant remark from a minister entirely out of touch with the reality of the NHS winter crisis. ""Placing sick patients in chairs because of acute bed shortages is clearly not acceptable in the 21st Century. ""And yet with numerous trusts this winter at times reporting 100% bed occupancy, hospitals simply cannot cope and are being forced into these intolerable situations. ""Patients and staff are currently facing an unprecedented winter crisis. Instead of worrying about reshuffles, the prime minister must urgently sort this mess out."" Mr Dunne later released a statement which said: ""I responded to a question in the House of Commons about Pinderfields Hospital in Yorkshire, which had earlier indicated chairs were available for those patients who were pictured on the floor. ""As the Prime Minister and Secretary of State both have done, I too have apologised for any cases where care has fallen below the high standards we expect."" His boss, Mr Hunt emerged from Downing Street having been told he will remain as Health Secretary and having added social care to his brief, meaning the two areas are overseen by the same department for the first time since the 1990s. Downing Street confirmed that as a consequence of the change, under which he will be known as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the planned Green Paper on social care will move from the Cabinet Office to health. There is widespread approval for health and social care to be considered in concert as the issues they face are interlinked. Many of those in hospital are there because of a shortage of the social care provision that would allow them to be cared for at home. Around 20% of those currently admitted have been there for more than three weeks."

2018-01-09,"It was, predictably enough, in a pub opposite the EU headquarters where Nigel Farage 'debriefed' the media.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/nigel-farage-reveals-details-of-meeting-with-eus-brexit-negotiator-michel-barnier-11200281,"A significant number of us (also predictable) had gathered to hear the outcome of what was, on the face of it, an unusual meeting. Mr Farage had spent the previous 45 minutes inside the nerve centre of the European Union, the organisation he's spent decades trying to destroy, meeting a man for whom the EU is a fundamental force for good - Michel Barnier, the bloc's Brexit negotiator. He'd written to Mr Barnier back in October requesting the meeting. ""As you appear to be conducting a series of meetings with UK political figures on the issue of Brexit, I wish to make a request,"" he wrote. ""It seems that you are listening to a group of people who want to stop or delay Brexit. I will come to speak for the 17.4 million who did not vote for a transition deal or any further delays and whose resolve is getting stronger."" :: Farage meets Barnier: 'Brexit talks will continue to be difficult Mr Farage was worried that Mr Barnier was hearing only one side of the Brexit story - and it wasn't the Brexit side. Meetings with high-profile remainers like Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis, Ken Clarke and others helped to push that fear. In truth, Mr Barnier does meet people and hear the views of people on both sides of the Brexit divide - not least his opposite number David Davis, the Brexit Secretary and a firm Brexiteer. Still, the meeting was duly granted at the start of a week when Mr Barnier will also meet other Brexiteers including Steven Woolfe MEP (formerly of UKIP, now independent), Lord Digby Jones (former director of the CBI), John Mills (chair of Labour Leave) and John Longworth (co-chair of Leave Means Leave). It was off-camera and Mr Farage said no photos were taken. So, how did it go? ""I always said he would be very civil and indeed he was very civil. Coffee was offered which I thought was very nice…"" said a beaming, trilby-sporting Mr Farage, as he emerged from the meeting. ""I genuinely don't think he understands why people voted for Brexit, I really don't think he gets it. When I suggested to him that it might be something to do with open door immigration from within the EU, he almost looked at me with incredulity as if to say 'well surely wasn't it outside the EU migration that was the issue'. He didn't understand that. ""Was it a fruitful meeting?"" I asked him. ""Well I genuinely thought that the views of the 17.4m had not been expressed before to Mr Barnier and the meeting confirmed that, yes,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody has been to see him to really make that point that immigration was front and centre of that campaign. It was what motivated millions of people who don't normally vote to go out in the referendum and basically, where have we got to in terms of our debate in terms of our debate, our negotiations - I'll tell you, nowhere."" Mr Farage continued: ""I asked him - 'Who do you represent? Do you represent Brussels?' Do you represent these glass and steel structures? ""Do you represent the people here - you know, 10,000 people here earning more than the British Prime Minister with pensions and all the rest of it? Is that what you represent or do you represent the workers in the member states?' Of course he said, they are both the same thing. I am not so sure they are."" A German reporter snapped back: ""Who do you represent then? What are you doing?'"" ""Well, umm, I am trying to represent the view of those who voted Brexit because it's not really being heard. You know we didn't vote for transition deals. ""We didn't vote to sort of kick this into the long grass so that it's at least going to be six years from Brexit that we can sign a trade deal with anyone else or have any degree of control over our borders with the rest of the EU."" We don't know what Mr Barnier thought of the meeting. He's said nothing."

During a meeting in the village of Panmunjom, which sits on the border, the two nations discussed next month's Winter Olympics in the South Korean county of Pyeongchang. North Korea offered to send a delegation of high-ranking officials, athletes and a cheering squad to the event. Meanwhile, South Korea proposed that athletes from both nations march together at the opening ceremony - bringing the prospect of improved ties after years of strained relations. Seoul went on to suggest that military talks should take place with a view to reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula, and raised the prospect of resuming temporary reunions for families separated by war. :: The questions South Korea really wants to ask North Korea Citizens living in Pyongyang have said the talks - which follow an olive branch invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in an unusual New Year address - are encouraging. One of them, Kim Ri Ah, said: ""Every Korean really wants relations between the North and South to improve, it's urgent, it's an important thing that the whole nation should solve by coming together. ""Anything that provokes either side or creates obstacles to reunification should completely stop."" The meeting comes at a time of heightening tensions on the peninsula, with some of most bellicose rhetoric from the North and the US in living memory. Recently, leaders have openly compared the size and effectiveness of their nuclear ""buttons"" to the dismay and alarm of hundreds of millions. Those expecting an easing of tensions to follow these talks may need to manage their expectations. A lot more than sport may be motivating Kim. He may be seeking to exploit tensions between the South and its patrons, the US, under Donald Trump. South Korea's President, Moon Jae-in, has openly differed with Mr Trump by arguing for economic and diplomatic co-operation with North Korea, as the American president pushed for the opposite, over the isolated state's continuing missile and nuclear tests and progress towards a nuclear missile capable of hitting the US mainland. Mr Moon also angered the Americans by claiming they had given him a veto over any US military action against the North. Kim is likely to use these talks to drive a wedge between the South and the US - which he hopes might make it harder for sanctions to be tightened against his regime. Sanctions, in particular Chinese restrictions on some fuel imports, are thought to be making life increasingly difficult for the Kim regime. But he will also hope it makes preemptive military action against the North less likely. Reports from Washington suggest policymakers and military planners are now preparing for what was previously unthinkable, a first strike US military operation against the North. That would most likely lead to a North Korean retaliation that would in turn kill tens of thousands in South Korea. Some Trump officials have indicated that may be a price they are prepared to pay."

Police were unable to rouse the victim, who they found curled in a foetal position, shivering and moaning. He had been left with permanent brain damage, and died in hospital 16 days later. Mr Bonner had been spending the weekend with his boss Richard Spottiswood, 34, and Spottiswood’s girlfriend Lucy Burn, 29, at Creswell Towers Holiday Park, in Northumberland. Both Spottiswood and Burn are accused of murder. They deny the charge. Newcastle Crown Court heard that garage owner Spottiswood - who grew and sold cannabis with Mr Bonner – suspected Mr Bonner was spying for a drug rival. An argument between the two men inside a caravan in the early hours of the morning, resulted in Spottiswood putting the victim in a headlock, bursting blood vessels in his face, the prosecution alleges. Mr Bonner had also received around 12 blows on the back from a rod-shaped weapon, a post-mortem examination result showed. The prosecution alleges that Spottiswood then drove Mr Bonner’s body down the road in the back of his van, dragging him through a hole in the wall before dumping his body in a hastily dug shallow grave. Burn has admitted assisting an offender by evading the police and telling them lies. She had originally concealed the fact that Spottiswood and Mr Bonner had argued, saying that Spottiswood told her to lie to police. Following Burn's admission, Spottiswood also changed his story, saying he had argued with Mr Bonner as they went to the hole to bury stolen guns. Spottiswood had originally denied all knowledge of the death. The case continues."

If implemented, Wales would follow Scotland in ending the physical punishment of children. Last October, Scotland announced its plans to remove the defence of ""justifiable assault"" in Scots law, which allows parents to use physical punishment to discipline a child. Launching a 12-week consultation on the issue, Welsh minister for children and social care, Huw Irranca-Davies, said the ban would be part of a wider package of measures to support children. ""We want parents in Wales to be confident in managing their children's behaviour without feeling they must resort to physical punishment,"" he said. ""If there is any potential risk of harm to a child then it is our obligation as a government to take action. ""Legislation was introduced many years ago to stop physical punishment in schools and childcare settings - now is the time to ensure it is no longer acceptable anywhere."" The proposed legislation would not result in the creation of a new offence but would instead remove a defence to the existing offences of assault and battery. This means an adult looking after a child would no longer be able to use physical or corporal punishment against them. NSPCC Cymru said it had long campaigned for children in Wales to have the same protection against assault as adults. ""We welcome the steps being taken towards removing the defence of 'reasonable punishment',"" a spokesperson said. Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales, said the proposed legislation, if accepted, would mean Wales was leading the way ""yet again in protecting children's rights"". Other countries that have already made the change include France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Ireland."

As a result, over the past decade, brands like Givenchy and Louis Vuitton have been keen to try and tap into new audiences, and the ""hypebeast"" scene is a designer label's dream. For those unfamiliar with what a ""hypebeast"" is, the hype part refers to wearing the most exclusive clothes that everyone's talking about. The beast part is meant to indicate an obsession. The term was originally meant as an insult among teenagers for those who looked faintly ridiculous dressed top-to-toe in expensive designer gear. Supreme, Palace, BAPE, Kanye West's brand Yeezy and Off-White are the key names to be seen in; all street-wear brands that produce limited-edition runs which are hard to get your hands on. For those who do not understand this world, spending hundreds on a white T-shirt with a small logo on it might sound like a vain waste of money, but it is the hypebeasts that might be having the last laugh. Many savvy young teenagers are making fortune online, often queuing in the rain for hours to buy items on the day they're released in store, showing their ""garms"" off by posing in them that day on Instagram, then immediately selling them on at a profit on eBay. Ari Petrou has made a career out of it. He has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and calls himself the UK's biggest hypebeast.  Got Bape on my back with some Act on me 🦍✨ Today’s denim @dsrcv petrou10 for a discount 💰 📸 @bxnmxclean A post shared by  UK’s Biggest Hypebeast 🇬🇧 (@aripetrou) on Jan 7, 2018 at 8:00am PST He said: ""Basically I take pictures, promote clothes and buy and sell clothes for a living. ""I started doing it because I wasn't making enough money out of my job and someone told me I could make money by buying shoes. ""I ended up making more doing that once or twice a week then working my job - so I quit. ""I have multiple sponsors from companies in Hong Kong now and massive companies in the States who pay me thousands to post pictures in their clothes and say 'this is what I'm wearing today'. ""It's got to the point where now I can just pay a kid to queue to get me the latest stuff, maybe £10, while I stay at home in my bed. ""The younger generation, they are just all doing it because it's like a hobby and you make money from it. ""Now I see so many groups of school kids that will go to shops like Supreme all together, it's like their day out, and they've all made like £100 or £200, and they are 13-year-old kids. ""There are people that are like from bad backgrounds that have gone from selling drugs to selling clothes. It is a legitimate business."" In truth, those who can be bothered with the effort often earn their money. In order to buy Supreme's latest collection on the day it is released, you first need to understand where to queue and when. On Monday, those in the know will be emailed about a secret location where they will go to be given a number which determines their position in the queue for the ""drop"" on Thursday. It is a complicated system but the only fair way the shop has found to stop kids from camping out overnight to be first in line. Supreme, in particular, enjoys making fun of how obsessed people are buying its limited runs. A basic clay brick - which went on to sell for £1,000 on eBay - is one of the more ridiculous items it has sold. As Ari explains, it is fun but also an investment. ""I have Supreme toothbrushes, torches, shovels even, which obviously I don't care but I know I am pretty much one of the only people to have it,"" he says. ""Stuff like that, it is worth way more than I paid for it. Maybe I pay £1,000 for my collection and in two years' time it is worth three, four, five thousand."" The roots of this scene started out with trainers. Influencer Vivian Frank has made a career out of buying and selling them. He is the man behind two of the biggest Facebook groups in the UK for buying and selling sneakers: Sneaker Myth, which has more than 60,000 members, and Yeezy Talk, which has 150,000. ""I was into trainers and social media, I started buying a few shoes and eventually ended up creating my own platform,"" Vivian says. ""Reselling is like a culture, there is a community around it. There are sneaker events, Facebook groups, I made most of my friends through sneakers, it's like a family sort of thing."" Vivian says the key to making money is understanding which brands to invest in. ""For example, when I was in high school, I got a pair of shoes for £220 and they are like £7,000 now,"" he adds. ""I don't come from a rich background, now I can buy a nice car and whatnot. I even help my parents out when they need money.""

2018-01-09,Morrisons said it enjoyed strong Christmas and New Year trading as like-for-like retail sales rose 2.1% in the ten weeks to 7 January.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/morrisons-reports-strong-trading-over-christmas-period-11200888,"The Bradford-based retailer - the first major supermarket to reveal how it performed over the recent festive period - said it had kept a lid on prices for shoppers despite higher commodity costs. It added that sales of its ""Best"" premium products were up by a quarter, new home and leisure ranges were proving popular and online sales grew 10%. Shares opened 4% higher. The figures come after monthly data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed a stark disparity between the performance of supermarkets and non-food retailers, as squeezed shoppers prioritised essentials such as food leaving less left over for Christmas gifts. In its update, Morrisons said overall group like-for-like sales were up by a better-than-expected 2.8%, boosted by a wholesale deal with convenience store chain McColl's. The company said performance was ""especially strong over the Christmas and New Year period"" with store sales up 2.8% and group sales up 3.7% in the six weeks to 7 January. Morrisons said it had become more competitive despite the increase in its buying costs - which have risen for many UK businesses after the collapse in the pound following the Brexit vote made imports more expensive. ""Despite input cost pressures on many commodities, the price of a basket of key Christmas items was the same as last year,"" the company said. Chief executive David Potts - who has been credited with turning around the performance of the business - said: ""More and more customers found more things they wanted to buy at competitive prices at Morrisons this Christmas."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said by keeping down prices it was likely to have taken a hit on profit margins or squeezed its suppliers. Elsewhere, Majestic Wine's chief executive Rowan Gormley said it had performed ""brilliantly"" over the key Christmas period, with like-for-like retail sales up 1.3% while it maintained its profit margin at the same level as last year. He said it showed the business's ""winning formula"" worked ""even when times are tough"". Those comments reflect a difficult environment for retailers as consumers are squeezed by higher inflation and weak wage growth - meaning that in real terms, their pay is falling. Figures from the BRC also out on Tuesday showed UK retailers saw a 0.6% like-for-like sales rise in December but the report highlighted how the ""severe pressure"" on spending was weighing heavily on some firms much more than others. It said that for the three months to December, food sales were up 2.6% but non-food sales saw their worst decline since March 2009 - at the height of the financial crisis - with a fall of 1.9%. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark. ""With inflation outpacing income growth, shoppers continued to see more of their spending power absorbed by essential items, including food, leaving less left over for buying Christmas gifts."" Tesco and Sainsbury's are due to report Christmas trading figures later in the week. Their share prices were both ahead after the Morrisons update. Investors were also responding to industry data from Kantar Worldpanel showing that shoppers spent an additional £1bn in grocery stores over the 12 weeks to 1 January - trading up to more expensive items despite tightening budgets. Tesco was the fastest growing of the major supermarkets, according to Kantar."

But separate numbers from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) highlighted the starkly different picture for non-food stores, which saw their worst fall since 2009. Squeezed households have had to manage their budgets over a period when grocery inflation climbed to 3.7%, according to the Kantar data. Fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl were the biggest winners over the period, with sales up at each by 16.8%. Overall sales for the sector rose 3.8% to £28.9bn compared to last year. Tesco - which will report its own figures later this week - was boosted by the performance of its own label products as well as last-minute Sunday purchases at its convenience store network on Christmas Eve. Kantar said that, across the grocery retailers, households shrugged off economic worries to spend an average £1,054 over the period. It said shoppers continued to trade up to more expensive products, with a record £469m spent on premium own label lines such as chilled items, bakery goods and fresh meat in December alone. Mince pie sales rose 13.2% to £93m while alcohol was up 5.1% to £3.9bn. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""Overall supermarket sales increased in value by 3.8%, with an additional £1bn ringing through the tills compared to the same festive period last year. ""Shoppers parted with £747m on 22 December alone, making the Friday before Christmas the busiest shopping day ever recorded."" The report came on the same day as Morrisons delivered its own better-than-expected trading update, and a day ahead of figures from Sansbury's. Figures from the BRC also out on Tuesday showed UK retailers saw a 0.6% like-for-like sales rise in December but the report highlighted how the ""severe pressure"" on spending was weighing heavily on some firms much more than others.

2018-01-09,"""Do no harm"" should probably be the top aim of a reshuffle.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/cabinet-reshuffle-analysis-greening-departure-gives-pm-a-putney-problem-11200812,"In the end, it was relatively minor. There were five new faces at the Cabinet table, some rebranded departments and a shift around of jobs at Justice, Work & Pensions, Northern Ireland, Education and the Cabinet Office. The first problem with the reshuffle was it was over-hyped, presumably by some people who thought they were being helpful to Theresa May. This was not helped by the Conservatives' official Twitter account wrongly heralding Chris Grayling as Sir Patrick McLoughlin's replacement as party chairman. The second problem was that it did not assert the Prime Minister's post-Brexit negotiation authority. In allowing Jeremy Hunt, Greg Clark, Justine Greening and Damian Hinds to hang around Downing Street for hours in total - with at least two of them pushing back against the PM's decision-making - it made for a rather public display of a lack of authority. But above all, the principal consequence - along with the decision of Mrs May's allies to brief against Ms Greening and Mr Clark - is the PM now has a ""Putney problem"". Ms Greening, the Putney MP and now former education secretary, is not going quietly and her friends are furious with her treatment. One told me: ""She should have absolutely expected to continue. She saw people who have been massively disloyal, others not competent, allowed to stay in Cabinet, and even given expanded briefs."" A Tory MP told me that Ms Greening was a ""damaging loss"" and Mrs May made a ""dreadful error... caving into boys but not a woman"" - a reference to Jeremy Hunt staying in post. Ms Greening's constituency voted 75% in favour of remaining in the EU. She has argued in Cabinet for a ""pragmatic"" Brexit and her friends say she achieved some progress with the teaching community, few of whom voted Tory, but who proved influential in driving the electoral decisions of important swing voters. :: Cabinet reshuffle: Who's in and who's out Now, there is an extra backbencher whose inner scepticism about elements of Mrs May's Brexit strategy has so far been held in check by Governmental loyalty. Number 10 pointed out that the PM was disappointed by the departure of Ms Greening, who was offered the position as Work and Pensions Secretary. But the briefing against Ms Greening, and the feeling that Mrs May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy is still influencing events, has left a bad taste. And there is a bigger canvas from a seat that saw a collapse from a five-figure majority to become a marginal last year. The long-standing, modernising wing of the Conservative Party believes that the PM actively unlearned successful Cameron-era lessons that won the Conservatives a swathe of middle-class liberal England less than three years ago. The slightly odd and unannounced silent photo op of Mrs May outside Downing Street with her new, diverse party vice-chairman only showed up the fact that the Cabinet appointments did not live up to that billing. The ""Putney problem"" is that the PM's 2017 election strategy of reuniting the Conservative and UKIP vote may not be reconcilable by winning swathes of liberal England previously won by David Cameron. The PM is trying to reinvent a wheel that she broke last year. The upcoming local elections across Greater London will be extremely difficult for the Conservatives. All this occurs before more parliamentary fireworks on the EU Withdrawal Bill, in the Commons and the Lords, and as the tougher part of Brexit negotiations hit home. Mrs May needs the shuffle of more junior ministerial ranks to go more smoothly than this."
2018-01-09,Blockbusters Dunkirk and Blade Runner 2049 were the biggest surprises of the BAFTA 2018 nominations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/bafta-2018-blade-runner-and-dunkirk-among-main-nominees-11200940,"While the Guillermo Del Toro's sci-fi romance The Shape Of Water led the nominations with 12 nods, including best film, director and actress for Sally Hawkins, that came as no surprise. The film had already dominated nominations at the Golden Globes, but fell short of expectations at the ceremony on Sunday, losing best picture to Martin McDonagh's Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh's film picked up nine nominations for this year's BAFTAs, including best film, director, outstanding British film, original screenplay and best actress for Frances McDormand. Following closely was Joe Wright's The Darkest Hour, with a nod for best film and best actor for Gary Oldman. ""This is my third BAFTA nomination as an actor,"" he said. ""The recognition means so much, and especially more so not merely for the distinguished company I now find myself in with my fellow nominees, but most especially for the privilege of playing Winston Churchill - which it truly was."" :: As It Happened: BAFTA 2018 nominations But the real surprise were the IMAX hits of the year, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk and Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049, with eight nods each. The two films exceeded in technical categories, and both got a best director nod for their respective filmmakers. The highly anticipated Blade Runner sequel was snubbed by the Globes this year, but had a deeper impact on British jurors. BAFTA's biggest snub of the year was for first-time director Greta Gerwig and her movie Lady Bird. :: Golden Globes got it all wrong - except the tone Not only did it fail to win a nod for best film, but also best director, leaving the category male-dominated. The absence of female directors nominated for the Globes on Sunday was underlined by Natalie Portman as she announced the ""all male nominees"" for best director, to gasps from the audience. ""Thank you so much for this amazing honour,"" Gerwig said in statement regarding her nod for best original screenplay. ""Everyone who worked on Lady Bird poured their heart and soul into it, and I am so proud of every single cast and crew member. I am thrilled for Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf -- they are both such extraordinary actresses, and they are deserving of every accolade. ""I've always wanted to be a writer and director, and I could not be more happy that I've been able to do it and that it has been received with such love."" Also snubbed by the British Academy was Steven Spielberg's The Post, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, which failed to receive any nominations. :: Golden Globes: The full list of winners :: Which stars wore black at Golden Globes? In the run for best male performer is Christopher Plummer, who replaced Kevin Spacey in Ridley Scott's All The Money In The World following accusations of sexual misconduct.

The Papua New Guinea international was part of the side which lost to England in the 2017 World Cup quarter-finals. In a statement, Widnes Vikings head coach Denis Betts said: ""To receive this tragic news is heartbreaking. ""All of us saw at the World Cup the incredible gifts that Kato had, and his potential to forge a great career in Rugby League. ""Moreover, in all of our interactions with him, we found Kato to be a person of great character, who was excited to be following his dreams. ""On behalf of the coaching team, staff and players at Widnes Vikings, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to Kato's loved ones."" Ottio, who played primarily at centre, earned six caps for Papua New Guinea, scoring two tries at international level. He signed for Canberra Raiders in February 2016 and played for the club's feeder team, the Mount Pritchard Mounties. He was also a former volleyball player, winning gold at the 2013 Pacific Mini Games as a member of Papua New Guinea's squad. Widnes Vikings chief executive James Rule said everyone at the club was ""devastated"" by Ottio's death. He added: ""Kato was an incredibly talented player, with a bright future ahead of him in Rugby League. ""This news is all the more tragic, because Kato was due to travel to the UK this week to fulfil his dream of playing first-grade Rugby League. ""Having only learned this morning that Kato had developed a sudden health issue whilst training yesterday, we are in absolute shock to now receive this tragic news. ""Widnes Vikings will of course be looking to celebrate Kato's life and pay our sincere respects to someone who we believe would have become a hero at our club."""
2018-01-09,Theresa May's mostly unchanged Cabinet will meet today after a reshuffle that did not quite go to plan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-to-meet-cabinet-after-reshuffle-plans-backfire-11200817,"A notable absence will be Justine Greening, who quit the Government after refusing to shift from her role as Education Secretary to the Department for Work and Pensions. Later, she tweeted: ""Social mobility matters to me and our country more than my ministerial career."" Sources close to the departing minister told Sky News: ""She should have absolutely expected to continue. She saw people who've been massively disloyal, others not competent, allowed to stay in Cabinet and even get expanded briefs."" The PM's attention will now turn to junior ministers, as last night some within her party questioned what the point was of the changes thus far. Nicholas Soames, MP for Mid Sussex, tweeted: ""Is that it? I don't mean to be rude or to be seen to be disloyal but there needs to be a major improvement to the reshuffle tomorrow."" :: Cabinet reshuffle - Who's in and who's out Today's more junior appointments will signal who the Prime Minister sees as rising stars within the party. These supporting roles are coveted by new intake MPs wanting to get a foot on the ministerial ladder. Ms Greening's departure was the biggest upset yesterday after the Prime Minister kept all the political big beasts in her Cabinet in place, including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Even the replacement of Damian Green as First Secretary of State did not happen as David Lidington took on many of his responsibilities without the title. Jeremy Hunt was another minister who refused to budge after being offered a swap to Business Secretary. Instead, he increased his role - his job title changed from Health Secretary to Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. :: What the newspapers say about the Cabinet reshuffle Critics will regard it as a sign of weakness that the PM did not feel able to impose any significant change in the most senior ranks. Business Secretary Greg Clark, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom were all tipped for demotions but kept their roles. Newspapers were also over-briefed for changes that so far have not transpired, such as a ""no deal"" Brexit minister. The adjusting of titles added to the sense of tinkering. Sajid Javid expanded his job title, adding the housing to his role as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Last night, Jeremy Corbyn told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party: ""You can't make up for nearly eight years of failure by changing the name of a department."" :: Analysis from Sky's Political Editor on May's reshuffle However, leading doctors have welcomed Downing Street's decision to merge health and social care. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""We support the bringing together of health and social care into the portfolio of one minister as we recognise that what happens to patients in the NHS is profoundly impacted by the state of social care."" In an embarrassing twist, Mr Hunt was forced to explain why he had ""liked"" a tweet stating that Ms Greening had left the Government. Mr Hunt tweeted: ""Like button pressed by accident. Justine was an excellent minister and will be a great loss to govt."" Other changes included David Gauke taking over the role of Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary. Esther McVey was eventually given the vacancy at the Department of Work and Pensions. Karen Bradley took on the role of Northern Ireland Secretary vacated by James Brokenshire for health reasons. Digital minister Matt Hancock takes over as Culture Secretary. Brexit Secretary David Davis, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox all remain in the same jobs. Downing Street said the reshuffle was seen by Mrs May as ""an opportunity to refresh the Government and to give added impetus to the PM's reform agenda while continuing to deliver on Brexit"". But Liberal Democrat chief whip Alistair Carmichael said the whole affair could be summed up in the PM's previous comment that ""nothing has changed"", adding: ""Theresa May wanted to reassert her authority but has come out of this looking weaker than ever."""

The mothers were split into three groups. One group received normal post-natal care, the second engaged in group work with creative play workshops, and the final group received 10 weeks of singing workshops. As well as learning and listening to new songs, the musical mothers also had the chance to create their own. The study's authors found those with symptoms of moderate to severe PND reported a quicker improvement in the singing workshops than those in the usual care group. There was no difference between those in the play workshop compared with the usual care group. Gail Barnes told Sky News that singing with her little boy made a big difference to the first few months of his life. She said: ""To say it saved me may be dramatic but it made a massive difference. ""I was very nervous to go out without family, but I was told about this singing group and that was my decision made - I had to get out and go to it. ""Before, it had felt like I was just getting through each day with him, it was monotonous and lonely. ""But here there were other mums, screaming babies, and we were all in it together. I stopped feeling nervous, as did my baby, when we started to learn the songs, and we interacted in a way which was fun."" Ms Barnes added that one of the biggest benefits was attending the sessions with her baby, rather than singing on her own. Elaine Bielby, who runs the Music with Mummy sessions in Lincoln, said she had started the group after suffering with PND herself six years ago. She said: ""One of the best things I could do was get out to as many groups as possible. ""We do lots around it - discussion times and nights out - but singing is so important."" Fellow Music with Mummy member Amelia Foster, who is a singer, said: ""I found that going to music groups was more sociable than your average play group, because we have a group goal, and a structure. ""I found at other play groups you could be isolated, but with singing groups, there's a real team effort. ""As I'm a singer anyway I probably put more into it than your average person, but there's a real sense of achieving something with your baby."" Principal investigator Dr Rosie Perkins, a research fellow at the Centre for Performance Science, said: ""Post-natal depression is debilitating for mothers and their families, yet our research indicates that for some women something as accessible as singing with their baby could help to speed up recovery at one of the most vulnerable times of their lives."" Commenting on the study, Dr Trudi Seneviratne, chairwoman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Perinatal Faculty, said: ""It's exciting to hear about the growing evidence base for novel psycho-social interventions such as singing to facilitate a more rapid recovery for women with post-natal depression."" PND affects approximately one in nine new mothers."
2018-01-09,A couple who met on an online dating website have been found guilty of plotting an Islamic State-inspired attack over Christmas.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/online-couple-guilty-of-is-christmas-plot-11200446,"Munir Mohammed, 37, enlisted the help of pharmacist Rowaida el-Hassan on SingleMuslim.com after volunteering for a lone wolf mission directed by a man he believed was an IS commander on Facebook. Mohammed, a Sudanese asylum seeker who arrived in the back of a lorry in February 2014, was arrested in December 2016 at his home in Leopold Street, Derby. Police found two of the three components for the explosive TATP, manuals on how to make explosives, mobile phone detonators and ricin, a deadly poison. Both he and Hassan, 33, of Willesden Lane, northwest London, denied preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016. An Old Bailey jury on Monday found the pair guilty of the plot and Judge Michael Topolski QC remanded the pair in custody, warning therm they face jail when they are sentenced on 22 February. Following the verdicts, he said: ""Munir Mohammed, you have been convicted of planning a potentially devastating terrorist attack by creating an explosive device and deploying it somewhere in the UK, targeting those you regarded as enemies of the Islamic State. ""Rowaida El-Hassan, you share the extremist mindset with Munir Mohammed and you were ideologically motivated to provide him with support, motivation and assistance. ""You knew he was engaging and planning an attack. You knew he was planning an explosion to kill and maim innocent people in the cause of Islamic State."" Mohammed, who was living in Derby, used Facebook to get in touch with an IS commander, asking him for a bomb-making recipe and further instructions. He had also researched the deadly poison ricin while working illegally in a Kerry Foods factory making sauces for supermarket chains. Hassan, a former Boots pharmacist, ""rapidly formed an emotional attachment"" after meeting Mohammed online, prosecutors said. He sent her gory videos of IS executions, including some carried out by children. She asked him to ""send more"" and helped guide him to the right chemicals for his bomb. He bought two of the three ingredients required to make the explosive called triacetone triperoxide (TATP), known as Mother of Satan, and thought he had a third. Investigators believe that it was only his lack of English that meant he had accidentally bought the wrong third ingredient. He needed Hassan's help because hydrogen peroxide, one of the bomb's components is a ""p-line"" product, which means that customers have to speak to the pharmacist before it can be purchased. But evidence suggested that Hassan was also discussing targets, at one point searching for: ""Why is UK not fearful of attacks like Germany and France."" Anne Whyte QC, prosecuting, told the jury at the Old Bailey: ""Rowaida Hassan was the educated assistant with a rallying cry when he needed it and the pharmaceutical knowledge to help. ""Munir Mohammed was the active heavy lifter. They were both assets to ISIS in their different ways."" DCI Paul Greenwood of the North-East Counter-Terrorism Unit, said: ""We consider that Mohammed was in the later stages of a plot. He had bought the chemicals and although he had not had the tasking, there was a high risk that he could have launched an attack by Christmas."" Ms Whyte said: ""This is a case which reflects the age in which we live. It demonstrates the relative ease with which acts of terrorism can be prepared, thanks to the internet. ""The prosecution allege that Munir Mohammed had resolved upon a lone wolf attack and that Rowaida el-Hassan was aware of his engagement with such a plan."" The jury was told that Mohammed was in contact over Facebook with an IS commander, who used the online identity Abubakr Kurdi. ""Kurdi was the one to give instructions and Mohammed was to carry them out"", prosecutors said. At one point, Rowaida el-Hassan messaged Munir Mohammed: ""Oh you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you and let them find harshness in you. ""Perform jihad in Allah's cause for jihad is a tremendous door leading to paradise, through it Allah saves one from sadness and grief."" Mohammed accessed a video on how to make a crude version of ricin, titled: ""Jihadi ideas for Lonely Lions."" In the space of three months Mohammed also downloaded three separate videos which showed how to make a bomb. He had an IS video which showed how to make TATP, a YouTube video showing how to make TATP into a plastic explosive and an Arabic video which showed how to make a shaped charge."
2018-01-09,Vauxhall is to cut a further 250 jobs at its plant in Cheshire as it slashes production of the Astra.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/vauxhall-cuts-further-250-jobs-at-ellesmere-port-factory-11200360,"The carmaker, sold to Peugeot owner PSA by General Motors last year, said the losses would be on top of 400 redundancies announced in October as it moves to a single daily manufacturing shift from April to bolster its competitiveness. It said the latest decision amounted to an extension of the voluntary redundancy scheme revealed in the autumn - launched in response to falling sales. Vauxhall said: ""At a meeting held on Thursday 4 January 2018 between representatives from Vauxhall Motors and Unite the Union, the company explained that although the initial voluntary separation programme at its Ellesmere Port plant announced in October (aligned to adjustment of production volumes in order to protect its future) has been successful, it needs to initiate a further voluntary programme for eligible employees of a further 250 heads in the period from April to the end of September 2018. ""The teams are conscious of the need to accelerate the recovery of plant productivity in order to meet the challenges ahead and as an important element of this recovery, this additional separation programme will support the planned move to a single production shift at Ellesmere Port during April 2018."" The statement added: ""Vauxhall Management affirmed the company's continued commitment to the Astra plant at Ellesmere Port. ""The company remains confident in the ability of the Ellesmere Port workforce to deliver the necessary improvements in financial performance."" Sales of the Astra - built at the factory since 1979 - slowed to just shy of 50,000 cars in 2017 from more than 60,000 in the previous year. It was the UK's sixth-favourite new model but has traditionally trailed Ford's most popular competitors and the likes of the VW Golf. Ellesmere Port has been producing 680 models daily in recent times - before the decision to cut down the workforce. At the time of Vauxhall's £1.9bn sale to PSA, the buyer made clear its plant network across Europe was in a race for competitiveness because future investment would depend on ""performance"". The car industry in the UK has distanced itself from suggestions it has benefited from the collapse in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote - insisting it is having to pay suppliers outside the UK more for parts. Commenting on Vauxhall's plans, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""This is an additional blow to a world-class workforce that is one of the most efficient in the industry. He added: ""PSA must provide investment guarantees on new models for Ellesmere Port as a matter of urgency. ""The government must play its part too and provide guarantees on frictionless trade after Brexit. ""Unite's priority is to support our members and protect this plant. We will not tolerate compulsory redundancies and Unite will leave no stone unturned in securing the long term future of Ellesmere Port and the highly skilled workforce."""

It is estimated up to 51 trillion microbeads are currently in our oceans, while a single shower can flush away an estimated 100,000 microbeads. They are then ingested by marine life and even end up entering our food chain. Environment minister Therese Coffey told Sky News that the ban is part of a wider plan to cut down on plastic pollution. She said: ""We know that any plastic in the marine environment is not good and we know that animals consume this. ""They can be ingested directly into the fish and while we're still looking for extra evidence on the impact on human health, the point is that they don't need to be there and that's why we've taken the steps to have this ban."" :: SNP politician calls for plastic straw tax The ban has been welcomed by campaigners and cosmetic companies which already use natural alternatives to microbeads. Tipper Lewis, from organic skincare company Neal's Yard, said: ""We think the ban is absolutely fantastic. ""We use all sorts of things instead of plastic; rosehip seed powder which we can use for facial products, we've got pumice powder which we use in body products, it's a bit more exfoliating… and we've got ground rice powder which we use in our facial scrubs as well. ""The benefits of these is they're all biodegradable so they break down in the oceans, they don't get into the food chains and we don't end up eating them."" :: 'Latte levy' would boost recycling rates - MPs Mary Creagh, who chairs the Environment Audit Committee, said the ban was a ""good thing"" but the Government must go ""much further, much faster"". The MP said: ""We need to look at how plastic has invaded every area of our life. ""Since the ban recommendation, my committee has also recommended that we should have a deposit return scheme, the latte levy because of the recyclability of coffee cups and we've also recommended that producers who make hard to recycle products are forced to pay more for them."" Although manufacturing microbead products has been banned, they will not be removed from shop shelves completely until July."

",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180109123134/https://news.sky.com/story/endangered-stick-insects-breed-at-bristol-zoo-11200334,"Two Lord Howe stick insects - which were once thought to have gone extinct - have produced eggs. The pair were themselves the product of a breeding programme, despite the species being ""incredibly difficult"" to look after. The zoo says its is first time a second generation of eggs has ever been laid outside of the creatures' native Australia. Bristol Zoo were sent the first batch of eggs of the insect, nicknamed 'tree lobsters', in 2015, when 300 arrived from Melbourne Zoo. The eggs were flown in carefully packaged batches of 50, placed in sterilised sand, and transported in a climate-controlled part of a cargo hold. In three years, zoo keepers have worked with San Diego Zoo and Toronto Zoo to save the species. The larvae of six of the 300 eggs managed to reach adulthood. Those six then produced larvae of their own. Five of these subsequent babies also reached adulthood, and two of those have now produced eggs of their own. Fully grown adults are wingless and nocturnal and can only eat one species of a plant which has to be specially grown by horticulturists at the zoo. Since 2002, the insect has been categorised as 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) whose red list tracks species numbers in the world. It originates on Lord Howe Island, a remote island about 300 miles off the coast of eastern Australia. They were thought to have been driven to extinction after black rats invaded their habitat from a British supply ship stranded in 1918. A small colony was found in 2001 on Ball's Pyramid, a volcanic outcrop 12 miles offshore from Lord Howe Island. There are now an estimated 20-30 of the insects left. Mark Bushell, Curator of Invertebrates at Bristol Zoo, called the new eggs ""one of our biggest achievements"". He said: ""We had our suspicions that the females might soon lay eggs, but to find eggs on New Year's Eve is a great end to an already successful year, and a fantastic start to 2018. ""We have been tirelessly working with this critically endangered species for two years now, and to have achieved this success after such a lot of hard work and dedication is truly fantastic."""

God forbid, unless a plane crashes through his roof, he'll be there one way or the other. ""So any rumour to the contrary is... my favourite new word is becoming 'oh rubbish'. Yeah, so he will be there."" Samantha, from her father's first marriage, also swerved questions on a tweet she posted, which had been interpreted as criticising Prince Harry. The tweet was thought to be in reaction to a comment by Harry that his fiancée was gaining a family she ""never had"". :: Trump Royal wedding snub 'could hit post-Brexit trade deal' She insisted Harry's comments were not ""hurtful"" and added: ""My response was very positive, verbatim, and taken far out of context. ""There was never slamming, it was never negative. ""And, you know, so respectfully so, Harry said a lovely thing. But, and it's true, marrying merely extends that family."" The response follows Harry's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme after the couple spent Christmas together with the royal family. He told presenter Sarah Montague: ""She's done an absolutely amazing job. She's getting in there and it's the family I suppose that she's never had."" Samantha then tweeted: ""Actually she has a large family who were always there with her and for her."" The actress's mother Doria Ragland divorced Mr Markle when Meghan was six.

The nursery, which she will be attending full-time, uses lots of play to help children learn. Founded in 1964, it offers a range of classes including French, dance, sport and music. Each child's development is monitored by an allocated member of staff. It is rated outstanding by Ofsted and described by Tatler magazine as a ""hidden gem"". It is not the first time that pregnant Kate, 36 on Tuesday, has taken official photographs herself. The Duchess released pictures of her newborn daughter in 2015, taken at her and William's home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. Kate, who accepted a lifetime honorary membership of the Royal Photographic Society last year, is a keen amateur photographer. The society recognised her ""talent and enthusiasm"".

The 33-year-old shop worker, who said she got the tablets from a friend, told an Egyptian court she had brought the painkillers for her boyfriend Omar Caboo, who suffers from severe back pain. She claimed she did not know what she was doing was against the law. Authorities in the UK have since launched their own investigation into how Plummer obtained the prescription medication, which was found in her suitcase. ""Following the arrest and subsequent conviction of Laura Plummer, we are looking into the circumstances of how the prescription drugs came to be in her possession and if any further individual has committed any offences,"" said detective inspector Jon Cross. ""This investigation is still ongoing. If you have information you believe could assist us in this inquiry, please call 101."" Plummer, from Hull, was arrested on 9 October at Hurghada International Airport. Her initial trial hearing on Christmas Day had to be adjourned as she reportedly broke down in court. The woman's family previously described her as ""daft"" and insisted she had no idea what she was doing was illegal. Plummer's sister, Rachel, said their mother Roberta Synclair, who travelled to Egypt for the hearings, was ""devastated"" following the sentencing. The family's local MP, Karl Turner, also described the sentence as ""devastating"" following the verdict on Boxing Day but said it could have been much worse. He told Sky News: ""She's been very anxious, she's suffered sleep deprivation, she's not been well in terms of her mental health and her physical health."" The Hull East MP also urged Egyptian authorities to ""think very hard about what this means to people in the UK who are considering travelling (there)"". It is believed Plummer will appeal the sentence as supporters continue to argue the painkillers were not hidden away in her suitcase."

Sources said the agenda would be largely Brexit-focused but could also cover areas such as corporate remuneration, with ministers keen to avoid damaging headlines about lavish boardroom pay during a period when the NHS is experiencing intense resourcing problems. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, is also expected to attend the meeting, which will take place against a more optimistic backdrop than previous meetings between Mrs May and financial services industry chiefs. Among those attending are expected to be Mark Wilson, chief executive of Aviva, the insurer; Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International; Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC Holdings; and Paul Manduca, the Prudential chairman. Pleased to see the PM @theresa_may and hear her views on how we can keep the City a vibrant centre of finance. https://t.co/Vsv3KyfASQ The meeting with City bosses will come a day after Mr Hammond and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, have travelled to Germany to appeal to business leaders for help in securing a trade deal which includes financial services. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has insisted that there will be no ""special deal"" for the City, despite warnings that it would drive up costs for European companies which rely on London to finance themselves cheaply. In an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, Mr Hammond and Mr Davis wrote that a Brexit deal which forced the fragmentation of the EU's financial services sector would pose a risk to financial stability. ""It makes no sense to either Germany or Britain to put in place unnecessary barriers to trade in goods and services that would only damage businesses and economic growth on both sides of the Channel,"" they argued. Financial services companies which trade across EU borders want a deal as close as possible to the current arrangements despite the fact that the UK will no longer be part of the EU single market or customs union. Mr Davis has described the desired outcome as ""Canada plus plus plus"", in reference to the country's low-tariff free trade deal with the EU, but with services also encompassed by it. Although many City executives feel more positive about the prospects for the UK's future relationship with the EU after last month's decision to move onto trade talks, the continuing possibility of a ""no deal"" exit means that companies continue to progress their contingency plans. Goldman Sachs International, which employs about 6,000 people in the UK, is among the international firms which have talked about the impact that the loss of passporting rights is likely to have on their UK-based operations. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive, has talked up the attractions of rival financial centres including Frankfurt and Paris in a series of tweets which have raised expectations that it will relocate substantial numbers of jobs from London. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the EU had started to warn UK-based employers of new regulatory barriers that will threaten their ability to trade with EU markets after Brexit. A Number 10 spokesman declined to comment, while none of the companies invited to Thursday's meeting would comment."

The identity of the dead man emerged in a questionnaire that has been handed out to residents. Police told neighbours they are investigating the death of Kenneth Coombes, who they said would have been in his late 80s in 2005. Investigators found Mr Coombes' body on Tuesday night after a 63-year-old woman walked into a police station on Sunday and confessed she had killed a man ""a number of years ago"". Neighbour Stella Ashton said: ""Police came yesterday. Just asked if I had heard anything, any whispers.

""All the neighbours are shocked and everyone is talking about it, but no one seems to know much about that family."" A Home Office post-mortem examination is due to take place to establish Mr Coombes' cause of death. Neighbours said Barbara Coombes was quiet, and usually only ever seen out walking her small dog when she would say no more than ""hello"" to passers-by. Another local described the family as ""odd"". Also registered at the address is Islay Coombes, a 29-year-old a student who is believed to be Barbara Coombes' daughter. Police said the woman arrested on Sunday remains in custody for questioning and appealed for anyone with information to come forward. Detective Inspector Dan Clegg, from GMP's major incident team, said: ""The investigation is still in its early stages and many questions still need answers.

An estimated 300 to 400 people were flown out of the Swiss resort on Tuesday and the flights resumed again today. Thirteen thousand people have been stuck in Zermatt - which sits a the foot of the iconic Matterhorn peak - for two days with roads and rail shut off. In France, the search for a 39-year-old British skier who went missing in ""terrible weather"" on Sunday is continuing. The reopening of Zermatt's rail line on Wednesday morning was delayed after pilots spotted a new snow mass left by an avalanche, but officials say they are ""confident to open the railway in the afternoon"". Clearing the line is vital, as it allows people to reach the nearby village of Tasch from where they can get buses to the airports. ""The persons in charge are working with high pressure,"" a statement on Zermatt's website said on Tuesday, as tourists - many who should have been back at work - settled in for another night.

But heavy snow has hit across the region, and rescuers are still searching for Briton John Bromell, who went missing in the French resort of Tignes on Sunday. The 39-year-old from Lincolnshire disappeared in bad weather and was last seen on the Paquis chairlift at 4.30pm. Police said he was wearing a multi-coloured hat with a pompom and a checked jacket. The hunt for Mr Bromell was initially hampered by the conditions but now a helicopter has joined the search. Elsewhere, a skier was killed after avalanches in Aranouet in the French Pyenees, while an avalanche hit a five-storey building in Sestriere in Italy after two metres of snow fell there in 48 hours. Broken branches and snow smashed their way into corridors and some apartments but the 29 people staying there escaped unharmed through the garage. About 100 people in the town's Olympic village complex were also evacuated over fears the roof could collapse because of the weight of snow."

Solicitors for 11 victims have written to the Probation Service demanding that Worboys is banned from Greater London, where most of them live, and is prohibited from contacting them ""under any circumstances"". Last week, a Ministry of Justice letter informing the victims of Worboys' imminent release said he could not approach or contact them ""without prior approval of the supervising officer"". Their solicitor Richard Scorer, of Slater and Gordon, said: ""It is unbelievable that Worboys' victims have not been consulted on their attacker’s licence conditions when they are living in fear of his release.

The Ministry of Justice insisted that any victim who signed up to the Victim Contact Scheme would be consulted before the 14 conditions were finalised. One victim said: ""I just spoke to my victim liaison officer. She said they are meeting to discuss his conditions tomorrow. ""I've told her I want an exclusion zone - Greater London.

Published in the Journal of Ethnobiology, the paper describes intentional fire-spreading by ""firehawk"" raptors in northern Australia - a phenomenon which has been witnessed for thousands of years. ""We're not discovering anything,"" the paper's co-author Mark Bonta told National Geographic. ""Most of the data that we've worked with is collaborative with Aboriginal peoples... they've known this for probably 40,000 years or more."" In northern Australia the black kite (Milvus migrans), whistling kite (Haliastur sphenurus) and the brown falcon (Falco berigora) are known as firehawks. Report co-author Bob Gosford, an Australian indigenous-rights lawyer and ornithologist, said that the firehawks are known to excel with hunting in bushfire conditions. ""Black kites and brown falcons come to these fronts because it is just literally a killing frenzy,"" Mr Gosford told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""It's a feeding frenzy, because out of these grasslands come small birds, lizards, insects, everything fleeing the front of the fire."" Bushfires are frequent during the Australian summer, and tree species such as eucalyptus have evolved to thrive because of the fires. Mr Gosford said he had not witnessed a hawk spreading fire, but some of his co-authors had. The birds are not capable of starting the fires themselves, but have been seen carrying smouldering or flaming sticks in their beaks or talons to spread the fire to where prey may be sheltering. ""The birds aren't starting fires from scratch, but it's the next best thing,"" Mr Bonta told The Washington Post last year. ""There's an immense amount of aboriginal knowledge of the birds in this country that I firmly believe that for science and land management, if there was greater recognition of it, we'd be a much better place,"" said Mr Gosford."

However, the headteacher of Wednesbury Oak Academy in Tipton has defended it, saying the equipment bag for ""fun-time lunchtime play"" is being run as an ""extra"" and the school is ""outstanding"". The petition claims pupils have been separated into groups of ""paid"" and ""unpaid"" students in the playground. It said: ""This has caused outright disgust from children, parents, grandparents, staff and such like. ""The parents that have paid and parents that haven't are totally against the separation of the children as this can cause upset, bullying and social exclusion amongst other things. ""We therefore request the 'scheme' to be discontinued as it's just not something that any of us wish to be associated with."" Mother-of-two Kirsty Williams, 28, told the Express and Star: ""We were asked to make the payment before Christmas but it was voluntary. ""It was a voluntary payment for sports equipment even though they had £9,000 for equipment. It is bullying really - they are separating the rich from the poor."" According to the paper, an unnamed mother of three, branded the move ""disgusting"". She said: ""I'm a parent and I found it really disgusting what's going on. If you don't pay the £6 the other kids can't play with the equipment. ""We have to pay £6 a year, it's per child, I don't think this is fair. That is £18 that could go towards the uniforms."" She went on: ""It's discrimination against the other kids, I don't think it is fair especially the way they treated some of the kids."" The school principal, Maria Bull, told the Express and Star: ""This is a parent council initiative and the parent council came up with this way back in May 2017. ""We currently have 80 children whose parents have made this payment out of 450. To be fair the parents have had since May so as I say, they are running this for the 80 children concerned. ""It is not like the children haven't got other equipment on the playground. It is being run as an extra, just like we ran extra activities, we run school discos as extra activities, we run all of this as a voluntary basis."""
2018-01-10,"The new Culture Secretary Matt Hancock has vowed to overturn a House of Lords vote on press regulation which he claims is a ""hammer blow"" to local papers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/government-defeated-as-lords-vote-for-fresh-inquiry-into-press-ethics-11202884,"In a double defeat for the Government, peers voted by 238 votes to 209 - a majority of 29 - for the go-ahead to part two of the Leveson Inquiry into the conduct of the press. They also voted by 211 votes to 200, a majority of 11, for another amendment to the Government's Data Protection Bill, which would make newspapers face big bills in data protection disputes. Under this proposal, newspapers not signed up to a state-supported regulator would have to pay their own and their opponent's legal costs, even if they were successful in court. But immediately after the Government defeats, which had been widely predicted, Mr Hancock pledged to attempt to overturn them in the House of Commons. ""House of Lords have just voted to restrict press freedoms,"" he tweeted. ""This vote will undermine high-quality journalism, fail to resolve challenges the media face and is a hammer blow to local press. ""We support a free press and will seek to overturn these amendments in the Commons."" But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said the Lords' vote was an ""important step towards justice"". He said: ""In 2012, all parties made a promise to the victims of phone hacking. ""At many times since then the Tories have tried to renege on that promise. ""Unlike the Tories, Labour has always stood by the victims of hacking and press intrusion with promises in each of our past manifestos to enact all the recommendations of Leveson. ""These votes send a signal to the Tories: that they must keep their promises."" The first amendment to the Data Protection Bill, requiring the Government to hold a public inquiry into ""corporate governance and management failures"" in the press, was moved by Baroness Hollins, who said her family have been a victim of press intrusion. Lady Hollins said her eyes were opened to ""inaccurate, corrupt and illegal practices"" in the press after her daughter Abigail Witchalls was left paralysed after being stabbed in 2005. The independent crossbench peer, a professor of psychiatry, gave evidence in the first Leveson Inquiry - set up by David Cameron in 2011 after the phone hacking scandal - accusing the press of intrusion into her family life following the incident. Speaking of her own experience, she said one of the consequences of having data stolen was that she had started to suspect people she knew of speaking to the media. ""I stopped trusting people, even people in my own family, my neighbours and my best friends,"" she said. ""I did not trust them. I did not know about hacking and blagging."" But Tory peer Lord Black of Brentwood, executive director of the Telegraph Media Group, noted the amendment on Leveson 2 did not mention the police or politicians and that the ""target is four-square the press"". He argued a further costly inquiry was ""completely unnecessary because there genuinely is nothing left to unearth"". ""The spectre of yet another inquiry is a toxic threat to a free and independent press,"" he added."
2018-01-10,Meghan Markle has shut down all of her social media accounts ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry in May.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/meghan-markle-closes-her-instagram-facebook-and-twitter-accounts-11202152,"Kensington Palace confirmed the 36-year-old American actress is no longer a Facebook, Twitter and Instagram user. The palace said: ""Ms Markle is grateful to everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years. ""However, as she has not used these accounts for some time, she has taken the decision to close them."" The move is in line with Royal tradition and comes after the Suits star closed her lifestyle blog The Tig in April last year. However, Royal watchers need not despair, for like Kate Middleton, aspects of her life as a Royal will continue to feature on Kensington Palace's official account. Sky's Royal Correspondent Rhiannon Mills said: ""Meghan Markle was very vocal and active on her Twitter and Instagram accounts. ""It was the way she built 'her brand', sharing her life with her fans and more significantly her views on everything from political participation to racial equality. ""It is another sign of her rapid induction into 'Team Windsor' and a reminder that she will now have to be more careful about how she shares her views on the world. The Royals are after all expected to be politically neutral. ""This isn't a sign that social media isn't important to the Royals. Over the past few years like any big organisation, they have increasingly focused on how they can use these new platforms to reach out to their loyal followers."" Thank you @ReprezentRadio for welcoming Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle to your station this afternoon! 🎧 pic.twitter.com/PB0xL2Hx6v She added: ""The fact that Harry and Meghan decided to release their third official engagement portrait on Instagram as a thank you for all the messages of congratulations is also a sign of how significant social media will continue to be in their married life."" Earlier this week, the palace issued photographs of Princess Charlotte's first day at nursery. On Tuesday, Miss Markle and Prince Harry carried out their second official engagement and visited Brixton radio station Reprezent, which trains youngsters in media skills. The couple will tie the knot on 19 May at St George's Chapel in Windsor, and the pair have previously said they want the public to feel a part of the celebrations."
2018-01-10,The Army is too small. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/do-new-adverts-misrepresent-the-british-army-11202241,"In 2010 it was dramatically reduced in size to save money - from a strength of 110,000 down to 82,000. Today it is even smaller - the latest figures put its strength at 78,000. There is room to grow. At some expense, the Army hired an external firm, Capita, to solve this problem. Capita has done extensive market research and has come up with five demographics who feel they might not belong in the Army. Some former officers have criticised the adverts for misrepresenting the Army - their argument is that the macho culture is a necessary part of joining the army. :: New Army adverts tell potential recruits it is okay to cry, be gay and practice your faith The military is a war-fighting machine not a kid's club, they say. It is important to note, however, that these adverts are part of a wider campaign - they are not supposed to sum up the entire culture of the Army in 30 seconds. The Army's problem isn't with recruitment. In 2016, 91,460 people applied to join. Last year that increased to 122,890. Where the army does have a problem is in retention. Between April 2016 and March 2017 8,194 people joined the Army but 9,775 left. The budgets cuts and whittling down of perks and incentives are having an effect. Army adverts have traditionally concentrated on the physical aspects, and benefits, to soldiering. This new focus on the emotional side of service is different and an attempt to showcase a modern military accepting of all. The Army might feel, and with some justification, that it is damned if it does, damned if it doesn't."
2018-01-10,Britain's multi-billion pound Brexit bill will be investigated by a watchdog over whether it represents good value for taxpayers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-bill-probed-over-reasonableness-concern-by-spending-watchdog-11202533,"Public spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) announced it will deliver a final verdict on the estimated £39bn divorce sum in March. It comes after a direct intervention by Nicky Morgan, a senior rebel Tory MP who chairs the Commons' Treasury Select Committee. Ms Morgan called on the NAO to probe ""the reasonableness of the payment"" so MPs could better scrutinise the Government's Brexit deal. She said: ""Various wide-ranging sums for the UK's withdrawal payment to the EU have been bandied about. Last month, the Prime Minister told Parliament that the so-called Brexit divorce bill will be £35-39 billion. ""Parliament must be able to scrutinise the reasonableness of this bill. ""Accordingly, I have written to Sir Amyas to request that the NAO examines the withdrawal payment, including the assumptions and methodologies used."" Ms Morgan was a fierce campaigner for Remain in the EU referendum and has spoken out against her party's position on Brexit after being fired by Theresa May in July 2016. Responding to her, NAO auditor general Sir Amywas Morse announced: ""I can confirm that we intend to report on the main elements of the financial settlement with the EU. ""We are already in discussions with HM Treasury aimed at planning our work. I expect our report to be published in late March."" Chris Leslie, a Labour MP and member of the pro-EU campaign Open Britain, claimed it was right to investigate. He said: ""With our NHS in crisis and public services struggling, the Government must be transparent about how all taxpayers' money in spent, so it is right for the National Audit Office to investigate the Brexit divorce bill. ""The economic cost of Brexit will be huge - this is just the tip of the iceberg. ""If the British people decide these costs aren't worth it, they have every right to keep an open mind about whether it's really the right path for the country."" The probe will likely rile ardent Brexiteers, some of whom think the UK should pay Brussels nothing, and others who have resigned the country to the sum as a price for freedom from the EU."
2018-01-10,"Philip Hammond has called on Europe's leaders to spell out what they want from Brexit, declaring: ""It takes two to tango.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-hammond-calls-on-eu-leaders-for-clarity-on-future-relationship-11202920,"The Chancellor, seen as the Cabinet's leading Remainer, made his plea in a speech to business leaders in Berlin during a visit to Germany billed as a charm offensive. After a joint plea with Brexit Secretary David Davis for tariff-free trade between the UK and Germany, Mr Hammond appealed for co-operation and no ""punishment"" for Brexit. The Chancellor's speech was a riposte to the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who 24 hours earlier complained about a lack of detailed UK proposals on trade. Speaking at the Die Welt economic summit dinner, Mr Hammond said: ""They say 'it takes two to tango'. Both sides need to be clear about what they want from a future relationship. ""I know the repeated complaint from Brussels has been that the UK 'hasn't made up its mind as to what type of relationship it wants'. ""But in London, many feel that we have little, if any, signal of what future relationship the EU27 would like to have with a post-Brexit Britain."" Mr Hammond said that since the EU referendum there had been a relative silence from Europe on what the EU wanted the future relationship with the UK to be like. ""I am saying this to you tonight because I fear many EU opinion formers see this as a question only for British politicians for British voters to resolve, before they engage with the EU27,"" he added. ""By signalling a willingness to work together in a spirit of pragmatic cooperation on a future, mutually beneficial partnership, based on high levels of access for goods and services, continued close cooperation in security and defence, in education, science, technology, and culture. ""Putting behind us any narrative of 'punishment' for leaving and focusing on the mutually beneficial relationships we have now and can continue in the future, the EU will send a message to the British people which will resonate as they consider the options for their future. And that is my challenge to you."" In his speech earlier, Mr Barnier said: ""What kind of future relationship does the UK want with the European Union? We don't yet have the answer to this question."" The trade plea from Mr Hammond and Mr Davis, who was also visiting Germany for Brexit talks, came in a jointly-written article for a Frankfurt newspaper. ""As two of Europe's biggest economies, it makes no sense to either Germany or Britain to put in place unnecessary barriers to trade in goods and services that would only damage businesses and economic growth on both sides of the Channel,"" they wrote."
2018-01-10,"Nine of the 10 ambulance services in England have declared the second-highest level of alert in response to the NHS winter crisis, indicating they are facing ""severe pressure"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-crisis-nine-in-10-ambulance-services-in-england-under-severe-pressure-11202967,"Ambulance trusts operate four alert levels known as Resource Escalation Action Plans (REAP), ranging from level one, indicating a steady state, to level four for extreme pressure. A Sky News survey found only the London Ambulance Service was operating below REAP level three. It is currently on REAP level two, which indicates moderate pressure. The other nine - the East Midlands, East of England, North East, North West, South Central, South East Coast, South Western, West Midlands and Yorkshire ambulance services - have all declared REAP level three. The news comes after an 81-year-old woman died last week in Clacton, Essex, while waiting almost four hours for paramedics to arrive. Sky News spent a day with West Midlands Ambulance Service (WMAS), which operates about 350 ambulances from 15 hubs across the region, with 99% of ambulances crewed by at least one paramedic. :: Why is there always a winter crisis in the NHS? The service has received a record number of calls this winter, with the control centre handling 15% more than this time a year ago. Pressure on hospitals means they have also been affected by ""handover delays"", which is when it takes longer than the recommended 30 minutes to pass a patient to hospital staff and prepare the ambulance for the next call. WMAS said more than 900 patients have had to wait more than an hour, and the delays are costing them the equivalent of 23 12-hour shifts every day. Several hospitals served by the trust, including those in Worcester, Stoke and Dudley, have faced severe pressure over the New Year period. A high number of callouts that do not require hospital treatment is also impacting the service, with only 60% of calls requiring transportation to hospital or other medical services. Travelling with paramedic Simon Wong and technician Sonia Nawaz, we saw them deal with a succession of elderly patients, some of whom did not need urgent medical care but were transported to hospital because a lack of social care meant it was unsafe for them to remain at home. Nathan Hudson, an assistant chief officer at WMAS, said: ""You hear lots of things about the NHS being in crisis but for us this is just winter, and it comes every year. ""We have found it incredibly challenging not just with the excessive demand and on top of that we had the snow that came before Christmas. Staff have been fantastic, without them we would not have been able to cope. ""The biggest danger of delays is patients' safety. When ambulances are delayed at hospital they are not out on the road getting to patients who need them."""
2018-01-10,"Jack and Sarah Hawkins lost their baby Harriet while Sarah was giving birth to her in April 2016. Now, a report has found a series of 13 failings in care which led to her death.

When I was told Harriet was dead, when she was still inside me, what I felt was disbelief. I felt completely numb. Then I had to go through several hours of labour before I gave birth to her. It was total disbelief and numbness. To have it officially acknowledged that I was in prolonged, undiagnosed labour, and that her death was certainly preventable is a relief. The report's authors were open and honest, and listened to our story - but the trust has not yet heard it. We are not sure what the trust is thinking, or what they have changed. They have accepted the report but we do not know what action they are going to take. They have sent what we consider to be a standard response to these kinds of reports. What we don't feel we have had is a proper apology. We don't feel the trust has recognised and taken responsibility for what happened. It is lovely to have an apology from the new chief executive, but she wasn't there at the time and it feels like something is missing. More staff is good but what went wrong for us were clinical issues, not staffing concerns. As staff members in that same trust, we trusted our colleagues and the NHS to deliver our perfectly healthy, full-term baby alive, and that got us a dead baby. No one has listened to us, they have not been open and honest. It has taken 20 months to get this report out, when hours after she died we were raising concerns. We got the blame, and Harriet got the blame. As we were in the trust, and have a clinical background, we were able to hold it together and escalate this to the right people at the right time. But we are concerned that there have been similar cases since Harriet's death and that other families and couples do not have our advantage. If we had not been clinical, we could have gone away from that first meeting and thought it was very sad but we knew it was preventable. We were at an advantage but we are concerned about those who are not in our position. Whilst we do feel dissatisfied with the trust, the clinical commissioning group had a wholly different attitude, being inclusive, supportive, thoughtful and kind and they wanted to join us in making the service better. This is just the start. We are bringing a civil claim for damages. We will be making referrals to the CPS and the Health and Safety Executive, as well as referrals based on the report of specific staff to the professional bodies. We will also be able to have Harriet's funeral, which will be an important emotional time for us. We have been so disturbed by the attitude of the NUH that we could not hold it. We did the right thing, but having your daughter's body in a mortuary for 20 months is tough. We hoped to have it in December and reset this New Year, but we will now hold it in the next couple of weeks and be able to grieve. We could have had it as soon as she had died if the trust had been open and honest, but this has compounded our mental and physical illness. In a statement made to Sky News, Tracey Taylor, the Chief Executive of Nottingham University Hospital accepted the findings and added: ""I offer my deepest sympathy to Sarah and Jack. ""I profoundly apologise that we let them and Harriet down so badly. NUH has acknowledged that it is likely Harriet would have survived had it not been for several shortcomings in care."""

He said they talked through every single item individually and Mr Barnier looked forward to tasting the Scottish gin. Mr Woolfe said the gifts will help Mr Barnier to ""fully grasp the powerful commercial position Britain occupies globally and how a deal between Europe's third largest economy and the EU trading block is in both sides' interests"". ""Our gifts help illustrate our rich cultural and commercial offering and the UK's position on the world stage,"" he added. Mr Woolfe said he hoped the hamper would help the EU's negotiators engage a more positive tone in the upcoming trade talks.

He appeared in court in the Siberian city of Irkutsk for a first hearing during which prosecutors read out the charges. Popkov killed the women with a hammer or axe after offering them lifts late at night, sometimes in his police car, while he was off duty near his hometown. Russian media have nicknamed him ""the werewolf"" and the ""Angarsk maniac"". Popkov, 53, told the Meduza news site in December that he viewed himself as a ""cleaner"" who was purging his city of prostitutes. He said he had targeted women who were drunk or he viewed as immoral. His victims did include prostitutes and drug addicts, but most were ordinary women with families, said investigator Yevgeny Karchevsky. He was finally caught in 2012 after investigators DNA-tested people who drove cars matching tyre tracks found at the crime scenes. Popkov later showed police where he had buried his victims' bodies. ""His diagnosis is homicidal maniac, that he has an uncontrollable desire to commit murders,"" Mr Karchevsky told Meduza. He added that Popkov is seen as having a personality disorder but is not judged to be insane. If convicted over the 81 deaths, he would be the most prolific killer in Russia's recent history, eclipsing ""chessboard killer Alexander Pichushkin, who murdered 48, and Andrei Chikatilo, who killed 52."

Mr Farage had spent the previous 45 minutes inside the nerve centre of the European Union, the organisation he's spent decades trying to destroy, meeting a man for whom the EU is a fundamental force for good - Michel Barnier, the bloc's Brexit negotiator. He'd written to Mr Barnier back in October requesting the meeting. ""As you appear to be conducting a series of meetings with UK political figures on the issue of Brexit, I wish to make a request,"" he wrote. ""It seems that you are listening to a group of people who want to stop or delay Brexit. I will come to speak for the 17.4 million who did not vote for a transition deal or any further delays and whose resolve is getting stronger."" :: Farage meets Barnier: 'Brexit talks will continue to be difficult Mr Farage was worried that Mr Barnier was hearing only one side of the Brexit story - and it wasn't the Brexit side. Meetings with high-profile remainers like Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis, Ken Clarke and others helped to push that fear. In truth, Mr Barnier does meet people and hear the views of people on both sides of the Brexit divide - not least his opposite number David Davis, the Brexit Secretary and a firm Brexiteer. Still, the meeting was duly granted at the start of a week when Mr Barnier will also meet other Brexiteers including Steven Woolfe MEP (formerly of UKIP, now independent), Lord Digby Jones (former director of the CBI), John Mills (chair of Labour Leave) and John Longworth (co-chair of Leave Means Leave). It was off-camera and Mr Farage said no photos were taken. So, how did it go? ""I always said he would be very civil and indeed he was very civil. Coffee was offered which I thought was very nice…"" said a beaming, trilby-sporting Mr Farage, as he emerged from the meeting. ""I genuinely don't think he understands why people voted for Brexit, I really don't think he gets it. When I suggested to him that it might be something to do with open door immigration from within the EU, he almost looked at me with incredulity as if to say 'well surely wasn't it outside the EU migration that was the issue'. He didn't understand that. ""Was it a fruitful meeting?"" I asked him. ""Well I genuinely thought that the views of the 17.4m had not been expressed before to Mr Barnier and the meeting confirmed that, yes,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody has been to see him to really make that point that immigration was front and centre of that campaign. It was what motivated millions of people who don't normally vote to go out in the referendum and basically, where have we got to in terms of our debate in terms of our debate, our negotiations - I'll tell you, nowhere."" Mr Farage continued: ""I asked him - 'Who do you represent? Do you represent Brussels?' Do you represent these glass and steel structures? ""Do you represent the people here - you know, 10,000 people here earning more than the British Prime Minister with pensions and all the rest of it? Is that what you represent or do you represent the workers in the member states?' Of course he said, they are both the same thing. I am not so sure they are."" A German reporter snapped back: ""Who do you represent then? What are you doing?'"" ""Well, umm, I am trying to represent the view of those who voted Brexit because it's not really being heard. You know we didn't vote for transition deals. ""We didn't vote to sort of kick this into the long grass so that it's at least going to be six years from Brexit that we can sign a trade deal with anyone else or have any degree of control over our borders with the rest of the EU."" We don't know what Mr Barnier thought of the meeting. He's said nothing."

The two suspects, who were dressed in dark clothing and motorcycle crash helmets, threatened two security guards who were refilling a cash machine. One of the guards was shot in the leg at close range three times by one of the gang. It left him requiring hospital treatment for a week and with a ""severe psychological impact"". Scotland Yard say all the offences occurred between May and August 2016 and three of the other four involved the use of a gun. The first involved suspects robbing Cyprofood, a 24-hour cash and carry in Tottenham. Crimestoppers is offering a reward of £5,000 for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the armed robberies. Detective Chief Inspector Nick Blackburn, of the Met’s Flying Squad, said: ""An increasing amount of violence is being used during these offences and we need the public’s help to identify the suspects, their firearms and the stolen cars they escaped in. ""In the latest offence, a guard was shot a number of times at close range. Fortunately, he has recovered from his physical injuries but has suffered a severe psychological impact from the incident. ""Any piece of information, no matter how small, could be what we need to identify the men responsible for these crimes.""

Many of the hundreds of mourners at the service wore items of pink clothing - as she liked the colour. The 30-year-old's husband Malcolm Willsher, who was one of the pallbearers who escorted her coffin into church, said he was lucky to have married her. Their daughter Megan walked behind, holding relatives' hands as the coffin was taken along the path of Christ Church, past hundreds of friends and family. In a eulogy, Mr Willsher said his wife and Megan were ""more than mother and daughter, they were best friends"" and ""the bond was beautiful to see"". He said Megan, who wore a pink and grey scarf as well as large pink fabric flower, was ""Jodie's greatest achievement"". Around 250 people attended the church service in Skipton and more than 150 listened to the ceremony in freezing weather outside. The Rev Ruth Harris told the congregation: ""Jodie was a woman full of fun, life and vitality who was a great colleague, a friend, an adoring mother, a caring daughter, a devoted wife. ""Jodie was preparing for Christmas and, through the nature of her work, she was helping others in their Christmas preparations. ""And it was about this work that her life was ended so abruptly, shockingly and with devastating consequences. ""What none could have anticipated was that, this Christmas, Jodie would be spending it with the angels and Jesus himself."" Neville Hord, 44, has appeared in court accused of Mrs Willsher's murder. He is due to appear again at Bradford Crown Court on 26 January."
2018-01-10,"Fruit, vegetables and other fresh foods should be sold loose instead of in plastic packaging, Theresa May is to tell supermarkets in a Government war on plastic waste.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-calls-for-fruit-and-veg-to-be-sold-without-plastic-packaging-11202929,"The Prime Minister is promising the Government will work with supermarkets to encourage them to introduce plastic-free aisles in which all food is loose. This will give consumers the choice to make greener decisions and promote the use of less damaging plastic packaging, according to the Government. Launching a 25-year Environmental Plan in a major speech, the Prime Minister is making the bold pledge to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste within a quarter of a century. And condemning plastic waste as ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"", she says the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill the Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times. In a major boost for Sky's Ocean Rescue Campaign, the Prime Minister is also confirming that the 5p carrier bag charge is to be extended from supermarkets and big stores to all shops. The call to increase the sales of loose fresh foods follows a Conservative peer urging the Government to force supermarkets to scrap ""unnecessary"" plastic wrapping on vegetables, specifically cucumbers. Former Conservative MP Lord Hayward told Sky News last month that UK supermarkets should follow other European supermarkets which he says offer customers a larger selection of vegetables unwrapped. The Cucumber Growers Association estimates 490 tons of plastic wrap is used to cover cucumbers in the UK every year, with around 220,000 tons of cucumbers sold in 2016. ""I want the Government to impose the pressure on the retailers and the retailers to think about the position and educate the customers,"" said Lord Hayward. ""By doing both of those, you will actually dramatically reduce the amount of waste that we have around."" Other new green measures in the PM's 25-year plan include tax changes to reduce waste, more funding for plastics innovation and £10m for schools to teach children more about the environment. Mrs May also says she is putting Ocean Rescue on the agenda at a Commonwealth summit in April and pledging to use more UK aid on ridding the oceans of plastic waste. In her speech, the PM will talk about how we will look back in ""horror"" at the damage done to the environment and how so much plastic was allowed to be ""produced needlessly"". She will add: ""In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls. ""This truly is one of the great environmental scourges of our time."" Claiming that the UK will demonstrate global leadership, the PM will say: ""We must reduce the demand for plastic, reduce the number of plastics in circulation and improve our recycling rates. To tackle it we will take action at every stage of the production and consumption of plastic. ""I want the Britain of the future to be a truly Global Britain, which is a force for good in the world. Steadfast in upholding our values - not least our fierce commitment to protecting the natural environment. ""When we host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April we will put the sustainable development of our oceans firmly on the agenda. ""We will work with our partners to create a Commonwealth Blue Charter and push for strong action to reduce plastic waste in the ocean. ""We will direct our development spending to help developing nations reduce plastic waste, increase our own marine protected areas at home, and establish new Blue Belt protections in our Overseas Territories."" Greenpeace has praised the Government for wanting to tackle plastic waste, but called the plans a ""missed opportunity"" as they do not match the ""scale of the environmental crisis"". The campaign group called for deposit return schemes. Labour attacked the Tories' environmental record, saying they have cut renewables support and allowed air pollution to escalate. Sue Hayman, shadow environment secretary, called the plan ""a cynical attempt at rebranding"" their image and said the proposals are ""weak"". She called for a fracking ban and for a new Clean Air Act as well as backing Labour's environmental amendments to the Brexit bill next week. The Government says that to encourage industry to take more responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products and make them easier to recycle, it will look at how the tax system or charges could further reduce the amount of waste we create. A call for evidence on how to reduce the use of single-use plastics will begin next month. In addition, there will be new funding into plastics innovation through a bid into the government's £7bn research and development pot. It is estimated that 8.3bn tonnes of plastic have been produced since the 1950s. Research indicates that without urgent action to cut demand this is likely to be 34bn tonnes by 2050. In the UK alone, during its recent Great British Beach Clean Up, the Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100m stretch of beach surveyed, and of this, rubbish from food and drink made up at least one fifth. The plans to help more children engage with the environment will be delivered through £10m for school visits and a Nature Friendly Schools programme to create school grounds which allow young people to learn more about the natural world, targeting schools in disadvantaged areas first."

2018-01-10,The crisis in the NHS dominated raucous exchanges in the Commons as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed in the first Prime Minister's Questions of 2018.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111030421/https://news.sky.com/story/corbyn-claims-may-is-too-weak-to-sack-hunt-amid-nhs-crisis-11202418,"The Labour leader accused the Prime Minister of being ""too weak"" to sack Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has been a lightning rod for criticism in his more than five years in the role. Mrs May attacked her opposite number's portrayal of the state of the health service, telling MPs that if you were to believe Mr Corbyn, everyone who turns up at hospital is being failed by the NHS. :: Health minister criticised for saying patients can sit when beds are unavailable:: May defends handling of NHS amid winter crisis: 'Nothing is perfect':: Why is there always a winter crisis in the NHS? She repeated her apology to patients who have been impacted by the unprecedented pressures on the NHS, which has seen thousands of operations scrapped. Mrs May again defended preparations and said ""record funding"" was being put in. But Mr Corbyn said the PM had recognised there was a ""crisis"" because she at first wanted to sack Mr Hunt in her Cabinet reshuffle. Mr Hunt, who has been in the role since 2012, survived and was given an expanded brief, with social care now included in his portfolio. The Labour leader used his time at the dispatch box to lay into what he sees as the government's failings on the NHS, telling the Commons that nurses were ""spending their entire shift treating people in car parks"" due to long queues of ambulances. He added: ""We know the Prime Minister recognises there's a crisis in our NHS because she wanted to sack the Health Secretary last week but was too weak to do it. ""And if the NHS is so well-resourced and so well-prepared, why was a decision taken last week to cancel the operations of 55,000 patients during the month of January?"" Members of Labour's frontbench shouted ""apologise"" at Mrs May as she responded, with the PM telling them she had already made clear her contrition earlier. She added: ""We will make sure those operations are reinstated as soon as possible. We are putting record funding into the NHS and record funding into mental health."" Mr Corbyn cited the experience of an 82-year-old woman who spent 13 hours lying on a trolley in a corridor, having been taken to hospital by ambulance three hours after calling 999. He said this case was far from an ""isolated"", adding: ""Does the Prime Minister really believe the NHS is better prepared than ever for the crisis it's now going through?"" Mrs May told MPs she would look into the case and went on to say: ""Week in and week out, in the run-up to Christmas and now today, what (Mr Corbyn) is doing is giving the impression of a National Health Service that is failing everybody that goes to use the NHS. ""The reality in our NHS is that we are seeing 2.9 million more people now going to accident and emergency, over 2 million more operations taking place each year. ""Our National Health Service is something we should be proud of and that's why it's a first-class National Health Service."" Mr Corbyn said it was the actions of the Government that was ""pushing our NHS into crisis"". He added: ""The Health Secretary, during his occupation of her office to keep his job, said he won't abandon the ship. ""Isn't that an admission that, under his captaincy, the ship is indeed sinking?"" Mrs May rejected the claim by defending the Government's funding plans for the health service. The testy exchanges came as MPs debated a Labour motion - which the Government will abstain on - expressing ""concern at the effect on patient care of the closure of 14,000 hospital beds since 2010"". It also calls on the Government to ""increase cash limits for the current year"" in order for hospitals to reschedule elective operations. Theresa May forced to apologise 'unreservedly' for #PMQs jibe at Angela Rayner - while she's off ill getting medical treatment pic.twitter.com/THglxups3U Although the NHS dominated, there was an awkward moment for Mrs May when she attacked the absence of Labour's Angela Rayner - who is away receiving medical treatment. The PM was criticising Labour's plans for increased public spending - referencing recent comments by Ms Rayner - when she pointed out that she was not in the chamber. When the Labour frontbench shouted the reason for the shadow education secretary's absence, Mrs May responded: ""Oh, I do apologise. ""No, I didn't realise the shadow education secretary was herself undergoing medical treatment. I apologise unreservedly for that comment."""

She had been pronounced dead nine hours earlier. Sarah and Jack Hawkins always believed that mistakes by staff at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust had led to their daughter's death, but it has taken almost two years for an independent report to reach the same conclusion. Mrs Hawkins had been seen by staff, but remained in undiagnosed labour for six days. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Hawkins said: ""Harriet was normal, Sarah was well, so the only explanation was that there had been failures of care."" Among 13 failings identified by a National Patient Safety Agency investigation into the birth at Nottingham City Hospital were a failure to record information properly, a failure to recognise a prolonged dysfunctional labour and a delay in applying appropriate foetal monitoring. Mrs Hawkins had been due to give birth at the Queen's Medical Centre, but its maternity unit had stopped new admissions because of staff shortages. What makes the case more unusual is that both parents worked at the hospital: Mr Hawkins as a consultant, and Mrs Hawkins as a physiotherapist. She said: ""It's mentally and physically exhausting. We should be grieving for our dead daughter and we haven't been able to have a funeral yet. ""Not one person from the hospital has asked for our story. We are in the prime position because we worked at the hospital, we trusted our colleagues."" Their solicitor Janet Baker said that it is one of the worst cases of medical negligence she has seen in 30 years. ""This is only the third time that I've advised clients in relation to making referrals for investigation of criminal and safety prosecutions,"" she added. Tracey Taylor, the chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH), said the organisation accepted the report's findings. She added: ""I offer my deepest sympathy to Sarah and Jack... I profoundly apologise that we let them and Harriet down so badly. ""NUH has acknowledged that it is likely Harriet would have survived had it not been for several shortcomings in care."" Because of the lengthy inquiry, Harriet's body remains in the hospital mortuary. Finally, her parents can begin to plan her funeral."
2018-01-11,"Government officials and regulators will hold crisis talks on Friday aimed at safeguarding pensioners’ interests at Carillion, the vast construction group which is racing to avoid collapse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111162751/https://news.sky.com/story/regulators-to-hold-pensions-summit-as-carillion-crisis-deepens-11203432,"Sky News has learnt that senior civil servants from the Cabinet Office are expected to attend an emergency summit that will also include representatives from The Pensions Regulator (TPR), Pension Protection Fund (PPF), Carillion's pension trustees and an assortment of City advisers. The talks will take place 48 hours after the company, which is a major Government partner on HS2, the new high-speed rail link, presented a revised business plan to scores of lenders. Sky News revealed last weekend that Carillion was due to meet banks within days amid an urgent need to secure new funding. One insider put the amount of new short-term funding required by the company from the end of this month at around £300m. Unless that funding materialises - either from commercial lenders or in the form of emergency Government support - Carillion would be likely to crash into administration, threatening the jobs of at least some of the 19,500 people it employs in the UK. Carillion has a pension deficit of roughly £580m, although this figure would be expected to rise sharply if measured according to the cost of insuring its various retirement schemes on a full buyout basis. The company itself is not expected to attend the pension crisis summit. Its last annual report said there were 28,500 members of various defined benefit pension schemes. A TPR spokesperson said: ""We have been and remain closely involved in discussions with Carillion and the trustees of the pension schemes as this situation has unfolded. ""We will not comment further unless it becomes appropriate to do so."" The PPF, which would take on responsibility for paying pensions to thousands of current and former Carillion workers if it collapses, said: ""The PPF is aware of the discussions between the company, Government and banks and, along with the Trustees and the Pensions Regulator, will act as it always does to protect the interests of Carillon scheme members and levy payers."" Carillion's shares rocketed on Monday when some in the City misinterpreted last weekend's story as a sign that a rescue deal was about to be agreed. The company was then forced to issue a statement to the stock market that it knew of no reason for investors' sudden optimism. The rescue plan shown to lenders on Wednesday includes handing back some loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and potentially accepting financial support from the Government if it cannot secure it from private sector sources. Carillion's large syndicate of lenders includes Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK, as well as a host of overseas firms. To date, many of the banks have indicated that they are reluctant to provide additional funding given the potential for huge losses on their existing exposure. Their attitude is said to have prompted senior figures close to Carillion to discuss the possibility of emergency financial support from the Government. A number of disposals aimed at raising cash, including that of its Canadian operations, are progressing more slowly than originally anticipated. Its only asset sale since the crisis erupted has been to offload a portfolio of healthcare contracts to rival outsourcer Serco for £50m - against a broader forecast for disposal proceeds of £300m. If it survives in the short term, Carillion is also working on a plan to swap £1bn or more of its borrowings for new shares in the company, which is one of the Government's most important infrastructure delivery partners. Such a plan would leave its pension scheme, or the Pension Protection Fund, as a big shareholder. The Wolverhampton-based group is the second-largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains approximately half of the UK's prisons as well as roughly 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. It is also engaged in building the Aberdeen Bypass and was responsible for constructing the Tate Modern art gallery in London and the Channel Tunnel. Last week, the company was dealt a fresh blow when the City watchdog launched a probe into the ""timeliness and content"" of statements it made to the‎ stock market about is financial position between December 2016 and July last year, when a massive profit warning sent its shares crashing by 75%. Since then, the company has cleared out its executive team, including chief executive Richard Howson and finance director Zafar Khan. Mr Howson was replaced on an interim basis by Keith Cochrane, the former Weir Group boss, with Andrew Davies due to arrive from Wates Group as his permanent successor on 22 January. Carillion reported a first-half pre-tax loss of £1.15bn in September, while it announced just before Christmas that its lenders had agreed to defer a test of its borrowing agreements from 31 December to 30 April. A Government spokesperson repeated a statement given to Sky News last weekend which said it was ""committed to maintaining a healthy supplier market and work closely with our key suppliers"". ""The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. ""We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress."""

These issues have prompted the organisers of the North American Bitcoin Conference to be held in Miami next week to announce they would no longer be exchanging tickets for any cryptocurrency. The conference announced that ""due to network congestion and manual processing, we have closed ticket payments using cryptocurrencies"" just a week before the conference opened. ""We have, and always will, accept cryptocurrencies for our conferences, up to fourteen days before the event,"" the organisers said. ""However, due to the manual inputting of data in our ticketing platforms when paid in cryptocurrencies, we decided to shut down bitcoin payments for last minute sales due to print deadlines."" Stating that things would hopefully be better next year when ""global adoption [of cryptopcurrencies] becomes reality"", the conference organisers called for ""more unity in the community about scaling"" - allowing Bitcoin to grow by improving the processing speeds and transaction costs. Last minute tickets for the conference are selling for $1,000 (£740), but some of Bitcoin's most devoted fans may not have that much cash to hand after placing it all into the cryptocurrency. A single Bitcoin is currently valued at exactly £10,000 after a record year in 2017 when it increased in value more than 2,000% between its record low and high."

After a joint plea with Brexit Secretary David Davis for tariff-free trade between the UK and Germany, Mr Hammond appealed for co-operation and no ""punishment"" for Brexit. The Chancellor's speech was a riposte to the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who 24 hours earlier complained about a lack of detailed UK proposals on trade. Speaking at the Die Welt economic summit dinner, Mr Hammond said: ""They say 'it takes two to tango'. Both sides need to be clear about what they want from a future relationship. ""I know the repeated complaint from Brussels has been that the UK 'hasn't made up its mind as to what type of relationship it wants'. ""But in London, many feel that we have little, if any, signal of what future relationship the EU27 would like to have with a post-Brexit Britain."" Mr Hammond said that since the EU referendum there had been a relative silence from Europe on what the EU wanted the future relationship with the UK to be like. ""I am saying this to you tonight because I fear many EU opinion formers see this as a question only for British politicians for British voters to resolve, before they engage with the EU27,"" he added. ""By signalling a willingness to work together in a spirit of pragmatic cooperation on a future, mutually beneficial partnership, based on high levels of access for goods and services, continued close cooperation in security and defence, in education, science, technology, and culture. ""Putting behind us any narrative of 'punishment' for leaving and focusing on the mutually beneficial relationships we have now and can continue in the future, the EU will send a message to the British people which will resonate as they consider the options for their future. And that is my challenge to you."" In his speech earlier, Mr Barnier said: ""What kind of future relationship does the UK want with the European Union? We don't yet have the answer to this question."" The trade plea from Mr Hammond and Mr Davis, who was also visiting Germany for Brexit talks, came in a jointly-written article for a Frankfurt newspaper. ""As two of Europe's biggest economies, it makes no sense to either Germany or Britain to put in place unnecessary barriers to trade in goods and services that would only damage businesses and economic growth on both sides of the Channel,"" they wrote."

M&S said it sold out on its website within 40 minutes of being confirmed as one of its products. It was back in stock on the website on Thursday and was also in stores.

The move has been labelled ""disgusting"", ""bullying"" and ""discrimination"" by parents and some have set up a petition calling for the scheme to be axed. However, the headteacher of Wednesbury Oak Academy in Tipton has defended it, saying the equipment bag for ""fun-time lunchtime play"" is being run as an ""extra"" and the school is ""outstanding"". The petition claims pupils have been separated into groups of ""paid"" and ""unpaid"" students in the playground. It said: ""This has caused outright disgust from children, parents, grandparents, staff and such like. ""The parents that have paid and parents that haven't are totally against the separation of the children as this can cause upset, bullying and social exclusion amongst other things. ""We therefore request the 'scheme' to be discontinued as it's just not something that any of us wish to be associated with."" Mother-of-two Kirsty Williams, 28, told the Express and Star: ""We were asked to make the payment before Christmas but it was voluntary. ""It was a voluntary payment for sports equipment even though they had £9,000 for equipment. It is bullying really - they are separating the rich from the poor."" According to the paper, an unnamed mother of three, branded the move ""disgusting"". She said: ""I'm a parent and I found it really disgusting what's going on. If you don't pay the £6 the other kids can't play with the equipment. ""We have to pay £6 a year, it's per child, I don't think this is fair. That is £18 that could go towards the uniforms."" She went on: ""It's discrimination against the other kids, I don't think it is fair especially the way they treated some of the kids."" The school principal, Maria Bull, told the Express and Star: ""This is a parent council initiative and the parent council came up with this way back in May 2017. ""We currently have 80 children whose parents have made this payment out of 450. To be fair the parents have had since May so as I say, they are running this for the 80 children concerned. ""It is not like the children haven't got other equipment on the playground. It is being run as an extra, just like we ran extra activities, we run school discos as extra activities, we run all of this as a voluntary basis."""

Pornhub said 24.7bn searches were made on its site last year, the most frequent being ""porn for women"", which saw a 359% year-on-year increase among female users. The phrase was used 1,400% more by all users of the website in general. Rival site xHamster reported a 2.4% increase in female users globally, with South Africa and Saudi Arabia seeing the largest increases of 23% and 11% respectively. Meanwhile, female viewership in China and Australia dropped by 28% and 17% respectively. Viewing pornography in the UK is set to be much more difficult as the Government implements a new law requiring websites to verify their users' ages.

Concerns have been raised that as a pornography business, MindGeek is not a suitable firm to protect children from adult content."
2018-01-11,Almost 15% of England's A&E patients waited more than four hours to be seen last month - the joint-worst figure on record.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111162751/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-winter-crisis-thousands-of-ambulance-delays-11203206,"That performance, which equals January 2017, is 1% worse than a year ago and well under the target of 95% of A&E patients being seen within four hours. Sky News Health Correspondent Paul Kelso said: ""The NHS treated more patients than the previous year, so demand is rising. ""Staff are working very hard to keep up but they're still falling backwards on that key four hour target. ""This is despite the Government repeatedly saying that the NHS is better prepared than it has ever been and has all the resources it needs."" Some 95% of NHS hospital beds in England were full last week, while 11 trusts said they had no beds available on Sunday and at various points last week. In the week ending 7 January, 16,690 patients were kept waiting in an ambulance for more than 30 minutes before they could be handed over to A&E, a slight improvement on the previous week. But some 5,082 were delayed for more than an hour, an increase from 4,734 the previous week. :: The life of a paramedic in the NHS: Eat sleep, work, repeat To make life more difficult for the health service, there was a spike in the number of bed closures due to norovirus or diarrhoea and vomiting. Some 944 beds were closed, compared with 731 the previous week. The number of people taken to hospital for flu is also running at around 2.5% higher than the same time last year, according to figures for the week ending 31 December. There have been 48 flu-related deaths in England this winter. The statistics come after Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS services, called for an increase in the NHS budget to £153bn by 2022/23 to deal with the projected increase in demand for services. Mr Hopson said: ""If we continue to run the NHS at close to 100% capacity, day in day out, permanently in the red zone, it's not surprising that the service can't cope when we get a high - but entirely predictable - spike in demand."" Former NHS Trust chairman Roy Lilley told Sky News the figures were ""a disaster"". Pointing to the bed occupancy statistics, he said: ""As hard as the NHS works to get people out of ambulances, into A&E and into a ward, it can't get them home."" Commenting on the figures, an NHS England spokesman said: ""Despite the clear pressure on the NHS in December, with rising levels of flu and record numbers of 111 calls and hospital admission, we managed to hold A&E performance at the same level as last January. ""We also saw the best seasonal performance on NHS Delayed Transfers of Care in four years and went into winter with cancer and routine surgery waits both showing improvements."""

The Ministry of Justice has said the rapist's victims will have their say, but one victim told Sky News she was still waiting to be told what those restrictions were and whether she could influence them. Solicitors for 11 victims have written to the Probation Service demanding that Worboys is banned from Greater London, where most of them live, and is prohibited from contacting them ""under any circumstances"". Last week, a Ministry of Justice letter informing the victims of Worboys' imminent release said he could not approach or contact them ""without prior approval of the supervising officer"". Their solicitor Richard Scorer, of Slater and Gordon, said: ""It is unbelievable that Worboys' victims have not been consulted on their attacker’s licence conditions when they are living in fear of his release. ""Considering the shambles of this sorry episode so far it is inexcusable that all victims have not been asked to make representations about his restrictions. ""Our clients already felt betrayed by the way they have been treated by the criminal justice system; they now feel like they are being treated with the utmost contempt. ""This is an absolute disgrace and we demand that all victims – those involved in the criminal trial and those who were not – are consulted before Worboys' licence conditions are finalised."" The Ministry of Justice insisted that any victim who signed up to the Victim Contact Scheme would be consulted before the 14 conditions were finalised. One victim said: ""I just spoke to my victim liaison officer. She said they are meeting to discuss his conditions tomorrow. ""I've told her I want an exclusion zone - Greater London. She said she would 'feed that in'. ""If I hadn't have called today no one would have told me I could have fed in and that the meeting to discuss it was tomorrow."""

Worboys was convicted of 19 crimes on evidence from 12 victims, but police said later they believed he attacked up to 102 victims. Lawyers believe there were 105 victims. The letter, from solicitors Slater and Gordon and Birnberg Pierce, says victims were assured after Worboys' conviction that he would ""not be coming out for a long time."" Last week, the Parole Board agreed to his imminent release after he had served a year more than his minimum eight-year sentence. :: Worboys victims left in dark over rapist's release conditions A three-person panel decided he was no longer a danger to the public and approved his release on licence, but with 14 secret restrictions. The letter says: ""It is crucial that the CPS reconsiders all of the cases Worboys was not prosecuted for to assess whether he should face further charges. ""Our clients were led to believe their attacker would not be walking free for many many years, so there was no point in prosecuting him for their allegations. ""This clearly has not happened and we are left with dozens of women fearing for their safety and feeling sorely let down by the very system that is meant to protect them. ""It is of fundamental importance that the CPS agrees to this request to ensure Worboys' victims, and indeed the greater public, have their faith restored in the criminal justice system."" :: Worboys victim fears black cab rapist may attempt to contact her One of Worboys' victims told Sky News it would be a ""total scandal"" if other cases were not re-assessed. ""There are few things more difficult and upsetting than coming forward after being sexually assaulted or raped,"" they said. ""But when you do, then not to have your evidence taken into account, is much, much worse. What signal does that send? Unless these cases are reopened we can have no faith in the justice system."" Worboys, 60, carried out his attacks between 2002 and 2008. Many of his victims had been drinking in trendy West End and Chelsea bars. The cab driver, who is also a former stripper, would offer them champagne spiked with powerful sedatives to celebrate a made-up lottery win, which he would attempt to prove by showing his victims a carrier bag stuffed with cash. Worboys would then pounce on his victims in the back of his vehicle as they were left insensible and unable to protect themselves. A CPS spokesman said: ""During the police investigation into John Worboys, files relating to 83 separate complainants were referred to the CPS. ""Of those 83, 14 complainants formed part of the trial. In respect of the remaining complainants, the cases did not pass the evidential test. ""Prior to trial, the cases of three further complainants were assessed to have passed the evidential test. However, by that stage it had been decided that there were sufficient counts on the indictment to enable the judge to impose an appropriate sentence in the event of conviction. ""These decisions were taken in full consultation with the police. ""Our decision-making was on the basis of all available evidence and there are no plans to review it. We would consider further charging advice in the event of matters being referred to us by police. ""If cases did not pass the evidential test there would have to be new evidence available that altered that assessment before they could be prosecuted. No cases can be prosecuted unless they pass the test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors."""

""It would kill off the issue for a generation once and for all."" But his apparent support for a fresh vote on Brexit was condemned by fellow Leave supporters. UKIP leader Henry Bolton said the party opposes another referendum as it would be ""damaging to the nation"". Other prominent UKIP figures also criticised their former party leader's comments, with MEP Gerard Batten suggesting Mr Farage might be guilty of ""attention seeking"". Mr Batten, UKIP's Brexit spokesman, told LBC Radio that Mr Farage's ""very unhelpful"" intervention was ""handing something on a plate to our political opponents"". Meanwhile Peter Whittle, a UKIP member of the London Assembly, warned a second referendum would hand a ""moral victory"" to ""anti-democratic remoaners"". Government minister and prominent Leave supporter Steve Baker claimed Mr Farage's remarks were ""further confirmation of my long-held view that Nigel Farage is one of the greatest impediments to a successful Brexit"". Mr Farage's tweet followed comments he made on television talk show The Wright Stuff. He said: ""What is for certain is that the Cleggs, the Blairs, the Adonises will never, ever, ever give up. ""They will go on whingeing and whining and moaning all the way through this process.

""We may just finish the whole thing off and (Tony) Blair can disappear off into total obscurity."" Leave.EU campaign co-founder and major UKIP donor Arron Banks backed Mr Farage's call for a second referendum, insisting Leave ""would win by a landslide"". ""If we do not act radically now, we will sleepwalk into a faux Brexit, in name only,"" he said. ""True Brexiteers have been backed into a corner and the only option now is to go back to the polls and let the people shout from the rooftops their support of a true Brexit."" In response to Mr Farage's comments, Lord Malloch Brown, who chairs anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: ""Bring it on."" Lord Brown claimed another vote was something ""the country needs"", adding: ""Every day we see the disaster of Brexit as we see its impact on our economy, jobs, communities and our society. ""With these comments, Nigel Farage is disowning the chaos that trying to leave the EU has wrought on this country."" Another staunch Remainer, Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said: ""For perhaps the first time in his life, Nigel Farage is making a valid point. ""In a democracy like ours, the British people have every right to keep an open mind about Brexit."" Meanwhile, in a reference to the 2010 leaders' debate, former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg tweeted: ""I agree with Nigel""."

2018-01-11,Tesco reported lower than expected sales growth over Christmas with a strong performance in groceries held back by weaker trading in general goods such as DVDs and games.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111162751/https://news.sky.com/story/tesco-boosted-by-christmas-sales-growth-11203093,"Britain's biggest supermarket said like-for-like sales were up 1.9% in the six-week period to 6 January, with food up 3.4%, but that general merchandise dragged on the overall performance - though clothing was up. Tesco also took a significant hit from lost tobacco sales after the collapse of wholesaler Palmer & Harvey in November put an extra strain on its distribution network. Shares were 5% lower in early trading after the figures missed City expectations. Earlier this week, industry data had indicated that Tesco had been the best performing of the major supermarkets in the run-up to Christmas. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the business had again worked with suppliers to try and limit the impact of higher costs on shoppers. He said: ""We have continued to outperform the market throughout this period, particularly in fresh food, thanks to our most competitive offer for many years."" Alongside the Christmas update, Tesco reported a 2.3% rise in sales for the third quarter, just before the festive period, meaning that for the combined 19 weeks it was up by 2.1%. The figures were published at the same time as a slew of retailers' trading updates, with rival supermarket Waitrose seeing like-for-like sales up by 1.5% over the six weeks to 30 December. Waitrose, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, hailed the impact of ""innovative"" products such as chocolate and ginger mince pies and one-day only cut-price offers, but said the ""highly competitive"" market saw its profit margins come under pressure. Tesco said all its formats, covering stores and online, had performed well, resulting in record sales and volumes in the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day. It said own brand food ranges had performed strongly but general merchandise sales dragged like-for-like sales down by 0.6 percentage points over the Christmas period. That mirrored a trend seen across the retail sector of squeezed consumers splashing out on grocery essentials, leaving them with less to spend on presents. Lost tobacco sales after Palmer & Harvey's collapse knocked 0.5 percentage points off like-for-like growth. Mr Lewis said the problems had now been resolved but ""took the shine off an otherwise outstanding performance"". Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Tesco's growth figure was slightly below market forecasts after it was hindered by these logistics issues. But he added: ""Tesco will be encouraged by its biggest ever week of sales in the key Christmas week."""

The shelter was demolished in the crash, witnesses said. Three other people, including the vehicle's driver, were injured. A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said a 47-year-old woman was taken to Leeds General Infirmary with life-threatening injuries. Her condition has since been described as stable. A 17-year-old girl was taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary with serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening. The 51-year-old driver was taken to the same hospital.

Today it is even smaller - the latest figures put its strength at 78,000. There is room to grow. At some expense, the Army hired an external firm, Capita, to solve this problem. Capita has done extensive market research and has come up with five demographics who feel they might not belong in the Army. Some former officers have criticised the adverts for misrepresenting the Army - their argument is that the macho culture is a necessary part of joining the army. :: New Army adverts tell potential recruits it is okay to cry, be gay and practice your faith The military is a war-fighting machine not a kid's club, they say. It is important to note, however, that these adverts are part of a wider campaign - they are not supposed to sum up the entire culture of the Army in 30 seconds. The Army's problem isn't with recruitment. In 2016, 91,460 people applied to join. Last year that increased to 122,890. Where the army does have a problem is in retention. Between April 2016 and March 2017 8,194 people joined the Army but 9,775 left. The budgets cuts and whittling down of perks and incentives are having an effect. Army adverts have traditionally concentrated on the physical aspects, and benefits, to soldiering. This new focus on the emotional side of service is different and an attempt to showcase a modern military accepting of all. The Army might feel, and with some justification, that it is damned if it does, damned if it doesn't."

Officers have been handing neighbours a questionnaire saying they are investigating his death. Police found the human remains after Coombes walked into a police station at the weekend and told officers she had killed a man and buried his body in her back garden.

Unveiling her Environmental Plan in a speech in west London, she called plastic ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". Single-use plastic wasted every year in the UK would fill the Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times, the PM said. Supermarkets will also be encouraged to have plastic-free aisles where items such as fruit and veg are loose rather than wrapped up in film. Charges and taxes on single-use items, for example takeaway containers, will also be considered. And the 5p plastic bag charge will now also be brought in for smaller shops, which were previously exempt. But critics of the plan have called it a ""missed opportunity"" and say it should be underpinned by new laws in order to hold the Government and businesses to account. Speaking at London's Wetland Centre, Mrs May insisted that Brexit would not lead to lower environmental standards. She said: ""We will incorporate all existing EU environmental regulations into domestic legalisation when we leave. ""We will set out our plans for a new, world-leading independent statutory body to hold government to account and give the environment a voice."" Other pledges include aid to help developing nations reduce plastic use and a new Northern Forest from Cheshire to Lancashire and Yorkshire. There was no confirmation in the PM's speech of a suggested 25p charge on the millions of disposable coffee cups used each year - of which only a tiny percentage get recycled. However, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has called the idea ""exciting"" and ""one we are reflecting on"". Greenpeace praised the Government for wanting to tackle plastic waste, but called the plans a ""missed opportunity"" which do not match the ""scale of the environmental crisis"". The campaign group called for a deposit return schemes on plastic bottles. The National Trust's Patrick Begg questioned whether the plan ""will have the institutions and laws to ensure it really delivers across the UK"". Labour attacked the Tories' environmental record and accused them of cutting renewables support and allowing air pollution to escalate. Sue Hayman, shadow environment secretary, called it ""a cynical attempt at rebranding"". She called for a fracking ban and for a new Clean Air Act, as well as backing Labour's environmental amendments to the Brexit bill next week. Meanwhile, the British Takeaway Campaign said the Prime Minister's plans ""would lead to increased costs for consumers and hurt the many small and independent businesses"". ""With takeaways reliant on having a cost effective solution to keeping customers' food hot, an additional plastic tax will harm the prospects of an industry which contributes £9.4bn to the economy,"" chairman Ibrahim Dogus said. ""The British Takeaway Campaign will be consulting our members, such as the Foodservice Packaging Association, to explore workable alternative solutions which do not increase costs for small businesses or lead to higher prices for customers."" Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign has been running for a year, highlighting the damage being done by plastics to the seas and their wildlife. Chief executive Jeremy Darroch called the PM's plan a ""welcome step forward"" but added: ""We need to see real action and ambitious targets if we are to effectively manage this critical issue."""

As such they are incredibly difficult to study, although a collaboration between researchers from Northwestern University and the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands has managed just that. They were examining the ""relativistic jets"" from black holes, the material that actually does manage to escape from them - one of the most mysterious phenomena in modern astronomy. As explained by Northwestern University: ""Similar to how water in a bathtub forms a whirlpool as it goes down a drain, the gas and magnetic fields that feed a supermassive black hole swirl to form a rotating disk - a tangled spaghetti of magnetic field lines mixed into a broth of hot gas. ""As the black hole consumes this astrophysical soup, it gobbles up the broth but leaves the magnetic spaghetti dangling out of its mouth. This makes the black hole into a kind of launching pad from which energy, in the form of relativistic jets, shoots from the web of twisted magnetic spaghetti."" :: Two monster black holes found lurking in nearby galaxies The scientists ran complicated simulations on one of the world's most powerful supercomputers and discovered that these relativistic jets actually changed direction as a result of space-time itself being dragged into the rotation of the black hole. ""Understanding how rotating black holes drag the space-time around them and how this process affects what we see through the telescopes remains a crucial, difficult-to-crack puzzle,"" according to one of the researchers. Alexander Tchekhovskoy, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, said: ""Fortunately, the breakthroughs in code development and leaps in supercomputer architecture are bringing us ever closer to finding the answers."" The researchers discovered that where previously simulations considered the disks and the axis of the black hole's rotation were aligned, in reality they are unlikely to be parallel. The study confirmed that these tilted disks, which are likely to include the disk of the black hole at the centre of our own galaxy the Milky Way, change direction, much like a spinning top, causing the direction of the relativistic jets to change too. ""The high resolution allowed us, for the first time, to ensure that small-scale turbulent disk motions are accurately captured in our models,"" Mr Tchekhovskoy said. To the researcher's surprise the motions turned out to be so strong that they caused the disk to fatten up and the direction changing to stop. The results of their research are now being applied to interpreting the observations of the Event Horizon Telescope examining the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way."
2018-01-11,Shares in M&S have fallen sharply after sales declines in both its clothing and food divisions left a sour taste in the mouth for investors. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111162751/https://news.sky.com/story/ms-clothing-and-home-sales-fall-over-christmas-quarter-11203087,"The retailer was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, sliding by 7%, after another Christmas setback on a day when some of its rivals delivered better headline figures. M&S blamed unseasonal autumn weather as clothing and homeware sales dropped by 2.8% in the 13 weeks to 30 December while food - until recently a stellar performer for the company - slid by 0.4%. The setback for food looked especially disappointing given that the grocery sector overall was emerging as a winner from the festive period - with upmarket rival Waitrose and supermarket giant Tesco both enjoying strong food revenues. In clothing, M&S again looked to have been outshone by Next, which last week reported an unexpected sales rise. Marks's figures were released at the same time as department store John Lewis, which reported a 3.1% rise in like-for-like sales for the six weeks to 30 December. But Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the partnership which owns the chain as well as supermarket Waitrose, admitted that pressure on profit margins had intensified amid rising costs thanks to the pound's weakness. He warned that trading would remain ""volatile"" for the year ahead. Elsewhere, House of Fraser said store sales in the six weeks to 23 December were down 2.9% and post-Christmas performance was ""disappointing"". It also said online sales were down by 7.5%. However, sales were up both in-store and online for Black Friday. The update comes days after Sky News revealed that the Chinese-owned business was seeking rent reductions at a number of its 59 department stores. M&S chief executive Steve Rowe said it had seen revenue grow both in-store and online in the weeks leading up to Christmas while it maintained its full-price stance in a ""very promotional market"" and did not participate in the Black Friday discount day. ""However, the impact of an unseasonal October resulted in an overall revenue decline,"" said Mr Rowe. ""As a result, we carried more stock into the December sale."" In food, he said sales came under pressure in the lead-up to Christmas ""as consumer spending and choices reflected tighter budgets"". The M&S update revealed the latest in a long period of quarterly declines for its clothing and home division - one which was broken by a sales rise last Christmas. It highlighted just how dependent fashion retailers can be on the weather, with milder autumns and winters tending to dampen demand for higher-price items such as warm coats and knitwear. The update comes after rival Next said it had seen a better-than-expected Christmas sales performance, partly thanks to cold weather in December - but over a period that did not include October. Thursday's slew of trading updates also appeared to suggest a victory for Moz the Monster, John Lewis's ad campaign star, over Paddington Bear - who featured in M&S's marketing. However the figures released by the two retailers were not directly comparable as John Lewis's covered a shorter period. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Marks & Spencer update was disappointing, particularly in food and online sales - the latter of which grew by what he described as a ""pretty feeble"" 3%.

2018-01-11,"The new Culture Secretary Matt Hancock has vowed to overturn a House of Lords vote on press regulation which he claims is a ""hammer blow"" to local papers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111162751/https://news.sky.com/story/government-defeated-as-lords-vote-for-fresh-inquiry-into-press-ethics-11202884,"In a double defeat for the Government, peers voted by 238 votes to 209 - a majority of 29 - for the go-ahead to part two of the Leveson Inquiry into the conduct of the press. They also voted by 211 votes to 200, a majority of 11, for another amendment to the Government's Data Protection Bill, which would make newspapers face big bills in data protection disputes. Under this proposal, newspapers not signed up to a state-supported regulator would have to pay their own and their opponent's legal costs, even if they were successful in court. But immediately after the Government defeats, which had been widely predicted, Mr Hancock pledged to attempt to overturn them in the House of Commons. ""House of Lords have just voted to restrict press freedoms,"" he tweeted. ""This vote will undermine high-quality journalism, fail to resolve challenges the media face and is a hammer blow to local press. ""We support a free press and will seek to overturn these amendments in the Commons."" But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, said the Lords' vote was an ""important step towards justice"". He said: ""In 2012, all parties made a promise to the victims of phone hacking. ""At many times since then the Tories have tried to renege on that promise. ""Unlike the Tories, Labour has always stood by the victims of hacking and press intrusion with promises in each of our past manifestos to enact all the recommendations of Leveson. ""These votes send a signal to the Tories: that they must keep their promises."" The first amendment to the Data Protection Bill, requiring the Government to hold a public inquiry into ""corporate governance and management failures"" in the press, was moved by Baroness Hollins, who said her family have been a victim of press intrusion. Lady Hollins said her eyes were opened to ""inaccurate, corrupt and illegal practices"" in the press after her daughter Abigail Witchalls was left paralysed after being stabbed in 2005. The independent crossbench peer, a professor of psychiatry, gave evidence in the first Leveson Inquiry - set up by David Cameron in 2011 after the phone hacking scandal - accusing the press of intrusion into her family life following the incident. Speaking of her own experience, she said one of the consequences of having data stolen was that she had started to suspect people she knew of speaking to the media. ""I stopped trusting people, even people in my own family, my neighbours and my best friends,"" she said. ""I did not trust them. I did not know about hacking and blagging."" But Tory peer Lord Black of Brentwood, executive director of the Telegraph Media Group, noted the amendment on Leveson 2 did not mention the police or politicians and that the ""target is four-square the press"". He argued a further costly inquiry was ""completely unnecessary because there genuinely is nothing left to unearth"". ""The spectre of yet another inquiry is a toxic threat to a free and independent press,"" he added."
2018-01-11,A man who became known as the M25 rapist has been referred for parole a week after a decision to free another serial sex attacker.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111162751/https://news.sky.com/story/m25-rapist-antoni-imiela-referred-for-parole-11203210,"Antoni Imiela, 63, was given seven life sentences in 2004 for a series of rapes across the Home Counties against women and girls as young as 10. The railway worker, from Appledore near Ashford in Kent, carried out his attacks on women and girls he had never met. He grabbed them and dragged them into a secluded area, threatening to kill them and hit them. A spokesman for the Parole Board said: ""We can confirm that the Ministry of Justice has referred the case of Antoni Imiela for a parole review."" It added that the review is ""following the standard six-month process for all indeterminate sentence prisoners"". However, it is understood that any hearing to decide Imiela's parole is unlikely to take place in the next six months. After his 2004 conviction, Imiela's DNA was put on a police database. A cold case review into a sex attack that happened on Christmas Day 1987 found a match between the victim, 31-year-old mother of two Sheila Jankowitz, and Imiela. He was then jailed for 12 years at the Old Bailey in March 2013 after being found guilty of rape, indecent assault and another serious sex offence against Jankowitz. Imiela's parole referral comes after the controversial decision to release black cab rapist John Worboys. Worboys was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years, for drugging and sexually assaulting female passengers. The 60-year-old carried out his attacks between 2002 and 2008. Many of his victims had been drinking in trendy West End and Chelsea bars. The cab driver, who is also a former stripper, would offer them champagne spiked with powerful sedatives to celebrate a made-up lottery win, which he would attempt to prove by showing his victims a carrier bag stuffed with cash. Worboys would then pounce on his victims in the back of his vehicle as they were left insensible and unable to protect themselves. The chairman of the Parole Board was forced to apologise after it emerged that some of Worboys' victims were not told of his release. A review into how the Parole Board made its decision has been launched as a result."
2018-01-11,"Brexit could see a £54bn hit to the economy by 2030, depending on the type of deal struck in the next year, according to the first set of taxpayer-funded impact assessments.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180111162751/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-could-see-uk-economy-lose-54bn-by-2030-sadiq-khans-impact-papers-warn-11203054,"The mayor of London Sadiq Khan commissioned a set of economic studies of the impact of different Brexit outcomes on regions and nine key sectors after Brexit Secretary David Davis said the Government had not done such work. The scenarios assessed range from leaving the single market, the customs union, leaving both together and failing to get a transition deal, described by the study as ""hard Brexit"". The assessment, carried out by Cambridge Econometrics, says economic output across the UK could be on average between 3% lower by 2030 than it would if Britain were to remain within the single market and customs union. The hit to London is calculated at 2%. Mr Khan said: ""This independent analysis should help guide the Government to the best outcome for London and the UK. ""If the Government continue to mishandle the negotiations we could be heading for a lost decade of lower growth and lower employment. ""The analysis concludes that the harder the Brexit we end up with, the bigger the potential impact on jobs, growth and living standards. ""Ministers are fast running out of time to turn the negotiations around. A 'no deal' hard Brexit is still a very real risk - the worst possible scenarios."" The impact assessments could infuriate the Government, which has insisted such information could undermine negotiations. It has both refused to release such information and also suggested that such analysis does not exist. Mr Khan justified the move, saying: ""It's astonishing that the Government has failed to do any proper impact assessments on what Brexit could mean for our economy. ""Their complete lack of preparation is irresponsible leading to fears that they are putting party politics ahead of the national interest. ""I've released these impact assessments because the British people and our businesses have a right to know the likely impact of the various options the government are considering on their lives and personal finances. ""This new analysis shows why the Government should now change its approach and negotiate a deal that enables us to remain in both the single market and the customs union."" Last month the Government was obliged to release some Brexit sectoral analyses after losing a binding vote in the Commons.  The Treasury is believed to have carried out similar calculations, but it is unclear even if the Cabinet sub-committee responsible for overseeing negotiations have been shown them. Some Cabinet ministers involved in the Leave campaign are known to dismiss such studies as ""Project Fear"". Mr Khan's study indicates a serious hit to the economy in the event of a significant break with the customs union and single market. But the hit is notably smaller than predicted before the referendum by the Treasury, which forecast a ""hard Brexit"" hit to the economy of 7.5% by 2030, compared to 3% in Mr Khan's study. The calculations are in line with assessments done before the referendum by the IMF and the National institute of Economic and Social Research. Already economists suggest that during 2017 the economy had grown about 1% more slowly, falling to the bottom of the G7 and major EU league table, after the impact on prices of the post-referendum slide in sterling. However, the recession predicted during the referendum has not yet materialised. This analysis suggests 500,000 jobs are under threat from a ""no deal"" Brexit by 2030, including 87,000 in London. Financial and professional services would be the ""worst affected key sector"" with up to 119,000 fewer jobs nationally, the report says. There could be 92,000 fewer jobs in science and technology, and 43,000 fewer jobs in construction. Both the London mayor and Cambridge Econometrics admit that this analysis is not a precise forecast of what will happen. They argue the report ""highlights the scale of the comparative risks associated with each scenario and potential outcome from the negotiations""."

Mr Farage had spent the previous 45 minutes inside the nerve centre of the European Union, the organisation he's spent decades trying to destroy, meeting a man for whom the EU is a fundamental force for good - Michel Barnier, the bloc's Brexit negotiator. He'd written to Mr Barnier back in October requesting the meeting. ""As you appear to be conducting a series of meetings with UK political figures on the issue of Brexit, I wish to make a request,"" he wrote. ""It seems that you are listening to a group of people who want to stop or delay Brexit. I will come to speak for the 17.4 million who did not vote for a transition deal or any further delays and whose resolve is getting stronger."" :: Farage meets Barnier: 'Brexit talks will continue to be difficult Mr Farage was worried that Mr Barnier was hearing only one side of the Brexit story - and it wasn't the Brexit side. Meetings with high-profile remainers like Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis, Ken Clarke and others helped to push that fear. In truth, Mr Barnier does meet people and hear the views of people on both sides of the Brexit divide - not least his opposite number David Davis, the Brexit Secretary and a firm Brexiteer. Still, the meeting was duly granted at the start of a week when Mr Barnier will also meet other Brexiteers including Steven Woolfe MEP (formerly of UKIP, now independent), Lord Digby Jones (former director of the CBI), John Mills (chair of Labour Leave) and John Longworth (co-chair of Leave Means Leave). It was off-camera and Mr Farage said no photos were taken. So, how did it go? ""I always said he would be very civil and indeed he was very civil. Coffee was offered which I thought was very nice…"" said a beaming, trilby-sporting Mr Farage, as he emerged from the meeting. ""I genuinely don't think he understands why people voted for Brexit, I really don't think he gets it. When I suggested to him that it might be something to do with open door immigration from within the EU, he almost looked at me with incredulity as if to say 'well surely wasn't it outside the EU migration that was the issue'. He didn't understand that. ""Was it a fruitful meeting?"" I asked him. ""Well I genuinely thought that the views of the 17.4m had not been expressed before to Mr Barnier and the meeting confirmed that, yes,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody has been to see him to really make that point that immigration was front and centre of that campaign. It was what motivated millions of people who don't normally vote to go out in the referendum and basically, where have we got to in terms of our debate in terms of our debate, our negotiations - I'll tell you, nowhere."" Mr Farage continued: ""I asked him - 'Who do you represent? Do you represent Brussels?' Do you represent these glass and steel structures? ""Do you represent the people here - you know, 10,000 people here earning more than the British Prime Minister with pensions and all the rest of it? Is that what you represent or do you represent the workers in the member states?' Of course he said, they are both the same thing. I am not so sure they are."" A German reporter snapped back: ""Who do you represent then? What are you doing?'"" ""Well, umm, I am trying to represent the view of those who voted Brexit because it's not really being heard. You know we didn't vote for transition deals. ""We didn't vote to sort of kick this into the long grass so that it's at least going to be six years from Brexit that we can sign a trade deal with anyone else or have any degree of control over our borders with the rest of the EU."" We don't know what Mr Barnier thought of the meeting. He's said nothing."

During sentencing, the judge said he had ""betrayed the trust"" of patients. Prosecutors described how the surgeon used an argon beam to brand his initials on the livers of two anaesthetised patients at the end of transplant operations in February and August 2013. One of the livers failed - for reasons unconnected to Bramhall's actions - and it was then that another surgeon discovered the initials ""SB"" burnt on to it and took a photo of the 4cm mark. Bramhall, who is world-renowned in his profession, resigned from his job at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 2014. One of the victims was left feeling ""violated"" and still suffers extreme psychological difficulties, Birmingham Crown Court heard. In a victim impact statement, she said the moment she was shown the mark ""will forever be etched on my mind"". A nurse who witnessed the surgeon's actions said she had asked him what he was doing; he is said to have replied: ""I do this."" The court heard Bramhall later told police he had ""flicked his wrist"" and made the mark in a few seconds. ""He knew that the action could cause no harm to the patient. He also said that in hindsight this was naive and foolhardy - a misjudged attempt to relieve the tension in theatre,"" said prosecutor Tony Badenoch QC. Judge Paul Farrer QC sentenced Bramhall to a 12-month community order with 120 hours of unpaid work, and fined him £10,000. He told him: ""I accept that on both occasions you were tired and stressed and I accept that this may have affected your judgement. ""This was conduct born of professional arrogance of such magnitude that it strayed into criminal behaviour. ""What you did was an abuse of power and a betrayal of trust that these patients had invested in you. ""I accept that you didn't intend or foresee anything but the most trivial of harm would be caused."" Sky's Tom Parmenter, in court for the sentencing, said a ""significant number of other former patients of Simon Bramhall were in court to show their support and gratitude"". Bramhall was also described in mitigation as ""one of the outstanding surgeons of his generation"", Parmenter added. One of the patients supporting the surgeon was Barbara Moss, who was given just three months to live in 2006 when Simon Bramhall told her he would operate on a 15cm tumour. ""It was Mr Bramhall who gave me my first instincts of hope,"" she told the court. Military surgeon Colonel Douglas Bowley also paid tribute to the work Bramhall has carried out on injured service personnel returning from the war in Afghanistan. Bramhall collaborated with Army doctors to drastically improve survival rates from the conflict. The surgeon was given a formal warning by the General Medical Council last February and now works as an anaesthetist at a hospital in Hereford."

Today it is even smaller - the latest figures put its strength at 78,000. There is room to grow. At some expense, the Army hired an external firm, Capita, to solve this problem. Capita has done extensive market research and has come up with five demographics who feel they might not belong in the Army. Some former officers have criticised the adverts for misrepresenting the Army - their argument is that the macho culture is a necessary part of joining the army. :: New Army adverts tell potential recruits it is okay to cry, be gay and practice your faith The military is a war-fighting machine not a kid's club, they say. It is important to note, however, that these adverts are part of a wider campaign - they are not supposed to sum up the entire culture of the Army in 30 seconds. The Army's problem isn't with recruitment. In 2016, 91,460 people applied to join. Last year that increased to 122,890. Where the army does have a problem is in retention. Between April 2016 and March 2017 8,194 people joined the Army but 9,775 left. The budgets cuts and whittling down of perks and incentives are having an effect. Army adverts have traditionally concentrated on the physical aspects, and benefits, to soldiering. This new focus on the emotional side of service is different and an attempt to showcase a modern military accepting of all. The Army might feel, and with some justification, that it is damned if it does, damned if it doesn't."

Mr Trump said he was cancelling the forthcoming trip because his predecessor Barack Obama sold the old Grosvenor Square embassy for ""peanuts"" and built the new one in an ""off location"". Despite the claims, it was the George W Bush administration that initiated the building's move to Battersea. Battersea Labour MP Marsha De Cordova said Mr Trump was ""scared to come to London because of all the peaceful protests he will face""."
2018-01-12,"Government officials and regulators will hold crisis talks on Friday aimed at safeguarding pensioners’ interests at Carillion, the vast construction group which is racing to avoid collapse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/regulators-to-hold-pensions-summit-as-carillion-crisis-deepens-11203432,"Sky News has learnt that senior civil servants from the Cabinet Office are expected to attend an emergency summit that will also include representatives from The Pensions Regulator (TPR), Pension Protection Fund (PPF), Carillion's pension trustees and an assortment of City advisers. The talks will take place 48 hours after the company, which is a major Government partner on HS2, the new high-speed rail link, presented a revised business plan to scores of lenders. Sky News revealed last weekend that Carillion was due to meet banks within days amid an urgent need to secure new funding. One insider put the amount of new short-term funding required by the company from the end of this month at around £300m. Unless that funding materialises - either from commercial lenders or in the form of emergency Government support - Carillion would be likely to crash into administration, threatening the jobs of at least some of the 19,500 people it employs in the UK. Carillion has a pension deficit of roughly £580m, although this figure would be expected to rise sharply if measured according to the cost of insuring its various retirement schemes on a full buyout basis. The company itself is not expected to attend the pension crisis summit. Its last annual report said there were 28,500 members of various defined benefit pension schemes. A TPR spokesperson said: ""We have been and remain closely involved in discussions with Carillion and the trustees of the pension schemes as this situation has unfolded. ""We will not comment further unless it becomes appropriate to do so."" The PPF, which would take on responsibility for paying pensions to thousands of current and former Carillion workers if it collapses, said: ""The PPF is aware of the discussions between the company, Government and banks and, along with the Trustees and the Pensions Regulator, will act as it always does to protect the interests of Carillon scheme members and levy payers."" Carillion's shares rocketed on Monday when some in the City misinterpreted last weekend's story as a sign that a rescue deal was about to be agreed. The company was then forced to issue a statement to the stock market that it knew of no reason for investors' sudden optimism. The rescue plan shown to lenders on Wednesday includes handing back some loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and potentially accepting financial support from the Government if it cannot secure it from private sector sources. Carillion's large syndicate of lenders includes Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK, as well as a host of overseas firms. To date, many of the banks have indicated that they are reluctant to provide additional funding given the potential for huge losses on their existing exposure. Their attitude is said to have prompted senior figures close to Carillion to discuss the possibility of emergency financial support from the Government. A number of disposals aimed at raising cash, including that of its Canadian operations, are progressing more slowly than originally anticipated. Its only asset sale since the crisis erupted has been to offload a portfolio of healthcare contracts to rival outsourcer Serco for £50m - against a broader forecast for disposal proceeds of £300m. If it survives in the short term, Carillion is also working on a plan to swap £1bn or more of its borrowings for new shares in the company, which is one of the Government's most important infrastructure delivery partners. Such a plan would leave its pension scheme, or the Pension Protection Fund, as a big shareholder. The Wolverhampton-based group is the second-largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains approximately half of the UK's prisons as well as roughly 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. It is also engaged in building the Aberdeen Bypass and was responsible for constructing the Tate Modern art gallery in London and the Channel Tunnel. Last week, the company was dealt a fresh blow when the City watchdog launched a probe into the ""timeliness and content"" of statements it made to the‎ stock market about is financial position between December 2016 and July last year, when a massive profit warning sent its shares crashing by 75%. Since then, the company has cleared out its executive team, including chief executive Richard Howson and finance director Zafar Khan. Mr Howson was replaced on an interim basis by Keith Cochrane, the former Weir Group boss, with Andrew Davies due to arrive from Wates Group as his permanent successor on 22 January. Carillion reported a first-half pre-tax loss of £1.15bn in September, while it announced just before Christmas that its lenders had agreed to defer a test of its borrowing agreements from 31 December to 30 April. A Government spokesperson repeated a statement given to Sky News last weekend which said it was ""committed to maintaining a healthy supplier market and work closely with our key suppliers"". ""The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. ""We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress."""

A prototype has arrived at the Ocado Technology robotics research lab, where it will be experimented on to test different features. It is hoped the robots will help improve productivity at the dozens of warehouses Ocado has across the UK. The company's head offices are in Hatfield in Hertfordshire, and it also has a presence in Poland, Bulgaria, and Spain - however it has faced criticism for the number of automated systems its warehouses employ. The company itself has said that the investment in automation is not an attempt to replace people, but to ""take away an element of a technician's job that is physically demanding, boring or unpleasant"". ""We are removing the physical labour but you will still need the human,"" the company said. ""The idea is they work together and are more productive as a pair."" Economic forecasts suggest that automation will lead to the loss of jobs, however. A report last year by PwC said that around 10 million workers were at risk of losing their jobs to robots over the next 15 years. The report said up to around 30% of existing UK jobs were susceptible to automation by the 2030s. Sectors such as transport and manufacturing were said to be facing the biggest risk, with half of jobs at ""potential high risk"" of disappearing, according to the analysis. According to the World Robotics Report, installations of robots in industrial settings are set to grow 15% in 2018."
2018-01-12,Two of the BBC's top-earning male journalists reportedly joked about the equal pay fight of one of their female colleagues.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/bbc-stars-john-humphrys-and-jon-sopel-joke-about-equal-pay-row-in-leaked-recording-11204248,"John Humphrys, host of Radio 4's Today programme, and North America editor Jon Sopel were apparently recorded off-air talking about Carrie Gracie. Gracie quit as China editor after accusing the BBC of a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"" in which her male counterparts at the same level were being paid far more. According to The Sun and The Times, Humphrys told Sopel: ""The first question will be how much of your salary you are prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her, and then a few comments about your other colleagues, you know, like our Middle East editor and the other men who are earning too much…"" Sopel replied: ""I mean, obviously if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution I'll have to come back and say well yes Mr Humphrys, but…"" Humphrys, 74, reportedly responded: ""And I could save you the trouble as I could volunteer that I've handed over already more than you f****** earn but I'm still left with more than anybody else and that seems to me to be entirely just..."" The exchange reportedly happened on Monday, before the Today programme was on air, and the same day Gracie co-hosted the show with Humphrys. The BBC presenter told The Times the conversation was not intended to make light of Gracie's push for pay equality. ""This was what I thought was an exchange between two old friends who have known each other for 30 years and were taking the mickey out of each other,"" said Humphrys. ""It was nothing to do with Carrie's campaign."" A BBC spokeswoman said: ""This was an ill-advised off-air conversation which the presenter regrets. ""The BBC is committed to getting its pay structures right and, as we have said, we are conducting a comprehensive analysis of presenter pay."" The BBC pay disclosure last summer showed Sopel was in the £200,000 - £249,999 pay bracket, while Humphrys was earning between £600,000 and £649,999. Gracie has said she gets £135,000. Former BBC journalist Miriam O'Reilly, who won an ageism case against the corporation in 2011, claimed to have heard the recording. She described it as ""smug and condescending"" and ""beneath what the public would expect to hear from John Humphrys"". Gracie released an open letter to the ""Dear BBC Audience"" when she quit, claiming her employer was not ""living up to its stated values of trust, honesty and accountability"". She said male international news editors were being paid 50% more than women in the same role. Gracie added that she had been offered a £45,000 pay rise, to £180,000, but that it was still less than men in the same role. ""I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally,"" she wrote. Responding to Gracie's letter, the BBC said ""fairness in pay is vital"" and that an ""independent judge-led audit of pay for rank and file staff showed 'no systemic discrimination against women'."" The row comes after the BBC published salaries of some of its biggest stars in July. It revealed disparities between some presenters in similar roles - for example a £200,000 gap between Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce, who both present evening news programmes."
2018-01-12,The pound has climbed to its highest level against the US dollar since the Brexit vote.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/pound-cimbs-to-highest-level-against-dollar-since-brexit-vote-11204637,"Sterling was up by more than a cent to reach nearly $1.37 in Friday trading. It was little changed against the euro, hovering below €1.13. It has not been as high versus the dollar since the result of the EU referendum in June 2016 sent the pound plunging from $1.50. That result saw sterling sliding to less than $1.20 in ensuing months before steadily gaining back ground over 2017. The latest rise on Friday was partly attributed to a report that Spain and the Netherlands were open to a softer Brexit deal for Britain. Bloomberg reported that the two countries' foreign ministers had agreed to work together for a divorce deal that would maintain close ties between the EU and Britain. That did little to help the pound against Europe's single currency, which was buoyed by signs that the European Central Bank was preparing to unwind its huge monetary stimulus, as well as a coalition deal in Germany after months of political uncertainty. But sterling made up more ground versus the dollar, weakened by worries about low inflation. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 extended recent gains to reach a fresh record high of 7792.6 during the session. London's leading share index tends to fall when the pound rises - because so many of its multinational constituents earn much of their revenues in foreign currency. But it was ahead in the latest session as a £7bn takeover offer for GKN - rejected by the engineering giant - saw its shares surge by 26%. The pound's weakness since the Brexit vote has had a major impact on the economy, because it has made the import of goods priced in euros and dollars more expensive. That has filtered through to inflation, which recently reached its highest level for nearly six years, squeezing household finances at a time when wage growth is failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living. A tougher time for households has meant a leaner spell for the consumer side of the economy, contributing to a slowdown in economic growth. This has also been a factor in some of the pain felt by retailers over what for many has been a difficult Christmas period. Sterling's weakness has been a help, however, to Britain's factories, as it makes their products more attractively priced for overseas buyers. Official figures earlier this week showed manufacturing growth at its strongest level since 2011. The latest upturn for the pound still leaves it about 9% lower than its peak just over 18 months ago. But it could at least mean British tourists travelling to some overseas destinations will see their money go a little further on holiday than it would have done a year ago. However, some analysts were unconvinced by the significance of the reports on the positions of Spain and the Netherlands. Nomura currency strategist Jordan Rochester said: ""I'm sceptical this is necessarily a game-changer at this stage as there will also be member states pushing the other way."""

Here, he tells Sky News what a typical day looks like.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-it-like-being-a-paramedic-in-the-nhs-11203017,"Mid-morning riser: I work the 1pm to 1am shift so I usually get up around 11am, shower and have breakfast and try to relax a little bit before work. I have never been a morning person and even on my days off I tend to stick to twilight hours. I get in half an hour before I start and check who I am working with. I'm a team mentor, which means I work with our trainee paramedics. I don't have the same crew mate every shift, so I'll check who I am working with before we begin. If I know them already, then great, otherwise I'll spend some time speaking with them, finding out about their background and their training. I'll also give them some encouragement, let them know I am there to back them up and step in if they need it. The day begins: I will usually check over the ambulance I am assigned to. It will have been cleaned and restocked, but I will make sure that I have everything I need, and check anything else, like morphine, before we go. Then at 1pm, I tell control that we are in the ambulance and ready to go. We start at a busy time of day, so we often get a call-out straight away. It might be a new emergency that has just come in, or it could be someone who has been waiting because of the volume of calls the handlers are getting. There's no typical day - but on average, I'll attend seven call-outs before the end of my day at 1am. If we can treat the patient at the scene, it may take around an hour, but transferring someone to hospital will take longer. It usually takes closer to two hours if we have to take them to A&E, and then we have to wait with them if there isn't a space straight away. I've waited for as long as three hours for there to be treatment space once we have arrived at the hospital. The best and the worst job:  Going out to deal with aspects of pregnancy can be the best and the worst. If everything is alright, it's really emotional, and you can feel a part of someone's family. But there could be a complication, the child could not be breathing. It could be the best thing or the worst thing. The types of job I really like are those where I have to use all my skills and my knowledge to make a difference. You might not get the rapport with the patient, but it is nice to know that you have done the best you could. To know I have got them the care that they needed. I will pop back some hours later to check on them, and can see the care they have been given. They will say thank you and you see that 10 minutes of being with them could have made a big difference. After I clock off:  I finish at 1am and I often try to do my shopping then. The supermarkets are so quiet, you can park right next to the store, get all the best expiry dates and no queue at the till. It feels like you have it to yourself. I've also joined a 24-hour gym, so I may go there, or swap the rear wheel of my mountain bike for a training wheel and park myself in front of YouTube for a 45 minute ride ""through the Alps"". Sometimes I have a midnight snack, though this isn't so good for your stomach. By the time you get home, have a shower and have some downtime it's 3.30am, so getting to bed means you'll have around seven hours of sleep before starting again. I work five days on with 12-hour shifts and then five days off. I really value the time off. Although we get lots of time off, we have also done around a week and a half's worth of work in five days. It can feel like eat, sleep, work, repeat. If I wasn't doing this:  I always wanted to be in the Royal Marines, and was a cadet for years, but asthma prevented me. I was also a special constable for several years but never made it full time in the force. I think the military is still in my blood, so I'd probably be doing something with that, or in the police, or maybe a pilot."

Noel, 50, previously told the same magazine he had no interest in getting Oasis back together, saying it would ""kill him as a person"". Liam, 45, said: ""He's desperate to get Oasis back but he knows he's crossed that bridge. ""And he's not allowed to, his missus (Sara MacDonald) won't let him now, cos she's another one."" He added: ""I know for a fact, deep down, he wants to be playing stadiums... You can only play stadiums when I'm there. ""I don't think our kid's got it in him anymore, anyway.

Oasis were one of the biggest bands in the UK from their breakthrough with Definitely Maybe in 1994, until they split in 2009. Noel left the band and formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, while Liam continued with the remaining members as Beady Eye. The brothers have a long history of spats. When Noel said he wanted to ""bury the parka monkeys"" with his new album, Liam replied with: ""He's f****** with a generation there, man. I'd rather be a parka monkey than a f****** Givenchy f******' Bond Street ... wearing clown or whatever he is. ""Parkas, bring it on."" Just before Christmas, the pair seemed to have buried the hatchet, with Liam tweeted ""Happy Christmas"" to Noel's team and suggesting he had ""reached out"" to him. In the Q interview, Liam also said he wants to play three Oasis albums, Definitely Maybe, Morning Glory and Be Here Now, saying: ""F*** the rest. No-one cares after that... I want to give people what they want and I want to give me what I want."" The full interview appears in this month's Q Magazine, on sale on Tuesday."

The President tweeted on Friday following criticism from the UN and other countries. ""The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards,"" he said. ""The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!"" The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime..... ....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund.... ....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards.

Mr Trump had asked why America should allow more people from ""shithole countries"" during the meeting with legislators about a proposed bipartisan deal on immigration. Sources briefed on the conversation said Mr Trump questioned why the US would want to admit more people from Haiti and Africa, adding: ""We should have more people from Norway"". However, the President denied saying ""anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country."" He tweeted: ""Never said 'take them out.'

Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust! The President's alleged comments drew widespread condemnation. Botswana's government called Mr Trump's comment ""highly irresponsible, reprehensible and racist"", and said it had summoned its ambassador to find out if Botswana is considered a ""shithole"" by the US. ""The Botswana Government has also enquired from the US Government through the Ambassador, to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US, and also that some of Batswana may wish to visit the US,"" it said. UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville also criticised the President's behaviour, saying: ""These are shocking and shameful comments from the President of the United States. ""There is no other word one can use but racist. ""You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as 'shitholes', whose entire populations, who are not white, are therefore not welcome."" :: Immigration slur - Why did Trump say it? He added: ""The future of the Dreamers should not be used as a bargaining chip to negotiate the most severe and restrictive immigration and security measures possible. These are human beings, not commodities."" ""Ours is not a shithole country, neither is Haiti or any other country in distress,"" said Jessie Duarte, the deputy secretary general of South Africa's ruling African National Congress party. ""We would not deign to make comments as derogatory as that about any country that has any kind of socioeconomic or other difficulties."" Former Mexican president Vicente Fox Quesada described Mr Trump's comments as ""foul"". He said: ""America's greatness is built on diversity, or have you forgotten your immigrant background, Donald?"" .@realDonaldTrump, your mouth is the foulest shithole in the world. With what authority do you proclaim who’s welcome in America and who’s not. America’s greatness is built on diversity, or have you forgotten your immigrant background, Donald? The White House did not immediately contradict reports of Mr Trump's remarks, but suggested the President was ""fighting for permanent solutions"" that strengthen the nation, and that included the use of a merit-based immigration system. ""Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,"" White House spokesman Raj Shah. ""He will always reject temporary, weak and dangerous stopgap measures that threaten the lives of hardworking Americans, and undercut immigrants who seek a better life in the United States through a legal pathway."" Mr Trump later tweeted that he would not accept the proposed bi-partisan deal as the US would be ""forced to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly."" He added: ""I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level."" In November, Donald Trump's administration said it was ending Temporary Protected Status for people from Haiti. It gave the approximately 59,000 Haitian immigrants who had been granted the status until July 2019 to return home or legalise their presence in the United States."

She revealed the seven-metre-long (24ft) gilded carriage, which weighs almost four tons and is pulled by eight horses, is ""not meant for travelling in at all"". ""It's only sprung on leather"", she added, and ""not very comfortable"". Her Majesty said her journey to the abbey was four to five miles - ""halfway around London"", she claimed. The Queen said the coach ""can only go at a walking pace"" and the horses ""could not go any faster"" as it was ""so heavy"". She added when she sits in the carriage, she is very high, comparing her height to the coachmen several feet below. It was commissioned in 1760 and because of its age and rough ride, it is only used on certain occasions including jubilees. The revelations about the carriage were revealed in a new documentary about the amusing trials and tribulations of being head of state. The royal speaks candidly and with humour about the experience of her coronation and artefacts associated with the sovereign. She jokingly stated she could not look down when wearing the imperial state crown, which weighs 2lbs 13oz (1.28kg), as her neck would ""break"". Looking at the priceless artefact, she said: ""Fortunately, my father and I have about the same sort of shaped head. But once you put it on, it stays. I mean, it just remains on."" Royal commentator Alastair Bruce said the head has to be kept still when wearing it and the Queen agreed: ""Yes. And you can't look down to read the speech you have to take the speech up. ""Because if you did your neck would break, it would fall off. ""So there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise they're quite important things."" She also recounted how she was brought to a standstill when her robes ran against the carpet pile in the abbey during her coronation. The Queen recalled: ""Well, I remember one moment when I was going against the pile of the carpet and I couldn't move at all."" Mr Bruce said ""really?"" and the monarch replied: ""Yes, they hadn't thought of that."" The Coronation will be broadcast on BBC One at 8pm at Sunday."
2018-01-12,Voting will close today in the latest election which will help determine the future of the Labour party.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/crucial-national-executive-committee-vote-will-help-determine-labours-future-11204055,"Elections for the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) - the body which runs the party and sets its rules - will close at noon. Although little noticed since the turn of the year amid the trials of Theresa May's latest botched reshuffle and the NHS winter crisis, they are the latest staging post in the Labour civil war. Three new positions representing the party members are up for grabs. The jobs were created in an expansion of the NEC at the urging of the leadership. They said that it was important the party's new 600,000 strong membership had more representation. They also knew that those elected to the new positions would almost certainly be favourably disposed to Jeremy Corbyn. Hitherto control of the NEC has largely eluded the leadership with the composition being finely balanced between left and right. Technically, with Kezia Dugdale's shock resignation as Scottish Labour leader last year, the left had a small advantage but assuming they win all three new seats (and most think they will) then that majority will become well entrenched. And that worries plenty of Labour MPs. They know that the long-term aim of the left is to wrest more control from members of parliament to members of the Labour party. At the forefront of that movement is Jon Lansman, perennial ""Labour Lefty"" (as he calls himself) and activist, head of the pro-Jeremy Corbyn pressure group Momentum and now first-time candidate for the NEC. As he told me, he wants to see power transferred to the membership: ""I think members need to have a greater say and need to be seen to have a greater say because firstly they need to feel ownership of it, but we also have 600,000 members who know their communities, fellow workers and their workplaces."" In practice this could mean lowering once again the number of MPs required to nominate someone for the leadership (or allowing party members, trade unions or affiliated Labour groups to do so as well), handing power of manifesto policy setting to the membership (possibly as Lansman tells me, through ""the power of digital democracy"") and mandatory reselection of MPs (MPs having to be readopted as candidates by their local parties before every general election). There's no doubt Lansman and his fellow left-wingers have deeply held beliefs on democratisation of the party. There's also little doubt that they also believe such measures would empower their own wing of the party and embed the Corbyn legacy and permanently transform Labour. With a larger majority on the NEC this project can begin with gusto. There has been some opposition, including from longstanding activist Eddie Izzard who hopes to wrest one of the places from the left. But most observers think it will be a clean sweep. There is, however, one solitary fleck of grit in the Corbyn oyster. Another slow rumbling development in Labour politics could derail this new leftist-hegemony. There is a possibility that Len McCLuskey, the close Corbyn ally and General Secretary of Unite (Labour's biggest donor and Britain's biggest trade union) might have his election as the head of his union declared void after alleged voting irregularities. If that happened it would throw Unite into turmoil and he may potentially have to hand over to Gerard Coyne, no friend of Corbyn. If that happened Unite's seats on the NEC would be up for grabs and the left's majority might in the medium term disappear. A Labour source tells me the Unite decision might come very soon. It's just a reminder that just when one faction seems unassailable the political gods have a peculiar way of redressing the balance. In the 1990s and 2000s it looked as if the Labour left was moribund, never to return. Now they seem invincible. But invincibility can be fleeting. Perhaps then all the more reason to move quickly. If the Corbynistas do win (we'll know the result on Monday) expect more headlines on changes to party rules - and sooner rather than later."
2018-01-12,Carillion has put one of the big four accountancy firms on standby to oversee an administration of the construction giant in a further signal of the precarious state of its finances.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/carillion-lines-up-administrator-in-case-rescue-talks-fail-11204463,"Sky News has learnt that EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers were asked to compete for the role as administrator to the HS2 high-speed rail-link contractor in recent weeks, with EY said to have been lined up by directors. The move is part of contingency planning being undertaken by Carillion as it races to secure approximately £300m of emergency funding by the end of the month. It does not necessarily mean that EY - which has been acting as an adviser on the company's rescue plan for several months - will ultimately be appointed, according to insiders. It comes as Government officials and regulators hold crisis talks on Friday aimed at safeguarding the interests of more than 28,000 pension scheme members who could face cuts to retirement payments if Carillion does not survive. Senior civil servants from the Cabinet Office are due to attend an emergency summit that will include representatives from The Pensions Regulator (TPR), Pension Protection Fund (PPF), Carillion's pension trustees and an assortment of City advisers. The talks will take place 24 hours after a meeting of ministers from across a multitude of Whitehall departments, reported on Thursday by the Financial Times, to discuss contingency plans for its collapse. A Downing Street spokesman said the Government was closely monitoring the unfolding situation. Earlier this week, Carillion presented a revised business plan to scores of lenders - but contrary to reports, this was not expected to produce an instant agreement with them. Carillion's shares rocketed on Monday when some in the City misinterpreted last weekend's story as a sign that a rescue deal was about to be agreed. The company was then forced to issue a statement to the stock market that it knew of no reason for investors' sudden optimism. Sky News revealed last weekend that Carillion needs hundreds of millions of pounds within weeks to survive. Unless that funding materialises - either from commercial lenders or in the form of emergency Government support - an administration would put at risk the jobs of at least some of the 19,500 people it employs in the UK. Carillion has a pension deficit of roughly £580m, although this figure would be expected to rise sharply if measured according to the cost of insuring its various retirement schemes on a full buyout basis. The rescue plan shown to lenders on Wednesday includes handing back some loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and potentially accepting financial support from the Government if it cannot secure it from private sector sources. Carillion's large syndicate of lenders includes Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK, as well as a host of overseas firms. So far, many of the banks have indicated that they are reluctant to provide additional funding given the potential for huge losses on their existing exposure. Their attitude is said to have prompted senior figures close to Carillion to discuss the possibility of emergency financial support from the Government. A number of disposals aimed at raising cash, including that of its Canadian operations, are progressing more slowly than originally anticipated. Its only asset sale since the crisis erupted has been to offload a portfolio of healthcare contracts to rival outsourcer Serco for £50m - against a broader forecast for disposal proceeds of £300m. If it survives in the short term, Carillion is also working on a plan to swap £1bn or more of its borrowings for new shares in the company, which is one of the Government's most important infrastructure delivery partners. Such a plan would leave its pension scheme, or the Pension Protection Fund, as a big shareholder. The Wolverhampton-based group is the second-largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains approximately half of the UK's prisons as well as roughly 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. It is also engaged in building the Aberdeen Bypass and was responsible for constructing the Tate Modern art gallery in London and the Channel Tunnel. Last week, the company was dealt a fresh blow when the City watchdog launched a probe into the ""timeliness and content"" of statements it made to the‎ stock market about is financial position between December 2016 and July last year, when a massive profit warning sent its shares crashing by 75%. Since then, the company has cleared out its executive team, including chief executive Richard Howson and finance director Zafar Khan. Mr Howson was replaced on an interim basis by Keith Cochrane, the former Weir Group boss, with Andrew Davies due to arrive from Wates Group as his permanent successor on 22 January. Carillion reported a first-half pre-tax loss of £1.15bn in September, while it announced just before Christmas that its lenders had agreed to defer a test of its borrowing agreements from 31 December to 30 April. Carillion and EY declined to comment."
2018-01-12,Discount retailer B&M has emerged as a Christmas winner after food and other household essentials helped it grow like-for-like sales by 3.9% in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/christmas-sales-cheer-for-discount-chain-bm-11204216,"Shares in the company, whose soon-to-depart chairman is former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, rose 3% after the trading update covering the 13 weeks to 23 December. It comes a day after figures from Sir Terry’s former company fell short of City expectations, despite showing the best Christmas performance since 2010, when he was in charge. Retailers have seen mixed fortunes over the period, with food stores broadly doing well as squeezed consumers focused on essentials – leaving less to spend on clothing and gifts at other stores. At the upmarket end of the shopping spectrum there was a positive update from Fortnum & Mason on Friday, with like-for-like sales up 13% in the five weeks to 31 December. That was thanks to the performances of its central London flagship store in Picadilly as well as outlets at St Pancras and at Heathrow, as well as online revenues. :: Christmas of contrasts for Britain's retailers B&M, which describes itself as the UK's leading general merchandise value retailer, said it had seen a ""robust performance"" in grocery and FMCG, or fast-moving consumer goods – a category ranging from canned drinks and toilet roll to fruit and veg. Chief executive Simon Arora said the growth came despite comparisons with a strong Christmas period last year. ""B&M continues to go from strength to strength... delivering great value for customers week-in week-out,"" he said. The company operates 569 B&M stores in the UK and 263 under the Heron convenience chain it bought for £152m earlier this year, as well as 84 Jawoll outlets in Germany. It reported total revenues of £970m for the Christmas quarter, 23% up on the same period last year as it continued to expand and said it was confident of meeting market expectations for the financial year to March. Analysts at Shore Capital said: ""B&M Retail is another winner for Christmas 2017. In our view there are few store based retailers in the UK producing such impressive growth numbers."""
2018-01-12,"A report into last year's Manchester bombing has criticised some in the media, especially social media, for how the aftermath was dealt with.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/manchester-bombing-report-criticises-media-11204473,"Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds injured when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives after a concert by US popstar Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena in May. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham commissioned a report into the tragedy, led by former head of the Civil Service Lord Bob Kerslake, who has presented his interim findings. Lord Kerslake told reporters: ""Clearly a lot of the media handled the issues very respectfully, but there is a new dimension here and that is the advent of social media. ""Very quickly photos of those missing go up on social media and families want that because they're looking for information. ""The question then is: how do the media respond to that information? ""In a number of occasions, the media have approached families, indeed door-stopping them, before those families themselves know for certain what happened to their loved ones, and we think that is an issue of concern that needs to be explored."" But Chris Phillips, former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, told Sky News: ""I think the world has changed very quickly and whenever there's an incident, there will be people tweeting about it and there will be people sending messages. ""So it's really difficult for the media to control what they're doing in light of the amount of social media activity out there. ""It's easy to push blame... but we have to be realistic about the world that we live in."" Sky News Correspondent Mike McCarthy, at the news conference in Manchester, said families had raised the issue with Lord Kerslake and other panel members. He said: ""In one case, for example, the panel said that the media were picking up images and re-using them, images that were taken from social media that were not very sensitive, as far as the families were concerned. ""When asked what should be done about it, they said they didn't know at this stage, but it was just an issue they wanted to raise."" The panel's interim report also called for public bodies to commit to a charter guaranteeing bereaved families are respected in the aftermath of similar tragedies. More than 170 families had taken part in the review, meeting with the panel members face-to-face or contributing in writing. Lord Kerslake said the panel had ""wanted to tell the story from the perspective of those who were caught up in those events that night"". This follows concerns expressed after the Hillsborough inquest that families affected by that tragedy had not been shown enough respect and had not been given a fair hearing. Lord Kerslake said many of the Manchester families were ""still having their lives dominated by that terrible night"". He added: ""People talk loosely about closure but for those families there will not be quick closure. But they do want to understand better what happened."" The full review will be published in March."

Twelve fire crews were sent to tackle the blaze, which broke out at about 6.30am. While the fire is still being fought, it has been brought under control and an investigation is under way. Superintendent Sandra England, who is leading the British Transport Police response, said: ""A joint investigation is now under way with Nottingham Fire and Rescue Service to establish the cause of the fire. We would like to hear from anyone who has any information."" She said officers were ""grateful for the support we have received from the people of Nottingham"" following the incident. The blaze has caused major disruption, with the station closed and train services expected to be cancelled or delayed for the entire day. In a video posted on Twitter, incident commander Bryn Coleman said crews had been ""offensively firefighting"" using breathing apparatus, with firefighters in ""some real severe conditions in terms of heat and smoke"". Mr Coleman added that the flames were in the walkways between new and old sections of the station. Speaking later to Sky News, he said the main area of operation was an ""old bridge that's going across platforms six and seven"", with fires still burning ""in that void area"". There is ""smoke damage to the original concourse area of Nottingham station and also smoke damage to the new-build section"", Mr Coleman said. The fire service said no one is believed to have been injured. Fire officer John Mills said it was the worst blaze local firefighters had seen ""for 20 years"", the Nottingham Post reported. ""This is about complexity rather than the size of the fire,"" he said. ""People driving through the main roads in the city will barely see any smoke. ""That is because the fire is burning continuously through voids, which puts it out of sight and makes it incredibly difficult for us to locate."" East Midlands Trains said it expected services ""to be disrupted on all routes through Nottingham for the whole of Friday 12 January"". Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood tweeted: ""Devastating pictures from Nottingham railway station. ""Thank you to our emergency services for your fantastic work."""
2018-01-12,"All around the country, people are hitting the halfway mark in their January detoxes and getting to grips with their New Year's resolutions.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/is-a-month-without-booze-worth-it-experts-on-dry-january-11202717,"Whether it was to get to the gym more, eat more fruit and vegetables, or cut back on alcohol, there may be a slump around the corner requiring a new flex of willpower. But is there any point to a detox? What really happens to your body when you give up the booze? Should we all be trying to help our bodies cut out 'toxins'? Sky News spoke to experts to get the truth about the January detox. Yes to a detox - it's a great opportunity Dr Sarah Brewer, author of more than 60 self-help books, told Sky News: ""I think a detox is a great opportunity to review and address your diet and change things that are wrong with it. Most people recognise that they don't eat enough fruit and vegetables, or protein. ""It is an opportunity to ditch the crap, and focus on a healthy diet. ""Avoiding alcohol is always a good thing to give your liver a rest. ""There is a lot of research to show supplements can help. If you take one thing, I recommend globe artichoke, to help the liver. ""During a detox, you eat a restricted selection of healthy and nutritious foods. You can eat as much or as little of these foods as you like, and do not necessarily need to lose weight. In practice, however, most people aim to halve their usual calorie intake to help boost the Detox process and to lose a few excess pounds. ""I do not recommend patches or colonics, it's all about focusing on your diet and cutting back."" No to a detox - your liver does the job Leading Harley Street Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert said: ""The good news is that that we all already have a detoxification system. It's called the liver and no tea, juice cleanse or diet will do it's job any better. ""Any suggestion that the human body can be detoxed with a tea, juice cleanse or patch is incorrect. We are naturally designed to remove toxins using our liver and kidneys - none of these perform such a detox. These items often prey on those individuals desperate for a quick fix or simply to feel healthier, when in reality just addressing their overall diet and lifestyle will work wonders and cost less. ""The idea that we kind do some kind of purge and purify our bodies is an attractive thought but the reality is you simply need to eat well most of the time. If you accept the marketing of any supposed detox, you're abandoning proven science. ""Food isn't strictly speaking medicine and encouraging people to see some food as toxic and others as pure is dangerous. In my experience, all detoxes do is push you into extreme calorie restriction. An obsession with a rule-driven way of eating like so-called detoxing is familiar to so many people with disordered eating."" She added: ""There is no denying that alcohol should be limited as part of a healthy diet. All too often I see alcohol associated with weight gain and poor mental clarity. Any positive claims from alcohol stem largely from studies using quality red wine and often on males over the age of 50. There is a lot of research investigating the powerful plant compounds in red wine and their health benefits, including reduced inflammation, lower risk of heart disease and extended lifespan. ""Choose your alcohol wisely and remember that alcohol can be addictive and excessive consumption can cause a whole host of health issues."" Dry January: What happens after you give up alcohol? Many people may now be starting to see some differences in their appearance and their wellbeing as they make it to the second weekend in January without alcohol. In general, those who give up alcohol for one to two weeks report better quality of sleep, and see improvements in their skin. According to Drinkaware, drinking alcohol helps people to drop off to sleep quicker, but it prevents the body staying in deep sleep, and entering REM cycles (rapid eye movement). This means while the glass of red might send you to sleep, it'll make you groggy the next day too. Reducing alcohol intake could also benefit your skin, as it's a diuretic, meaning it makes you dehydrated. Cutting back will help your skin and eyes to sparkle. Many people report weight loss, as the empty calories of alcohol are replaced with lower calories alternatives, and making up lbs with pounds when they don't get tied into rounds at the pub. Friends Andy Ramage and Ruari Fairburns gave up alcohol for a year after becoming fed up of late nights and hangovers entertaining clients in the City of London. Now, they've written a book together, The 28 Day Alcohol Free Challenge, and run programmes encouraging people to knock the pints on the head for as long as they can, from 28 days to 365. Mr Fairburns said: ""We have worked with the University of Stirling and we've found that people who do our programme get an 'epiphany' moment somewhere between 20 and 60 days. ""This epiphany is 'I feel amazing'. It happens to nearly everyone who regularly drinks more than 14 units a week, four large glasses of wine. ""They think 'I feel limitless'. Many people who stick to our 28 days end up staying to do 90 days or longer without alcohol."" He added that humans naturally want to fit into a tribe, and for some tribes, they can be defensive when one member stops drinking. But the key can be finding a tribe with a different common interest, or who can help keep you on the no alcohol path. Mr Fairburns said: ""Something I always say is treat this like the challenge it is. It needs prep, think of what you'll have in the house and what you'll drink out, have it in place. ""When you do that and you get to that epiphany, then you feel like you are in control."""

His comments were quickly seized upon by pro-Remain supporters, while prominent Brexiteers condemned Mr Farage's intervention. The leading Leave campaigner later used his LBC Radio show to offer a more detailed explanation of - and an apparent backtrack on - his surprising remarks, as he urged Brexiteers to prepare for ""one last dramatic battle"". Mr Farage, who leads a group of eurosceptic MEPs in the European Parliament, claimed his meeting with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday had prompted his comments. ""I haven't reached this conclusion comfortably or easily but my meeting with Barnier convinced me we are not going to get a good deal and Parliament isn't going to accept it,"" he said. Last month, rebel Tory MPs forced a defeat on the Government to secure a ""meaningful"" vote on the final exit deal agreed between Britain and the EU. Mr Farage suggested, if Parliament rejected a Brexit agreement, then ""both the Commons and the Lords may well do everything they can to put us through a second referendum"". In an appeal to Brexit campaigners, Mr Farage added: ""I'm saying please get yourselves ready, there may well be a second referendum on this. ""This is meant to be, actually, a wake-up call to Leavers. ""I genuinely believe we must prepare for the possibility of a second referendum whether we like that prospect or not."" Prominent Remainers such as former prime minister Tony Blair, ex-Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Labour peer Lord Adonis have all previously called for a second Brexit vote. Mr Farage added, if a second EU referendum were to be held, he is ""confident"" Leave would win with a ""bigger"" majority and the pro-Brussels trio would be sent ""into outer space"". But, a new ComRes poll for the Daily Mirror revealed, if there were a second EU referendum, 55% would vote to Remain and 45% to Leave. Yet, only 43% of the 1,049 people asked were in favour of a fresh vote, with 51% opposed and 6% answering ""don't know"". James McGrory, executive director of pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""It looks like the worm is starting to turn. ""In a mature democracy like ours, the will of the people can and does change and the British public have every right to keep an open mind about Brexit as new facts continue to emerge."" Earlier on Thursday, Mr Clegg posted on Twitter: ""I agree with Nigel"", while Lord Adonis commented: ""Farage wants a second referendum. Bring it on!"" Downing Street insisted there will not be a second EU referendum."
2018-01-12,"The ""broken"" mother of a teenage girl who died days into the New Year said her daughter had been suffering from a flu virus.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/mothers-tribute-to-beautiful-girl-bethany-walker-who-died-after-catching-flu-virus-11203923,"Heather Teale paid tribute to Bethany Walker, from Applecross, Scotland, on Facebook, describing the 18-year-old as her ""beautiful girl"". She said the student ""deteriorated rapidly"" after her flu ""became pneumonia"" causing her to be airlifted to hospital, where she was put in intensive care. The latest figures for the UK say that 85 people have died of flu since the week starting 2 October, although that figure is up from 48 deaths the week before. Ms Teale wrote: ""Despite their best efforts she didn't make it. I am broken, the bottom has fallen out of my world... Life will never be the same again. ""Bethany, I love you to the moon and back, I always have and I always will, you were the best daughter I could have ever wished for and I will always be the proudest mum in the world. ""I have no more words. I'm truly devastated. Sleep tight my beautiful girl, your brother and I will love you forever, you will never be out of my thoughts as long as I live."" The death follows the spread of the Australian flu, which has been linked to a number of deaths in Ireland. There was a sharp rise this week in the number of flu cases presenting to GPs in England - up 78 % - from 21 per 100,000 to 37.3 per 100,000. The flu rate in Scotland for the first week of 2018 was four times higher than the same week in 2017. Figures from Health Protection Scotland showed 107 people in every 100,000 of the Scottish population were suffering from a flu in the week ending 7 January, with figures among over-75s peaking at 212 per 100,000. Scotland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith has called on people eligible for a free vaccination, which include the elderly, young and pregnant, to get vaccinated. He said: ""While we've still got a couple of months of winter left, this week's statistics provide further evidence that the vaccine is a good match against the current most common strains. ""I would encourage anyone in an eligible group to get vaccinated - it is the best defence against flu."" Plockton High School, Bethany's former school, paid tribute to the ""kind, caring, gifted and exceptionally conscientious student"" in another Facebook post. It said the school community was ""saddened"" by the news after the former deputy head girl left in the summer of 2017 to take a gap year before taking up a place at the University of Aberdeen to study midwifery. The statement added: ""It is tragic to lose someone so young and the thoughts of the whole school and the hostel are with Bethany’s family at this sad time."""
2018-01-12,"It was, predictably enough, in a pub opposite the EU headquarters where Nigel Farage 'debriefed' the media.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180112164955/https://news.sky.com/story/nigel-farage-reveals-details-of-meeting-with-eus-brexit-negotiator-michel-barnier-11200281,"A significant number of us (also predictable) had gathered to hear the outcome of what was, on the face of it, an unusual meeting. Mr Farage had spent the previous 45 minutes inside the nerve centre of the European Union, the organisation he's spent decades trying to destroy, meeting a man for whom the EU is a fundamental force for good - Michel Barnier, the bloc's Brexit negotiator. He'd written to Mr Barnier back in October requesting the meeting. ""As you appear to be conducting a series of meetings with UK political figures on the issue of Brexit, I wish to make a request,"" he wrote. ""It seems that you are listening to a group of people who want to stop or delay Brexit. I will come to speak for the 17.4 million who did not vote for a transition deal or any further delays and whose resolve is getting stronger."" :: Farage meets Barnier: 'Brexit talks will continue to be difficult Mr Farage was worried that Mr Barnier was hearing only one side of the Brexit story - and it wasn't the Brexit side. Meetings with high-profile remainers like Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis, Ken Clarke and others helped to push that fear. In truth, Mr Barnier does meet people and hear the views of people on both sides of the Brexit divide - not least his opposite number David Davis, the Brexit Secretary and a firm Brexiteer. Still, the meeting was duly granted at the start of a week when Mr Barnier will also meet other Brexiteers including Steven Woolfe MEP (formerly of UKIP, now independent), Lord Digby Jones (former director of the CBI), John Mills (chair of Labour Leave) and John Longworth (co-chair of Leave Means Leave). It was off-camera and Mr Farage said no photos were taken. So, how did it go? ""I always said he would be very civil and indeed he was very civil. Coffee was offered which I thought was very nice…"" said a beaming, trilby-sporting Mr Farage, as he emerged from the meeting. ""I genuinely don't think he understands why people voted for Brexit, I really don't think he gets it. When I suggested to him that it might be something to do with open door immigration from within the EU, he almost looked at me with incredulity as if to say 'well surely wasn't it outside the EU migration that was the issue'. He didn't understand that. ""Was it a fruitful meeting?"" I asked him. ""Well I genuinely thought that the views of the 17.4m had not been expressed before to Mr Barnier and the meeting confirmed that, yes,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody has been to see him to really make that point that immigration was front and centre of that campaign. It was what motivated millions of people who don't normally vote to go out in the referendum and basically, where have we got to in terms of our debate in terms of our debate, our negotiations - I'll tell you, nowhere."" Mr Farage continued: ""I asked him - 'Who do you represent? Do you represent Brussels?' Do you represent these glass and steel structures? ""Do you represent the people here - you know, 10,000 people here earning more than the British Prime Minister with pensions and all the rest of it? Is that what you represent or do you represent the workers in the member states?' Of course he said, they are both the same thing. I am not so sure they are."" A German reporter snapped back: ""Who do you represent then? What are you doing?'"" ""Well, umm, I am trying to represent the view of those who voted Brexit because it's not really being heard. You know we didn't vote for transition deals. ""We didn't vote to sort of kick this into the long grass so that it's at least going to be six years from Brexit that we can sign a trade deal with anyone else or have any degree of control over our borders with the rest of the EU."" We don't know what Mr Barnier thought of the meeting. He's said nothing."

It is not clear whether the two events are linked. Rigby & Peller, which had held the royal warrant since 1960, said it was ""deeply saddened"" to confirm it had been cancelled. Mrs Kenton was a regular visitor to Buckingham Palace, serving members of the Royal Family including the Queen, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. Her autobiography provided some detail about her working relationship with them. Mrs Kenton, 82, told the Daily Telegraph: ""It is very sad for me that they didn't like it and I'm finding that very difficult to accept. It's horrible and a real shock. ""I never thought when I wrote the book that it would upset anyone."" She added that the book ""doesn't contain anything naughty"" and that there would have been a ""gaping hole"" in the memoir if she had not mentioned that she had worked for the Queen. Mrs Kenton's daughter Jill Kenton told The Times: ""She is devastated. The book was not a kiss-and-tell. It was a kind, gentle memoir. She is not disloyal."" Rigby & Peller said in a statement: ""The Royal Household Warrants Committee has decided to cancel the royal warrant granted to Rigby & Peller and Mrs June Kenton. ""Rigby & Peller is deeply saddened by this decision and is not able to elaborate further on the cancellation out of respect for Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Warrant Holders Association. ""However, the company will continue to provide an exemplary and discreet service to its clients."" Buckingham Palace said it did not ""comment on individual companies"". Mrs Kenton bought Rigby & Peller with her husband in 1982 for £20,000 before selling a majority stake in 2011 for £8m - although she remains on the board."
2018-01-13,New EU rules come into effect today which will mean customers can't be penalised with extra fees for choosing to pay by credit or debit card. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180113174006/https://news.sky.com/story/why-have-businesses-charged-for-using-cards-and-what-will-a-ban-mean-for-them-11204901,"But what will the Payment Services Directive mean for businesses? Why were some businesses charging extra for card payments in the past? Up until now, firms were allowed to pass the costs of processing a card payment on to their customers. When you choose to pay via credit or debit card, either in a shop or online, the retailer has to pass a percentage of your money on to the company which organises the payment - usually either Mastercard or Visa. Some of that money is then forwarded to your bank via an 'interchange fee', which the bank uses to fund the cost of issuing your card and managing your electronic payments, and to the processor who owns the technology platform used to transfer the money. Many businesses and websites have been adding those extra costs on to your bill, either in the form of a percentage value of the transaction or through a flat card fee. Government bodies have also been guilty of this; some councils and public services have been charging more to pay with card rather than via cash or direct debit. But why did paying with a credit card often cost more than a debit card? Although payments using debit and credit cards are managed in the same way, most banks see more risk in sending a credit payment as opposed to debiting money directly from your account, and so they charge higher interchange fees. And even then not all credit card fees are equal - American Express charges firms a higher rate to process payments than Mastercard or Visa, which is why some businesses decide it's cheaper not to accept them at all. So what's changed? Essentially, the only thing that is now different is that companies are no longer allowed to pass these extra charges on to their customers; consumers must pay the same price for goods and services whether they choose to pay with cash or with plastic. So the companies and businesses you buy from will now have to absorb the extra costs of credit and debit payments themselves. So will this mean I'll be charged less? Not necessarily. Some firms, including food delivery firm JustEat, have already announced that they intend to simply extend the extra fees to all customers regardless of their payment method, rather than scrap them for those using cards. By choosing to levy fees on those using cash as well as those using plastic they are still treating all payment methods equally and so are within the rules. Other companies are expected to raise prices in order to pay the extra costs. Could small businesses be hurt by the changes? According to some, yes. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the proportion of small firms reporting a rise in costs was at a five-year high. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""Removing their freedom to share the burden of card payment fees will give them yet another outgoing to worry about."" There are fears that the travel industry will be particularly affected, as the need to process payments in several currencies means they may have to shoulder higher costs than other sectors. Will this ban on fees remain in place after Brexit? The Government has said this directive will be part of UK law after the country leaves the EU"
2018-01-13,Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster has called for closer Anglo-Irish relations during the Brexit negotiations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180113174006/https://news.sky.com/story/dup-leader-arlene-foster-calls-for-close-anglo-irish-relations-during-brexit-talks-11205767,"Mrs Foster said there are more things to unite than divide the UK and Ireland in phase two of discussions on the split from Europe. Speaking in Killarney, in the Irish Republic, she suggested leaders across Ireland should work together. Mrs Foster said she planned to raise the prospect of enhancing Anglo-Irish relations, under the auspices of the British-Irish Council, when she meets Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney. ""Maintaining Northern Ireland's economic and political status as an integral part of the United Kingdom is absolutely crucial to me and my party,"" she said. ""To think anything else would be as foolish as believing that the Taoiseach (Leo Varadkar) or the Tanaiste (Mr Coveney) desired anything other than Irish unity. ""But while we will always battle for our own national interests, we must also battle for our mutual interests. ""And our mutual interests will not end on the day the UK formally leaves the European Union. The United Kingdom may be leaving the EU but the common interests that we share across the British Isles will remain."" Mrs Foster was speaking at the Killarney Economic Conference in Co Kerry, discussing Brexit. Her remarks on forging closer ties and mutual respect are a significant departure from the fallout which marked relations between the DUP and the Irish government towards the end of last year. That came amid both the fractious finish to phase one of the Brexit negotiations and the Irish border question, and Mr Coveney's aspirations for a united Ireland. The DUP leader suggested Anglo-Irish relations could be strengthened through the British-Irish Council, set up as part of the Good Friday Agreement to boost co-operation between the UK and Ireland in areas such as transport, the environment and energy. ""The UK exiting the European Union ought not to become a barrier to continued co-operation on issues of ongoing mutual interest,"" she said. ""It especially shouldn't become a barrier when the infrastructure - in the guise of the British-Irish Council - already exists that can allow us to continue to work together as closely as ever on issues of shared interest."""

2018-01-13,"Children and teenagers underwent almost 43,000 ""completely preventable"" operations to remove rotting teeth last year, costing the NHS more than £36m, according to new figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180113174006/https://news.sky.com/story/tooth-extraction-epidemic-costs-nhs-millions-11205389,"Analysis of NHS spending data by the Local Government Association (LGA) found that £36.2m was spent on 42,911 extractions for under-18s in 2016/17, which equates to 170 operations a day. It represents an almost-20% increase over the past four years and a total cost to the NHS of £165m since 2012, as many youngsters face trips to hospital for operation under general anaesthetic due to the severity of their tooth decay. An NHS England spokesman said eating sugary food and drinks was ""driving this unfortunate and unnecessary epidemic"", with the LGA's figures released just a week after Public Health England (PHE) said half of children's sugar intake came from unhealthy snacks and drinks. PHE has called for children to be limited to just two snacks of no more than 100 calories per day, having found that they currently eat almost 400 biscuits per year - plus hundreds of other sugary snacks. The LGA, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, said further action was needed to tackle the amount of sugar being consumed, such as reducing the amount in soft drinks, introducing teaspoon labelling on food packaging, and councils getting a say on where the revenue from the soft drinks levy is spent when it is introduced in April. Cllr Izzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board, said: ""These figures, which have risen sharply, show that we have an oral health crisis and highlight the damage that excessive sugar intake is doing to young people's teeth. :: Coca-Cola slammed over UK-wide Christmas truck tour amid child obesity fears ""The fact that, due to the severity of the decay, 170 operations a day to remove teeth in children and teenagers have to be done in a hospital is alarming and also adds to current pressures on the NHS. ""This concerning trend shows there is an urgent need to introduce measures to curb our sugar addiction which is causing children's teeth to rot. ""Untreated dental care remains one of the most prevalent diseases affecting children and young people's ability to speak, eat, play and socialise. ""These figures also highlight how regular check-ups at a dentist can help prevent tooth decay and the need for hospital treatment."" :: NHS could ban sugary drinks from hospital shops Health ministers have been accused of failing to confront the ""wholly preventable disease"" of tooth decay by the British Dental Association, with chairman Mick Armstrong describing the LGA's figures as a ""badge of dishonour"" for them. ""Tooth decay is the number one reason for child hospital admissions, but communities across England have been left hamstrung without resources or leadership,"" he continued. ""This short-sightedness means just a few thousand children stand to benefit from policies that need to be reaching millions."" Unlike Wales and Scotland, England has no dedicated national child oral health programme, although NHS England has developed the Starting Well campaign, which is aimed at helping under-fives in ""high-need communities"" see their dentist and improve their oral health. But Professor Russell Viner, officer for health promotion at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said more needed to be done, with thousands of children and their families faced with anxiety over ""completely preventable"" operations. ""As many of these operations are due to the food and drink children consume, they are completely preventable and pose an unnecessary financial burden on our overstretched NHS,"" he added. ""At a time when we are faced with reports of chronic bed shortages and cancelled operations, these latest startling statistics should act as a wake-up call to policy makers and act as the catalyst for change."" It comes just a few months after the Government was urged to crack down on TV adverts for junk food in a bid to improve children's health - although that was focused on the UK's obesity crisis rather than dental hygiene."

The London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Leeds branches we spoke to said they were completely out of stock, and could not confirm when new supplies would be received. While the Glasgow and Belfast branches both had some vaccine in stock, a backlog of patients meant the supplies were accounted for and no new patients would be able to receive them during a walk-in-appointment, they said. All branches advised calling back next week, with the hope they may receive more stock mid-week. :: Do you have flu or is it just a cold? As cases of flu are on the rise, it is important NHS staff and eligible people get their flu jab – it is our best protection. @CMO_England has urged staff to get vaccinated: https://t.co/6ErfzPvSMN pic.twitter.com/9JlW2EO92V A Boots spokeswoman told Sky News that ""a very high level of demand in the recent week"" had meant that ""some Boots stores temporarily ran out of stock for a limited time."" She said new flu vaccine stock was now available at the Boots warehouse for their pharmacies to re-stock. Free flu jabs are available for children under nine, pensioners, pregnant women and people with certain long-term health conditions. For those who pay for their jab, the cost is about £13. The high uptake of the flu jab this winter follows Australia's worst outbreak on record, with an epidemic in Europe feared later in the year. The H3N2 strain, known as ""Australian flu"" or ""Aussie flu,"" has been linked to a number of deaths in Ireland. It has the same symptoms as common flu - including a high fever, exhaustion, a chesty cough and a sore throat. A flu epidemic has also hit France, claiming at least 30 lives, and cases of the flu are widespread across America, affecting every state except Hawaii. Earlier this year, 18-year-old Bethany Walker from Applecross, Scotland, died of pneumonia after sufferingfrom flu. So far this winter, there have been 93 flu-related deaths in England, according to Public Health England. Department statistics also show that over the last week there has been a 78% increase in people visiting the doctor with flu-like symptoms; a 50% increase in people taken into hospital with the flu and a 65% increase in intensive care flu admissions, compared to figures from the previous week. The flu rate in Scotland for the first week of 2018 was four times higher than the same week in 2017. Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies has advised NHS staff to make sure they are vaccinated against flu, warning: ""Flu can kill and it is important we all take it seriously."" Across the NHS, 59% of staff have had the vaccine but in some trusts less than 3 in 10 staff are protected. With January A&E waiting times the joint-worst on record, it is feared that many hospitals would struggle to cope with a flu epidemic should it hit in the midst of the NHS winter crisis."
2018-01-13,Britain's second-largest construction group is on the brink of collapse this weekend as its directors plot last-ditch talks aimed at securing new financial guarantees from ministers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180113174006/https://news.sky.com/story/carillion-teeters-on-brink-as-board-eyes-last-ditch-rescue-plan-11205705,"Sky News has learnt that Carillion, which is building the HS2 high-speed rail link and other big Government infrastructure projects, could crash into administration as soon as Monday. Its fate hangs on the outcome of emergency talks due to take place on Sunday with ‎Whitehall officials. The company has drawn up a plan that would see it being able to borrow significant amounts of new funding from its existing lenders if the Government agrees to guarantee payments at certain stages of public sector contracts. One insider said it was ""a make-or-break weekend"". ""Without that commitment of support from the Government, administration is all but inevitable,"" they said. Officials and Carillion's lenders are understood to have held emergency talks on Friday night - the latest in a series of crisis meetings conducted in recent days. Government sources indicated this weekend that ministers had decided against providing a direct financial bailout to loss-making Carillion and were also likely to be lukewarm about the latest rescue blueprint. That decision, which sources close to the company said they were unaware of on Saturday, would expose Theresa May's administration to a protracted and potentially chaotic fallout ‎from the failure of a major Government delivery partner. Employing 19,500 people in the UK alone, Wolverhampton-based Carillion is the second-largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains approximately half of the UK's prisons as well as roughly 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. It is also engaged in building the Aberdeen Bypass as well as schools across Britain. Without support from the Government, Carillion's syndicate of banks will not provide‎ up to £300m of new funding required from the end of the month. Sky News revealed on Friday that EY, the accountancy firm, had been placed on standby to act as administrator to Carillion. Ministers across Whitehall with responsibility for prisons, hospitals, schools and transport infrastructure have been drawing up contingency plans for the company's collapse, including establishing new vehicles to take on Carillion contracts. In a statement issued after the stock market closed on Friday, Carillion denied reports by the Press Association and the Financial Times that its lenders had rejected the company's revised business plan. It said it continued to hold ""constructive discussions with a range of financial and other stakeholders ‎regarding options to reduce debt and strengthen the group's balance sheet"". Carillion added that it was in dialogue about securing short-term financing ""while the longer-term discussions are continuing"". Government officials and regulators met on Friday to discuss how to safeguard the interests of more than 28,000 pension scheme members who could face cuts to retirement payments if Carillion does not survive. Senior civil servants from the Cabinet Office attended an emergency summit that included representatives from The Pensions Regulator (TPR), Pension Protection Fund (PPF), Carillion's pension trustees and an assortment of City advisers. Carillion has a pension deficit of roughly £580m, although this figure would be expected to rise sharply if measured according to the cost of insuring its various retirement schemes on a full buyout basis. The talks took place 24 hours after a meeting of ministers from across a multitude of Whitehall departments to discuss contingency plans for its collapse. Sky News revealed last weekend that Carillion needs hundreds of millions of pounds within weeks to survive. The rescue plan shown to lenders on Wednesday includes handing back some loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and potentially accepting financial support from the Government if it cannot secure it from private sector sources. Carillion's large syndicate of lenders includes Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK, as well as a host of overseas firms. A number of disposals aimed at raising cash, including that of its Canadian operations, are progressing more slowly than originally anticipated. Its only asset sale since the crisis erupted has been to offload a portfolio of healthcare contracts to rival outsourcer Serco for £50m - against a broader forecast for disposal proceeds of £300m. If it can survive in the short term, Carillion is also working on a plan to swap £1bn or more of its borrowings for new shares in the company, which is one of the Government's most important infrastructure delivery partners. Such a plan would leave its pension scheme, or the Pension Protection Fund, as a big shareholder. Last week, the company was dealt a fresh blow when the City watchdog launched a probe into the ""timeliness and content"" of statements it made to the‎ stock market about is financial position between December 2016 and July last year, when a massive profit warning sent its shares crashing by 75%. Since then, the company has cleared out its executive team, including chief executive Richard Howson and finance director Zafar Khan. Mr Howson was replaced on an interim basis by Keith Cochrane, the former Weir Group boss, with Andrew Davies due to arrive from Wates Group as his permanent successor on 22 January. Carillion reported a first-half pre-tax loss of £1.15bn in September, while it announced just before Christmas that its lenders had agreed to defer a test of its borrowing agreements from 31 December to 30 April. The company declined to comment on Saturday, while a Government spokeswoman said ""it should come as no surprise that we are carefully monitoring the situation while working to ensure our contingency plans are robust""."
2018-01-13,"The flu vaccine used to fight this winter's outbreak is only working in 30-40% of cases, the director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre laboratory in London has told Sky News.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180113174006/https://news.sky.com/story/flu-vaccine-only-works-in-30-40-of-cases-researchers-say-11205163,"Vaccination is the first line of defence against flu outbreaks, and laboratories around the world collaborate to try and develop the most effective defence against a virus that is constantly evolving. The vaccine developed this year is intended to protect against several strains, including the H3N2 virus, dubbed ""Aussie flu"" after Australia suffered its worst ever outbreak in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Dr John McCauley, director of the laboratory based at the Francis Crick Institute, said the threat posed by H3N2 may have been over-stated, and figures show it is responsible for only one in four cases. But the vaccine intended to control it has not proved as effective as hoped. ""The vaccine for this particular influenza, H3N2, is not particularly effective, it is basically considered of moderate effectiveness, which means 30-40% of cases will be avoided among people who have the vaccine,"" Dr McCauley said. ""At a public health level that is a lot less flu and it may also be reducing the impact of the virus on those that do get it."" Cases of flu have spiked in the last week according to Public Health England, with hospital admissions two and a half times higher than in the same week last year, and a 78% increase in cases reported by GPs. Britain has experienced only moderate flu levels in the last two winters, with the last really serious outbreak in 2014, and before that the 2009-10 swine flu outbreak. Flu is very infectious and spread by germs from coughs and sneezes, which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours. Use a tissue, bin used tissues and wash your hands thoroughly to stop the spread of flu germs. Catch it. Bin it. Kill it. https://t.co/0WnJUPsNoC pic.twitter.com/6OF0I7kFR3 Dr McCauley said if cases increase at the current rate it could become significant. ""What the prospect for this winter is I think too early to say. We know it is not going to be a mild winter, but whether it is moderate or severe we wait and see. The numbers are increasing, and if they continue increasing it's going to be quite an influenza season"" The impact is being felt particularly at GPs' surgeries, and the chair of the Royal College of GPs described the current rates as ""staggering"". Dame Helen Stokes Lampard told Sky News: ""The whole of the NHS is feeling the strain at the moment, and there is a lot of talk about the pressure accident and emergency is under, but actually the figures in GPs are staggering. ""There's been an 80% increase in the number of people coming to see their GP with flu or respiratory illness, and that's a huge increase in workload. ""It means every surgery in country will be feeling the pressure and there will be fewer appointments available for routine issues as we focus our energy on those who really need us, the acutely unwell."""

The serial conman is the subject of a European Arrest Warrant which is not recognised in non-EU Switzerland, though there is an extradition treaty between the Swiss and the British. The passport and residency permit were obtained in 2014, sometime after he fled the UK, and both are still valid. He rented an apartment above a shop in a drab northern suburb of Zurich, where we met a resident who helped him set up the accommodation as a favour to a mutual business associate. The man told us: ""I saw him when he picked up his correspondence, but he never lived here. ""The last time I saw him was three years ago when he was arrested, for some credit card allegation I think, but the police released him. ""I looked at his correspondence and everything was paid, so the arrest must have been for something else."" Acklom, 44, is on the run with his wife and two young daughters, suspected of fleecing British woman Carolyn Woods of her £850,000 life savings after promising to marry her. Sky News can reveal that he is also being investigated over other allegations. Detective Inspector Adam Bunting, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""There could be more charges. We are still investigating a number of incidents and reports to do with Mark Acklom and his activities in the Bath and Bristol areas going back to 2012 and 2013."" Acklom has changed his name officially several times over the years and used various aliases. He once wrote to a business associate: ""Regarding names etc. Under English law it's a normal procedure to change ones name..."" Architect David Hadfield said he rented his luxury Bath home to Acklom - then calling himself Mark Moss - and had to chase him for payment. When Acklom vanished, Mr Hadfield was still owed around £5,000 for design work Acklom had commissioned from him, so he hired a private detective to investigate. Mr Hadfield said: ""I didn't lose much, but I was worried that others might become bigger victims. The detective and I believed he was building up to a huge fraud on someone. He was such a strange guy, a pathological liar who can’t help himself. ""I Googled the name Mark Moss and couldn't find a thing about him and he tried to convince me he had paid £12m to wipe his identity from the internet."" :: Sightings reported of fugitive British conman Acklom :: Police searching for fugitive conman Acklom put focus on daughters Mr Hadfield passed the investigator's report to police, around the time that Acklom met Ms Woods in nearby Gloucestershire. He added: ""The police showed little interest, at least not for a long time. They have been to see me since and taken a statement."" After Acklom left Bath, two demands arrived for outstanding payments for his daughters' private school fees, for more than £10,000. :: If you have information about the whereabouts of Mark Acklom and are in the UK, contact Avon and Somerset Police by calling 101 and giving the reference number 7429713, visit avonandsomerset.police.uk/contact-us, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

Today it is even smaller - the latest figures put its strength at 78,000. There is room to grow. At some expense, the Army hired an external firm, Capita, to solve this problem. Capita has done extensive market research and has come up with five demographics who feel they might not belong in the Army. Some former officers have criticised the adverts for misrepresenting the Army - their argument is that the macho culture is a necessary part of joining the army. :: New Army adverts tell potential recruits it is okay to cry, be gay and practice your faith The military is a war-fighting machine not a kid's club, they say. It is important to note, however, that these adverts are part of a wider campaign - they are not supposed to sum up the entire culture of the Army in 30 seconds. The Army's problem isn't with recruitment. In 2016, 91,460 people applied to join. Last year that increased to 122,890. Where the army does have a problem is in retention. Between April 2016 and March 2017 8,194 people joined the Army but 9,775 left. The budgets cuts and whittling down of perks and incentives are having an effect. Army adverts have traditionally concentrated on the physical aspects, and benefits, to soldiering. This new focus on the emotional side of service is different and an attempt to showcase a modern military accepting of all. The Army might feel, and with some justification, that it is damned if it does, damned if it doesn't."

He lost his life in November after being washed overboard in the Indian Ocean, and was the third Briton to die competing in the event in the last two years. The MAIB has issued a safety bulletin after a preliminary investigation revealed what happened. The report said: ""A safety issue identified during the investigation was that the hook on the end of Mr Speirs’ tether had become caught under a deck cleat, resulting in a lateral loading that was sufficient to cause the hook to distort and eventually release."" The hook used is said to be certified and an international standard across the sailing world. It is designed to withstand pressures of over one ton when loaded longitudinally. The urgent advice to sailors is: ""To prevent the strength of a safety harness tether becoming compromised in-service due to lateral loading on the tether hook, the method used to anchor the end of the tether to the vessel should be arranged to ensure that the tether hook cannot become entangled with deck fittings or other equipment."" Mr Speirs was given a sea burial at his family's request, with a service led by his skipper. Organisers call the Clipper Race ""one of the biggest challenges of the natural world and an endurance test like no other"". Previous sailing experience is not required to enter the race but each of the 12 competing yachts has a fully qualified skipper on board. The year-long event costs £49,000 to enter and is the brainchild of Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to sail solo non-stop around the world. London company director Sarah Young, 40, died during the race in 2016 after falling overboard while sailing from China to Seattle. And in 2015, Andrew Ashman, 49, from Orpington in Kent, died after being hit by a rope while competing in the event. Following Mr Speirs' death, Sir Robin Knox-Johnston told Sky News he would cooperate fully with the MAIB which will publish its full report later this year."

He added: ""It is a pleasure to be here even though we were distracted by the actions of what some would call very stable geniuses.""

""I think for too long consumers have been fed up when they get this sneaky charge added to the end of a transaction be it online or anywhere... this ban will go for debit, credit cards and PayPal including Amex, so there is no uncertainty,"" he said. :: What will card surcharge ban mean for firms? Surcharges cost UK consumers £166m a year in 2015. Often the justification from businesses is that they're charged high costs to process the payments by the credit card companies or banks. Small business owner Guy Lachlan, whose company Classic Oils Ltd supplies lubricants for classic cars, believes the Government is wrong to go after the retailers. ""Credit cards are very expensive to accept, they vary depending on the type of card,"" he told Sky News. ""The Government perhaps should have looked at the cosy cartel of the credit card system in general. Big retailers, surprise surprise, pay lower fees and smaller retailers pay higher fees. ""Don't get me wrong every form of payment has a cost associated with it, but the question is are they fair?"" The new rules are being enforced by Trading Standards which has the power to take civil enforcement action against traders who breach the regulations. Companies like Just Eat have already made sure they won't be out of pocket - and been criticised for working around the new rules. Instead of singling out card payments it's introduced a new blanket service charge of 50p on all its orders, even if you're paying cash. Gareth Shaw, a money expert at Which?, says he expects other businesses might opt for a similar solution. ""Some firms have said they will inevitably increase prices in order to cover the cost of processing payments, whereas others out there have said absolutely not,"" he said. ""Really it's down to you as a consumer to seek out the best deal and if you're not happy with the price of goods or service, you can vote with your feet and go elsewhere."""

If an account holder is found to be in the UK illegally the bank must inform the Home Office, which will instruct on action that may include closing the account. ""These new measures are part of our commitment to make it more difficult for people with no right to live or work in the UK to remain here,"" immigration minister Caroline Noakes said. The measures have been criticised by rights groups who say they will expose vulnerable people to harm, as well as putting those with regular migration status at risk of having their accounts mistakenly closed. ""What is shocking about this system is that people's bank accounts, which they rely on for their jobs, their homes, and every aspect of life, can be closed with no clear means of redress or compensation in case of errors,"" said Chai Patel, legal policy director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. ""Additionally, this places people affected at even greater risk of exploitation and of being driven into a cash-only economy at the mercy of unscrupulous employers and landlords."" :: 'Unlawful' immigration clause could destroy data rights Banks and building societies have been required to check a person's immigration status before they open a current account since 2014, and a 2016 investigation found 10% of those denied an account after such checks had been refused wrongly. In a statement, the Home Office said only the details of people who were ""liable for removal"" or who had ""absconded from immigration control"" would be shared, and that asylum seekers and others whose applications were being processed would not be affected. Money will be returned to the account holders unless evidence of criminality is found, in which case an account could be frozen, the Home Office said. ""We must be firm with those who break the rules as illegal immigration impacts the whole of society,"" it added. ""Those living and working in the UK illegally can drive down the wages of lawful workers, allow rogue employers to undercut legitimate businesses and put pressure on taxpayer-funded public services."" The ""hostile environment"" refers to a range of Government policies aimed to make life difficult for people in the UK illegally, in order to encourage them to leave. Current measures seek to prevent people from working, renting accommodation or getting driving licences, and have seen demands for immigration checks implemented in hospitals and schools."

In August, a video was shared showing the 55-year-old actor jumping between two high roofs in London, supported only by a wire. Cruise seemingly fails to get the jump right, and then hurts his ankle getting up, causing Paramount to suspend production. According to director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise was ""always supposed to slam into the side of the building"" during the stunt. ""On the fourth try, he hit the building at a slightly different angle and he broke his ankle."" On Saturday, the American star was back at it, seen sprinting through Blackfriars rail bridge over the Thames, with a helicopter chasing him. Traffic was halted and boats kept from the area while the scenes were being shot. Reports in the US last year suggested the movie could see its release date postponed as Cruise recovered. But McQuarrie insisted the sixth instalment of the action franchise remains set for 27 July. Cruise is known for being one of the few film stars to do his own stunts in action-packed movies. He is due to begin filming for the long-awaited sequel to 1986 hit Top Gun later this year."

Intelligence revealed he had attempted to buy a car bomb which he wanted to use to kill his parents, fearing they would interfere in his relationship. According to police, he thought his parents would try to force him to end it, although it is not known why his mother disapproved of the girl. Randhawa, of Wightwick, Wolverhampton, was arrested by armed officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) last May after he obtained what he believed to be an explosive device and attempted to test it. The NCA said the package had been replaced with a ""safe dummy device"" before they allowed it to be delivered to the address he had provided when ordering the explosives. In July, Randhawa pleaded guilty to attempting to import explosives and was convicted at Birmingham Crown Court in November. It is not clear whether he had successfully ordered an explosive device on the dark web, or whether the person he believed he was buying the device from was an undercover officer or how police detected the sale, which typically would be through encrypted channels. Tim Gregory from the NCA said: ""The explosive device Randhawa sought to purchase online had the potential to cause serious damage and kill many people if he had been successful in using it. ""He was not involved in an organised crime group or linked to terrorism, but his actions show he is someone who poses a significant risk to the community. ""Identifying people like Randhawa - who seek to access illegal firearms and weapons - is a priority for the NCA and we will not stop in our efforts to make sure they are arrested and held accountable for their actions."" Andy Young, from the CPS, said: ""Gurtej Randhawa attempted to purchase explosives which could have resulted in deaths or serious injuries had they been used. ""He denied he planned to use the explosives to cause injury but the CPS demonstrated to the jury that this was a lie and Randhawa was observed attempting to test his device before being arrested.

The money made would be put back into maintaining the cleanliness of the city, which councillors say is much needed in times of austerity. The UNESCO world heritage site, which is best known for its Roman baths, Georgian streets and abbey, attracts around six million visitors a year. Tourism in the city and its surrounding areas supports around 10,000 jobs. Councillor Charles Gerrish told Sky News: ""Fundamentally it (the tax) happens all across Europe and the council has to be creative to meet the shortfall of funding that we currently face... Hopefully it would go to replacing the general revenue of the cleanliness of the city, so we make it look more attractive to visitors."" This isn't the first time that Bath has come up with the idea of introducing a levy - it previously had its plans rejected by Westminster last year. However, there has been a suggestion that Birmingham may be able to tax tourists in order to help fund the 2022 Commonwealth Games, which is being held in the city, and that has encouraged Bath to revisit its idea. But in Bath many hoteliers believe it will have a detrimental impact, especially as Britain's VAT rate is already higher than most other countries. Hotelier Lawrence Beere said: ""Why are we targeting just hotels? Hotels only represent 35% to 40% of the bed stock in Bath. There are things like Airbnb. So you have a small group of businesses who already have a lot of pressure, who have to pay a lot of tax. ""I think this form of tax will be anti-competitive to Bath. We are very expensive already. When you look at other cities like York people will think 'well, I will go and see other cities'. I think this could be seriously detrimental to Bath."" On the streets of the city there was a mixed reaction to the plans. Ted Soler, from Oklahoma in the United States, told Sky News: ""Frankly it would put me off. This place is too expensive as it is and adding more cost to visit the sites would be a great injustice."" Last year, film director Ken Loach, who is a local resident, said Bath could lose its UNESCO status if modern developments, aimed at attracting tourists, continued to be built. The plans for a levy by the local council would need to be approved by Westminster, but if they get the go ahead it would make Bath the first city in the country to tax tourists for a room."

The normally routine examination comes after the 71-year-old President has pushed back against suggestions by his detractors that he is mentally unfit for the job, declaring himself ""a very stable genius"". The White House also faced a barrage of questions last month after he slurred some words during a speech on national TV. Past presidential examinations have included vitals such as height, weight, body mass index, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation in the blood. They have also included more detailed examinations of the heart, lungs, vision, cholesterol and blood glucose - but the White House said ahead of the check-up that Mr Trump would not undergo a psychiatric assessment.

Mr Trump announced on Thursday he would not be visiting London to open the new $1bn (728.6m) embassy in Nine Elms, Battersea, in south London, next Tuesday. He tweeted: ""Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for 'peanuts,' only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" On Friday evening, the embassy released a statement which was potentially embarrassing for the President, as a spokesman explained it was not Barack Obama who made the decision, but George W Bush - a fellow Republican. :: Waxwork Trump mocks President outside embassy It said the current US embassy in Grosvenor Square, central London, had ""aged beyond its ability to be improved to current security and life safety standards without extensive investment in infrastructure that would require appropriated dollars"". US Ambassador Robert ""Woody"" Johnson - a Trump appointee - also explained in an article for the Evening Standard the decision to move the embassy was made in 2008 because of security fears after 9/11. He said it was a necessary change, even though the US had been linked to Grosvenor Square for more than 200 years. The embassy revealed the Nine Elms site, design and construction costs were all paid for by selling off other US government property in London."

Police are treating his death as ""unexplained"" and are expected to pass a report to a coroner. Mr Halligen's company, Oakley International, was hired on a £500,000 contract by Kate and Gerry McCann and the administrators of the Find Madeleine Fund in 2008, a year after their daughter vanished in Portugal. The McCanns had become frustrated with the failure of the Portuguese police to find Madeleine or any clue to what happened to her. Mr Halligen portrayed himself as a James Bond-type figure, though a source said he was later considered ""a bit of a fantasist"". The McCanns ended the investigator's contract in 2009, believing he had failed to deliver the work they were paying him for. Dublin-born Mr Halligen, who had dual American and Irish nationality, was later extradited to the US where he admitted fraud charges over a previous contract. He was jailed, but freed because of the time he had already served in custody and later returned to the UK. In a TV interview he denied he had misused funds in his Madeline investigation and dismissed accusations of leading a lavish lifestyle. Surrey Police said: ""We were called to an address in Cobbett Hill Road, Normandy, Guildford, on Monday following a report of a man in his 50s having been taken unwell, who subsequently died. ""The death is being treated as unexplained and a file will be passed to the coroner's office in due course."" The McCanns did not comment, but it is understood they had had no association with him since terminating his contract. Madeleine was nearly four when she disappeared from the family's rented holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve coast in May 2007. Her parents hired a series of private investigators who failed to find any trace of her. In 2011 Scotland Yard began a new investigation, funded by the UK government, but has not solved the mystery - though its work continues."

As cases of flu are on the rise, it is important NHS staff and eligible people get their flu jab – it is our best protection. @CMO_England has urged staff to get vaccinated: https://t.co/6ErfzPvSMN pic.twitter.com/9JlW2EO92V A Boots spokeswoman told Sky News that ""a very high level of demand in the recent week"" had meant that ""some Boots stores temporarily ran out of stock for a limited time."" She said new flu vaccine stock was now available at the Boots warehouse for their pharmacies to re-stock. Free flu jabs are available for children under nine, pensioners, pregnant women and people with certain long-term health conditions. For those who pay for their jab, the cost is about £13. The high uptake of the flu jab this winter follows Australia's worst outbreak on record, with an epidemic in Europe feared later in the year. The H3N2 strain, known as ""Australian flu"" or ""Aussie flu,"" has been linked to a number of deaths in Ireland. It has the same symptoms as common flu - including a high fever, exhaustion, a chesty cough and a sore throat. A flu epidemic has also hit France, claiming at least 30 lives, and cases of the flu are widespread across America, affecting every state except Hawaii. Earlier this year, 18-year-old Bethany Walker from Applecross, Scotland, died of pneumonia after sufferingfrom flu. So far this winter, there have been 93 flu-related deaths in England, according to Public Health England. Department statistics also show that over the last week there has been a 78% increase in people visiting the doctor with flu-like symptoms; a 50% increase in people taken into hospital with the flu and a 65% increase in intensive care flu admissions, compared to figures from the previous week. The flu rate in Scotland for the first week of 2018 was four times higher than the same week in 2017. Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies has advised NHS staff to make sure they are vaccinated against flu, warning: ""Flu can kill and it is important we all take it seriously."" Across the NHS, 59% of staff have had the vaccine but in some trusts less than 3 in 10 staff are protected. With January A&E waiting times the joint-worst on record, it is feared that many hospitals would struggle to cope with a flu epidemic should it hit in the midst of the NHS winter crisis."

""Our whole lives have been shattered,"" the statement said. ""This has torn our hearts from our bodies. ""Cassie was an amazing, kind human being who would do anything for anyone. ""She doted on all her family and our loss is beyond calculation. We ask that our family be left to grieve in private."" Andrew Burke, 30, of Vincent Street in St Helens, has been charged with murder and will appear at South Sefton Magistrates' Court in Bootle on Monday. Ms Hayes was on shift in the Chapel Street store on Saturday afternoon when the attack, which police described as domestic-related, took place. Shocked shoppers looked on as emergency services - including two air ambulances - rushed to try to save her life. The mother-of-one, who lived in the Southport area, was taken to hospital, where she died from her injuries. A post-mortem showed the cause of death was shock and haemorrhaging as a result of a wound to her throat. Tributes have been paid to a ""a lovely person"" who had an ""absolute heart of gold"". Former colleague Gordon Campbell, 44, from Preston, said he would remember her ""mischievous"" sense of humour. He said she was ""happy, full of love and... had an absolute heart of gold. She will be most definitely missed by everybody that knew her."" Another former colleague wrote on Facebook: ""Such sad news about Cassie, worked with her a few times when I was working for Tui and she was such a lovely person. Thoughts are with all my friends at Tui, Tui Southport and her family and friends. RIP Cassie xxx."" A police cordon remains around the area and a handful of bouquets have been laid outside Tui after being handed to officers. Ms Hayes' ex-partner, Leah McDonald, said on Facebook she was ""heartbroken and numb"". She posted: ""What can I say. This girl was my absolute world from the first moment we met on 4 July 2007 till this very day. ""We had our fall outs, our ups and downs but I can tell you now despite all that we absolutely loved each other and out of all the people in the world I could not of picked a better mammy for our child.

Ms Hayes' former boss, Michael Richards, wrote on Twitter: ""To all who knew our AMAZING Cassie. I was lucky enough to have been her manager at Thomson (Tui) Southport.

2018-01-14,The Justice Secretary David Gauke has requested advice from lawyers on whether the release of black cab rapist John Worboys could be challenged in court.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180114183937/https://news.sky.com/story/justice-secretary-david-gauke-to-intervene-on-john-worboys-release-11207198,"The decision of the Parole Board to approve the release of Worboys later this month caused outrage amongst his victims, charities and MPs. According to the Sunday Times, Mr Gauke who became Justice Secretary on Monday, has come under pressure from four fellow cabinet ministers to bring a judicial review of the decision. In a statement, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson confirmed lawyers had been asked to make an assessment on the merits of an intervention. :: Parole chief apologises to victims not told of Worboys' release :: How the Parole Board decided to release Worboys ""The Secretary of State commissioned advice last week about the plausibility and potential success of a judicial review; he is only minded to only move forward if there is a reasonable prospect of success,"" they said. A three-person panel decided the 60-year-old was no longer a danger to the public and approved his release on licence, but with 14 secret restrictions, yet his victims - who were attacked between 2002 and 2008 - only found out through the media. It is understood any challenge would focus on failures to communicate with victims about its decision, or to seek representations from victims on the licensing terms that Worboys would be subjected to. Last Tuesday, David Gauke delivered a statement in the House of Commons in relation to the Parole Board's decision. :: Victims urge CPS to bring fresh charges against Worboys :: Starmer: CPS made rapist decision He told MPs that a review, due to report back at Easter, would look at what changes could be made to the regulations that govern the Parole Board to allow greater transparency of the decision-making process and its communication with victims, but said it appeared the correct process had been followed in terms of the decision itself. ""While it appears the correct procedures were followed the fact that some victims learnt the decision from the media suggests there is a need to review these procedures to assess whether lessons can be learned and improvements can be made"", said Mr Gauke. It is understood the terms of Worboys release have yet to be finalised, and that his release will only take place once all victims who have subscribed to the Victim Contact Scheme have been given the opportunity to make representations to the Parole Board on the licensing conditions he will be subjected to. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Parole Board Nick Hardwick has urged MPs to back his calls to change the law to allow the board to better communicate how it arrives at decisions. :: Parole Board chair to face MPs over rapist's 'disturbing' release :: Worboys victims left in dark over rapist's release conditions Mr. Worboys was convicted in 2009 on 19 counts of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 women, and one count of rape. Last week the Crown Prosecution Service said it had no plans to review 93 unprosecuted allegations against Worboys, saying new evidence from police would be needed to referred to them. When he was sentenced in 2009, Worboys received an open-ended indeterminate public protection order - with a minimum tariff of eight years. If his release goes ahead, he will leave prison having served one year more than his minimum sentence."

Plummer and Williams were nominated for Golden Globes for their performances. Wahlberg said: ""Over the last few days my re-shoot fee for All the Money in the World has become an important topic of conversation. ""I 100% support the fight for fair pay and I'm donating the $1.5m to the Time's Up Legal Defence Fund in Michelle Williams' name.""

Time's Up was launched by hundreds of leading Hollywood women on New Year's Day to address ""the systemic inequality and injustice in the workplace that have kept underrepresented groups from reaching their full potential"". It also aims to generate a fund to provide legal support to people who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. It followed the #MeToo movement, which encouraged victims to speak out in the wake of the Weinstein scandal - and took the 75th annual Golden Globes awards ceremony by storm last week."

""I love the hills, I love the mud, I love the beautiful places we run in. But I find it had to believe that women are still not racing over the same distances as men."" For women who run competitively, in England races are often much shorter. At the English National Championships, the men run 12k, while the women are only allowed to run eight. ""People outside of running have no idea that this sort of discrimination is happening,"" says Ms Hodson. ""On the roads we all run marathons and half marathons, on the track we all race over the same distance, but cross country is stuck in a bit of a time warp. ""There are many reasons we're given, the main one seems to be tradition, that it's the way it's always been done. They also say there isn't enough time to run a longer race."" In a statement to Sky News, the English Cross Country Association said: ""Distances for cross country races are determined by the individual competition providers rather than as a requirement of UKA Rules for Competition. ""As a result, in many races male and female competitors at all levels compete over different distances at senior level. In championships this is usually 8k for women and 12k for men. These distances have evolved over the years and are at present the ones traditionally used."" It went on to say: ""We are pleased to confirm we will be conducting a survey with athletes at next month's National Cross Country Championships in London."" In the meantime, Ms Hodson has started an online petition demanding change. She says there's a simple solution. ""We could all run the distance in the middle, so for instance instead of 8k for women and 12k for men, we could all run 10k. This is what's happening in the world championships, this is what's happening in the Scottish nationals, but not yet here in England."" British long-distance runner Jo Pavey, a World, European and Commonwealth medallist, agrees it makes little sense. ""I think it is patronising, when women are competing in the same events as men across all the different distances on the track and the road, and actually when you go to longer distances physiologically women have been shown to become more equal to men, rather than the other way around,"" she says. ""Women are achieving such great things, there are great role models out there. Women have obviously been running the marathon for many years now and it is very patronising to suggest that women aren't as capable as men."""

In August, a video was shared showing the 55-year-old actor jumping between two high roofs in London, supported only by a wire. Cruise seemingly fails to get the jump right, and then hurts his ankle getting up, causing Paramount to suspend production. According to director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise was ""always supposed to slam into the side of the building"" during the stunt. ""On the fourth try, he hit the building at a slightly different angle and he broke his ankle."" On Saturday, the American star was back at it, seen sprinting through Blackfriars rail bridge over the Thames, with a helicopter chasing him. Traffic was halted and boats kept from the area while the scenes were being shot. Reports in the US last year suggested the movie could see its release date postponed as Cruise recovered. But McQuarrie insisted the sixth instalment of the action franchise remains set for 27 July. Cruise is known for being one of the few film stars to do his own stunts in action-packed movies. He is due to begin filming for the long-awaited sequel to 1986 hit Top Gun later this year."

Fantastic Xmas dinner with our leader @_henrybolton 🎄#ukip pic.twitter.com/UtR2ib73Hs In a statement to the newspaper, Ms Marney apologised ""unreservedly"" for the ""shocking language"" she used in the messages. ""The opinions I expressed were deliberately exaggerated in order to make a point and have, to an extent, been taken out of context. Yet I fully recognise the offence they have caused,"" she added. Mr Bolton, who was elected party leader in September, tweeted to say Ms Marney had been suspended from the party ""immediately upon us receiving this information"". He was responding to a teenage party activist who urged him to publicly call for Ms Marney to have her membership removed. Jo was suspended immediately upon us receiving this information. ""Her words were blatantly racist and there should be no room for that in UKIP,"" wrote 16-year-old Jack Penny on Twitter. ""Also it would be hypocritical to allow her to stay... because he said in the leadership election he was the candidate against racism and nazis so she has to go or he and @UKIP are doomed if we let this behaviour happen in the party,"" he added.

Party chairman Paul Oakden told the Mail on Sunday that Ms Marney was suspended from the party membership immediately after he was made aware of the messages. ""UKIP does not, has not and never will condone racism,"" he said. Earlier this month, Mr Bolton announced in a letter to UKIP supporters that he had started a relationship with Ms Marney after splitting from his wife, but denied a ""clandestine affair"". He left his wife Tatiana, 42, who gave birth to their second daughter at London's St Pancras station in 2016 after going into labour on a train, prior to his relationship with Ms Marney becoming public. On Sunday, he dismissed claims on Twitter that he was in Ms Marney's company when he appeared on television in mid-October as ""rubbish"".

He claimed failure to do so would plunge the NHS winter crisis to a new level. Mr Ashworth said the current situation was ""very serious indeed"" - as ministers met in Whitehall for crunch talks about Carillion's fate. Patients deserved ""peace of mind"", he added, that hospital services such as catering, maintenance and cleaning work would continue even if the contracted firm went into administration. Carillion, which is Britain's second largest construction group but also operates in schools and hospitals, is on the brink of collapse. Administrators could be called in within days unless shareholders, creditors or the Government agree to stump up funds, it is believed. The company has struggled since reporting half-year losses of £1.15bn. Carillion is currently leading the HS2 construction and other big Government infrastructure projects. Mr Ashworth urged Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to come to the House of Commons on Monday and give ""clarity"" about the situation. He told Sky News: ""I think we do need that clarity from the Government - Monday, I would say, in the House of Commons. ""But certainly as soon as possible, because the NHS is in a state - we're in a huge winter crisis. ""I've been on Sky umpteen times in recent days, talking about the scale of the crisis in the NHS with people in corridors on trolleys and so on.

TUC deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said vital public services and tens of thousands of jobs were at risk. ""Workers, taxpayers and public service users could well be left to carry the can,"" he said, warning against a Government bailout. ""Carillion is a textbook example of the failures of privatisation and outsourcing. ""The Government needs to step in, guarantee jobs and services, and explain how they let this mess happen in the first place."" Earlier, new Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""It is a growing concern. ""It's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say it is a growing concern. ""I would hope to see that the working capital they need will be there, working with their partners.

Today it is even smaller - the latest figures put its strength at 78,000. There is room to grow. At some expense, the Army hired an external firm, Capita, to solve this problem. Capita has done extensive market research and has come up with five demographics who feel they might not belong in the Army. Some former officers have criticised the adverts for misrepresenting the Army - their argument is that the macho culture is a necessary part of joining the army. :: New Army adverts tell potential recruits it is okay to cry, be gay and practice your faith The military is a war-fighting machine not a kid's club, they say. It is important to note, however, that these adverts are part of a wider campaign - they are not supposed to sum up the entire culture of the Army in 30 seconds. The Army's problem isn't with recruitment. In 2016, 91,460 people applied to join. Last year that increased to 122,890. Where the army does have a problem is in retention. Between April 2016 and March 2017 8,194 people joined the Army but 9,775 left. The budgets cuts and whittling down of perks and incentives are having an effect. Army adverts have traditionally concentrated on the physical aspects, and benefits, to soldiering. This new focus on the emotional side of service is different and an attempt to showcase a modern military accepting of all. The Army might feel, and with some justification, that it is damned if it does, damned if it doesn't."

The intervention came amid a furious attack from shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who called Mr Trump ""an asteroid of awfulness"". ""He is a danger. He is a racist,"" she said. Commenting for the first time since the US leader pulled out of a visit to London to open a new embassy, Mr Corbyn was asked if Britain's relationship with the US was the most important. ""No,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. ""I think there are many important relationships. ""The US one is obviously culturally and economically significant and important. ""The biggest disappointment of Donald Trump is, apart from his endless offensive remarks about women, about minorities and about different faiths, is his failure to support international institutions like the United Nations and like UNESCO."" Mr Corbyn also claimed a former prime minister had told him that ""if they specified what the special relationship was, it wouldn't be a special relationship"". He declined to say who. The Labour leader acknowledged having a relationship with the US was important because ""it is such a huge military and economic power"". New immigration minister Caroline Nokes said Britons should give Mr Trump ""a good welcome"" when he does visit the UK. She denied the Foreign Office had failed over the US leader's outburst about cancelling the visit on Twitter, saying: ""There was never a date set. I am sure that he will come here. We will accord, to the President of one of our greatest allies, an invitation to come here."" New Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We have a hugely important relationship with the US. ""It is right that the President is welcome to the UK. It would be beneficial to us."" It comes amid a report in The Times that Mr Trump's decision to cancel the visit was for ""personal reasons"" after perceived slights form Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan. A Whitehall source told the newspaper: ""I don't think anyone believes this is an issue of policy or divergence between our countries."" Mr Trump announced his decision to pull out of the visit on Friday, claiming it was because the old embassy site had been sold for ""peanuts"" and he did not want to cut the ribbon on the new one as it was in an ""off location""."
2018-01-14,Jeremy Corbyn has hit out at Labour critics calling for him to back the UK staying in the single market after Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180114183937/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-corbyn-faces-down-critics-over-eu-single-market-stance-11207582,"The Labour leader insisted that continuing the trade arrangement was dependent on being in the EU. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""The single market is dependent on membership of the European Union. ""Do we have a trading relationship with Europe which is tariff-free, which is based on access to that market, and access of Europe to our market? Yes. ""Do we push for that in the negotiations? Yes. Is that what we have said to the European Union in opposition? Yes. ""You have to make a special relationship with the European Union."" But the comments sparked a swift backlash from some Labour MPs. Chris Leslie tweeted: ""The Single Market is NOT dependent on membership of the EU"". He posted the comment four times, followed by: ""#worthrepeating."" His colleague Chuka Umunna also pointed out on Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson that Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway were in the single market but not part of the EU28. A Labour source told Sky News it was ""completely false"" to claim the single market was a ""membership club"", pointing out that countries outside the EU did not get to set the terms of the trade arrangement. Mr Corbyn also faced questions about Labour's stance on a second Brexit referendum. He said the party was ""not supporting or calling"" for one, but dodged questions about whether he could change his mind in the future. His shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, earlier told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""If 90% of the population was now saying we must stay in the European Union and we must not leave then that would be a challenge that would be there for all of us who are democrats. ""But, at the moment, and as things currently stand, we proceed in good faith, we do as we are instructed and we are leaving the European Union."" While shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams told Sky News a second referendum was ""not something we support"". MEP and former UKIP spokesperson Steven Woolfe blasted calls for another poll, which would bring the total number on EU membership up to three since 1975. ""It's not a game of tic-tac-toe - we're not here to have the best of three,"" he said. New Conservative deputy-chair James Cleverly said Mr Corbyn's comments showed that ""every step of the way Labour are trying to frustrate the Brexit process rather than make a success of it""."

""They’ve met up and spoken about it a number of times and this is the decision he has made,"" the source added. ""They are getting divorced. He is obviously really upset about it."" McPartlin has spoken publicly about his time in rehab, with his problems having reportedly been triggered by failed knee surgery. ""I've spoken out because I think it's important that people ask for help if they're going through a rough time and get the proper treatment to help their recovery,"" he said last year. ""I feel like I have let a lot of people down and for that I am truly sorry. ""I want to thank my wife, family and closest friends for helping me through this really difficult time.""

They say the change to the Bill would prevent ministers being able to take the UK out of the single market and customs union without the approval of Parliament. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said opposition parties had the power to change the course of Brexit - if Labour backed the move. ""This amendment is a significant step in the fight against Brexit, demonstrating the increased willingness of parties to work together formally rather than just behind the scenes,"" said Sir Vince. ""Through the four leaders in the House of Commons, we are presenting a united front. We urge the leadership of a fifth opposition party, Labour, to join us so we can change course from the dangerous Brexit being pursued by the Conservatives."" Ian Blackford, the SNP's leader in Westminster, said: ""With just 10 months to go before a deal is due between the UK and EU, sensible MPs of all parties must now unite to protect our vital place in the single market."" His Plaid Cymru counterpart Liz Saville-Roberts added: ""We remain hopeful that the Labour Party will work with us and take the opportunity to defeat the Tories."" And Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: ""We urge the Labour leadership to join us in backing this crucial amendment - and show that they too are willing to put the national interest first."" On Saturday, Labour MP Wes Streeting said the party was now the ""single biggest barrier"" to Britain remaining in the single market and claimed a rethink by Jeremy Corbn would be a ""game-changing moment"" in British politics. But a Labour spokesperson confirmed the party would not be backing the proposed change to the legislation. ""This amendment would not keep the UK in the single market and customs union, nor does it intend to deal with the serious flaws in this Bill,"" they said. ""Labour has been clear that we want a time-limited transition on the same basic terms we have now. Following that, we want a final deal that retains the benefits of the customs union and the single market. Options for achieving that are subject to the negotiations."" It comes after shadow Brexit secretary Sir Kier Starmer told an audience at the Fabian Society conference in London that Labour would vote against any Brexit deal that did not contain the ""exact same benefits"" that the UK currently enjoys through membership of the single market and customs union. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: ""We respect the four freedoms of the EU and that is why, as we leave the EU, we are leaving the single market and customs union. ""The purpose of the Withdrawal Bill is to provide a functioning statute book on the day we leave the EU, not to pursue policy choices like this.

2018-01-14,New EU rules come into effect today which will mean customers can't be penalised with extra fees for choosing to pay by credit or debit card. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180114183937/https://news.sky.com/story/why-have-businesses-charged-for-using-cards-and-what-will-a-ban-mean-for-them-11204901,"But what will the Payment Services Directive mean for businesses? Why were some businesses charging extra for card payments in the past? Up until now, firms were allowed to pass the costs of processing a card payment on to their customers. When you choose to pay via credit or debit card, either in a shop or online, the retailer has to pass a percentage of your money on to the company which organises the payment - usually either Mastercard or Visa. Some of that money is then forwarded to your bank via an 'interchange fee', which the bank uses to fund the cost of issuing your card and managing your electronic payments, and to the processor who owns the technology platform used to transfer the money. Many businesses and websites have been adding those extra costs on to your bill, either in the form of a percentage value of the transaction or through a flat card fee. Government bodies have also been guilty of this; some councils and public services have been charging more to pay with card rather than via cash or direct debit. But why did paying with a credit card often cost more than a debit card? Although payments using debit and credit cards are managed in the same way, most banks see more risk in sending a credit payment as opposed to debiting money directly from your account, and so they charge higher interchange fees. And even then not all credit card fees are equal - American Express charges firms a higher rate to process payments than Mastercard or Visa, which is why some businesses decide it's cheaper not to accept them at all. So what's changed? Essentially, the only thing that is now different is that companies are no longer allowed to pass these extra charges on to their customers; consumers must pay the same price for goods and services whether they choose to pay with cash or with plastic. So the companies and businesses you buy from will now have to absorb the extra costs of credit and debit payments themselves. So will this mean I'll be charged less? Not necessarily. Some firms, including food delivery firm JustEat, have already announced that they intend to simply extend the extra fees to all customers regardless of their payment method, rather than scrap them for those using cards. By choosing to levy fees on those using cash as well as those using plastic they are still treating all payment methods equally and so are within the rules. Other companies are expected to raise prices in order to pay the extra costs. Could small businesses be hurt by the changes? According to some, yes. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the proportion of small firms reporting a rise in costs was at a five-year high. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""Removing their freedom to share the burden of card payment fees will give them yet another outgoing to worry about."" There are fears that the travel industry will be particularly affected, as the need to process payments in several currencies means they may have to shoulder higher costs than other sectors. Will this ban on fees remain in place after Brexit? The Government has said this directive will be part of UK law after the country leaves the EU"

The men and Chips, who once met then prime minister Winston Churchill, landed at dawn but came under fire from a machine gun nest as soon as they arrived. The dog escaped from his lead and ran towards the line of fire as the soldiers taking part in the US-led mission - Operation Husky - headed for cover. Soldiers could only watch as Chips headed into a shack where enemy fighters were positioned and stopped the gunfire. An enemy soldier then emerged from the hut with the dog at his throat before Chips grabbed a machine gun by the barrel and pulled it off its mount. The American and British soldiers were then able to push forward. Chips was left with scalp wounds and powder burns as a result of his efforts. PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said the ""heroic"" pooch ""undoubtedly"" saved lives. She said: ""It has taken over seven decades but Chips can now finally take his place in the history books as one of the most heroic dogs to serve with the US Army."" Chips also served as a sentry dog at the Casablanca Conference in Morocco in January 1943 as the Allies fought to clear Germans from North Africa. It was during this period he met Mr Churchill and US president Franklin Roosevelt, who were deciding on the Allies' future strategy in the conflict. The accolade was awarded on the 75th anniversary of the Casablanca Conference and was received by US Air Force dog Ayron on behalf of Chips. Chips was donated to the war effort by the father of Vietnam War veteran John Wren, 76, who flew to the UK from New York to attend the award ceremony. The pooch returned home when Mr Wren was four and resumed his role as the family pet after the war. ""He is finally getting good recognition of his efforts,"" said Mr Wren. ""If you look at what he did, it was pretty unbelievable."" Other heroic animals awarded the Dickin Medal include a trio of Second World War pigeons and a Royal Navy cat called Simon."

Police are appealing for the public's help again after having no luck in finding the child's parents. Scientific analysis found the birth most likely happened in bushes next to the park between 6pm on 15 May and 8am the following day. Detective chief inspector Dave Storey said this led to a review of CCTV footage which found images of two people walking past the birth scene 10 times between 11.30pm on 15 May and 12.30am on 16 May. A post-mortem examination found the child died within six hours of her birth. The baby suffered multiple blunt force injuries to her head and other minor injuries to her body. DCI Storey said a DNA profile taken from the baby showed her mother, and probably the child's father, were of East Asian ethnicity. ""This remains a particularly sad case which despite extensive investigation we are still are nowhere nearer to identifying the newborn baby, Baby M, nor her mother,"" he said. ""We have a baby who is unnamed and at this stage is still not buried and we would like some assistance in order to identify the mother and obtain some justice for Baby M. ""Initially when the investigation was launched we were concerned regarding the health of the mother, so there were lots of inquiries undertaken with local partners, NHS and local communities in order to identify the mother which were unsuccessful."" He added: ""We have carried out lots of inquiries since then including pathology, scientific work regarding the baby's ancestry and what was established fairly early on was the baby's death was a result of deliberate head injuries and as such we launched a murder inquiry. ""We still would like to identify the mother and provide some support because it takes an awful lot for a mother to give birth to a child to then either kill the baby or have the baby taken away from her and killed immediately afterwards."" DCI Storey said detectives ""strongly believe"" the couple who walked past the birth scene 10 times may be connected with the birth and subsequent murder. He asked the public to come forward if they witnessed anything or have any information to identify the pair. Police are also carrying out house-to-house inquiries in and around Manor Park to try to identify witnesses."

Ryanair’s Kenny Jacobs said: ""This new policy is centred around lower checked bag fees and bigger bag allowances and we have notified by email all our customers travelling from Monday. ""All Ryanair customers will still be free to bring two free carry-on bags but we will now ask non-priority customers to put their bigger bag in the hold – free of charge – in order to eliminate boarding delays and improve our industry leading on-time departures.

The company had been carrying out a number of Government construction projects - including the HS2 railway, multi-million pound hospitals and the Aberdeen bypass - as well as maintenance and catering services for the Ministry of Defence. :: Carillion collapse: The day's developments as they happened Downing Street has admitted eight new contracts were signed with Carillion since July last year, when the firm issued a profit warning to spark a share value fall. Speaking in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington sought to reassure Carillion staff following the company's ""regrettable"" collapse. He said the Government is ""doing everything possible to minimise any impact on employees"", adding: ""All employees should continue to turn up to work confident in the knowledge they will be paid for the public services that they are providing."" A helpline is being set up for those staff affected, with ministers also aiming to reassure sub-contractors of Carillion. :: What ultimately went wrong at Carillion? :: How Carillion's demise could affect you Mr Lidington also sought to dismiss fears taxpayers' could be left with a hefty bill due to Carillion's demise. He told MPs: ""It is regrettable that Carillion has not been able to find suitable financing options with its lenders and I am disappointed that the company has become insolvent as a result. ""It is however the failure of a private sector company and it is the company's shareholders and its lenders who will bear the brunt of the losses: taxpayers should not and will not bail out a private sector company for private sector losses or allow rewards for failure."" Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett accused the Government of being ""recklessly complacent"" by attempting to lay sole blame for Carillion's collapse on the company. He said: ""The House will conclude it was recklessly complacent in seeking to avoid responsibility for the Government and placing the whole responsibility on the company.

Mr Gilmer and a woman were found injured at the property after officers were alerted to a disturbance at about 9.20pm on Friday. According to reports, a crossbow was used in the attack and the village is in ""lockdown"". Mr Gilmer died at Hull Royal Infirmary on Saturday, while the woman, who has not been named, remains in a stable condition. Police teams including dogs and the force helicopter are searching the area and local woods. The force is appealing for information to trace 55-year-old Anthony Lawrence following the attack. His car - a navy blue Vauxhall Meriva - has been found. The force said it was supporting Mr Gilmer's family during this ""difficult and sad time"", adding that ""the investigation to find the person responsible is ongoing"". Chief Inspector Andy Parsons said: ""We are still appealing for anyone who believes they have seen Mr Lawrence to call us immediately.

2018-01-15,"Lenders to Carillion, the construction giant which collapsed into liquidation on Monday, are facing losses of up to £2bn, making it one of the costliest corporate insolvencies for years.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180115191611/https://news.sky.com/story/banks-face-2bn-of-losses-from-collapse-of-hs2-contractor-carillion-11208802,"Sky News has learnt that a complex series of financing arrangements for subsidiaries of Carillion mean that the total exposure of its banking syndicate is far higher than the £900m headline debt figure carried by the listed construction group. Industry sources said that £2bn was ""a sensible estimate"" of the huge losses confronting the company's banks, following the failure of last-ditch rescue talks over the weekend. :: LIVE: Ailing construction giant Carillion collapses Carillion's large syndicate of lenders includes Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Santander UK, as well as a host of overseas firms.‎ Lenders were asked for roughly £20m to keep Carillion trading for another week, according to sources, but the absence of Government support for the company made the proposal unworkable. The construction group's lenders are not the only creditors facing financial pain from its collapse. The UK's pensions lifeboat faces a hit of up to £900m to cover the cost of paying compensation to thousands of pension scheme members, according to initial estimates. If the Pension Protection Fund's (PPF) exposure did reach that level, it would make it the single-largest bill in the organisation's history. The PPF reassured employees on Monday that their benefits would be protected. Carillion's collapse into compulsory liquidation came after weeks of increasingly urgent discussions with the Government and the company's lenders. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, said it was ""regrettable"" that Carillion had not secured a private rescue deal but added that ""taxpayers cannot be expected to bail out a private company"". The construction group, which counted the HS2 high-speed rail link and hundreds of schools, hospitals and prisons among the public sector work it was contracted for, had seen mounting losses in recent months after mispricing a series of projects. Wolverhampton-based Carillion is the second-largest supplier to Network Rail and maintains approximately half of the UK's prisons as well as roughly 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. More than 19,000 UK-based employees of Carillion now face an uncertain future, although the Government insisted that they would continue to be paid through the Official Receiver. Government sources had said that emergency talks on Sunday concluded with John Manzoni, the permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, announcing that Carillion would not receive any special support from taxpayers. The company's bosses had hoped that ministers might agree to a proposal made over the weekend to guarantee payments on public sector contracts, which would enable it to borrow more money. Carillion needed £300m of short-term funding from the end of this month, and its banks had previously indicated that they were reluctant to provide it without significant support from the Government. As recently as Friday night, Carillion insisted it was holding ""constructive discussions with a range of financial and other stakeholders ‎regarding options to reduce debt and strengthen the group's balance sheet"". Philip Green, the company's chairman, said the collapse meant it was ""a very sad day for Carillion"". As an agent of the Insolvency Service, the Official Receiver is responsible for examining the causes of corporate failure, a role that will include investigating directors' conduct and ""the business, dealings and affairs of the company"", according to a Government statement. Carillion had issued a string of profit warnings during the last six months, sending it scrambling to raise more cash after unveiling a thumping £1.1bn loss for the half-year. Earlier this month, the company was dealt a fresh blow when the City watchdog launched a probe into the ""timeliness and content"" of statements it made to the‎ stock market about its financial position between December 2016 and July last year, when a massive profit warning sent its shares crashing by 75%. Since then, the company has cleared out its executive team, including chief executive Richard Howson and finance director Zafar Khan. Mr Howson was replaced on an interim basis by Keith Cochrane, the former Weir Group boss, with Andrew Davies having been due to arrive from Wates Group as his permanent successor next week."

2018-01-15,Carillion ultimately went under for the same reason every company goes under - it was overwhelmed by its debts and was unable to obtain further credit from its lenders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180115191611/https://news.sky.com/story/what-ultimately-went-wrong-at-carillion-11209011,"Behind that, though, is the story of a company that was consistently too optimistic about the profitability of the work it was doing. At the heart of that were cost overruns on major construction projects on which Carillion was working as a contractor for the Government: the £745m Aberdeen bypass, the £335m Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the £350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital at Smethwick near Birmingham. :: Banks face £2bn loss from collapsed Carillion There were specific difficulties with each of these three projects. In Liverpool, for example, asbestos was found on the brownfield site on which the new hospital was being built, high winds hampered the use of cranes and the discovery of cracks in the building also delayed completion. In Aberdeen, low progress in completing initial earthworks pushed back the completion date. In Smethwick, there were problems with the ventilation, heating and lighting systems. Contrary to what the unions often argue, Government contracts of these kind are not a licence to print money, but typically provide only wafer-thin profit margins for the contractors involved. Because the work is done over a long period of time, the revenues they are likely to generate for the contractor are often little more than estimates at the time they bid for the contract, frequently making them subject to revision. That was why, when on 10 July last year Carillion issued the first of three profits warnings, the company unveiled an astonishing provision of £845m - including some £599m worth of income it had previously expected to receive but no longer expected to. :: How Carillion's demise could affect you As Keith Cochrane, the respected engineering industry veteran who was parachuted in to try and rescue the company, said at the time: ""Tenders have been accepted with a high degree of uncertainty about key assumptions; our ultimate success has been contingent on the performance of others not under our control and we've agreed design changes without agreeing incremental cost and value."" So this was a company that did not have a handle on its costs, was over-optimistic about the work it had taken on and had over-reached itself in terms of the projects it took on. Delays in payments for work it had taken on in the Middle East added to its woes and getting out of contracts both there and in Canada added to strain on the balance sheet. As the company's debts mounted, from around £695m in mid-2017 to an estimated £925m now, banks were reluctant to extend further credit to the company over and above the £140m that it raised from lenders - at a punishing rate of interest - in October last year. Shareholders, it had been clear from July last year, were also reluctant to throw good money after bad. By the time of July's profits warning, rumours were already swirling around the City about Carillion's financial health. Hedge funds have, for more than two years, been selling shares in Carillion in anticipation of the price falling lower. They began digging into the company's accounts after it failed to pull off a merger with rival Balfour Beatty in 2014 and were further alerted to the company's financial plight when it lengthened its payment terms to suppliers to 120 days - always a sign that a company is trying to conserve cash. The collapse of Carillion raises all kinds of questions, among which the most pressing is why both ministers and civil servants agreed to hand the company further work following July's profits warning. Another is to whether Carillion kept the market properly updated on its financial situation, something into which the Financial Conduct Authority, the chief City regulator, is already looking, with a statement in December 2016 that said the company's performance was ""meeting expectations"" and that it expected ""strong growth in total revenue and increased operating profits"" looking particularly dubious. A third question is why KPMG signed off on Carillion's 2016 report and accounts, published at the end of March last year, just months before the company issued its profits warning. Then there are other questions about what this will mean for subcontractors used by the company and the other contractors with which they were working on larger projects. Balfour Beatty, which was working with Carillion on three road projects including the Aberdeen bypass, has said the latter's failure will cost it between £35-£45m this year. Pensioners, meanwhile, can expect a reduction in their retirement incomes when Carillion's 13 pension schemes are tipped into the Pension Protection Fund. Other questions include the cost to the taxpayer: while the Government refused the bail out the company, it is still paying the cost of receivership, which will include the cost of re-tendering contracts. This episode also raises questions about whether some public sector contracts on which Carillion was working, notably HS2, can be delivered at the price ministers have said they can. Longer term, Carillion's collapse is likely to reignite a debate about whether the Government should be running all major infrastructure projects. That seems unlikely, though: even before the birth of the Private Finance Initiatives so beloved by both major parties, the use of private sector contractors in projects such as roadbuilding was commonplace. The Government cannot do everything - as the recent travails of the NHS have shown - while it interacts with the private sector in all other kinds of activity already anyway, whether that is in the supply of school, hospital and prison dinners, the provision of uniforms and equipment for the military, the cleaning of Government offices and the provision of IT services. There is no logical reason why infrastructure work should be treated differently than these other activities. And, if it was, there is no guarantee that it would be immune from the bad management of the kind that sank Carillion - which, potentially, would leave taxpayers facing the kind of hammering that creditors and shareholders have suffered during the last 18 months."
2018-01-15,A raft of pro-Jeremy Corbyn candidates have swept the board in a crucial election to Labour's National Executive Committee.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180115191611/https://news.sky.com/story/crucial-national-executive-committee-vote-transforms-labours-future-11209060,"Among them is John Lansman, the founder of left-wing pressure group Momentum. Manchester councillor Yasmine Dar and long-standing member of Labour's National Policy Forum Rachel Garnham also join the body, which runs the party and sets its rules. Comedian Eddie Izzard and other candidates on the centrist side of the party - including one former NEC member standing for re-election - missed out on the roles. BREAK: All 3 Momentum/Left candidates elected to Labour’s NEC. Walked it. pic.twitter.com/9ucCGqwAks Although little noticed since the turn of the year amid the trials of Theresa May's latest botched reshuffle and the NHS winter crisis, they were the latest staging post in the Labour civil war. Hitherto, control of the NEC has largely eluded the leadership, with the composition being finely balanced between left and right. Technically, with Kezia Dugdale's shock resignation as Scottish Labour leader last year, the left had a small advantage. But with their win on Monday, that majority has become well entrenched. That worries plenty of Labour MPs. They know that the long-term aim of the left is to wrest more control from Members of Parliament to members of the Labour party. At the forefront of that movement was Jon Lansman, perennial ""Labour Lefty"" (as he calls himself). He told me: ""I think members need to have a greater say and need to be seen to have a greater say because firstly they need to feel ownership of it, but we also have 600,000 members who know their communities, fellow workers and their workplaces."" In practice this could mean lowering once again the number of MPs required to nominate someone for the leadership (or allowing party members, trade unions or affiliated Labour groups to do so as well). Or it could mean handing power of manifesto policy setting to the membership (possibly, as Lansman tells me, through ""the power of digital democracy""). Mandatory re-selection of MPs could also be on the cards, meaning those already sitting in the Commons would have to be readopted as candidates by their local parties before every general election. There's no doubt Lansman and his fellow left-wingers have deeply held beliefs on democratisation of the party. There's also little doubt that they also believe such measures would empower their own wing of the party and embed the Corbyn legacy and permanently transform Labour. With a larger majority on the NEC this project can begin with gusto. There is, however, one solitary fleck of grit in the Corbyn oyster. Another slow-rumbling development in Labour politics could derail this new leftist-hegemony. Len McCluskey, the close Corbyn ally and General Secretary of Unite (Labour's biggest donor and Britain's biggest trade union), could have his election as the head of his union declared void - after alleged voting irregularities. If that happened it would throw Unite into turmoil and he may potentially have to hand over to Gerard Coyne, no friend of Corbyn. That could make Unite's seats on the NEC up for grabs and the left's majority might in the medium-term disappear. A Labour source tells me the Unite decision might come very soon. It's just a reminder that just when one faction seems unassailable the political gods have a peculiar way of redressing the balance. In the 1990s and 2000s it looked as if the Labour left was moribund, never to return. Now they seem invincible. But invincibility can be fleeting. Perhaps then all the more reason to move quickly. Now the Corbynistas have won this battle, expect more headlines on changes to party rules - and sooner rather than later."

It comes as no surprise to Laura Willoughby, who set up the mindful drinking movement Club Soda in 2015. Since then 15,000 people have joined to try to cut down or stop drinking altogether. ""Society says it's a suitable and acceptable coping mechanism... so stopping means having to unpick social norms and social myths we have learnt to accept."" For Laura, the decision was made to give up drinking five-and-a-half years ago after realising how reliant she had become on it as a way of coping, particularly while in a job she hated. ""If you continually try and push the problem into the background, it doesn't go away, it just stays there for another day so actually rather than drinking it's about saying I have to deal with my anxiety, my mental health, my stress and make it better."" The study was carried out by YouGov alongside the charity Drinkaware. Its chief executive Elaine Hindal said the problem lies in the fact people reward themselves at the end of a hard day with a drink. ""Of course, that first drink does help lower inhibition... You may feel more relaxed, more confident, but regularly using alcohol as a prop in that way is a particular concern. ""What people might often not realise is that alcohol is not only associated with lower rates of good mental health but also with a whole number of diseases with our physical health as well... cardio vascular disease, certain types of cancer or even managing our weight."" Increasingly, people are taking a look at how much they are drinking. Dry January has never been so popular - good news according to Ms Hindal. ""By the end of January you are hopefully a little bit better off, a bit more money in your wallet, you've lost a couple of pounds and you are sleeping better already."" But not everyone sees having a drink to wind down as an issue. Shona Castles-Greene, halfway through a glass of white wine with a friend, said: ""I don't think I massively use it to deal with stress but it does take the edge off after a you've had a bad day at work, but perhaps a glass or so will do."""

In France and beyond the letter, published in Le Monde, was widely condemned. Deneuve, 74, best known for playing a bored housewife who spends her afternoons as a prostitute in 1967 film Belle du Jour, has written a new letter apologising to abuse victims. However, she has also defended her view men are becoming victims of a ""media lynching"" which threatens sexual freedom. She said ""obviously nothing"" in the original letter ""claims that harassment is good"". Writing in French paper Liberation, founded by philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, she said: ""I greet, sincerely, all the victims of odious acts that may have felt aggrieved by the letter published in Le Monde. ""It is to them and to them alone that I apologise."" She acknowledged signing the original letter but said she disagreed with the way some of those who signed it ""claim the right to spread"" a ""distorted spirit"" of the text. The original letter said that campaigns like #MeToo and its French equivalent #Balancetonporc (Call out your pig) that have stemmed from the Weinstein scandal have gone too far and threaten hard-won sexual freedoms. ""Legitimate protests against the sexual violence that women are subject to, particularly in their professional lives"", had turned into a ""witch-hunt"", it claimed. ""Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - nor is men being gentlemanly a macho attack,"" the letter said. ""Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone's knee or try to steal a kiss."" Men had been dragged through the mud, they insisted, for ""talking about intimate subjects during professional dinners or for sending sexually-charged messages to women who did not return their attentions"". Ms Deneuve defended her feminist credentials in her rebuttal letter, saying she publicly backed legalising abortion in France."

A judge will have to decide how much each gang member must pay back or serve longer in prison in default of payment. Prosecutor Philip Evans said the new figure for the stolen loot was £13,690,331.75p. It is much reduced from the £25m mentioned in more recent hearings, but around the same as the original figure announced after the raid on the safe deposit vault in London's jewellery district over the 2015 Easter weekend. Mr Evans said: ""The amount to be repaid by the individuals remains subject to argument."" The proceeds of crime hearing is expected to last one week - much shorter than anticipated after prosecution and defence lawyers spent time in discussion. The five involved in the hearing are the four ring leaders Brian Reader, 78, Terence Perkins, 68, John Collins, 75 and Daniel Jones, 62, as well as the gang's getaway driver William Lincoln, 62. Only Collins and Jones were in the dock for the start of the hearing, the others were said to be unwell. Perkins, Collins, Jones and Lincoln were jailed for seven years in March 2016, while Reader got six years and three months. All were convicted for conspiracy to burgle the vault. Another gang member, Carl Wood, 59, was ordered last year to pay back £50,000 or spend another 18 months in jail. The last of those convicted, plumber Hugh Doyle, is due in court next week. He was convicted of handling stolen goods and given a suspended sentence. The gang failed to drill through the vault wall on the first night of the heist, but successfully completed the job the following day after returning with more equipment. They were caught principally because Collins used his own car during the raid and it was easily traced by the Flying Squad, a branch of the Serious and Organised Crime Command within the Metropolitan Police. The gang was dubbed Dads' Army because of their ages. Only £4m worth of the loot has been recovered, some of it from a grave in Edmonton, north London, after police were alerted by Sky News. One mystery gang member got away, a man known to the others as ""Basil"" who is thought to have taken some of the loot with him."

Regis finished with West Brom in 1984 having scored 112 goals and made 301 appearances. The forward, aged 26, joined Coventry City in the same year and was a key member of the FA Cup winning team in 1987. In 1991, aged 33, Regis was sold to Aston Villa where he was reunited with former West Brom manager, Ron Atkinson. Two years later he was transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers where he stayed for just one season before signing with Wycombe Wanderers in Division Two. Regis played his last game in February 1996 aged 38. He retired from the game in October 1996 after failing to recover fully from an injury sustained during his final senior game for Chester. He was awarded an MBE in 2008. More follows..."
2018-01-15,There are not many economic fields in which Britain truly leads the world.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180115191611/https://news.sky.com/story/will-a-post-brexit-economy-swap-workers-for-robots-11208518,"Financial innovation, perhaps. Deep sea oil mining maybe. Formula One engineering, probably. But there is one sector where the UK is an indisputable leader: sandwiches. This country is more efficient and more successful at producing high quality takeaway sandwiches than any other economy in the world. Britain's sandwich industry has been at the forefront of innovation in the field, developing new breeds of vegetables - tomatoes and lettuce - that make for a fresher, longer-lasting sandwich. So if there was some way to build a robot to make sandwiches, you might have thought Britain would have developed it already. But if you take a trip to one of this country's major sandwich makers, a place like Raynor's, for instance, you will instead find a hive of human activity. While there is a certain amount of automated activities along the production line - the slicer for the bread, the packaging machines - the majority of work filling the sandwiches is still done by hand. That means Raynor's is highly reliant on low cost, low skill labour, which these days mostly means Eastern European workers. But in the past few months, they've noticed the flows of workers have slowed. This poses something of a problem. In the long run, given Britain has near full employment, the solution - if immigration is indeed to fall as the Government intends - is to automate more of the production line. But according to managing director Matt Raynor, the technology is still some way off. You can't get a robot to pick out the appropriate leaf of lettuce for the appropriate sandwich - and certainly not as quickly as a human could do the job. The big question is whether Brexit will push UK firms in the right direction - to try to develop that robot, or find an alternative. Indeed, for all the doom and gloom about the decision to leave the EU, this shock therapy for productivity is one of the areas where economists might agree Brexit provides some opportunities. Faced with a tighter labour market and fewer workers, might UK firms be forced to innovate and invest in automation? Given the UK currently has the developed world’s lowest take-up of robots, perhaps this is for the best? :: Robots could replace more jobs as living wage rises It's a similar story in the agriculture sector. Alison Capper of Stocks Farm in Worcestershire farms apples and hops, but while she has managed to automate some processes, for instance cutting one tractor by introducing a self-driving platform for fruit pickers, there is no off-the-shelf machine that could pluck an apple off the tree. Perhaps such a thing might exist in five or 10 years, but might that be too late? And that raises a big question. The Government is determined to push through Brexit as fast as possible, with a time-limited implementation period. But at present, most businesses say they could not instantly adapt to a sudden fall in migration. At the very least, they say, if the plan is to cut EU migration, then they will need more seasonal labour from outside the EU. But that would run headlong into the Government's other aim: to get net migration down into five figures. In other words, were this all to happen in five or 10 years' time, the two aims of business and government could dovetail perfectly. Immigration could come down and the robots would be there to take up the slack. UK productivity could finally rebound from the low rates seen recently. But if immigration were to fall dramatically overnight, businesses wouldn't have the processes available to adapt. It would be deeply economically destructive. It underlines why so many companies are so keen on a transition period with the continuation of free movement for some time longer. It's not so much that they are all ardent remainers. It is that the country is not yet ready to shut its doors. But in a few years' time we might hit the sweet spot where the technology is there, and lower migration might actually be a good thing for UK plc."
2018-01-15,"Toddler Poppi Worthington died from asphyxia and was sexually abused before her death, according to a coroner.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180115191611/https://news.sky.com/story/poppi-worthington-died-of-asphyxia-after-sexual-abuse-in-fathers-bed-coroner-rules-11209292,"David Roberts said the child's ability to breathe was compromised by an ""unsafe"" sleeping environment after her father Paul Worthington took her from her cot and placed her next to him in his bed. Mr Roberts said 13-month-old Poppi was suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection at the time and she was abused in the bed. The Crown Prosecution Service says it does not plan to review its decision not to charge Mr Worthington. At Kendal Coroner's Court, Mr Roberts concluded she did not die immediately after the abuse in 2012 and it did not cause her death. The coroner said an unlawful killing conclusion was not available to him as he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Poppi died due to murder or manslaughter. During a three-week inquest in Cumbria, Mr Worthington refused to answer questions about her death 252 times and his account did not ""stand up to scrutiny"", according to the coroner. A family court judge ruled in January 2016 that ""on the balance of probabilities"" he had sexually assaulted Poppi before she died. The father has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any offence as the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence. He has been living in hiding since the family court proceedings were made public. The inquest at Kendal Coroner's Court was told the child woke up screaming at about 5.30am on 12 December 2012, at her home in Barrow-in-Furness and her father put her in his bed and went to get a fresh nappy. Mr Worthington said that when he returned, she had settled but 5-10 minutes later he reached over and she was limp. He claimed he then ran downstairs and the child's mother, who was sleeping downstairs, called an ambulance. Paramedics took the youngster to Furness General Hospital at 6.11am but she never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead shortly after 7am. The pathologist who carried out Poppi's post-mortem examination found Poppi's injuries, including two fractures to her leg, to be strongly suspicious of child abuse. Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked red-eyed and close to tears for much of Monday's three-hour hearing. After the inquest, her lawyer Fiona McGhie told reporters: ""The past five years have been a complete nightmare for my client. ""Now knowing what happened to Poppi on that day and knowing that there were evidence-gathering failures by police in the very early stages of the investigation has made things worse. ""She is disappointed that Poppi's father chose to rely on his right not to answer questions which might incriminate him. While she understands he is entitled to do this, she considers he should have given the coroner the crucial evidence of Poppi's last few hours."" Paul Worthington's sister Tracy told Sky News: ""He has been through so much and he's done nothing wrong and he doesn't know which way to turn. He can only go on the advice of his solicitors."" Cumbria Police chief constable Jerry Graham said he would discuss the case with the Crown Prosecution Service to ""determine possible courses of action"". Mr Worthington's solicitors said the father was ""considering his options"", adding that ""we are advising him not to say anything further at this point""."

An RAF spokesman said: ""We can confirm that quick reaction alert Typhoon aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth scrambled this morning. ""This is a live operation and therefore we will not be providing any additional information until the mission is complete."" The MoD has since confirmed the incident is now over. The response to the quick reaction alert comes amid tensions between the West and Russia. The RAF confirmed the Typhoons had taken off but the Ministry of Defence said it had not intercepted the Russian aircraft. An MoD spokesman said: ""We have got jets up in the air monitoring the situation but we have not intercepted anything."" The unidentified Russian plane was heading towards the UK from the north and had been monitored by NATO allies. Russian activity close to the UK in recent months has led to several planes being scrambled and warships sent to monitor naval vessels. HMS Westminster was reportedly tasked with intercepting two Russian warships and two supporting vessels as they passed close to British waters on 8 January."

The 25-year-old - who describes herself as a model, actor and journalist - also said Ms Markle had a ""tiny brain"" and that black people were ugly. Mr Bolton said he was ""appalled"" with the comments which were made ""in the heat of the moment"" and ""not meant for the public eye"". He told Sky News that he had ended his relationship with Ms Marney, who has been suspended from the party, after ""many hours of difficult conversation"". Mr Bolton said UKIP's the chairman was ""right"" to suspend Ms Marney, but would not say whether he thought she should be thrown out of the party, saying the decision was ""nothing to do with him"". Responding to widespread calls for him to stand down as UKIP leader, he said the party ""can't afford a leadership change"". He told Sky News: ""I'm pushing forward with the agenda of reforming the internal communication, finances and policy making of the party. ""All stuff that needs to be done to allow the party to project its politics into the Brexit debate and the shaping of the country post-Brexit. That simply isn’t enough. The damage has been done and he has previously defended her social media. You can’t throw her to the wolves now and expect your lack of judgment to disappear with her. For every minute longer he stays, he makes the recovery that little bit harder for the membership of this party to put things right. ""This is all critical stuff and we can't afford a leadership change at the moment."" Former UKIP leadership candidate Ben Walker called for Mr Bolton's resignation, accusing him of having ""deeply flawed judgement"". UKIP's National Executive Committee will meet to discuss Mr Bolton's future as leader of the party on Sunday. Sky News Political Correspondent Lewis Goodall said it is likely there will be a vote of no confidence at the meeting, with one of his sources telling him that Mr Bolton ""has few allies and members are leaving in droves"". A senior UKIP figure told him: ""The chances of Henry Bolton surviving as UKIP leader are extremely small."" If Mr Bolton were to leave the party it would force UKIP to elect its fifth leader in 18 months. Ukip's Brexit spokesperon, MEP Gerard Batten, told Sky News: ""It is clear the leader finds himself in a very difficult situation. ""But I find it despicable that there are those seeking to use this situation to jockey for a leadership position when there is as yet no vacancy."" Senior UKIP figure tells me: ""The chances of Henry Bolton surviving as UKIP leader are extremely small."" Mr Bolton, 54, announced his relationship with Ms Marney in a letter to UKIP supporters earlier this month, but denied it was a ""clandestine affair"". He left his wife Tatiana, 42, with whom he has two children, before going public with the relationship. Mr Bolton said he met Ms Marney at a Boxing Day lunch where he spoke to her ""for about five minutes"". Talking about her political views, he said: ""We have discussed in the past, immigration and integration issues and she has never expressed her views in such a way as she did in those messages."" He said Ms Marney is ""utterly distraught"" over the revelations. She has since apologised ""unreservedly"" for her comments, but insists her opinions have ""been taken out of context""."

Metropolitan Police said O'Riordan was pronounced dead at the Hilton on Park Lane, adding: ""At this early stage the death is being treated as unexplained."" A spokesperson for the hotel said: ""It is with deep regret that we can confirm a guest sadly passed away at the hotel on Monday 15th January. We offer our sincere condolences to their family at this difficult time. O'Riordan's family are said to be ""devastated"" and have asked for privacy. Irish President Michael D Higgins was among those who paid tribute to the singer, saying: ""Dolores O'Riordan and The Cranberries had an immense influence on rock and pop music in Ireland and internationally. ""I recall with fondness the late Limerick TD Jim Kemmy's introduction of her and The Cranberries to me, and the pride he and so many others took in their successes. ""To her family and all those who follow and support Irish music, Irish musicians and the performing arts her death will be a big loss."" The band, which was formed in 1989, rose to international fame in the 1990s and sold more than 40m records worldwide, with hits including Zombie, Linger and Dreams. The group released five albums before taking a break in 2003. O'Riordan, from Friarstown, Co Limerick, released two solo albums during the hiatus before the band reformed in 2009. In May 2017, The Cranberries cancelled a number of shows after doctors told O'Riordan to stop working for a month for medical reasons linked to a back problem. Another set of shows in North America, due to take place in September and October, were cancelled in July. In February 2016, O'Riordan said she would use ""music, dancing and performing to improve her mental health"" after avoiding a criminal conviction for assault at an airport. She was ordered to pay €6,000 to charity for headbutting, kicking, hitting and spitting on police officers following an air rage incident. The singer had previously admitted three assaults and obstructing an officer after being taken off an Aer Lingus flight from New York's JFK to Ireland on 10 November 2014. Medical reports produced for the trial revealed she had been suffering from mental illness and severely impaired judgement at the time of the incident, and that she remembered nothing about it. O'Riordan is survived by her three children; son Taylor and daughters Molly and Dakota. The 46-year-old spilt from her husband of 20 years, former Duran Duran tour manager Don Burton, in 2014. ""We are crushed to hear the news about the passing of Dolores O'Riordan,"" Duran Duran said on Twitter. ""Our thoughts go out to her family at this terrible time."" Irish singer Ronan Keating said he was ""totally shocked"" about the death of O'Riordan, who he described as an ""incredible talent and a lovely soul"". Meanwhile, The Kinks guitarist Dave Davies wrote on Twitter: ""I was talking to her a couple weeks before Christmas she seemed happy and well - we even spoke about maybe writing some songs together."""

2018-01-15,Carillion is one of the UK's largest construction companies but it is also a provider of many services that help the country function.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180115191611/https://news.sky.com/story/who-are-carillion-11205822,"Its collapse through an application for compulsory liquidation means the company will eventually be dissolved, with creditors sharing any money from the sale of its assets. The decision to effectively declare itself bust leaves 43,000 jobs worldwide hanging in the balance, though there is some hope that many in the sprawling business will keep their jobs, albeit through Carillion's work being transferred. The Government has committed to funding public service contracts, for the moment at least, and has asked all staff to turn up for work as normal. :: Background Carillion was created in 1999 by the famous road surfacing business Tarmac in a demerger. It expanded its interests - buying a string of companies including Mowlem in 2006 and Alfred McAlpine two years later. The Wolverhampton-based company described itself as an ""integrated support business"" with its main focus being on construction and support services work in the UK, Canada and the Middle East. Almost half its workers - 19,500 people - are in the UK. :: Construction Construction was at the heart of the business. Its major projects have included ""the doughnut"" - the iconic circular office building of the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) - completed in 2003. Alongside new facilities for the Royal Opera House, Carillion completed the Tate Modern in London in 2000. Its other projects have included the Grand Mosque in Oman as well as an expansion to Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium in 2016. It had almost completed work on the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell - a 670-bed super hospital - with the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals' NHS Trust saying on Monday it was working with the Government on putting ""alternative arrangements"" in place. The knock-on effect was also being felt by some rivals, with Balfour Beatty saying it faced costs of up to £45m arising from its joint ventures with Carillion. :: Schools Carillion holds various public sector contracts - even providing dinners. It is supposed to provide 32,000 meals to primary and secondary schools every day in the UK. About half that number is in Oxfordshire, where the fire service has been put on standby to help with deliveries, if needed. The company has been responsible for cleaning 245 schools and provides maintenance to hundreds more UK-wide. :: Transport Carillion is the second-largest supplier to Network Rail. Its work includes track, signalling and building projects - recently completing a scheme in Edinburgh over the festive season. We've delivered another successful project at the #Edinburgh Waverley Station.  We installed the 150A and 150B modular crossover panels between platforms 10 & 11 during a 54-hour Christmas possession & 29-hour New Year possession. pic.twitter.com/mtApxGfcmc Carillion was also among winning bidders for two key tunnel and track contracts on the HS2 rail project worth £1.4bn. One of its partners in the work, Kier Group, said on Monday that it was working to achieve continuity of service on not just HS2 but also on their shared Highways England smart motorway programme. The Government has also said it is expecting the joint ventures to be fulfilled by existing contractors. :: Prisons and Defence Carillion maintains approximately half of the UK's prisons as well as roughly 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. :: Healthcare It is understood that 10-15 NHS hospital Trusts have direct or sub-contracted arrangements with Carillion in areas such as cleaning and maintenance. An NHS Improvement spokesperson said: ""Our top priority is to keep services running safely for patients. ""We, alongside the trusts and the private service providers, have planned extensively for this scenario and will aim to keep any disruption to a minimum. ""We're also well aware of the concerns staff will have at this point and we thank them for their continued hard work.

The causes of death for the couple, from Maids Moreton, have not yet been determined, officers said. Neighbours have named two of those arrested as Ben Field, 27, a church warden and Mr Farquhar's lodger, and his friend Martyn Smith, a 31-year-old magician. It is understood the two men cared for Mr Farquhar as his health deteriorated and were students at the University of Buckinghamshire, where he was a guest lecturer. They are said to have persuaded him to publish his works, and set up a company to do so. Mr Farquhar was a lay preacher at Stowe Parish Church where Field is listed as a deputy warden. The force said four properties were currently being search as part of the investigation - one in Milton Keynes, two in Towcester, Northamptonshire, and another near Redruth in Cornwall. The three men were arrested on Tuesday and remain in custody. They are: A University of Buckingham spokeswoman said: ""The students were suspended as soon as police informed us of the allegations. ""We cannot comment further pending the police investigation."" Mr Farquhar was a retired part-time English lecturer at the University of Buckingham. He also taught at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire and Manchester Grammar School. His former colleague at the university Professor Stefan Hawlin said he was saddened to hear about the police investigation. He added: ""He was a charming, erudite and deeply thoughtful man, he was thoroughly learned in literature. He was very well thought of.""

It's an unusual condition that occurs after trauma such as vomiting or heavy coughing. The pharynx is the part of the throat that is behind the mouth and nasal cavity. He told doctors at hospital in Leicester that he had developed a popping sensation in the back of his throat and this had suddenly swelled up after he tried to hold in a sneeze by shutting his mouth and pinching his nose at the same time. Doctors then heard the popping and crackling sounds in his neck, which extended all the way down to his ribcage. The sounds indicate that air bubbles had found their way into the deep tissue and muscles of the chest, which was later confirmed by a scan. He had to spend seven days in hospital, being fed through a tube and given antibiotics through an IV drip, as doctors were concerned about complications that could arise. Writing in the BMLJ case studies, the team said holding a sneeze in by clamping the nose and mouth shut is not a good idea and could lead to ""numerous complications"". ""Halting sneezing via blocking (the) nostrils and mouth is a dangerous manoeuvre, and should be avoided,"" the authors said. ""It may lead to numerous complications, such as pseudomediastinum (air trapped in the chest between both lungs), perforation of the tympanic membrane (perforated eardrum), and even rupture of a cerebral aneurysm (ballooning blood vessel in the brain),"" they added."

Police are appealing for the public's help again after having no luck in finding the child's parents. Scientific analysis found the birth most likely happened in bushes next to the park between 6pm on 15 May and 8am the following day. Detective chief inspector Dave Storey said this led to a review of CCTV footage which found images of two people walking past the birth scene 10 times between 11.30pm on 15 May and 12.30am on 16 May. A post-mortem examination found the child died within six hours of her birth. The baby suffered multiple blunt force injuries to her head and other minor injuries to her body. DCI Storey said a DNA profile taken from the baby showed her mother, and probably the child's father, were of East Asian ethnicity. ""This remains a particularly sad case which despite extensive investigation we are still are nowhere nearer to identifying the newborn baby, Baby M, nor her mother,"" he said. ""We have a baby who is unnamed and at this stage is still not buried and we would like some assistance in order to identify the mother and obtain some justice for Baby M. ""Initially when the investigation was launched we were concerned regarding the health of the mother, so there were lots of inquiries undertaken with local partners, NHS and local communities in order to identify the mother which were unsuccessful."" He added: ""We have carried out lots of inquiries since then including pathology, scientific work regarding the baby's ancestry and what was established fairly early on was the baby's death was a result of deliberate head injuries and as such we launched a murder inquiry. ""We still would like to identify the mother and provide some support because it takes an awful lot for a mother to give birth to a child to then either kill the baby or have the baby taken away from her and killed immediately afterwards."" DCI Storey said detectives ""strongly believe"" the couple who walked past the birth scene 10 times may be connected with the birth and subsequent murder. He asked the public to come forward if they witnessed anything or have any information to identify the pair. Police are also carrying out house-to-house inquiries in and around Manor Park to try to identify witnesses."

A family court judge ruled in January 2016 that ""on the balance of probabilities"" he had sexually assaulted Poppi before she died. The father has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any offence as the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence. He has been living in hiding since the family court proceedings were made public. The inquest at Kendal Coroner's Court was told the child woke up screaming at about 5.30am on 12 December 2012, at her home in Barrow-in-Furness and her father put her in his bed and went to get a fresh nappy. Mr Worthington said that when he returned, she had settled but 5-10 minutes later he reached over and she was limp. He claimed he then ran downstairs and the child's mother, who was sleeping downstairs, called an ambulance. Paramedics took the youngster to Furness General Hospital at 6.11am but she never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead shortly after 7am. The pathologist who carried out Poppi's post-mortem examination found Poppi's injuries, including two fractures to her leg, to be strongly suspicious of child abuse. Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked red-eyed and close to tears for much of Monday's three-hour hearing. After the inquest, her lawyer Fiona McGhie told reporters: ""The past five years have been a complete nightmare for my client. ""Now knowing what happened to Poppi on that day and knowing that there were evidence-gathering failures by police in the very early stages of the investigation has made things worse. ""She is disappointed that Poppi's father chose to rely on his right not to answer questions which might incriminate him. While she understands he is entitled to do this, she considers he should have given the coroner the crucial evidence of Poppi's last few hours."" Paul Worthington's sister Tracy told Sky News: ""He has been through so much and he's done nothing wrong and he doesn't know which way to turn. He can only go on the advice of his solicitors."" Cumbria Police chief constable Jerry Graham said he would discuss the case with the Crown Prosecution Service to ""determine possible courses of action"". Mr Worthington's solicitors said the father was ""considering his options"", adding that ""we are advising him not to say anything further at this point""."

The Black Death devastated medieval Europe from 1346 to 1353, killing an estimated 75 to 200 million people. It was caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis, which lasted on the continent until the 19th century. Scientists from the University of Oslo in Norway and the University of Ferrara in Italy now say they believe human ""ectoparasites"", such as body lice and human fleas, might be more likely to have caused the pandemic. They have tracked how the plague developed by using mortality data from nine plague outbreaks in Europe between the 14th and 19th centuries. The team used the data to create models of how a disease could be spread by rats, airborne transmission, and fleas and lice on humans and clothes. It was discovered that in seven of the cases there was a closer resemblance between the human model and the outbreak when compared with the others. Their paper has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. In it, they say: ""While it is commonly assumed that rats and their fleas spread plague during the Second Pandemic, there is little historical and archaeological support for such a claim. ""Here, we show that human ectoparasites, like body lice and human fleas, might be more likely than rats to have caused the rapidly developing epidemics in pre-Industrial Europe."""

Mr Trump had taken aim at North Korea's nuclear ambitions in a 3 January tweet, in response to a claim by Kim Jong Un that he had a nuclear button on his desk at all times. ""North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the 'nuclear button is on his desk at all times',"" he wrote. ""Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!""

The US President has called Korea's leader a ""little rocket man"" while Pyongyang's foreign minister responded in kind by calling Mr Trump a ""mentally deranged person full of meglomania"". In the commentary published on Tuesday, Rodong Sinmum said: ""The spasm of Trump in the new year reflects the desperate mental state of a loser who failed to check the vigorous advance of the army and people of the DPRK.

The retailer's Clubcard vouchers, sent out after shoppers accrue points, can be spent in store at Tesco and also at several restaurant chains and with other partnership companies - where some were worth twice as much and many worth four times their value, before the change. Tesco now says all vouchers spent with its 100-plus reward scheme partners, including Pizza Express, Prezzo and Zizzi, will be worth three times the value. A Tesco spokeswoman said: ""We've listened to our customers and simplified our Clubcard Reward Partners so that they're more straightforward for everyone. ""This means that from January 15, we will offer customers three times the value of their vouchers with over 100 Clubcard Reward Partners including days out, weekend breaks, holidays and more."" Shoppers soon aired their outrage on social media. One wrote on Twitter: ""We had £89 saved up in vouchers - worth £356. Now they are worth £267. ""No advance warning, really really poor from @Tesco #tescoclubcard - been loyal Tesco customers for well over 10 years - because of clubcard. And what a load of BS about 'making it easier'."" Another user said: ""All clubcard boosts going to 3x. Everything we chose was 4x so this is a big reduction. ""But highlight was the inane corporate-speak lathered over the announcement...'this is not a reduction in boosts, oh no, this is TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND' How dumb are we?"" Tesco's move has devalued the scheme, according to the editor of the Shopper Points website Anika Newjoto, who said shoppers were not given the time to spend their saved vouchers at the old rates. She said just a small number of partners previously had offers at twice the value. These include National Express, Megabus and redspottedhanky, which will now go up to three times the value. However, most would go down from four to three, Ms Newjoto said. ""Loyalty schemes are meant to work two ways, not one way,"" she added."

An RAF spokesman said: ""We can confirm that quick reaction alert Typhoon aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth scrambled this morning. ""This is a live operation and therefore we will not be providing any additional information until the mission is complete."" The MoD has since confirmed the incident is now over. The response to the quick reaction alert comes amid tensions between the West and Russia. The RAF confirmed the Typhoons had taken off but the Ministry of Defence said it had not intercepted the Russian aircraft. An MoD spokesman said: ""We have got jets up in the air monitoring the situation but we have not intercepted anything."" The unidentified Russian plane was heading towards the UK from the north and had been monitored by NATO allies. Russian activity close to the UK in recent months has led to several planes being scrambled and warships sent to monitor naval vessels. HMS Westminster was reportedly tasked with intercepting two Russian warships and two supporting vessels as they passed close to British waters on 8 January."
2018-01-16,The taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) tightened the terms of its funding to the stricken Government contractor Carillion three days before it was forced to call in liquidators.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180116200115/https://news.sky.com/story/revealed-state-backed-rbss-role-in-collapse-of-carillion-11210171,"Sky News has obtained a witness statement filed at the High Court by Keith Cochrane, its interim chief executive, which details the increasingly frenetic nature of efforts to rescue the company. Carillion collapsed on Monday, raising doubts about the future of more than 19,000 UK staff and igniting a political firestorm over ministers' handling of the crisis. It went bust carrying more than £2.2bn of financial liabilities, according to Mr Cochrane, comprising of almost £1.3bn of debt to financial creditors; £350m relating to Carillion's early payment facilities; tax liabilities including £16m due later this month; and a defined benefit pension deficit of £587m. :: Carillion investigation fast-tracked and extended Mr Cochrane, who has yet to speak publicly about the collapse of the company he had been in charge of since a profit warning sent its shares tumbling last July, accused RBS in his statement of taking ""unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". That suggestion may spark fresh criticism of RBS, which continues to face regulatory scrutiny from the City watchdog over its treatment of financially distressed business customers. The bank continues to be majority-owned by the Government almost a decade after its £45.5bn bailout. A number of senior bankers said RBS was simply taking prudent steps last week to manage its exposure to Carillion given the parlous state of the construction group's finances. RBS had already taken an impairment charge of £151m relating to Carillion at its third-quarter results last year, and Sky News revealed on Monday that the HS2 rail link contractor's lenders were facing total losses of around £2bn. According to Mr Cochrane's witness statement, RBS informed Carillion last Friday that it wanted the company to pre-fund supplier payments made through the bank, which meant it would need to make those payments two days earlier than cashflow forecasts had assumed. :: Carillion collapse: The key figures in the firm He said this negatively impacted Carillion's liquidity by between £2m and £20m. RBS, he added, insisted that this revised arrangement ""would be in place until support from [the Government] had been agreed and that the terms of this support would determine whether other uncommitted facilities with RBS would be withdrawn"". RBS is not the only lender to Carillion singled out in Mr Cochrane's witness statement. Santander UK, another member of the committee of Carillion's biggest lenders, caused panic among the lending syndicate on 21 December by writing to the construction giant's suppliers notifying them of immediate changes to an Early Payment Facility (EPF) with the bank. ""The company relied upon that EPF in order to assist it making payments to its suppliers,"" Mr Cochrane said. ""Santander informed the group's suppliers that arrangements to automatically prepay invoices submitted by the supplier would be terminated and it sent a separate email to certain of its suppliers that 'all payments with Carillion are stopped'"". The interim boss added that the Spanish-owned bank relented following ""urgent discussions"" with the other lenders and the company but reduced the maximum value of discounted supplier invoices from £150m to £117m. Mr Cochrane's statement, made on behalf of the entire Carillion board, also discloses that the company begged Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs for support in the form of payment deferrals on tax liabilities at a meeting on 9 January. He added that even as it was winning ""significant new contracts, including with [the Government]"" in the last two months of 2017, ""the company also suffered during this period because bonding providers withdrew facilities, credit insurers reduced or eliminated coverage and certain long-standing customers informed the company that they would not place new work until its balance sheet issues were resolved"". According to Mr Cochrane, Carillion wrote to the Government on Saturday requesting an unquantified sum of short-term funding to provide it with liquidity for four months to allow it to carry out a broader restructuring plan with creditors. The letter ""noted that should [the Government] or creditors refuse to provide such support the company may be forced to conclude that there is no longer a reasonable prospect of it avoiding insolvent liquidation, and the importance of adequate contingency planning"". That request was rejected at a meeting on Sunday, according to Mr Cochrane's statement, confirming a Sky News report later that evening. Sky News understands that during a last-ditch discussion held on Sunday night, RBS, Santander UK and Lloyds Banking Group decided not to extend additional funding that would have enabled Carillion to limp on for another week. Barclays and HSBC indicated that they would be prepared to support further emergency loans to the company. A Lloyds spokesman said: ""Lloyds Banking Group had been supporting Carillion for many months, including providing additional financing last year alongside the other main lending banks, in order to provide the company's management time to consider its options. ""Unfortunately the company was unable to implement a viable restructuring plan. ""In the absence of any such plan, we were unable to provide additional financing."" Santander UK said: ""It is with serious regret that following several years of support for Carillion we made the decision to not extend further funding to the business. ""We did not take this decision lightly. ""In the absence of a viable business plan we were not prepared to increase our exposure and further losses.""As a responsible lender, we are accountable to all of our stakeholders when making lending decisions and need to assess the impact of our actions on all of them. ""It is that assessment which led us to the conclusion that we did not believe it would be responsible to offer further financial support in these circumstances."" RBS declined to comment."
2018-01-16,A British supermarket believes it will be the first retailer in the world to make its own-brand products plastic-free within five years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180116200115/https://news.sky.com/story/supermarket-iceland-vows-to-ditch-plastic-from-its-stores-in-five-years-11209621,"Iceland, the frozen food specialist, says it has worked with environmental charities and experts to develop paper and pulp alternatives that are fully recyclable, affecting more than 1,000 lines. ""We've created a monster,"" managing director Richard Walker told Sky News. ""Plastic does not degrade, it lasts for half a millennium. Every minute there's a truckload of plastic waste entering the ocean. ""It's ubiquitous, it's in everything, it's in up to 50% of what the average supermarket sells. The time to act is now. ""Take our ready meals. They are in a board carton sleeve which is good, made of paper, but the problem is the black plastic tray. ""We're going to replace that with a wooden board tray, and the final piece of the jigsaw is the plastic film over the top: we're looking at cellulose-based technologies which are made from paper pulp."" Some within the plastics industry think it's a step too far and are questioning how ""green"" the move really is. ""It's a really surprising announcement"", Barry Turner from the British Plastics Federation said. ""The reason a lot of supermarkets embraced plastics packaging is because it's resource efficient. He claimed: ""If they move away from plastics in the way that they've declared, it will mean that the weight of the packaging they use will increase four times, the carbon emissions will increase by around three times, the amount of energy to make that packaging will increase two-fold. ""So, the net result is that the environmental footprint of the packaging that they're including, will increase."" According to Plastics Oceans Foundation an estimated eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans every year, putting all forms of marine life at risk. Campaigns like Sky Ocean Rescue are changing the way consumers are thinking about plastic. Iceland said a survey of 5,000 shoppers found that 91% would be more likely to encourage friends and family to shop there if they pursued a plastic-free future. The chain isn't the biggest player within its industry - its market share is just 2%. But, it's hoping customers buy into it, like they do at zero-waste food shop Hetu in Battersea, albeit on a much smaller scale. ""My business plan is to be out of business in five years,"" said Laura Boyes who set up the store six weeks ago. ""I want a big organisation to do a shop like this, fully plastic-free, and do it on a large scale where you can pass savings on to the customers and know the supply chains, and do it from a wholesale point of view."" While Iceland welcomes the Prime Minister's call for ""plastic-free aisles"", it points out that it has been working on this for a year, and it's convinced it's the way forward. ""By doing this we're showing it can be done, it is possible,"" added Mr Walker. ""I'm genuinely calling on all supermarkets to join us in this fight. It's a time for collaboration. We want everyone to come up with similar pledges and share technologies to make it a reality."""

In one photo, David Allen Turpin, 57, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, who have been taken to a detention centre, are pictured with their children in front of mountains. The family members, who are all wearing matching ""Thing"" T-shirts from the Dr Seuss book The Cat In The Hat, are seen smiling and having a good time. The girls all appear to have the same haircuts as each other, as do the boys. Another photo shows the family during a visit to Disney World in Florida. The seemingly happy family pose in front of a fairy tale castle with some of the children wearing identical outfits. Photos also include those of the mother and father's wedding ceremony. In one image, one of the sons appears to be the ring bearer as the couple are wedded by an Elvis Presley impersonator. In another picture, the siblings are again seen wearing matching outfits for an outdoor family portrait. They appear in good spirits and a stark contrast to what police officers were confronted with. Officers were alerted by a 17-year-old girl who managed to escape the family home. She told them her siblings were being held captive by their parents. The remaining 12 siblings were reportedly found in a dark, foul-smelling room. Police said they appeared to be ""malnourished and very dirty"". The parents were unable to provide an explanation as to why the children were restrained at the house in Muir Woods Road, Perris, California. They were interviewed and taken to a detention centre and could face charges of torture and child endangerment."

The ride-hailing app said the measures were an ""industry first"" that would enhance safety for both drivers and passengers. But unions have slammed the change as ""tinkering"" that fails to address the reasons for long hours worked by many drivers on the app. ""The reason drivers are fatigued is because they are not earning enough,"" said James Farrar, the chair of the private hire drivers' branch of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. ""If Uber forces drivers to work less without paying more it is just going to depress hourly earnings even further below the minimum wage and push drivers to the brink."" Research by the IWGB, which represents workers in several areas of what has come to be known as the ""gig"" economy, found Uber drivers had to work just over 34 hours a week to break even. The same findings suggested a net hourly income of £5.17 per hour. The measures mean the app will enforce a six-hour break demand after a driver racks up 10 hours driving on a trip with a passenger, or on the way to pick one up. If a driver is waiting for a request, sitting in an airport queue or driving without a passenger, however, this will not be included in the 10-hour limit. Uber says that nearly a third of its 50,000 UK drivers are logged into the app for more than 40 hours a week, with just under 8% online for more than 60. ""Licensed drivers who use our app really value the freedom and flexibility to choose if, when and where they work,"" said Andrew Byrne, Uber's head of policy. ""We continue to listen to feedback and plan to make other changes and improvements over the coming months."" The ride-sharing app has in recent months been plagued by concerns over safety and driver rights. In October, Transport for London denied it a licence to operate in London, saying it had demonstrated a ""lack of corporate responsibility"". The following month Mr Farrar and another driver won a landmark case against the ride hailing app, with a court ruling they were workers entitled to the minimum wage, sick pay and benefits."

Winter Driving Tips: :: Check your speed and use gentle driver inputs:: Give more warning than usual to other drivers:: Keep plenty of distance between cars:: Be extra wary of black ice, as it's easy to miss:: Approach corners at a steady speed, in as low a gear as possible:: Be familiar with your car's ventilation system to prevent steaming up Schools and nurseries have also been affected by the snow, with more than 50 closed in the Highlands allowing more than 3,000 children to enjoy a snow day. There have been further closures in South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway. Snow has also already fallen in parts of northern England and Northern Ireland, with 1cm (0.4in) reported in Lough Fea. Despite a lack of snow, it has been bitterly cold and windy in southern parts of the UK, with ice expected and temperatures unlikely to go above -1C in London on Tuesday night."
2018-01-16,A US military dog who protected British and American soldiers during beach landings in the Second World War has been posthumously awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180116200115/https://news.sky.com/story/hero-ww2-dog-given-medal-for-running-into-hail-of-bullets-and-stopping-enemy-fire-11209304,"The heroic husky-Alsatian cross - called Chips - was awarded a PDSA Dickin Medal for protecting the lives of his platoon as soldiers invaded Sicily in July 1943. The men and Chips, who once met then prime minister Winston Churchill, landed at dawn but came under fire from a machine gun nest as soon as they arrived. The dog escaped from his lead and ran towards the line of fire as the soldiers taking part in the US-led mission - Operation Husky - headed for cover. Soldiers could only watch as Chips headed into a shack where enemy fighters were positioned and stopped the gunfire. An enemy soldier then emerged from the hut with the dog at his throat before Chips grabbed a machine gun by the barrel and pulled it off its mount. The American and British soldiers were then able to push forward. Chips was left with scalp wounds and powder burns as a result of his efforts. PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said the ""heroic"" pooch ""undoubtedly"" saved lives. She said: ""It has taken over seven decades but Chips can now finally take his place in the history books as one of the most heroic dogs to serve with the US Army."" Chips also served as a sentry dog at the Casablanca Conference in Morocco in January 1943 as the Allies fought to clear Germans from North Africa. It was during this period he met Mr Churchill and US president Franklin Roosevelt, who were deciding on the Allies' future strategy in the conflict. The accolade was awarded on the 75th anniversary of the Casablanca Conference and was received by US Air Force dog Ayron on behalf of Chips. Chips was donated to the war effort by the father of Vietnam War veteran John Wren, 76, who flew to the UK from New York to attend the award ceremony. The pooch returned home when Mr Wren was four and resumed his role as the family pet after the war. ""He is finally getting good recognition of his efforts,"" said Mr Wren. ""If you look at what he did, it was pretty unbelievable."" Other heroic animals awarded the Dickin Medal include a trio of Second World War pigeons and a Royal Navy cat called Simon."
2018-01-16,"Five of the Hatton Garden heist gang ""benefitted"" from £13.69m of stolen loot, a court was told.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180116200115/https://news.sky.com/story/hatton-garden-heist-gang-benefitted-from-136m-worth-of-stolen-loot-11209344,"Three of them accepted the figure, but two will dispute it during a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing, Woolwich Crown Court heard. A judge will have to decide how much each gang member must pay back or serve longer in prison in default of payment. Prosecutor Philip Evans said the new figure for the stolen loot was £13,690,331.75p. It is much reduced from the £25m mentioned in more recent hearings, but around the same as the original figure announced after the raid on the safe deposit vault in London's jewellery district over the 2015 Easter weekend. Mr Evans said: ""The amount to be repaid by the individuals remains subject to argument."" The proceeds of crime hearing is expected to last one week - much shorter than anticipated after prosecution and defence lawyers spent time in discussion. The five involved in the hearing are the four ring leaders Brian Reader, 78, Terence Perkins, 68, John Collins, 75 and Daniel Jones, 62, as well as the gang's getaway driver William Lincoln, 62. Only Collins and Jones were in the dock for the start of the hearing, the others were said to be unwell. Perkins, Collins, Jones and Lincoln were jailed for seven years in March 2016, while Reader got six years and three months. All were convicted for conspiracy to burgle the vault. Another gang member, Carl Wood, 59, was ordered last year to pay back £50,000 or spend another 18 months in jail. The last of those convicted, plumber Hugh Doyle, is due in court next week. He was convicted of handling stolen goods and given a suspended sentence. The gang failed to drill through the vault wall on the first night of the heist, but successfully completed the job the following day after returning with more equipment. They were caught principally because Collins used his own car during the raid and it was easily traced by the Flying Squad, a branch of the Serious and Organised Crime Command within the Metropolitan Police. The gang was dubbed Dads' Army because of their ages. Only £4m worth of the loot has been recovered, some of it from a grave in Edmonton, north London, after police were alerted by Sky News. One mystery gang member got away, a man known to the others as ""Basil"" who is thought to have taken some of the loot with him."

Measles is now rare in the UK, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the illness eliminated in 2016 due to the success of the MMR vaccination, introduced in 1988. However, the NHS says this does not mean it has completely disappeared. The latest spike in cases is linked to ongoing outbreaks in Europe, PHE said. People who have recently travelled - or are planning to visit - Romania, Italy and Germany and have not received two doses of the MMR vaccine are particularly at risk. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""This serves as an important reminder for parents to take up the offer of MMR vaccination for their children at one year of age and as a pre-school booster at three years and four months of age. ""Children and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had two doses should contact their GP practice to catch-up. ""We'd also encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks."" Dr Ramsay said the overall risk to people in the UK is low. ""However, due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe, we will continue to see cases in unimmunised individuals and limited onward spread can occur in communities with low MMR coverage and in age groups with very close mixing."" The highly infectious viral illness begins with cold-like symptoms around 10 days after becoming infected, followed by the measles rash a few days later. While most people recover after about a week to 10 days, measles can sometimes lead to serious complications such as infection, pneumonia and bronchitis. PHE says local health protection teams are working with the NHS and local councils to raise awareness of the outbreaks in England and on the continent. The MMR vaccine is available to all adults and children who are not up to date with their doses. Anyone who is unsure if they are fully vaccinated should get in touch with their GP practice."

Vines was able to write letters to Maitlis while serving a prison sentence for breaching a restraining order. He then wrote to her again from a bail hostel after he was released from prison, the court heard. Judge Peter Ross described this as ""wholly unsatisfactory"" and gave the probation service and the governor at HMP Bullingdon 10 days for a written explanation. Maitlis, who was not in court, said she was let down by the criminal justice system and had been unable to live a ""normal family life"" . In a victim impact statement, she added that the harassment had ""scared my children who thought the threat had gone away"" and reminded her that Vines ""remains a constant threat in my life"". Defending himself, Vines, of Clarks Row, Oxford, said Ms Maitlis' views were ""all new to me"". ""I think the whole issue can be resolved if she would talk to me,"" he said. ""That has not happened since 1995 and she has not spoken to me since then. ""I think I have been through enough and a lengthy prison sentence is not going to help. I do not think I am going to write to her again."" Here is Emily Maitlis' victim impact statement in full: ""When I heard that Edward Vines had breached his restraining order, I felt scared and let down. ""Scared because it meant that even from within the prison system the perpetrator was able to reach me - let down because the system had been unable to stop him getting in touch, even though the crime he is serving time for is harassment through unwanted and ongoing contact. ""It has affected my relationship with my husband, who is frustrated that we cannot get to the bottom of this problem even though we have been tackling it through the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts for over 20 years. And it has scared my children who thought the threat had gone away - albeit temporarily whilst he was behind bars. ""It has affected my ability to do my work - I am constantly thinking of where I am being sent and whether he will be attempting to track me down. ""And it affects every day decisions like how I leave the house and how I get to work, what time I feel able to come home at night, I work late nights often. ""It also makes me jumpy around strangers for no reason as I fear any advance might be him. ""Altogether the breach has been a reminder for me that this man remains a constant threat in my life and my family's life - and that my ability to do my work, hang out with my children and lead a normal family life without constant sense of suspicion and fear has been badly damaged."""
2018-01-16,MPs have warned there could be up to one million defective tumble dryers that have been blamed for causing hundreds of fires in UK homes.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180116200115/https://news.sky.com/story/up-to-one-million-defective-tumble-dryers-in-uk-homes-mps-11209769,"A report by the Business Committee, which is looking to bolster fire safety standards for household electrical goods in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, said its alert was a consequence of an ""inadequate response"" to the dryer issue by manufacturer Whirlpool. Whirlpool alerted authorities in 2015 that fires could be caused by fluff catching on a heating element in dryers marketed under its Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda and Proline brands. The defect has been blamed for 750 fires since 2004 while a second defect in the door mechanism of some Whirlpool products was blamed for a fire in Llanwrst, north Wales, which killed two men in 2014. The Grenfell fire, in June last year, killed 71 people. It is believed to have been sparked by a fault in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. In their criticism of Whirlpool, MPs also demanded the Government consider establishing a single National Product Safety Agency amid fears that cuts have undermined the effectiveness of local trading standards agencies. They also accused ministers of ""watering down"" recommendations for an overhaul of the product recall system put forward in 2016 by an independent review led by Lynn Faulds Wood. Committee chair, Labour's Rachel Reeves, said of the tumble dryer alert: ""Whirlpool's woeful response to the defect in its tumble dryers has caused huge worry to people with these appliances in their homes. ""Their delayed and dismissive response to correcting these defects has been inadequate and we call on Whirlpool to resolve issues urgently."" The company insisted it had acted properly. Its statement said: ""After two years of extensive measures to raise awareness to this campaign - including directly contacting four million owners of these appliances - the number of consumers coming forward has fallen sharply. ""We continue to urge consumers to contact us immediately if they believe they still own an affected appliance. We can assure consumers that they if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week."" A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Government's top priority is to keep people safe and Britain's product safety requirements are among the highest in the world, which is why weestablished the Working Group on Product Safety and Recalls to examine the evidence of Lynn Faulds Wood's independent review. ""We are considering their recommendations, including the creation of a new national oversight body, and will respond shortly. ""We have already taken a number of steps to improve our product safety regime, including upgrading the Government's recalls website to make it clear to the public which white goods are safe to use."""

Higher import costs because of the collapse in the value of the pound has been largely responsible for driving living costs up in 2017. At the same time, households have felt a squeeze from wage growth failing to keep pace - a scenario reflected in many Christmas trading statements from retailers. The ONS figures provide some hope that economists are right and the worst of the price increases have now filtered through. But James Tucker, a statistician who compiled the figures, said: ""It remains too early to say whether today's slight fall is the start of any longer-term reduction in the rate of inflation."" The impact of price growth on consumer spending - along with uncertainty over the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU - have been dominant factors in the slowdown in the UK economy during 2017. The Bank of England has predicted that Brexit-linked inflation will have peaked by now - giving some hope of respite to consumers feeling the pinch. But figures out next week will show whether there has been any improvement in the gulf between inflation and wage growth. Commenting on the ONS figures Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The fall-back in CPI inflation from 3.1% in November to 3% in December marks the beginning of what we expect will be a sustained downward trend over the course of this year. ""December's rate was in line with the consensus expectation, with the breakdown showing that a rise in fuel prices (reflecting the recent rise in oil prices) and tobacco prices (reflecting the duty changes announced in the Autumn Statement), was offset by a smaller contribution from airfares inflation. ""Meanwhile, the producer prices figures showed input price inflation fell sharply, from 7.3% in November to 4.9%, suggesting that price pressures at the beginning of the production pipeline are continuing to cool."" On the prospect of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) raising interest rates again following November's rise to combat inflation, he added: ""The MPC is unlikely to feel pressured into raising rates again very soon."""

""In particular, I have asked that the investigation looks not only at the conduct of the directors at the point of its insolvency, but also of any individuals who were previously directors. ""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously."" Mr Clark also told the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) to look into Carillion's accounts. Auditors should face questions over their ""conduct and practice"", he said. A meeting is being held later on Tuesday between the Business Secretary and leaders of the TUC and Unite trade unions. It comes after Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Government had questions to answer over why Carillion was awarded seven public sector contracts - after it received several profit warnings. He asked in the Commons: ""When there were loud and clear worrying signs about Carillion, why, instead of intervening, did Treasury ministers collude in the strategy of drip-feeding more contracts to Carillion to buoy up an obviously failing company?"" He added: ""I put it no stronger than this: at this stage there are real suspicions that the Government was too close to this company and too wedded to its privatisation role."" Downing Street confirmed public services run by Carillion are still being provided but insisted there was ""no complacency"" and the situation would be ""monitored"". Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said no taxpayer money was being used to bail out the company. However, the cost of insolvency will be picked up by the Government. Ministers were forced to intervene after Carillion went into liquidation on Monday morning, with 450 public sector contracts on its books. The 200-year-old firm employed 20,000 workers across Britain before banks pulled the plug. Contracts it received included work on the HS2 railway, construction of new schools and hospitals, the building of the Aberdeen bypass and catering contracts with both schools and the Ministry of Defence. Workers on public sector contracts have been told by the Government they should go to work and will still be paid. But those employed on private sector contracts will receive no pay after Wednesday - unless other companies included on joint-venture projects step in to take them on."

Labour's internal rift deepened on Tuesday when members of the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) elected a Momentum director as the new chair of their disputes panel. Christine Shawcroft took the influential post after beating incumbent Ann Black in a vote of NEC members, but saw her victory immediately attacked. Critics highlighted how Ms Shawcroft had previously been suspended by Labour for publicly supporting Lutfur Rahman, the controversial former mayor of London borough Tower Hamlets who was found guilty of electoral fraud. In her new role, Ms Shawcroft will lead the panel responsible for enforcing Labour Party rules. Commenting before the result of the vote, former NEC member Sir Tony posted on Twitter: ""Ann Black's brilliant - a radical voice for ordinary members on the NEC with an awesome work rate. ""The idea of the Corbynite left trying to undermine her is outrageous. ""If true it would confirm what I've always feared - our party completely taken over by and for a leftist clique.""

If true it would confirm what I’ve always feared- our party completely taken over by and for a leftist clique https://t.co/iT19WFsIZZ Labour peer Lord Beecham, who also previously served on the NEC, branded Ms Shawcroft's election ""shameful"". And Richard Angell, director of Progress, the pressure group of centre-left Labour members, said: ""The irony of someone who was kicked out of Labour because she supported Lutfur Rahman, the disgraced former mayor of Tower Hamlets, becoming the chair of the disputes committee shows the contempt the Momentum leadership have for due process and party democracy."" Momentum have been accused of staging an ""entryist"" takeover of the Labour Party following Mr Corbyn's election as party leader in 2015. The left-wing group, which grew out of Mr Corbyn's leadership campaign, has previously been branded ""a bit of a rabble"" by Labour deputy leader Tom Watson. On Monday, Momentum founder Jon Lansman was elected to the NEC to extend both his and Mr Corbyn's influence over Labour's ruling body. He was joined on the NEC by other Momentum-backed candidates Yasmine Dar and Rachel Garnham, while comedian Eddie Izzard was defeated in his attempt to win a place. The new prominence of Momentum on the NEC has sparked suggestions so-called ""moderate"" Labour MPs could be targeted by deselection efforts."
2018-01-16,There has not been governmental exposure to a private sector liquidation of this magnitude since the collapse of half the British banking system a decade ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180116200115/https://news.sky.com/story/counting-the-political-and-financial-cost-of-carillions-collapse-11209784,"The numbers involved in Carillion will be smaller than the tens of billions required then, but the potential impact on public services is immediately far more severe. So the political jeopardy involved in the handling of this is substantial. Sky News was given the departmental minute from the Cabinet Office which details the Government's proposals to take a ""significant contingent liability for which there is no specific statutory authority"". This is a case of ""special urgency"", where the liability has had to be incurred immediately without allowing MPs 14 days to object. In order to appoint a receiver acting to safeguard the continuity of public services, the Government has indemnified the receiver against any claims and proceedings. This may occur if creditors believe that some parts of the business should stop supplying services to the public sector - and could sue on this basis. No figure is attached to this assessment. :: Carillion collapse: Private sector workers' pay runs out on Wednesday David Lidington, leader of the House of Commons, apologised to MPs for not giving them the normal time to approve the liability. Separate to that, the Government will also loan Carillon the money to continue to fund the salaries on public sector contracts and for the rest of employees for a 48-hour period while private customers decide if they want the contracts to continue. The Government now has a complex multi-faceted test of competence and public sector delivery across hundreds of contracts, sites, schools, hospitals, prisons, and homes. That is why the Government's emergency Cobra committee met with a mix of Cabinet and newly appointed junior ministers last night. But the departmental minute - a contingent liability - also represents something much bigger. From the creation of private finance projects to their great expansion under the Blair government, the point of the costly funding was this: risk transfer. The departmental minute is the moment that at least part of that transfer of risk now falls firmly back on the Government’s shoulders. When these contracts were being signed the critique was that the transfer never happened, as when push came to shove governments could not allow these contracts to fail. This is what is happening right now. Shareholders are wiped out, bond holders will lose a lot, but ultimately the taxpayer will step in to ensure continuity of public service provision. Part of that will require a significant loan to the receivers. No figure will be revealed until next month but it could be hundreds of millions of pounds. : What ultimately went wrong at Carillion Government sources stressed to Sky News that the taxpayer will become the ""preferred creditor"", and so first in line for repayments from the liquidation. But this has happened on a broader political canvas too, where Labour, four months ago, called for many of these contracts to be brought back into the public sector. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the Carillion collapse a “defining moment”, and indeed it does appear to contain a toxic mix for the Government of massive bonuses, failing companies and public services provision. There are plenty of questions about the continued awarding of billions in contracts even as it was evident the company was in financial distress. The Government argues that a third of the contracts it now has to sort out were signed under the last Labour government. But the Government does now face the reality of having to take some of these contracts back in-house, effectively renationalising them, and providing for a significant taxpayer loan to the receiver, of an as of yet unspecified amount, and then also take responsibility for the provision of these services again. It must hope that there is no contagion to other similar companies, but fear of the impact on the Carillion supply chain. So far the response has been to maintain continuity over the next few days. But this is a private sector collapse with implications for the Government over months and years, at a time when Brexit and the NHS crisis are already consuming most of the political bandwidth."

In a tribute from the band, singer Tommy Vext said: ""Zombie is an incredibly personal song and although we are a hard rock band, we always felt the rawness and honesty she projected on stage and in her recordings was something to which all bands should aspire to, regardless of genre. ""When we heard she liked our version and wanted to sing on it, it was the greatest compliment a new band, or any band for that matter, could have received.""

We have always had deep respect for her as an artist and a vocalist and she was never afraid to bare her soul in her music and lyrics.

Mr Lethbridge's decision to hire a helicopter on Monday morning paid off when Samuel's car was seen in scrub off a road 12 miles from home. The teen was cut from the wreck around 30 hours after the accident. He remains in hospital in a serious condition, having suffered multiple fractures. NSW Ambulance Inspector Jeff Atkins said Samuel was ""very lucky to be alive"". Mr Lethbridge told Seven Network television that people initially suggested his son had run away, but he thought ""that's just not Samuel"". He said a previous case involving a car crash victim who died after not being found for a number of days spurred him to take action. ""I wasn't going to let that happen,"" Mr Lethbridge said. Lee Mitchell, a helicopter pilot and part-owner of Skyline Aviation Group, said he discounted his usual hire rate of A$1,200 (£693) when Mr Lethbridge came in and explained his situation. ""He came in looking anxious and somewhat fatigued and said he needed a helicopter bad,"" Mr Mitchell said of meeting Tony Lethbridge at Port Macquarie airport. The father said he had reported his son as a missing person to police and explained his fears he had been involved in an accident. ""He just said: 'I've got A$1,000 (£577) on me, will that be enough?' and we said: 'Yes, it would,'"" Mr Mitchell said. The helicopter took off soon afterwards with Samuel's uncle Michael Lethbridge on board, because the father often suffers from air sickness, the pilot said. The car was spotted within 15 minutes, around 20 metres from the road. ""It was fairly easy to spot from the air. It would've been near impossible to see from the road because it was well below the road level,"" Mr Mitchell said. The uncle was the first to reach the car and said he feared what he would find. ""I really didn't want to go. I was scared of what I'd find. As I got closer I seen Sam's head move,"" Michael Lethbridge told Melbourne Radio 3AW.

2018-01-16,A James Bond actor claims she was sexually assaulted by Steven Seagal in his hotel room during an audition when she was 25-years-old. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180116200115/https://news.sky.com/story/bond-girl-alleges-steven-seagal-sexually-assaulted-her-after-2002-audition-11209724,"Rachel Grant alleges Seagal talked dirty to her, pulled down her top, and pushed her on to a bed after she auditioned for a part in Out For A Kill in 2002. Grant claims she lost the role after she refused his sexual advances in his hotel bedroom in Bulgaria. Lawyers for the actor have denied the accusations. ""Our client denies having such contact with Miss Grant and further vehemently denies any alleged assault at all, in particular, the alleged assault occurring in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2002,"" said Seagal's representative. Talking to Sky News, Grant explained she had been flown out to Bulgaria by Seagal and his director, and was invited to run through some lines with them both, before Seagal asked the director to leave the room so he could get to know her. When it was just the two of them, he poured her a drink, soon began to ""talk dirty"" to her, and asked her several times to take her top off. She said: ""He asked me to sit on he bed because he wanted to give me a massage. ""I was wearing a top with no straps, so I had my shoulders exposed. I may have joked, but I said no."" She added that Seagal then went behind her chair and started to massage her shoulders. The 40-year-old said: ""I probably allowed it to happen for a few seconds before I stood up and walked away. ""Because I was in a different position and closer to the bed, he was able somehow to pull my top down. ""It really took me by surprise. I was really embarassed because I was so exposed."" She added: ""It was really awkward. It just got stuck under my breasts and I was so embarassed. ""I was embarassed for him too because it was so awful, what he had done. ""Suddenly this person you are so excited to see and meet becomes this horrible human being."" As she struggled to pull her top back up, she says he managed to get her on the bed. Ms Grant, who was 25 at the time of the assault, said: ""He didn't hurt me physically, but he is a big guy and his energy and presence fills the room like you wouldn't believe. ""I remember turning to the left and right, and saying 'let's not do this'."" As Seagal said she must ""want to see his private parts"", she burst into tears and he stopped. :: Steven Seagal investigated over claim of sexual assault Ms Grant said he apologised, and said ""when I work on a film it's nice to be dating the actress I'm working with, it's great for on-stage chemistry. ""I even said sorry for not being interested in him."" The actor said she had blamed herself for wearing a strapless top after the encounter. She said: ""It was such a let down and disappointment because A, I was there for a job and B, I was so excited to meet him. ""That I thought was my mistake, maybe he could see I was excited. It's no excuse, no one should be brought to meet an actor or producer in a bedroom on their first meeting."" On leaving the room, she said she could tell the director knew something was wrong, and put his head in his hands as she walked back to her own hotel room. A few days later Grant received a call from Seagal telling her she was not going to be cast in the film. She said: ""He asked me how I was and he said to me 'oh Rachel, after looking over everyone, all the actors, we have decided you really don't fit into the film. On this occasion, we are not going to be able to cast you in the film. We will keep you in mind for other films'."" Ms Grant had been offered the opportunity to sell the story but did not want people to know about what had happened. She added: ""When all these Me Too stories started emerging, I thought about what happened. I had people messaging me to say I should share the story, but I still wasn't ready. ""A few months went by and so many women had shared their stories and it was really inspiring. I couldn't believe the stories I was hearing, not just in the film industry, but around the world. ""It just came a point where I wanted to be part of the movement and make a difference. I'm happy to share it now, for such a long time it was a dark secret and it feels good to share it."""
2018-01-17,There has not been governmental exposure to a private sector liquidation of this magnitude since the collapse of half the British banking system a decade ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180117202849/https://news.sky.com/story/counting-the-political-and-financial-cost-of-carillions-collapse-11209784,"The numbers involved in Carillion will be smaller than the tens of billions required then, but the potential impact on public services is immediately far more severe. So the political jeopardy involved in the handling of this is substantial. Sky News was given the departmental minute from the Cabinet Office which details the Government's proposals to take a ""significant contingent liability for which there is no specific statutory authority"". This is a case of ""special urgency"", where the liability has had to be incurred immediately without allowing MPs 14 days to object. In order to appoint a receiver acting to safeguard the continuity of public services, the Government has indemnified the receiver against any claims and proceedings. This may occur if creditors believe that some parts of the business should stop supplying services to the public sector - and could sue on this basis. No figure is attached to this assessment. :: Carillion collapse: Private sector workers' pay runs out on Wednesday David Lidington, leader of the House of Commons, apologised to MPs for not giving them the normal time to approve the liability. Separate to that, the Government will also loan Carillon the money to continue to fund the salaries on public sector contracts and for the rest of employees for a 48-hour period while private customers decide if they want the contracts to continue. The Government now has a complex multi-faceted test of competence and public sector delivery across hundreds of contracts, sites, schools, hospitals, prisons, and homes. That is why the Government's emergency Cobra committee met with a mix of Cabinet and newly appointed junior ministers last night. But the departmental minute - a contingent liability - also represents something much bigger. From the creation of private finance projects to their great expansion under the Blair government, the point of the costly funding was this: risk transfer. The departmental minute is the moment that at least part of that transfer of risk now falls firmly back on the Government’s shoulders. When these contracts were being signed the critique was that the transfer never happened, as when push came to shove governments could not allow these contracts to fail. This is what is happening right now. Shareholders are wiped out, bond holders will lose a lot, but ultimately the taxpayer will step in to ensure continuity of public service provision. Part of that will require a significant loan to the receivers. No figure will be revealed until next month but it could be hundreds of millions of pounds. : What ultimately went wrong at Carillion Government sources stressed to Sky News that the taxpayer will become the ""preferred creditor"", and so first in line for repayments from the liquidation. But this has happened on a broader political canvas too, where Labour, four months ago, called for many of these contracts to be brought back into the public sector. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the Carillion collapse a “defining moment”, and indeed it does appear to contain a toxic mix for the Government of massive bonuses, failing companies and public services provision. There are plenty of questions about the continued awarding of billions in contracts even as it was evident the company was in financial distress. The Government argues that a third of the contracts it now has to sort out were signed under the last Labour government. But the Government does now face the reality of having to take some of these contracts back in-house, effectively renationalising them, and providing for a significant taxpayer loan to the receiver, of an as of yet unspecified amount, and then also take responsibility for the provision of these services again. It must hope that there is no contagion to other similar companies, but fear of the impact on the Carillion supply chain. So far the response has been to maintain continuity over the next few days. But this is a private sector collapse with implications for the Government over months and years, at a time when Brexit and the NHS crisis are already consuming most of the political bandwidth."
2018-01-17,Flagship Brexit legislation has cleared the House of Commons after MPs approved the EU Withdrawal Bill.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180117202849/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-eu-withdrawal-bill-clears-house-of-commons-to-pass-to-peers-11211620,"The key bill, which aims to end the supremacy of EU law in Britain in time for Brexit, will now pass to the House of Lords, where it will be closely scrutinised by peers. MPs voted in favour of the bill by 324 to 295, with Labour opposing its third reading. However, the legislation is likely to return to the House of Commons after peers signalled their intent to add amendments in the upper chamber. Commenting on Wednesday night's vote, Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""We are pleased that the bill has successfully completed this stage of its passage through Parliament. ""From the beginning our approach has been to work constructively with MPs from across the House wherever possible to improve the bill. ""This is a critical piece of legislation that aims to maximise certainty for individuals and businesses after our exit. ""We are looking forward to working with peers as the bill enters its next stage of scrutiny in the House of Lords at the end of this month."" Announcing Labour's opposition to the bill at third reading, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded it ""not fit for purpose"" as he repeated demands for MPs to have a meaningful vote on any divorce deal with the EU. The vote on the bill's third reading followed two hours of voting on MPs' proposed amendments to the legislation, which the Government defeated. As well as repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, which brought Britain into the EU, the EU Withdrawal Bill is also designed to transfer all existing Brussels laws into UK legislation. During Wednesday's debate, Theresa May was handed a warning over Brexit by former Cabinet minister Justine Greening, who quit the Government in this month's reshuffle. The ex-education secretary claimed Brexit will ""not be sustainable"" if it does not work for young people. Her remarks signalled Ms Greening could now join a group of Tory Brexit rebel MPs, who will be watched closely by the Government ahead of the EU Withdrawal Bill's probable return to the House of Commons. In the unlikely event the bill passes the House of Lords without peers adding amendments, it would receive Royal assent and become law."
2018-01-17,Bosses at collapsed construction firm Carillion have had their bonus payments halted amid growing anger at bumper payouts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180117202849/https://news.sky.com/story/carillion-directors-bonus-payments-stopped-11211292,"The Insolvency Service revealed payments had stopped when the major public service provider plunged into liquidation on Monday with debts of £1.3bn and a £600m pensions deficit. A spokesman said: ""Any bonus payment to directors, beyond the liquidation date, have been stopped and this includes the severance payments which were being paid to some senior executives who left the company."" The news came after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn used Prime Minister's Questions to tackle Theresa May over ""wildly excessive bonuses"" given to Carillion bosses. Carillion's former chief executive Richard Howson was handed £1.5m in salary, bonuses and pension payments as part of his exit deal in 2016, with the company agreeing to carry on paying him a £600,000 salary and £28,000 benefits until October 2018. Other former bosses had also been handed severance deals in which their salaries were continuing to be paid beyond their exit date. Mr Corbyn claimed Carillion's demise showed there was ""one rule for the super rich, another for everybody else"", while he claimed the Government had had a duty to ensure the firm was properly managed. He accused ministers of being ""very negligent"" over Carillion's failure as the Prime Minister faced her first public grilling since the downfall of the major public service provider. Mr Corbyn demanded Mrs May end the ""costly racket"" of private involvement in the public sector and asked why the Government had continued to hand contracts to Carillion even after the debt-laden firm had issued a series of profit warnings. Mrs May attempted to absolve ministers of responsibility over the demise of Carillion by insisting the Government was the ""customer"" of the collapsed firm and ""not the manager"". Ministers have been left reeling after Carillion went bust with 450 public sector contracts on its books. The 200-year-old firm employed 20,000 workers across Britain before banks pulled the plug. However, as MPs listened to the exchanges in the House of Commons, the Government was boosted by the news that workers on the majority of private sector contracts held by the failed firm will continue to be paid. The Insolvency Service revealed 90% of Carillion's private customers will ensure funding for the firm to continue providing services in the interim until new suppliers can be found. The Government had already assured employees on public sector contracts they will continue to be paid. But thousands of workers on private sector contracts had faced uncertainty about their future when a 48-hour period of support ends on Wednesday. In his questions to the Prime Minister, Mr Corbyn also highlighted other private companies' woes while holding public sector contracts. He said: ""These corporations need to be shown the door - we need our public services provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight. ""As the ruins of Carillion lie around her, will the Prime Minister act to end this costly racket of the relationship between Government and some of these companies?"" Interserve, a rival of Carillion until its financial collapse this week, has seen its share price fall sharply on a report the Government is closely monitoring the company. In her responses to Mr Corbyn, the Prime Minister said: ""We were a customer of Carillion, not the manager of Carillion, and that is a very important difference."" She added: ""We're making sure in this case that public services continue to be provided, that workers in those public services are supported and taxpayers are protected. ""But what Labour oppose isn't just a role for private companies in public services - it's the private sector as a whole."" Earlier in the session, Labour MP Catherine McKinnell asked for guarantees an estimated 1,400 Carillion apprentices will be able to complete their training and be paid. The Prime Minister said: ""We are aware of the issues around apprentices and that's why the minister with responsibility for that will be looking very carefully at what action can be taken."""

Dylan Farrow accused Allen of sexually assaulting her when she was 7 years old, a claim the director has rejected. Dylan is Mia Farrow's adoptive daughter, who Allen cared for during the course of this 13-year relationship with the actress. ""I am credible, and I am telling the truth, and I think it's important that people realise that one victim, one accuser, matters,"" Dylan is heard saying in a short clip published by CBS.

Timothee Chalamet, Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page, Rebecca Hall and Mira Sorvino are some of the stars who have apologised for having worked with Allen. Chalamet and Hall have donated all earnings made in Allen's productions to charities for victims of sexual abuse. On Tuesday, actor Alec Baldwin positioned himself on the other side of the debate, criticising those who are now disavowing the director. ""Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states and no charges were filed,"" Baldwin wrote on Twitter. ""Is it possible to support survivors of paedophilia and sexual assault/abuse and also believe that WA is innocent? I think so."" Standing with Dylan Farrow are her mother Mia and brother Ronan, the reporter whose expose on Harvey Weinstein sparked the mogul's downfall. Dylan's other brother Moses has backed Allen, saying Dylan's allegations are likely to be intended to ""please her mother"". ""Of course Woody did not molest my sister,"" he told People magazine in 2014. ""She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him."" Allen claims Mia Farrow never forgave him for marrying her adoptive daughter Soon-Yi when she was 27 years old."

Worboys, 60, is expected to walk free as early as the end of next week after being granted parole. He has served a year more than the minimum eight-year sentence he was given for one rape, six sex attacks and the drugging of 12 women he duped into accepting a ride in his taxi. The two women need to raise thousands of pounds for legal fees to mount their legal challenge. :: Justice Secretary 'to intervene' on black cab rapist John Worboys release Police believe Worboys attacked more than 100 victims, but more allegations were not pursued because either the evidence was poor or more convictions would not have added to his sentence, prosecutors said. A victim known as DSD said: ""Since hearing the news I have been in a state of complete shock and panic. How can a prolific sex offender be rehabilitated in a short space of time when he has never admitted to his guilt or shown any remorse? ""In 2003 when I reported to them I had been raped, I was told 'a black cab driver just wouldn't do it'. I said at the time if they didn't find him he would do it again. ""Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine he would go on to do it again another 100 times, that we know of. ""Unfortunately, I do not share their confidence and I am convinced he will re-offend.""

He's ruining my life all over again."" :: Worboys victims left in dark over black cab rapist's release conditions The victims will have to persuade a High Court judge that the Parole Board decision was either illegal or that it did not follow procedures.

The victim - who Bennell admitted abusing in 1998, when he was jailed for nine years - said he wanted to get in touch with the ex-Premier League midfielder's parents because he had read in the media that they had not been able to get closure as they had no explanation for his death. ""Four people from teams I have played with, with Bennell, have taken their own lives,"" he told the court. ""Whether they have taken their lives due to Barry solely I don't know but all I know is how it's had an impact on me and how it could impact on other people."" Speaking about his efforts to contact other alleged victims of the 64-year-old, the victim told the court: ""When people are breaking down on the phone, on the verge of suicide, when you hear of people who have taken their own lives..."" He said he knew of former youth players who had been left ""destitute"" and with alcohol problems as a result of the alleged abuse by Bennell - and that there was an ongoing civil case against Manchester City. But the victim told the court it was about ""justice"" and not compensation. ""I'm sick to death of this being part of my life and I just want to put it to bed once and for all,"" he said. Earlier in the day, the court heard from a complainant who said senior officials at Manchester City had been aware of abuse carried out by Bennell, who scouted players for several junior sides associated with the club. The victim said he was abused by Bennell more than 100 times during a four-year stint with one of the teams. He claimed chief scout Ken Barnes, who died in 2010, had known about the abuse. ""I want an apology off Manchester City and anyone else, if possible,"" he told the court. Bennell - who is appearing in court via video-link due to illness - denies 48 counts of child sex abuse against 11 complainants, with alleged offences having taken place between 1979 and 1990.

Navy doctor Ronny Jackson, who administered the physical exam, reported that Mr Trump was 6' 3'' and 239 pounds (17 stone), which would give him a BMI of 29.8 - making him overweight. But according to a copy of his driving license issued in May 2012 - published by Politico after an open records request - Mr Trump is 6' 2''. It may only be an inch but it is the difference between an overweight BMI or an obese one of 30.6, according to the NHS.

The ""deliberate and calculated"" attack left 16 people with chemical burns, while three people were temporarily blinded. Last month, the 25-year-old admitted hiding a phone, two SIM cards and two memory sticks inside a crutch while waiting trial over the attack. Collins claimed he had used the phone to make private calls to then pregnant Ferne McCann. McCann, who appeared in the TV show The Only Way Is Essex, gave birth to their baby daughter, Sunday, in November. Collins, from Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, appeared at Woolwich Crown Court via video link from the high security Belmarsh prison on Wednesday. He showed no emotion as he was sentenced for a single charge of possessing a prohibited item while in prison. Judge Nicholas Heathcote Williams said: ""The presence of a mobile phone or component part such as a SIM card has many implications, not only for the prison establishment, but also the wider environment. ""It provides a prisoner or prisoners with an opportunity to communicate they would otherwise not have. ""This therefore allows them to act in a way prison is supposed to prevent them from doing."" Collins' barrister Rebecca Randall said: ""The only reason Mr Collins had that phone was to contact, privately, his girlfriend and friends and family. ""His girlfriend at the time was heavily pregnant with his first child. ""That child is now two months old and occasionally visits him with its mother and his sister."" She told the court that Collins was worried his recorded prison phone calls to Ms McCann were being leaked to the press, including one in which the pair talked about baby names. During his trial over the acid attack, Collins admitted throwing the bottle of fluid over clubbers but said he thought it was a date rape drug which he had snatched from two men. He said he had been at the club to celebrate the news of Ms McCann's pregnancy, which they had announced to her family the previous day. After Collins was convicted, Ms McCann, who had by that point given birth to the baby, released a statement saying she would raise the child ""alone""."

I set off from a work meeting in Stoke at around 4pm, heading home to Motherwell, but by 6.30pm we were stuck on the motorway. I was travelling with a colleague who was heading back to Edinburgh. By 10pm we were still stuck, so to entertain myself I ended up getting out of my car to build a snowman. The chap in the car in front got out to help me, but ended up getting so cold he had to give up and get back in his car. I tweeted Police Scotland to find out how long we'd be stuck, and to check how long I had to finish it. They didn't get back to me, but I ended up having plenty of time. There were plenty of police around, and big gritters with snowploughs on the front. Every time the plough came through it was good news because it meant we could move forward a little bit. Some impatient motorists were using the hard shoulder to try to cheat their way through the traffic - not the cleverest move. They were stopping the gritters and police getting through, and just making things worse. We had seen that there were lots of problems on the roads before we set off, so we had picked up provisions at a petrol station before we got going, and filled up with petrol. Because I knew we were okay for fuel I must admit I kept the engine running most of the time, and kept the heating going as it was pretty cold outside. I texted my wife to let her know I wouldn't be home, and she stopped waiting up and went to bed. My colleague grabbed a nap, but I stayed awake as I was never sure if traffic might start moving again. I ended up getting back home at 3am, so all in all, we were stuck for seven hours. I grabbed a few hours' sleep, but I'm one of the lucky ones as I can work from home today. ""I take my hat off to the emergency services, rescue teams and gritter drivers - they really were doing their best in a difficult situation and it's a pretty remote location. ""They always get the grief when transport is hit, but given the volume of snow there is nothing more they could have done in a really challenging situation."""

Deutsche previously said it was considering shifting up to 4,000 staff from London to Frankfurt. The bank's British boss John Cryan said last July that it was preparing for a Brexit outcome that would be ""worse than people can imagine"". But on Wednesday, Stefan Hoops, head of Deutsche's capital market division in Germany, told reporters: ""Not thousands will move from London, but rather hundreds."" Deutsche Bank has its headquarters in Frankfurt but 8,600 staff are currently based in Britain. It is now planning a new booking centre in the German city to handle the billions of euros worth of non-European business currently routed through London – which may not be allowed after Brexit. Mr Hoops said a few senior traders would relocate to Frankfurt as well as risk managers and legal and support staff. ""But the lion's share of traders will remain in London,"" he added. Traders will mainly continue handling orders in the City but the booking of the trades will be carried out in Frankfurt. Last October, Sergio Ermotti, the head of Swiss banking giant UBS, said its ""worst case scenario"" of having to shift 1,000 jobs out of London due to Brexit was looking ""more and more unlikely"". He said there had been ""more regulatory and political clarification about what we need to do"". A few days later, HSBC said that its transfer of employees from London to Paris may be less than the 1,000 previously thought."
2018-01-17,A man who strangled a teenager and hid her body in a clingfilm-wrapped wardrobe has been jailed for life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180117202849/https://news.sky.com/story/murderer-ashley-foster-jailed-for-killing-teenager-megan-bills-and-clingfilming-her-body-in-wardrobe-11211363,"Ashley Foster will serve a minimum term of 26 years for the murder of 17-year-old Megan Bills during what the prosecution described as a violent sexual attack. Foster, 24, had been released from prison just three days before he met Megan and killed her in his room at an ex-offenders' hostel in Brierley Hill, West Midlands, on Easter Sunday last year. Megan's body was kept in a wardrobe for more than two weeks, where it decomposed while her killer searched the internet for snuff movies, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. Foster used a shirt as a ligature to kill Megan, and then used clingfilm to wrap the wardrobe, also covering it with a quilt and pointing a fan toward a window in an effort to get rid of the smell. The former hairdressing student's body was found by staff at the hostel who were investigating the smell. Judge James Burbidge QC said Foster had intended to kill Megan and that his behaviour after the murder had been ""beyond belief"". He said: ""Megan was vulnerable because she was young, although she was trying to live an independent life. ""Instead of acting in a compassionate, human and decent manner, you not only failed to ring the authorities, you bundled her body in a curtain or bedding and then placed her body in a wardrobe. ""You left her body there to be discovered by others. That in itself is shocking."" At the beginning of the seven-day trial, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC had said: ""Whether it was the prospect of having to dismember the body or whether it was a fear of being caught on camera or a combination of the two, Foster's nerve failed him and Megan's body was left in the wardrobe."" Foster had admitted preventing the decent and lawful burial of Megan but was found guilty by a jury of murdering her. He wrote a letter to his sister after the killing, saying Megan had died accidentally and he had not meant to hurt her, the court heard. In a statement issued after Foster's sentencing, Megan's parents, Martin and Dawn, said: ""To have lost Megan is hard enough, but to try and understand the impact, when coupled with the fact that her body was concealed until it had rotted beyond recognition, is clearly painful beyond words, and demonstrates an evil cruelty beyond any decent comprehension. ""The ongoing trauma we are living with is due in part to being denied the closure obtained from being able to see and hold Megan after she had died."""

The House of Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee is currently taking a wide look at the impact of ""fake news"" on websites and social media. Tory MP Damian Collins, the committee's chair, last month criticised Facebook's previous work in investigating Russian influence on the EU referendum. He even raised the possibility of sanctions for social media companies failing to police their websites. :: Long read: Key evidence linking Kremlin to social media trolls is lacking Facebook has so far claimed only three Russian-linked accounts were found to have bought adverts that may have influenced the Brexit referendum. In a submission to the Electoral Commission, which is conducting a separate probe into EU referendum funding, Facebook said just 200 people in Britain saw the adverts, which cost a total of 72p. But Mr Collins accused the company of doing ""no work"" other than looking at those accounts that had already been identified as part of the US Senate's investigation into Moscow interference in the US presidential election. Mr Collins' committee released a letter from Facebook's UK policy director Simon Milner on Wednesday, in which the company promised to look further than the ""cluster"" of accounts connected to the American election. I welcome the fact that Facebook have now responded to @CommonsCMS request for information regarding the abuse of their platform during the Brexit Referendum. I look forward to reviewing their findings. pic.twitter.com/7Sd6lSwsav Writing to Mr Collins, Mr Milner said: ""You expressed a view that there may be other similar coordinated activity from Russia that we had not yet identified through our investigation and asked for use to continue our investigatory work. ""We have considered your request and can confirm that our investigatory team is now looking to see if we can identify other similar clusters engaged in coordinated activity around the Brexit referendum that was not identified previously."" Mr Collins welcomed Facebook's promise to expand their investigation and said he would ""look forward to reviewing their findings"". The prominent Conservative MP has also previously criticised Twitter over its response to his committee's inquiry."

A Government official was said to have told the paper that ministers were ""very worried"". However, shares later recovered some poise - down 1.5% - after the Cabinet Office released a statement. A spokesperson told Sky News: ""We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve. ""We are in regular discussions with all these companies regarding their financial position. We do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion."" Carillion went bust on Monday carrying more than £2.2bn of financial liabilities, according to a filing by its interim chief executive Keith Cochrane, who also revealed it had just £29m in the bank at the time of its demise. Interserve, like the Government, sought to distance itself from the collapse of Carillion. A company spokesperson said: ""Last week we announced that we expect our 2017 performance to be in line with expectations outlined in October and that our transformation plan is expected to deliver £40m-£50m benefit by 2020. ""This remains the case and we expect our 2018 operating profit to be ahead of current market expectations and we continue to have constructive discussions with lenders over longer-term funding. ""We are keeping the Cabinet Office closely appraised of our progress as would be expected."" Interserve, which has around 80,000 staff worldwide - 25,000 of them in the UK - saw its chief executive quit in the last year ahead of a profit warning last September which left shares losing more than half their value. It blamed high costs from its exit from the waste-to-energy sector and tough trading in its construction and business services arms. The company later announced in December that it had secured new funding until the end of March to put its finances on a ""firmer footing"". It first raised its profit guidance a week ago. Commenting on the share price movements Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""Interserve has hadits problems for sure, but it's no Carillion. ""Its latest update showed improvement and the news will do no good for sentiment given there may be some twitchiness among investors in the sector following Carillion's collapse."""

Tesco said it would instead now offer a standardised reward worth three times the value, rather than two or four times more - with the latter including some of the most popular meal deals at Pizza Express, Prezzo and Zizzi. It prompted criticism on social media that customers would lose out where they had previously benefited from offers giving them four times the value of their vouchers. Some were also critical of the lack of notice given to Tesco's 16 million active Clubcard users. Now the supermarket has delayed the changes until 10 June. Tesco's chief customer officer Alessandra Bellini said: ""Customers have told us they want Clubcard to be simpler, and they've asked us to make it easier to get the most value from the points they collect. ""That's why we're simplifying our reward partners programme so it's more straightforward to use, by offering customers three times the value of their vouchers with over 100 Clubcard Reward Partners. ""We've listened to the feedback from customers who said they want more time to adjust, so we've delayed making these changes until 10 June. ""It means that customers who planned to redeem their vouchers at four times the value with reward partners will have the time to do so."""

She said MPs had a ""duty"" to ""look ahead"" and ensure that whatever deal is struck works for the younger generation. Ms Greening followed a speech by her Europhile colleague Ken Clarke in the House of Commons on Wednesday by saying he had made ""a very important point"". The Putney MP said: ""I represent a very young constituency here in London and the bottom line is that looking ahead, if Brexit doesn't work for young people in our country, in the end, it will not be sustainable. ""And when they take their place here they will seek to improve or undo what we've done and make it work for them. ""So we do absolutely have a duty in this House to look ahead and ensure that whatever we get is sustainable and works for them."" Ms Greening, who campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum, was until recently one of those sat around the Cabinet table when ministers discussed the Government's vision for Brexit. She has previously been bound by collective responsibility not to veer from or criticise the Government's message. But her first shot across its bows suggests she could join a number of Tory MPs unafraid to speak out on Brexit. She was also pictured chatting to Tory rebel Anna Soubry on the backbenches before last week's Prime Minister's Questions. In response to Ms Greening's comments, Theresa May's spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister is determined to deliver a Brexit deal which works for all sections of society. That would include young people and all parts of the UK. ""We have been very clear from the outset that we are leaving. That's what the British people voted for. ""And our efforts should concentrate on working together to build a future relationship with the EU. We are making good progress."""

With the next general election not scheduled until 5 May 2022, anonymous members of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet are reportedly warning about their party leader's age. If victorious in 2022, at close to the age of 73, Mr Corbyn would be the oldest person ever elected to 10 Downing Street for the first time. Members of his shadow team are also reportedly concerned he will have to enter the 2022 vote promising to serve as prime minister for a full five-year term, until he is 78. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Theresa May mocked Mr Corbyn for appearing to give a statement rather than ask a question. But the Labour leader's spokesman denied this was an example of a ""senior moment"". ""Jeremy will be continuing to lead the Labour party and fight the next election,"" he said. ""It's nonsense that the whole matter is in question, it's nonsense that he had a senior moment, it's nonsense on all fronts. ""Jeremy is extremely energetic, works extremely long hours and since he has been doing this job has performed at an extremely effective and high level. ""He is extremely vigorous. He has become more effective as a leader since he was first elected. ""I see no sign whatsoever that his age is an impediment to continuing to be leader."" In the wake of last June's snap general election, Glastonbury festival organiser Michael Eavis claimed Mr Corbyn had told him he would be Prime Minister by Christmas 2017. The Labour leader has since claimed there will ""probably"" be another election within the next year. Current septuagenarian world leaders include US President Donald Trump, while Mrs May is 61 and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable is 74."

Six explicit videos featuring Ms Chambers and her former partner were published on Redtube.com without her consent. She won her civil claim for breach of confidence, misuse of private information and harassment at London's High Court on Wednesday. The videos appeared on the website in December 2011 and January 2012. Three of them featured Ms Chambers' full name in the title and two contained her age at the time of filming, which was 18. Ms Chambers, 26, was only alerted to the films in June 2013 after she received numerous comments and messages on YouTube - where she runs a popular channel with her fiancee Bria Kam, aimed at teenagers. Many of the messages came from fans who thought she had intentionally been involved in pornography, with some saying they no longer wanted to view her content. :: Teens using 'bait out' groups to share revenge porn :: Australia launches website to report revenge porn in 'world first' Lawyer Alex Marzec told the court Ms Chambers' ex-boyfriend - who can only be legally identified as DCR - had caused her serious emotional and psychological difficulties by uploading the videos, which were filmed at her home in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 2009 without her knowledge or consent. Ms Chambers endured substance abuse and relationship problems as a result, Ms Marzec added. She was also diagnosed with PTSD and underwent specialised trauma therapy, but continued to have flashbacks and nightmares about the release of the films.

The 44-year-old Worcestershire business owner has launched legal action against Jet2holidays over the incident, which happened just hours into his holiday. Mr Hyde had arrived in the Spanish city with his wife Joanne and eight-year-old daughter to celebrate the pair's wedding anniversary. Mrs Hyde, who was poolside, captured the incident on her phone. Mr Hyde said he ""heard a massive crunch"" and was sent rotating underwater when the man's ""backside"" hit him on the head. ""I saw something massive coming towards me and only realised later that it was a young lad and he literally landed with his backside on my head,"" he recalled.

Mr Hyde said that despite physiotherapy he still experiences pain and stiffness because of the incident. Magdalena Knez, a specialist personal injury lawyer at Slater and Gordon who is representing Mr Hyde, said her client does not blame the man involved for what was an accident. Rather, she said Mr Hyde's issue is with the fact that there are ""no signs or barriers in place to section off the area where guests exit the water slide"" and that he has been ""ignored"" by the company. Mr Hyde said the incident ""completely ruined"" his holiday and added: ""It's not too much to ask for some form of response or apology."" A spokeswoman for Jet2holidays said the wellbeing of customers was ""extremely important"" and the firm was ""exploring Mr Hyde's claim fully"". The spokeswoman denied further comment pending the legal case."
2018-01-17,The Bayeux tapestry is set to come to the UK for the first time in 950 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180117202849/https://news.sky.com/story/bayeux-tapestry-set-to-go-on-display-in-the-uk-in-historic-loan-11211019,"French President Emmanuel Macron's office said it is in talks to loan the 11th-century embroidery to Britain, but added it would not be transferred before 2020. Mr Macron is expected to announce the loan when he visits the UK on Thursday. The 70m (230ft)-embroidered cloth, which depicts William of Normandy's 1066 victory over the Saxons at Hastings, is currently on display at the Bayeux museum in Normandy, France. Tests will be carried out to ensure the delicate fabric can be moved without damage. For Britons it could be a chance to see an artwork that has revealed historic secrets found nowhere else. It depicts the events leading up to the Battle of Hastings - the 1066 confrontation between Harold, who had been crowned King of England, and Duke William of Normandy, who believed his was the rightful claim to the throne. Across nine panels of cloth it shows the build-up to battle and the bloody showdown, culminating in Harold's death and William's victory, and paving the way to him becoming King of England. Some believe one scene shows Harold being struck through the eye with an arrow - although others think this a Victorian addition contradicted by accounts that the King was gruesomely hacked to death. The events shown in the tapestry are verified by other accounts from the time, and also include details about 11th- century everyday life valuable to historians today. Details of a pre-battle dinner of soup and roast chicken tells us about what Normans enjoyed eating, and details on fashion are also hidden in the needlework, with the English identified by long hair and moustaches, French figures shown clean-shaven, and aristocrats identified by elaborate accessories. The origins of the tapestry are shrouded in mystery: the first written record of it dates to 1476, when it is mentioned in the Bayeux cathedral's inventory of treasures. And it is technically not a tapestry but an embroidery, stitched into the fabric with ten shades of woollen yarn, rather than woven on a loom. With relations between the UK and Europe now being dramatically - although not so violently - renegotiated in the wake of the Brexit vote, some historians see a symbolism in the loan from France to the UK. ""As Britain seeks to renegotiate its relationship with France, there could scarcely be a better symbol of the close yet fraught ties that have bound the two nations together,"" Medieval historian Levi Roach said. The tapestry is from a Norman perspective, he said, but with ""real sympathy for the fate of the English""."

On Monday, Stokes was charged alongside two other men in relation to an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September.

At a delicate moment for Anglo-French and Anglo-EU relations, with Brexit around the corner, it's hoped that the announcement will form part of a warm mood at Thursday's summit between Mr Macron and Mrs May in Berkshire. There is no doubt that it represents a hugely important cultural moment which will excite historians, not to mention school trip organisers. :: What is the Bayeux Tapestry? There have been British efforts stretching back to the 1950s to exhibit the tapestry in the UK. Most historians agree that it was made in England just under a thousand years ago and that it would be apt for it to return, for a time. Yet critics are already pointing out what they see as an irony. The argument goes that the priceless artefact represents, literally, a painful poke in the eye for the English. The intricate stitching stretching along its 70 metres is the story of the last continental military victory on what's now British soil. The Norman conquest, the Battle of Hastings - an arrow in the eye for England's King Harold, and a Norman, William the Conqueror, taking the English throne. More than 951 years later, France's present day ruler, who's gesture this loan is, has established himself as Europe's key figure. It has become President Macron's style to steal the initiative and the headlines with bold decisions, with catchy (even cocky) sound bytes, sometimes patronising and with subtle irony. ""Let's make our planet great again,"" he said, just after he was elected, tweaking Donald Trump's catchphrase to respond to the US president's decision to pull out of the Paris Climate accord. ""Europe is back and there is this willingness... for me to be the cornerstone for the rest of Europe,"" he told the Chinese last week, straight-faced. Yesterday, he had a punchy direct message for Theresa May: the migration problem in northern France is Britain's problem too. That, despite the millions the UK ploughs into border controls in France already. And today he's told the British that he will ""look with kindness"" on any British decisions to abandon Brexit. Some will see that as taking patronising pity on Britain. As Angela Merkel struggles to form a government, he's filled the vacuum she's vacated as Europe's de facto leader. But, as for the apparent Bayeux irony... well, the keeper of the tapestry, a Frenchman of course, told me it's not quite accurate. Far from being a humiliation for England, Antoine Vernier says, it was the beginning of an English empire. Normandy wasn't part of France in 1066. The joining of Normandy with England, with the coronation of King William, the Conquerer, represented the expansion of a kingdom. ""Sure, in the 11th century there is a conquest in England by a Norman. But in the first part of the 12th century, in fact, Normandy was included in the English kingdom,"" Antoine Vernier told me. ""It's the first time when England take its place in Europe politically on the continent."" he said. He omitted King Cnut's reign as Ruler of England, Norway and Denmark from 995 to 1035. Still, perhaps the message from Macron to May is this: we've been politically linked in one way or another for hundreds of years. Don't stray too far."
2018-01-17,Fiona Broadfoot was exploited by a physically abusive pimp from the age of 15 and trafficked from Yorkshire to London to sell sex.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180117202849/https://news.sky.com/story/abused-and-pimped-out-as-a-teen-so-why-i-am-the-one-with-a-criminal-record-11210483,"She has struggled against prejudice and been denied access to education because of her past. Now she is backing a court battle by ex-prostitutes - all exploited and trafficked as teenagers - to change the law over the retention, recording and disclosure of their convictions. Here she explains why: I had the misfortune to meet an older man when I was 15 and he introduced me to prostitution within two weeks of meeting me. He groomed me, he took control of me in a really powerful way and trafficked me to London from Bradford and put me on the streets. He threatened to kill me if I didn't comply with his demands. That day I lost my identity, I lost my self worth and ended entrenched in a violent world for 11 years. My criminal record is eight pages - double-sided - with prostitution convictions - and I was actually a juvenile when they first convicted me. I was with one pimp in Bradford but I escaped from him through an older woman and was placed in the hands of another pimp, who controlled me for five years. I'd become 'another', I'd invented this other being, kind of disassociated from Fiona. I had a lot of attitude, I was cocky. I'd been very well groomed by my pimp and I was told exactly what to say to the police. I repeated it word for word when I was finally arrested. The night I was arrested by the Leeds vice squad, in Chapeltown, my pimp was stood at the side of me and they said hello to him and referred to him on first name terms. The legislation is that the women and the girls have to report the pimp - but you're so well groomed you're convinced it's your boyfriend and that he loves you, and that he only hits you and beats you because you deserve it. It's very similar to domestic violence and the dynamics used. I went to the police station, and I believe they phoned my parents that night, and my parents didn't come. They sent a duty social worker and then they sent me back to my pimp's address knowing I was a vulnerable girl who was missing for 18 months. I appeared in a juvenile court and was remanded in a lock-up unit for girls for three months. Eventually I got away from my pimp and I did attempt to go to college, but they found about my record and I was frogmarched from the school that I was doing a placement at to learn childcare. I went back into prostitution. I was really so damaged. I worked in brothels - from one end of the country to the other - I worked in Bristol, I worked in Edinburgh... I was working at the time at a brothel in Doncaster, watching the local news. My cousin's face came on the news and she had been murdered by a sex buyer. I've never sold myself since that day. I've been at activist and campaigner for the past 21 years to stop other girls experiencing what I did. But that fact that I've got this criminal record - I'm gonna be 50 - you can hear how upsetting it is. I live with this catalogue of abuse, and it's horrendous. I was on the parents' and teachers' association at school and I had to be scrutinised by the head teacher. It's the ignorance of people, you know, that somehow women who have been entrenched in prostitution are deviant women. It couldn't be further from the truth. I couldn't access university - I wanted to be a social worker - the university told me that because I've got a criminal record I won't be able to get a placement, so I wouldn't be able to fulfil the needs to receive the degree. I'm reluctant to apply for jobs, I've only ever applied for jobs with people I know, because people who don't know me just see that (the criminal record). Since we launched the case last July I've had lots of women contact me privately, on Messenger, through social media, thanking me; they've lived a nightmare. I'm very outspoken, my family aren't very happy with me, my publicity. In my right mind I know I'm not dirty, I know I'm not disgusting. But it really it taps into the trauma that's very deeply rooted. It's the first day of the (court) hearing and to be honest I've got mixed feelings because whenever I go into a court I do get triggers; it triggers my experience of what happened. But this time I'm in there with pride, dignity, and I'm going to hold my head up high - for all the women, all the women - and the men. A really dear friend has travelled all the way from Yorkshire to hold my hand. I've had many barriers and still face judgement because of this catalogue of abuse that people do not understand. And without me explaining and going through the horror of what happened to me, I'm judged. It would be so freeing (to win the case); also a recognition we're not criminals, we're victims of abuse. I'm not troublesome, I'm not violent, not abusive, I've raised a beautiful son. I'm a decent member of society. Many of the women who I've supported are - years and years later - having to use sleeping tablets and various things to cope with the abuse. Some their families don't know, their husbands don't know, Their children don't know - because they're terrified of the judgement. I know of a woman who is looking at getting custody of her grandchild and social services have written in the report that 28 years ago she was arrested for soliciting - she was 16. It beggars belief, just beggars belief. There's a vested interest in keeping girls and women - or vulnerable boys - responsible for sexual violence and abuse. We can see what that's done to our society and how much that is covered up and supported perpetrators for donkey's years."

They will also march under a unified flag, according to a statement from Seoul's Unification Ministry. North Korea will send a 550-member delegation to the games, which includes 230 cheerleaders, 140 artists and 30 taekwondo players for a demonstration. They will begin arriving in South Korea on 25 January. Officials have also agreed that a 140-piece orchestra from North Korea will perform in the South during the Olympics. North and South Korea are still technically at war with each other, as the 1950-53 conflict between the two states ended in a truce, not peace. Representatives from both countries have been talking with each other since last week, after more than two years of silence. The move also follows heightened tensions over the North's missile tests, nuclear weapons programme and its regular threats to destroy its neighbours. Despite a slight thawing of tensions, Japan has warned that the world should not be naive about the North's ""charm offensive"". ""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" foreign minister Taro Kono said. ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working."" Reaction to news of a joint Olympic team has been mixed in North Korea, with some athletes not happy about competing with their neighbours. More than 100 petitions have been sent to South Korea's presidential Blue House website opposing a joint Olympics team. The most popular has more than 11,000 signatures, with one person writing: ""This isn't the same as gluing a broken plate together"". North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the relationship between the North and the South was ""going towards detente"". But it criticised Japan's leader for refusing to ease the pressure on Pyongyang without the latter taking steps towards de-nuclearisation. It said: ""The detente on the Korean peninsula is unfavourable for the (Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe group whose ultimate goal is to convert Japan into a war state. ""That is why they persist in their policy to stifle the DPRK (North Korea)."""

The trial concerns a fight that took place outside a Bristol nightclub in September, in which one man suffered a fractured eye socket. Stokes, 26, missed the Ashes after being suspended from playing for England, but was back up for England selection after an announcement by the England and Wales Cricket board on Wednesday. He was named in the International Cricket Council's test and one-day international teams of 2017 on Thursday. In a series of tweets following the decision he said he was ""delighted to be given the opportunity"" to play for England again. Representing my country is one of the greatest things that I've ever been lucky enough to do, walking out on to the field with the England shirt on is a privilege and a honour.Im extremely delighted to be given this opportunity to do this again....1/2 I can't wait to get back out on a pitch with the 3 Lions on my chest and feeling that pride that we all get and giving everything for the team 🏏🏏✌️✌️...2/2 Days earlier he wrote in another message on Twitter that he was ""keen to have an opportunity"" to clear his name, and had cooperated with the police.

2018-01-18,Researchers have discovered the cause of one of the most mysterious mass mortality events to occur in the modern animal world.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180118211053/https://news.sky.com/story/how-200000-antelope-suddenly-died-11212354,"The world's scientists were baffled in 2015 when 200,000 antelope suddenly dropped dead in Kazakhstan. More than 60% of the global population of saiga antelope died in just three weeks in May 2015, with entire herds mysteriously collapsing across the Betpak-Dala region of Kazakhstan. Saiga antelopes are already a critically endangered species, and despite being a cousin species to the springbok and gazelle, is on the cusp of extinction. Examinations of the dead antelope showed that their deaths had been caused by the Pasturella multocide bacteria, but this did not make sense because the bacteria normally lives quite harmlessly in the tonsils of antelopes. An international group of interdisciplinary research teams have been investigating the deaths and now believe that a number of separate factors - most of which were harmless on their own - combined to kill the saiga antelopes. The researchers believe that ultimately the unusual humidity in May and the high air temperatures in the days before the deaths allowed the tonsil bacteria to infect the animal's bloodstream, leading to septicaemia. The deaths also occurred in May, when the saiga antelopes have their young. Saiga has the largest calves of any ungulate species - an evolutionary necessity allowing their young to quickly run when stalked by wolves. This physiological stress may have also contributed to making the mothers vulnerable. Historical weather data revealed similar conditions at the time of two other mass mortality events, one in 1988 and another in 1981. First author on the research paper, published in Science Advances, Professor Richard Kock of the Royal Veterinary College, said: ""The 2015 mass mortality event provided the first opportunity for in-depth study, and a multidisciplinary approach has enabled great advances to be made. ""The use of data from vets, biologists, botanists, ecologists and laboratory scientists is helping improve our understanding of the risk factors leading to mass mortality event - which was beneficial when another mass mortality event occurred, this time in Mongolia in 2017. ""Improved knowledge of disease in saigas, in the context of climate change, livestock interactions and landscape changes, is vital to planning conservation measures for the species' long-term survival."""
2018-01-18,A Pakistani humanist has had his asylum claim rejected by the Home Office after failing to name Plato and Aristotle as humanist philosophers. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180118211053/https://news.sky.com/story/pakistani-humanist-denied-asylum-after-showing-insufficient-knowledge-of-plato-11212651,"Hamza bin Walyat, who fears persecution in Pakistan after converting from Islam, was asked questions about classical philosophy and the semantics of religion in an assessment that Humanists UK said demonstrated a ""profound and dangerous lack of understanding"" by the Home Office. In a summary seen by Sky News, authorities detail disagreements with Mr Walayat's account of humanism and reject his claim to hold the belief as not ""consistent or credible"". Reasons given for the refusal included that Mr Walayat ""incorrectly"" stated humanism evolved in the 17th Century, did not know about Greek philosophers and the Happy Human international symbol for humanism, and had not joined a humanist organisation until recently. It also criticised Mr Walayat for stating his religion was humanist ""despite knowing that this is not a religion"", after he said: ""I believe in humanity and humanists believe in humanity."" Humanists UK said Plato was not regarded as a humanist, and that the questioning was ""unfair"". Mr bin Walayat, who has lived in the UK since 2011, told Sky News he fears he will be killed in Pakistan, where blasphemy can be punishable by death. He said his interviewer was ""insulting"" and that, during one assessment, he felt he was suffering a panic attack but was not allowed a break. ""I thought, 'why are they asking me that?' I wasn't there to educate them. They are a big institution but they didn't understand the problem,"" he said. ""It made me feel horrible."" Mr bin Walayat is appealing the decision. Humanists UK said it was dealing with a number of other cases in which its members had been treated with similar questioning. ""The questions put to Hamza not only reveal a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of humanism, but also show that the Home Office, as a public body, is failing in its duty under the Equality Act 2010,"" said the organisation's chief executive, Andrew Copson. The Home Office said it was unable to comment on individual cases but that the caseworkers receive extensive training on asylum cases to do with religious issues. ""The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and each claim is carefully considered on its individual merits,"" a statement said."
2018-01-18,"Donald Trump's golfing hobby is perhaps no surprise given his company runs 12 courses in the US - but how does he compare with another keen golfer, former president Barack Obama?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180118211053/https://news.sky.com/story/is-donald-trump-playing-more-golf-as-president-than-barack-obama-11209409,"One site which claims to log the President's time on the greens is trumpgolfcount.com. It currently puts his golfing visits at 77 and says it registers every time ""there are pictures of Trump playing golf or wearing golf attire such as cleats or a golf glove, or whenever the White House confirms that the President 'might have hit a few balls'"". The site says that could be a conservative estimate because Mr Trump sometimes stays overnight at his house on the 600-acre Bedminster, New Jersey course, and journalists are not allowed access. The White House also rarely confirms if the President has played while visiting one of his courses. He may just be holding meetings. Press Secretary Sarah Hucakabee Sanders told reporters that her boss's time golfing with ""a number of senators"" had helped him push through his tax cut agenda. Mr Trump has visited one of his golf clubs 92 times since he started the job, according to another count by CNN at the start of January. The President is particularly partial to a round at his West Palm Beach course in Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago retreat, and at the Trump National in Washington DC. Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy have also played with the President - but the Northern Irish golfer was criticised on social media for taking up the offer. Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter So how does Barack Obama stack up in this inexact science of logging time on the greens? Bear in mind that before he was President, Mr Trump accused Mr Obama on many occasions of spending too much time with a club in his hand and neglecting his duties. In October 2014, he posted: ""Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter."" During his eight years in office, Mr Obama is said to have played more than 300 times and was less shy about being pictured on the course than Mr Trump. He was pictured buzzing around the course at Andrews Air Force Base with Bill Clinton in September 2011. His 333rd and final round as leader of the free world was apparently in Hawaii at the end of 2016, according to a tally by CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller. :: A year on: Has President Trump followed through on his promises? :: Trump's trouble in the polls: Approval rating 'lowest on record' The Washington Post's Philip Bump is also on the case, monitoring how much time Mr Trump spends away from the White House at properties owned by his company. Running until New Year's Eve 2017, he estimated the President had played golf on average once every 4.7 days, with Obama having played once every 8.8 days (over eight years). It appears therefore that Mr Trump is on course to surpass his predecessor's tally of games - if he stays in the job long enough."

Such cladding is believed to have fuelled the spread of the Grenfell blaze in June, which left 71 people dead. The Citiscape building was one of 228 across the country which failed safety tests brought in by the Government in the aftermath of the fire. :: Grenfell: Britain's safety crisis First Port Property Services, which manages the high-rise building, was advised in August that action should be taken. It has written to residents twice, informing them that the cost will likely be borne by them through service charges. In November residents were told that the cost was about £500,000, but this estimate skyrocketed to between £1.8 and £2m last week. First Port said in its latest letter: ""We know that this work and the costs are unwelcome. However, as your property manager, our first priority has to be your safety."" A total of 95 flats are affected, and each household's share could be between around £13,300 and £31,300. This needs to be paid in instalments from March. And the cost of retaining fire marshals, who have been in place since June and will need to stay until the work is completed, is expected to increase the costs by around £300,000 a year. A tribunal hearing is due to be held next month to rule on who should foot the bill. Steve Reed, the area's MP, raised concerns with Communities Secretary Sajid Javid last year, with the minister replying that he would urge landlords to ""not attempt to pass on costs to leaseholders"". Mr Javid added that all councils and housing associations that had been in discussions with the department were opting not to pass costs on, as were a number of private firms. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""We are clear we would like to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs. ""We are giving an extra £465,000 to LEASE, who provide free legal advice to leaseholders, so they can provide a dedicated advice and dispute resolution service for people in buildings that require additional fire safety measures."" Alexandra Blanc, 37, who bought her flat four years ago, said the situation had spiralled ""out of control"". ""I received a letter telling me I have to pay more than I earn in one year salary in six weeks for something I am not even responsible for,"" she said. ""I'm very worried about the prospect of losing my flat. I have contacted estate agents to try and sell it but they told me this flat will never sell under those circumstances. ""My equity has also become negative since this debacle."" A First Port Property Services spokesman said: ""We are working hard to ensure residents are safe and supported during what we know is a challenging time. ""We recognise that the potential costs are significant and are committed to minimising them, while putting residents' safety first. ""As the property manager, we are discharging our responsibilities under the leasehold agreements and working with residents as closely as possible to find a solution to this very complex situation."""

An inquest held in November 2015 ruled that the former teacher had died of ""acute alcohol intoxication"", with then Buckinghamshire coroner Richard Hulett concluding that his death was an accident. But Mr Field and Mr Smith have since been arrested on suspicion of the 69-year-old's murder, as well as that of another retired teacher who lived in the same street in Maids Moreton, near Buckinghamshire, as Mr Farquhar. Ann Moore-Martin, 83, died in May 2017 and an inquest into her death has not yet been held. Police have said the causes of both deaths are ""yet to be determined"" and arrested Mr Field and Mr Smith on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of conspiracy to murder, two counts of suspicion of fraud by false representation, conspiracy to defraud, and one count of burglary. The force has been granted a custody extension to interview the pair, who were both students at the University of Buckingham, where Mr Farquhar was a guest lecturer. They helped look after him in the months before his death, having persuaded him to publish his novels. They planned to make a documentary programme about him. Mr Field was also Mr Farquhar's lodger and the warden at the church where he was a lay preacher, Stowe Parish Church, which is a short drive from Maids Moreton. His former colleague at the university, Professor Stefan Hawlin, said he was saddened to hear about the police investigation. ""He was a charming, erudite and deeply thoughtful man, he was thoroughly learned in literature. He was very well thought of,"" he added. According to a Guardian obituary, Mr Farquhar published three novels and was a character in the 2013 football film Believe. His third novel, A Wide Wide Sea, contains a dedication to Mr Field and Mr Smith, which reads: ""This book is dedicated to MARTYN SMITH and BEN FIELD whose encouragement was invaluable and without whom this book would not exist."" Investigating officers have searched four properties in three locations across the country as part of the double-murder inquiry, with a third man having been released pending further investigation. The 22-year-old, from Milton Keynes, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud, conspiring to commit fraud by false representation, and fraud by false representation."
2018-01-18,Northern Ireland is gaining ground on Belgium's record of 589 days without an elected government in a democracy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180118211053/https://news.sky.com/story/367-days-without-a-government-so-whos-running-northern-ireland-11212634,"It is 367 days since the devolved administration at Stormont collapsed, leaving one corner of the UK without a ruling executive in place. With no ministers in office, senior civil servants have had to step in to keep the various departments of government - health, education, etc - ticking over. Unelected officials are making decisions daily on how hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money should be spent. But that is not without precedent. In 2010-11, Belgium spent a year and a half in political limbo, and Spain found itself in a similar position for 10 months in 2016. Germany has been unable to form a coalition since the election last September but outgoing ministers remain in place in the interim. One year and two days after the power-sharing government fell apart in Northern Ireland, the civil servants fear they will soon run out of cash. David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland civil service, has warned that public finances will reach ""crunch point"" if there is not an agreed budget. With no budget in place for the start of the new financial year in April, officials cannot make crucial decisions and public services are at breaking point. Karen Bradley, the new Northern Ireland Secretary, has announced a short, intense phase of talks in the hope she will not have to step in. If the parties - and the DUP and Sinn Fein, in particular - refuse to compromise, Westminster will be required to set a budget for Northern Ireland. Whatever spin the various players might put on that, it would amount to a return to direct rule for the first time in 10 years. That risks significant tension between the British and Irish governments at a time when they are already divided on how Brexit will affect the border. Repeated efforts to restore devolution and a series of broken deadlines over the last 12 months have drained credibility from the political process in Belfast. The failure to resume power-sharing and the Prime Minister's reluctance to cut politicians' salaries has provided local comedians with a wealth of satire. But those affected by the growing crisis in public services, particularly in health and education, stopped seeing the funny side of stalemate a long time ago."
2018-01-18,Emmanuel Macron has warned Theresa May the UK will have to pay into the EU's coffers in order to secure a Brexit trade deal on financial services.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180118211053/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-france-summit-emmanuel-macron-says-uk-must-pay-for-post-brexit-city-deal-11212766,"Speaking alongside the Prime Minister during his first visit to Britain since being elected, the French President insisted he was ""here neither to punish nor reward"" over Brexit. But Mr Macron appeared to stick to the stance of the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who has said a post-Brexit deal on financial services is unlikely, unless the UK pays into the Brussels budget and accepts the jurisdiction of EU judges. Outlining a choice for the UK, the French leader claimed Britain would have to opt for a relationship with the EU along the lines of that held by either Norway or Canada. Mr Macron spoke at a joint news conference with Mrs May following a UK-France summit at Sandhurst military academy, in which the two countries struck a new border treaty and deeper defence cooperation in agreements totalling 13 separate documents. As expected, France also offered to loan the historic Bayeux Tapestry to the UK in 2022. Asked why the EU had suggested the UK's dominant financial services sector would not be included in a post-Brexit trade deal, Mr Macron replied: ""I'm here neither to punish nor to reward. ""I want to make sure that the single market is preserved because that's very much the heart of the EU. ""So, the choice is on the British side, not on my side. There can be no differentiated access to the financial services. ""If you want access to the single market, including financial services, be my guest. ""But it means you need to contribute to the budget and acknowledge the European jurisdiction. ""Such are the rules. We know this is already a system in place for Norway."" Norway is not in the EU but enjoys full access to the single market in exchange for contributions to the bloc's budget and abiding by Brussels rules. By contrast, Canada does not have the same obligations as part of its trade deal with the EU, but the agreement includes little in the way of access for financial services and does not give Canadian firms an EU financial services ""passport"". In response to Mr Macron's comments, the Prime Minister - who has rejected the Norway/Canada choice - repeated her position that Britain would leave the EU's single market after Brexit. But she also expressed her belief a Brexit trade deal should ""cover both goods and services"". ""The City of London will continue to be a major global financial centre,"" Mrs May said. ""That is an advantage not just for the UK, it's actually good for Europe and good for the global financial system."" The Prime Minister also spelled out her wish for a ""good ongoing security relationship with the EU"" after Brexit, with all the intelligence chiefs of both France and Britain having met for the first time in history earlier on Thursday. Despite his tough talk on Brexit negotiations, Mr Macron claimed the UK and France were ""making a new tapestry together"" as the two national leaders announced a series of new cooperative measures. At the forefront is a new border treaty, which will see the UK commit £44.5m to enhanced security at Calais and other Channel ports. The processing of migrants looking to come to the UK via northern France will also be speeded up, with a reduced waiting time from six months to one month for adults and 25 days for children. The French President branded the current situation in Calais as ""not satisfactory"" and claimed the new deal would allow him to meet his promise that after Brexit ""migrants will no longer be in Calais"". He said: ""We can either manage the border together or it will be a disastrous situation. ""It is not a gift for France. It is some joint management."" Un nouveau traité, le traité de Sandhurst, permettra d’améliorer la coopération pour gérer notre frontière commune. #UKFRSummit pic.twitter.com/hIPFtotg7l Mrs May also denied the agreement, which - unlike the French President - she notably did not describe as a treaty, was a concession to Mr Macron's demand for more UK assistance at Calais. She insisted the agreement was in Britain's national interest and would ""make the UK's borders even more secure"". In exchange for three UK Chinook helicopters being sent to Africa's Sahel region to assist French counter-terror efforts, Mr Macron has pledged French troops to a UK-led NATO battlegroup in Estonia in the face of Russian aggression. The Prime Minister also confirmed that by 2020 up to 10,000 troops would be able to be deployed ""quickly and effectively"" in the face of any threat as part of the UK-France Combined Joint Expeditionary Force. As Europe's ""foremost military powers"", Mrs May said it was ""incumbent"" on Britain and France to ""demonstrate leadership"" in upholding international laws. Mrs May hailed the economic partnership between the two countries, with £71bn in UK-French trade, and outlined the creation of a new fund for student exchanges. The Prime Minister described herself as ""honoured"" at the loan of the Bayeux Tapestry, which will come to the UK for the first time in more than 900 years. She said it would form ""part of a wider cultural exchange"" between the UK and France. Mrs May and Mr Macron enjoyed a Michelin-starred lunch at a Berkshire pub earlier in the day, while the Prime Minister - speaking partly in French at a reception at London's V&A museum on Thursday night - paid tribute to the large number of French nationals living in the UK."

The ""text bomb"" code is so toxic for iPhones that devices which were sent a link to the code would also crash - even if they didn't actually click the link. Mr Masri has since unpublished the code, which has been called ChaiOS - a pun between the word ""chaos"" and iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. As Mr Masri's code has been removed from GitHub, a developers' website, people are no longer able to send malicious texts linking to it. ""I'm not going to re-upload it. I made my point. Apple needs to take such bugs more seriously.,"" he wrote. Apple did not immediately respond to Sky News' enquiries. No, I'm not going to re-upload it. I made my point. Apple needs to take such bugs more seriously. It is possible that the code could be replicated by someone else and used to turn off phones - but at the moment, interrupting a phone is the only negative effect that the bug has. The ""text bomb"" does not seem to be able to steal data or allow hackers to take control of others' iPhones. ChaiOS is similar to a similar bug called Effective Power back in 2015. That text bomb contained the word ""Power"" and caused the SpringBoard application - which manages the iOS home screen - to crash."

Nottingham Prison was inspected on 8 January - the third inspection in a little over three years. Between the 2016 and 2018 inspections, levels of self-harm had risen ""very significantly"" and eight prisoners were believed to have taken their own lives. Only two of 13 ""crucial"" recommendations on safety made in 2016 were fully achieved. There were high levels of drugs, violence and assaults, HM Inspectorate of Prisons said. Mr Clarke said in a letter to Mr Gauke: ""It appears that the problems at Nottingham are intractable and that staff there are unable to improve safety despite the fact that this failing increases the vulnerability both of those who are held in the prison and of those who work there."" Under the new urgent notification process introduced in November, the chief inspector can inform the secretary of state of any urgent and severe prison problems found during an inspection. Mr Gauke then has 28 days to report on the measures he has taken to resolve the issues. ""Inspection findings at HMP Nottingham tell a story of dramatic decline since 2010,"" Mr Clarke said. ""The principal reason I have decided to issue an urgent notification... is because for the third time in a row HMI Prisons has found the prison to be fundamentally unsafe. ""Irrefutable evidence of the failure to respond to HMI Prisons' inspection findings at Nottingham can be seen not only in the gradings given as a result of the latest inspection, but also in the progress made in implementing previous recommendations,"" he added. HMP Nottingham is a Category B prison, with a capacity of 1,060."

The report was compiled before the collapse of Carillion, but its release as the contractor goes into liquidation will fuel the arguments against the controversial PFI scheme, in which private companies tender for money for public projects like schools and hospitals. Although the report from the NAO did not draw conclusions on the merits of the scheme, it said that PFI often ""results in additional costs compared to publicly financed procurement"". The government's National Infrastructure Plan suggested that money raised through PFI in 2010 cost between 2% to 3.75% more than from state borrowing. The report adds: ""Small changes to the cost of capital can have a significant impact on costs. ""Paying off a debt of £100 million over 30 years with interest of 2% costs £34 million in interest. At 4% this more than doubles to £73 million."" Some of the examples highlighted by the report include: The report has not been able to assess whether the higher costs were offset by better quality facilities or reduced risk to the taxpayer. But, the chair of the influential House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said there was little evidence the PFI scheme was beneficial. She said: ""Many local bodies are now shackled to inflexible PFI contracts that are exorbitantly expensive to change. ""I am concerned that the Treasury has relaunched PFI under new branding, without doing anything about most of its underlying problems. ""We need more investment in our schools and hospitals but if we get the contracts wrong, taxpayers pay the price."" Carillion's liquidation has hit 900 schools in Britain and will affect 1400 apprentices across the country. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""These corporations need to be shown the door. We need our public services provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight."" A Government spokesman said: ""Many vital infrastructure projects like roads, schools and hospitals are paid for by PFI and PF2, stimulating our economy, creating jobs and delivering better public services. ""We have reformed how we manage PFI contracts, and through PF2 have created a model which improves transparency and offers better value for money. ""Taxpayer money is protected through PFI and PF2 as the risks of construction and long-term maintenance of a project are transferred to the private sector."""
2018-01-18,"Pressure on NHS hospitals in England eased slightly in the last week, with fewer patients facing long delays in ambulances, but bed occupancy remains well above recommended safe limits.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180118211053/https://news.sky.com/story/hospital-bed-occupancy-rate-drops-slightly-nhs-england-figures-show-11212014,"In Wales, the latest monthly data reveals hospitals saw record attendances at A&E in December, and the greatest-ever number of calls to the ambulance service. The latest weekly situation reports for NHS England, recording data for the week to Sunday January 14, show that 94.9% of beds are occupied, down marginally from 95% the previous week. A figure of 85% is considered safe. One in eight patients continue to experience ambulance handover delays, where vehicles wait more than the target of 30 minutes to pass patients on and prepare for the next call, though the number fell. There were 12,600 delays of more than 30 minutes, down more than 4,000 from 16,700 the previous week. There was also a fall in ambulance diverts, where busy hospitals send patients elsewhere, down from 32 to six. A spokesperson for NHS England said raised levels of flu and norovirus continue to put pressure on busy A&Es and other front line services. ""Today's figures show pressures abating somewhat compared to the prior week, and with hospitals generally continuing to cope,"" the spokesperson said. Monthly statistics for Wales showed a 10% jump in the number of calls to the ambulance service on the previous month, with an average of 1,450 a day. A&E attendances in December 2017 were 5% up on the same month in 2016, but down marginally on November 2017. The Welsh figures come as a number of A&E consultants in Wales have written to the First Minister, who has responsibility for the NHS in the Principality, to say patient safety is being compromised to ""an unacceptable degree"". The figures show 78.9% of patients were seen and treated, admitted or discharged within four hours, well short of the 95% target and 1.5% down on the previous year. In December 3,741 patients spent 12 hours or more in an emergency care facility, an increase of 769 patients compared to the same month in 2016. Labour said its analysis of the latest data shows more than 100,000 patients have been stuck in ambulances over the winter, with nearly 25,000 waiting more than an hour. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures expose an ""uncomfortable reality"" for patients and the ambulance waits were ""unacceptable"". NHS Providers, which represents hospital and ambulance trusts, said the statistics demonstrate that conditions continue to be ""extremely challenging"". Director of policy and strategy Saffron Cordery said: ""Although we saw a very slight easing of pressures last week, NHS trusts are still working at or beyond full stretch, resulting - at times - in care for patients that falls short of what trusts and their staff want to provide. ""Having said that, it is encouraging to see how NHS trusts have worked to recover the situation, with far fewer ambulance diverts and a significant drop in delays to hand over patients when they arrive at A&E. ""However bed occupancy rates are still almost 10% higher than the recommended safe level of 85%, and it is worrying to see the figure for adult critical care beds at the highest level so far this winter. ""The impact of flu and cold weather remains a serious concern. The worst of winter may be yet to come."""

Local schools were placed on lockdown following his escape and police urged the public not to approach him. The 12-year-old animal was finally encouraged back into his trailer after around five hours on the loose before being taken back to his home. He escaped from the Conversation Trust sanctuary in Beenham, near Reading, early this morning after heavy winds blew down a fence in his enclosure. Sanctuary founder, Teresa Palmer, 62, who helped lure him back, said: ""The fact he went through a field of sheep on his way shows he would never be a threat to the public."" On hearing of his capture, wildlife film maker and presenter Anneka Svenska, who helped to raise Torak, said he ""is gentle and timid and would never have been a threat"". She also said security at the trust was ""exceptional"", adding ""they must not be blamed for bad weather"". Police confirmed that Torak - who is one of the sanctuary's largest wolves and described by his keepers as a ""gentle giant"" - was captured unharmed by officers and sanctuary staff.

Sian Champkin, whose husband works at Elstree Independent Boys' Preparatory School in nearby Woolhampton, said he had called her to warn her not to go outside. The 37-year-old, who lives about a mile from the sanctuary, said: ""I was slightly shocked, nothing like this has ever happened before."" On hearing that the wolf was on the loose, local Beenham Primary School tweeted: ""We love having the wolf sanctuary as neighbours and hope this beautiful creature is returned safely soon.""

The couple had got married in a civil ceremony in 2010 but were unable to follow it up with a church service because of the earthquake that hit the country that year. Mr Elorriaga told journalists that Francis told him that no pope had ever married a couple on board a plane. He said: ""We told him that we are husband and wife. That we are married. That we have two daughters and that we would have loved to receive his blessing. ""All of a sudden he asked us if we were married by the church too. We are not married by the church because the 2010 earthquake happened on the day we got married. ""He liked us and he asked 'Do you want me to marry you?' ""He took our hands and he asked if there was love in our marriage and if we want to keep on being together for life. He asked if wanted to stay together until the end. We said 'Yes'. ""We laughed for a while. It was very moving. He blessed us. He married us. It was a huge emotion, we are very, very happy."" The couple met while working on a flight 10 years ago. The witness to the marriage was the chairman of the airline LATAM, Don Ignacio Cueto. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said: ""Something totally extraordinary happened today, which was that the hostesses and the stewards going to get their photos taken and one said: 'We are a couple, we met on a plane.' ""And as they walked back they said that the Pope married them in a religious ceremony, which obviously has never happened on a papal plane before. ""They were super happy.

The 54-year-old revealed on Monday he had ended a one-month relationship with model Jo Marney. In a leaked exchange of messages with a friend, Ms Marney branded Ms Markle a ""dumb little commoner"" that would ""taint"" the royal family with her ""seed"" to pave the way for a ""black king"". The 25-year-old also said Ms Markle had a ""tiny brain"" and that black people were ugly. The revelation sparked fury among some senior UKIP figures, with accusations of ""racism"" and calls for Mr Bolton to resign. He faces a potential no confidence vote at a crunch meeting of the party's ruling National Executive Committee on Sunday. Mr Bolton told the Daily Telegraph at least four MEPs and two NEC members wanted him gone. But asked if he would rule out getting back with Ms Marney, Mr Bolton told the newspaper: ""I don't rule it out, not at all."" He added that he ""hadn't been as happy for many years"" as he was during the romance with Ms Marney. The former Army officer also claimed his experience in the military could not have prepared him for the top position. He said: ""I have seen people die, I have seen people blown up, I have seen people shot. Even the Taliban doesn't quite prepare you for UKIP though."" Mr Bolton, who left his wife just before Christmas, was spotted having dinner with Ms Marney on Wednesday night. One party spokesperson, MEP Bill Etheridge, has already quit in protest at Mr Bolton's leadership. ""He's a political lightweight, completely out of his depth and, frankly, he needs to move away,"" he said. Ms Marney has been suspended from the party but Mr Bolton refuses to stand down. He told Sky News on Monday: ""We can't afford a leadership change at the moment."""

He is alleged to have enlisted the help of labourer Vincent Tappu to kidnap the 20-year-old and another young woman by bundling them into the boot of his pick-up truck in July last year. They were said to have been bound and gagged as he drove them to a southwest London home he was renovating, and upon arrival they were raped and had their throats cut. While the other woman - who cannot legally be identified - was able to escape after tricking her attacker into believing they could be together, the body of Ms Dookhran was stuffed into a chest-high freezer at the empty property between Wimbledon and Kingston. When Arshid's wife demanded to know where their niece was on WhatsApp, Arshid initially told her: ""How do I know. She's the one that ran off."" She replied: ""You would stoop that low. You're the p***y."" Arshid then said: ""Whatever I may be, you made me. I'll call you from Pakistan."" But when his wife told him not to and that he was ""dead to me"", he retorted: ""So is Celine apparently."" The message exchange was read out by prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC as he outlined the case against Arshid, who was arrested after being traced by police to a Holiday Inn in Folkestone. The surviving woman had earlier been able to provide officers with information to lead them to the house where the attack had taken place, telling them from her bed at St George's Hospital in Tooting: ""Please go to the address and get (Ms Dookhran) out of the freezer."" She also expressed fear the defendant might kill others he came across, the court heard. Ms Dookhran's cold body was found covered in a dust sheet with ""several toes poking out from underneath"" after officers forced the freezer open with a crowbar. They seized the keys to the padlock from Arshid when they arrested him. When he was formally charged by police, Arshid told them to ""look at the evidence and keep an open mind"". Tappu, 28, was also arrested and denied any knowledge of the alleged attacks. He allegedly told officers: ""You lot are completely wrong, I don't know what's happened."" Mr Aylett told jurors that Tappu went on to tell police a ""pack of lies"" about his dealings with Arshid on the day of the kidnapping, with both men denying the charges against them. Arshid, of no fixed address, is accused of murder, attempted murder, rape of both women and a previous sexual assault, and assault by penetration of the surviving woman when she was about 13. Tappu, of Spencer Road, Acton, west London, is jointly charged with Arshid of both women's kidnap and false imprisonment, and possession of a firearm with intent."

The research, carried out using information from 375,000 households since 1957, showed weekly expenditure at £554.20. It represented a rise of £21.20 - or 4% - on the previous financial year, the ONS said, and was mainly driven by a surge in spending on transport costs - up £5.40 per week on average when adjusted for inflation. The period covers only the start of the surge in living costs witnessed since early last year as Brexit-linked inflation began to outstrip wage growth - damaging spending power. Nevertheless, the Resolution Foundation think tank said the ONS figures showed families were living beyond their means given that wages grew by 2.3% over the period on average. The ONS said all transport categories - public transport, vehicle ownership and vehicle maintenance - contributed to the average weekly spend of £79.70 per household on travel. The study pointed to the greatest contributions coming from the sale of cars as both new and second-hand sales hit record levels in the 2016-17 period. There were four points highlighted by the ONS, comparing family priorities and spending habits with those in 1957. In addition to the leap in expenditure on housing costs - not covering the price of a property but net rents and outgoings such as maintenance - it said the proportion of total spending on food had halved - from 33% to 16% - during the period. It said the percentage of spending on clothing had also halved to 5%. The ONS said those falls may be attributable to improved choice and competition and the fact the number of people per household is now, on average, lower. Two interesting social comparisons showed that spending on tobacco accounted for 6% of weekly expenditure 60 years ago - now down to an average 1%. It said the figure for alcohol was the same, at 3%, despite fluctuations over the study's lifetime."

Business Secretary Greg Clark said it was ""fantastic news"" for Airbus and its 15,000-strong UK workforce. The Toulouse-based company assembles wings for all its commercial aircraft at a plant in Broughton, north Wales, where 6,000 people are employed. Trade union Unite said the deal secured jobs there. Airbus also has a key design and engineering unit for aircraft in Filton, Bristol, where 4,000 people work. The announcement propelled shares in the company to a record high. Airbus said Emirates had placed a provisional order for 20 of the double-decker superjumbos, and an option for 16 more, with deliveries due to start in 2020. The $16bn total value reflects the list price of the transaction, something which is often lowered during negotiations over large orders. It is a lifeline for the slow-selling superjumbo, which has been in service for just 10 years, and ends months of tough talks. Negotiations between Airbus and Emirates had broken down at the last minute at the Dubai Airshow in November, when the Middle East carrier placed an order for 40 smaller 787 aircraft made by Airbus's US rival Boeing. Earlier this week, Airbus confirmed that securing the deal was critical for the A380. Announcing the agreement on Thursday, sales chief John Leahy said: ""This new order underscores Airbus' commitment to produce the A380 for at least another 10 years. ""I'm personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates' example and that this great aircraft will be built well into the 2030s."" Mr Clark said: ""This is fantastic news for Airbus, its 15,000 highly skilled UK workforce, the supply chain and our economy. ""The A380 is an iconic aircraft and today's deal underlines Airbus's commitment to its production over the long term."" Emirates is by far the largest operator of the 544-seat superjumbo, with 101 currently in service and a backlog of 41 already on order before the latest announcement.

The father-of-two was found to have Class A drugs in his system and severe injuries consistent with sexual assault. The bid by his father Terry, 73, to take the case to the High Court was declined by Attorney General Jeremy Wright on the grounds there was no new evidence likely to overturn the original court findings, with a 2002 inquest into the death having delivered an open verdict. Mr Lubbock, of Harlow, Essex, only found out after being phoned for his reaction to the decision by a journalist. ""You would think they would have had the decency to phone me and tell me,"" he said. ""I was thinking about dropping it anyway because it's taken 17 years of my life - look where I've ended up. ""I've had it going through my head for 17 years - it won't be easy to put it to rest but I have got to try. ""I'm totally and utterly dismayed by the police and justice system. I'm gutted, I really am. Seventeen years of my life and I've ended up in a care home. ""As far as I'm concerned it is the end. If anybody out there can do anything to keep it going I would welcome that."" Offering his ""deepest sympathy"" to Mr Lubbock's family, Mr Wright said: ""It would not be right to pass this matter to the High Court when the tests for a new inquest are not met."" Barrymore, 65, won a High Court compensation battle with Essex Police following his wrongful arrest on suspicion of rape and murder in 2007. The Strike It Lucky host says his career was destroyed by the arrest and is now waiting to hear how much money he will receive in damages. Barymore's legal team are pushing for a substantial payment estimated at around £2.5m."

The purpose of their visit was to celebrate Welsh culture and tradition - and where better to do that than at Cardiff Castle, which is 2,000 years old. Incidentally, the name Meghan even has Welsh origins. People queued from 6.30am to secure their positions. Among the crowd was Anne Daley, who regularly turns out to Royal events. She took along the family dog, Camilla, a King Charles Spaniel who too was dressed for the occasion in a veil and tiara. :: Recap: Meghan 'so excited' on Wales trip with Harry Ms Daley told Sky News: ""It was wonderful, wonderful…Meghan had a quick chat with the dog. We are frozen to the bone now. We have been here since seven. I told Meghan if she wants to go on a hen do, we could take her around Cardiff because we've got the most wonderful nightclubs."" As Meghan and Harry wooed the crowds separately, a group of teenagers watched on, discussing how beautiful the former Suits star is in the flesh. Dressed in a navy blue coat by British designer Stella McCartney, paired with denim trousers made by the Welsh brand Hiut, Ms Markle shook hands with members of the public and thanked them for coming. Onlookers also noticed that she was sporting different earrings on each ear. Cynthia Osbourne, who was dressed in a traditional Welsh hat, said: ""She showed me her ring. I said it sparkled like her. She thanked me. She was very nice. I gave her a flag to give to Harry and said he should wave it next time Wales play England in the rugby."" Inside the castle, the Royal couple listened to Welsh music and poetry. Children were very much a part of the day's events, with two youngsters called Megan and Harry getting to meet their namesakes. Megan Taylor, nine, from Marlborough Primary School, said: ""At first I was really nervous but then I got really excited…she was really nice and kind. She asked what school we went to and asked if my name was really Megan. She said I had freckles like her."" Among the crowd were people from as far afield as the United States, New Zealand and Australia - with one Australian couple saying they would be sharing their wedding day with Meghan and Harry. The Royal couple had been an hour late arriving at the castle because their train was delayed, and they stayed for two hours. For the crowds watching on it was a far longer day in freezing temperatures, but one that many felt was worth the wait."

Seventeen wild birds tested positive for bird flu in Dorset last week, bringing the total number of infected birds at that site to 31. Officials from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) set up a local prevention zone in the area on 12 January. This has now been extended to cover all of England as a precaution until further notice as the disease is no longer restricted to a single site. Tests on the birds found in Warwickshire are continuing, but DEFRA said the animals are ""highly"" likely to have been infected with the H5N6 strain of the virus which has been circulating across Europe. It is a different variant of H5N6 from the one which affected people in China last year. There are currently no plans to carry out any culls or put movement restrictions in place. Public Health England said the risk to public health remains ""very low"" and the Food Standards Agency said there is no food safety risk. Mr Gibben said: ""Following the latest finding of bird flu in wild birds in Warwickshire, we are extending our action to help prevent the virus spreading to poultry and other domestic birds. ""Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to meet enhanced biosecurity requirements and this is in your interests to do, to protect your birds from this highly infectious virus."" Under the terms of the prevention zone, bird keepers must: :: Ensure areas where birds are kept are unattractive to wild birds, for instance by using netting ponds and by removing wild bird food sources:: Feed and water their birds in enclosed areas to discourage wild birds:: Minimise movement in and out of enclosures:: Clean and disinfect footwear and keep areas where birds live clean and tidy:: Reduce any existing contamination by cleansing and disinfecting concrete areas, and fencing off wet or boggy areas. Keepers who have more than 500 birds will also have to take extra biosecurity measures, including restricting access to non-essential people, changing clothing and footwear before entering enclosures and cleaning and disinfecting vehicles. Poultry keepers and the public can report dead wild birds to the DEFRA helpline (03459 33 55 77) and keepers should report suspicion of disease to Animal and Plant Health Agency on 03000 200 301."

Naturally, those who think leaving the EU is a bad idea have a vested interest in peddling the notion that we are exiting just as those clever continentals are getting their act together and we are falling apart. The coverage of Emmanuel Macron and his offer of the Bayeux Tapestry is a good case in point. :: Macron and May to forge future Anglo-French relations To some it is what it seems, a French President making a gesture to smooth over potentially tricky tensions after Brexit. However, others are reading an awful lot more into it, revealing more perhaps about them than the French leader. For them it is a thinly veiled jab at the Brits, a reminder of a French military triumph over us and of the first time Britain was joined politically with the continent. If that really was President Macron’s thinking, he might have spent more time studying history at school than chasing his literature teacher. :: France's Bayeux Tapestry loan: Entente cordiale or poke in the eye? Excuse the history lesson, but the Battle of Hastings was not a French victory since the Normans were not French. They were - as their names suggests - Norsemen who had conquered and settled in Normandy, where they made life a merry hell for their French neighbours. Only 12 years before the Battle of Hastings for instance, William of Normandy had given the French king and his army a thorough thrashing at the Battle of Mortemer, from which the French never really recovered. In fact the Bayeux Tapestry commemorates the defeat of the French, not the English, or the start of it at least. Four centuries of on and off bloody, military humiliation. :: Government to increase Calais border spend during UK-France summit That is because it marks the moment Norman military technology merged with the wealth and manpower of Anglo-Saxon England. Throw in some Welsh longbowmen and you end up with the crushing French defeats at Agincourt, Crecy and Poitiers. President Macron probably just meant well when he said we could borrow the tapestry for a while, but the immediate assumptions by commentators of British incompetence in the face of masterful French diplomacy are revealing. So is our coverage of Macron’s recent gift of a horse to his Chinese hosts on a visit to Beijing. In the British press this has been universally praised as yet more brilliant Macronian statecraft. Not so much in France. Commentators there have noted that in history, horses were given to all powerful Chinese emperors by vassal states in a sign of deference. They have worried about the message this may have sent to China. Others in France have pointed out Macron’s name in Chinese means ""horse vanquishes dragon"" and feared his hosts would see the gift as a veiled insult. Questioning our leaders’ competence is after all not the exclusive preserve of the British. But enjoying the spectacle of them being shown up by foreigners can lead to some dodgy conclusions and should not be encouraged."

The post, obtained by The Times, read: ""We need to come down hard on these morons before somebody gets killed! ""If we have any sense as a nation we'll stay home tonight and make it easy for the police to find the ones hanging around town centres with their faces covered. ""For once I think police brutality should be encouraged!"" David Cameron, who was prime minister at the time of the riots, had called for ""more robust police action"" as pockets of violence sprang out in London and other major cities. Mr Bradley has already faced criticism for a 2011 post calling for vasectomies for unemployed people. And he wrote another blog entitled: ""Public sector workers: they don't know they're born!"" The Mansfield MP, who was elected in June last year, has apologised for the posts. ""I wrote a number of blog posts when I was in my early 20s and I accept some of the language I used was inappropriate and I apologise for that,"" he said. ""They were written at a different time of my life - getting married, becoming a father and now being an MP have changed my outlook."" Downing Street has defended Mr Bradley, with the Prime Minister's spokesman saying on Wednesday: ""He was 22 at the time he made them and he believes his career in politics since has demonstrated why those views are wrong."" The spokesman added that Theresa May did not know about the blog posts before she promoted the MP, and that he would keep his job."

He died at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after being unwell for a couple of months. Wyngarde found fame starring as handlebar moustache-wearing King in the 1969-70 espionage series Department S, about an elite group within Interpol. He had signed his contract on a napkin in a restaurant. When the show ended after two series, his suave character was spun off into an action series called Jason King, which ran for one season. As King, his dandy style of clothing was cited by actor Mike Myers as an inspiration for probably his most famous incarnation, special agent Austin Powers. The character of King, who wore wide-lapelled three-piece suits and folded his shirt cuffs over his jacket sleeves, has been cited as one of the most stylish men ever on TV. Wyngarde even beat singer Cliff Richard and football star George Best to a Britain's best-dressed man award in the 1970s. From wartime internment alongside JG Ballard to Klytus.

In 1975, Wyngarde was arrested and convicted for an act of ""gross indecency"" in the toilets of a bus station. Although he was billed as ""ladies' man"" King, Wyngarde's homosexuality was well known in acting circles, where he had the nickname 'Petunia Winegum'. Later in his career, he played General Klytus in the 1980 film Flash Gordon, where he was commander of Ming the Merciless's secret police force, and as Timanov in Doctor Who: Planet Of Fire in 1984. Writer and actor Mark Gatiss paid tribute on Twitter, saying: ""From wartime internment alongside JG Ballard to Klytus. With No.2, Baron Gruner, Professor Norman Taylor, Peter Quint and Gloucester bus station in between. What a life. What a legend. Jason King is dead. Long live Jason King! #peterwyngarde."" Singer Holly Johnson, of Frankie Goes To Hollywood, said: ""Goodbye Petunia Winegum #rip #jasonking."" Wyngarde's agent and manager, Thomas Bowington, said: ""He was one of the most unique, original and creative actors that I have ever seen. As a man, there were few things in life he didn't know. ""I sometimes nicknamed him 'the King' because he simply knew everything. He was a mentor on everything you can think of, from sports cars to how to make a good cup of tea and how to do a tie and shirt. ""He died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital (in London), and even then he was saying that you shouldn't button the upper button on a shirt.

However, the case has now been dropped after fresh evidence, including a diary that supported his case, was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service last week. Surrey Police has admitted ""there were flaws in the investigation"" after the force failed to examine the woman's ""digital media"" or follow ""a reasonable line of enquiry"". The woman's digital media was only handed to prosecutors on Monday. Prosecutor Sarah Lindop told Guildford Crown Court on Friday that the case was ""finely balanced"" from the start and the new material ""tips the balance"" in favour of Mr Mears. Judge Jonathan Black demanded the head of the CPS rape and sexual offences unit write to him within 28 days ""with a full explanation of what went wrong"" before he decides whether any action is required ""at CPS or police level"". ""It seems to me in a case which is as finely balanced as you say it was, there have been unnecessary delays in investigating... leading to what seems to be a completely unnecessary last-minute decision in this case,"" he said. The judge said that both Mr Mears and the complainant would not have had the ""matter hanging over their heads for two years"" if ""the investigation had been carried out properly in the first instance"". :: Student after rape trial thrown out: ""I've spent two years living in fear"" Ms Lindop admitted there were ""some disclosure matters"" in Mr Mears's case, but said it ""is not a disclosure case per se"".

The court heard Mr Mears's lawyers asked to see the full diary in October last year and the prosecutor explained: ""The police have been trying to secure that."" Surrey Police said the case was dropped for ""a number of reasons"", only one of which related to the force. ""On January 5 2018, the CPS requested that we provide materials from the victim's digital media,"" a spokesman for the force said. ""We then contacted the victim, obtained the devices and provided the available material to the CPS on January 15. ""Surrey Police deeply regrets mistakes made in the efficacy of investigations and will always seek to implement continual improvement and specific learning points. "" The force has launched a joint review of the case with the CPS. A CPS spokesman said that following a review of the case, ""prosecutors were not satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction"". It comes after Scotland Yard announced a review of every one of its sex crime investigations, where a suspect has been charged, following the collapse of two rape prosecutions in a week. The CPS offered no evidence against both Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary after the late disclosure of evidence that could have assisted the defendants."
2018-01-19,"Retail sales fell more sharply than expected in the core Christmas month, capping the worst December performance for volumes since 2010.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180119221238/https://news.sky.com/story/retailers-suffer-worst-december-since-2010-11213126,"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) issued the grim update on the health of the high street just hours after Carpetright became the latest big name chain to announce a profit warning. However, many analysts said the decline in sales reflected shifting consumer habits rather than the squeeze on living standards from higher inflation and weak wage growth. The retail figures showed sales volumes fell 1.5% on November, which was boosted by strong Black Friday trade. December's result marked the biggest month-on-month fall since June 2016 - the month when the UK was focused on the Brexit vote on 23 June. The Leave win prompted a collapse in the value of the pound, resulting in a leap in shop prices during 2017 as a whole as stores passed on higher import costs. Higher inflation, coupled with earnings failing to keep pace, has been a thorn in the side of the retail sector as the squeeze on shoppers' budgets has dented demand for non-essential goods. The ONS said 2017 was the weakest year for retail since 2013 but it still recorded year-on-year growth of 1.3% and a rise of 1% over the final quarter of the year. The pound hit a new post-Brexit vote high of $1.3945 just after the data was released before falling back towards $1.39 moments later as all the information was digested. :: How the major retailers have fared over Christmas Senior ONS statistician, Rhian Murphy, said: ""Retail sales continued to grow in the last three months of the year partly due to Black Friday deals boosting spending. ""Consumers continue to move Christmas purchases earlier with higher spending in November and lower spending in December than seen in previous years."" But Ian Gilmartin, head of retail & wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said: ""Although it might look like a negative result for the retail sector at first glance, December's retail data needs to be considered more carefully. ""A month-on-month dip and year-on-year rise appears difficult to assess, but the truth is that these kinds of comparisons are increasingly dangerous for retail analysts trying to untangle performance over the Christmas period. ""The pattern of trading is shifting, with variables including the evolving influence of Black Friday, timing of wider price cuts and importance of online trading disrupting traditional sales patterns. ""As today's data shows, purchases have been pulled forward to November which has had a knock-on effect on December's figures. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The squeeze on consumers remains appreciable at the start of 2018, but it should progressively ease as the year progresses due to inflation falling back significantly and pay gradually picking up."""

A packet of Digestives will be shrunk by 20%, from 500g (17oz) to 400g (14oz), equivalent to removing seven biscuits from a pack of 34. It follows a similar change by McVitie's in the number of Jaffa Cakes, from 12 to 10. The company said more than 10% of its 700 products - which include HobNobs - would also be shrunk down. McVitie's was unable to provide Sky News with a full list of these products when asked. Toblerone maker Mondelez cut the size of its chocolate bars in 2016, leaving fans ""distressed"" and prompting others to urge boycott. The change to products as an indirect result of the EU referendum has drawn comments from campaigners. Francis Grove-White, the deputy director of the Open Britain campaign, said: ""No wonder the latest polling shows support for hard Brexit is crumbling. The everyday consequences of the post-Brexit fall on the value of the pound are difficult to digest.

They were arrested on Sunday after their 17-year-old daughter escaped from their home in Perris, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles, and called police. The girl was one of 13 siblings, aged between two and 29, who had been starved and held captive at their family home. In a news conference on Thursday, district attorney Mike Hestrin revealed more information about the charges filed against the parents, along with harrowing details of the alleged abuse. The couple were charged with torture, child abuse, dependent adult abuse and false imprisonment. David Turpin was also charged with performing a lewd act on a child under the age of 14. They could each face 94 years in jail if found guilty. :: A happy family? Photos of chained siblings When asked to elaborate on the lewd act charge, Mr Hestrin said: ""We are alleging that David Turpin touched one of the victims in a lewd way by using force or fear."" He added that it was against a female child under 14. Mr Hestrin said there had been no torture charge filed in relation to the two-year-old because the toddler appeared to be ""getting enough food"". The district attorney also gave details of the alleged torture, calling it ""severe, emotional, physical abuse"". ""The victims said as a punishment they would be tied up with ropes but when they were able to escape, their parents began using chains and padlocks,"" he said. :: Captive siblings: Police reveal how girl escaped He added there was also ""frequent beatings"" and ""strangulation"", and reasons for punishment included washing their hands above the wrist area. ""They were accused of playing in the water and they would be chained up,"" he said, adding that none of the victims were allowed to shower more than once a year. He said none of the victims had seen a doctor in more than four years, and none of them had ever seen a dentist. The parents would buy food, including apple pies and pumpkin pies, and would put them on the counter for the children to see but would not let them eat any. When they were not chained up, they were kept in separate rooms and fed very little and on a schedule. The only thing the children were allowed to do was write in their journals, Mr Hestrin said. Police said they recovered hundreds of journals and are going through them for evidence. Mr Hestrin said the victims lacked a basic knowledge of life. Many of the children did not know what a police officer was, he said. When the 17-year-old was asked if there was medication or pills in the home, she did not know what medication or pills were. However, at least one of the older victims attended college classes, Mr Hestrin said, but his mother would accompany him, wait outside the classroom and when he was finished she would take him home. The parents are due to appear in court on 23 February."

The claims were made by Fusion GPS boss Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the investigative firm behind the controversial ""Trump dossier"" which was released by former British spy Christopher Steele. The unsubstantiated dossier was put together during the election campaign and was partially funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democrats. It was also given to the FBI. It claimed there was collusion between Mr Trump's presidential campaign and Russia before he entered the White House, and that the Russians have information that could be used to blackmail the President - claims he fiercely denies. However, during his appearance before the committee in November, Mr Simpson said his interest in the Trump campaign's links to UKIP and WikiLeaks were separate from ex-MI6 inteligence officer Mr Steele's investigations. According to a transcript of Mr Simpson's testimony released by the House Intelligence Committee, he claimed WikiLeaks was part of a ""somewhat unacknowledged relationship"" between the Trump team and the ""UKIP people"". He said that Mr Farage became ""someone that we were very interested in"" after the EU referendum vote in June 2016. ""I still think it's very interesting,"" he said. ""And so I have formed my own opinions... that there was a somewhat unacknowledged relationship between the Trump people and the UKIP people and that the path to WikiLeaks ran through that. And I still think that today."" Mr Simpson said while there had been reports of one visit Mr Farage made to the Ecuadorian embassy - where Mr Assange has been living since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden - he believed the pair had met more often than is widely known. ""I've been told and have not confirmed that Nigel Farage had additional trips to the Ecuadoran embassy than the one that's been in the papers and that he provided data to Julian Assange,"" he said. Asked what kind of data, he replied: ""A thumb drive."" Mr Farage was pictured leaving the Ecuadorian embassy on March 9 last year, but at the time refused to say whether he had met with Mr Assange. WikiLeaks has been accused by Mrs Clinton of acting as a ""fully owned subsidiary of Russian intelligence"" after it published damaging emails, allegedly stolen by Russian operatives, during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In June last year, Mr Farage dismissed a report that he was a ""person of interest"" in the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between Mr Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. He campaigned openly for the billionaire businessman and US reality TV star, and was one of the first people to meet him in Trump Tower after his election victory. He also hired the top floor of an exclusive five-star hotel in Washington DC to host a party celebrating Mr Trump's inauguration. Mr Trump also suggested Mr Farage should be appointed the UK's ambassador to the US. Mr Farage issued a one-line statement responding to the claims. He said: ""This is conspiratorial nonsense."""

Sources close to the Foreign Secretary told Sky News that Mr Johnson said: ""We need a new fixed link between UK and France. ""It's crazy that two of the biggest economies in the world are connected by one railway line when they are only 20 miles apart."" Sky News also understands, from British sources, that French President Emmanuel Macron replied: ""I agree, let's do it."" :: Macron: UK must pay for City deal after Brexit During Thursday's summit, Mr Johnson - a leading Brexit supporter - had hailed the ""important work"" taking place. He posted on Twitter: ""I'm especially pleased we are establishing a panel of experts to look at major projects together. ""Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. ""Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?"" He later posted a picture of himself and Mr Macron both making a thumbs up gesture. It was reported that Mr Johnson had specifically spoken of a potential bridge across the Channel. Industry groups have poured scorn in the idea of a bridge across the Channel. Jonathan Roberts, communications director at UK Chamber of Shipping, told Sky News: ""Building a huge concrete structure in the middle of the world's busiest shipping lane might come with some challenges. ""The Government and the EU should concentrate on keeping trade moving freely through our ports, something which is in the economic interest of both sides, instead of searching for headline grabbing ideas that sound better on paper than they would be in practice.""

Great meetings with French counterparts today pic.twitter.com/D73B1rSkd3 The Foreign Secretary was quoted as saying: ""If you wanted to show your commitment to Europe, is it not time for us to have further and better economic integration with a road tunnel? ""You could come out of the EU but join Europe in the most fundamental way. ""You undo the damage done at the end of the Ice Age. ""The Channel is really a river whose tributaries used to be the Seine and the Thames. ""It became bigger and bigger and bigger as the ice melted until it separated Britain from France."" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry responded to the idea in a post on Twitter: ""I ignored this earlier because I assumed it wasn't real. Apparently it is. I mean...who are these clowns claiming to run our country?"" The UK Chamber of Shipping also posted: ""Building a huge concrete structure in the middle of the world's busiest shipping lane might come with some challenges."" Prior to the building of the Channel Tunnel, opened in 1994, the prospect of a road bridge between Britain and France had been considered. A submission for a £3bn three-lane motorway link was made to transport officials in 1981, according to the National Archives. Over the past decade, China has built some of the world's longest bridges, with the cross-water Jiaozhou Bay link spanning more than 25 miles."

A total of 1,155 men were being held at HMP Liverpool when it was assessed in September. Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said the prison had failed to act following a previous inspection in 2015, when 89 recommendations were made. He said there was an ""abject failure... to offer a safe, decent and purposeful environment"". The damning report found: :: Of those prisoners assessed, more than a third (37.5%) tested positive for drug use. :: More than a third of prisoners said they felt unsafe and half said they had been victimised by staff. :: Some cells had broken windows and emergency call bells that did not work; some areas had rats and cockroaches. :: Prisoners with mental health problems waited several months for an appointment. :: There was a backlog of some 2,000 maintenance tasks. :: Violence of all kinds had increased, with assaults on staff more than tripling since the 2015 assessment. :: Urgent alert over 'fundamentally unsafe' Nottingham prison Mr Clarke wrote in his report: ""The inspection team was highly experienced and could not recall having seen worse living conditions than those at HMP Liverpool. ""The presence of inspectors seemed to provoke some piecemeal and superficial attempts at cleaning and the like, but the fear was that this would stop as soon as we left, which is clearly what happened after the last inspection."" He criticised the ""squalid"" environment and said many cells were ""not fit to be used"". One recently released prisoner told Sky News: ""It's absolutely appalling in there. They do absolutely nothing for you."" Having also been in a number of other prisons, he said HMP Liverpool was ""a different world compared to the other ones"". ""If you're scared of going to hell, trust me, come in here and you're not going to be scared of going to hell after this. ""I know we're criminals, we've done something wrong... but at the end of the day it's inhumane."" The Commons Justice Committee is to hold an evidence session on the findings next week. Michael Spurr, chief executive of HM Prison and Probation Service, acknowledged conditions at the prison were ""unacceptable"" and said ""immediate"" action was taken to fix the situation following the assessment. A new governor has been appointed, cleanliness has been improved and the maintenance backlog almost halved, he said. ""We are committed to fixing this, have already made changes where we can, and have today published a comprehensive action plan to address the chief inspector's concerns."""

The shaven style comes after years of jokes about his premature hair loss from wife Kate and brother Prince Harry. It was reportedly done during a private session at Kensington Palace at a cost of £180. The Prince is understood to have got advice from Kate's hairdresser, Richard Ward, before taking the plunge. However one of Ward's deputies, Joey Wheeler, reportedly carried out the royal cut. Mr Ward charges a base fee of £125 for a men's cut and finish, according to his website. ""Wills sought Richard's advice, but it was Joey who was the one to visit the Palace and give him his new buzz cut,"" a source close to the hairdressers told The Sun.

He hasn’t got much of it left to cut! The Duke, 35, has long been teased by his family for his receding hairline. Prince Harry once said that his brother ""was already bald aged 12"". In 2014, Kate was on tour in Australia when she was shown a tuft of alpaca wool, similar in colour to William's hair. Pointing to her husband's head, she said: ""You need it more than me."" Bookmakers William Hill are now offering odds of 6/4 that he will sport a completely shaved head for Prince Harry's wedding. Odds are 1/2 that he'll stick with the current shaved style, and 16/1 that he will have a hair transplant. Award-winning British barber and charity founder Tom Chapman said Prince William was joining a number of well-known names in ""making the bald head sexy"". He added: ""It's a timeless look that has been on trend for many decades now. ""It's usually a cost effective cut, unless you're a royal!

The letter writer claimed to have a client who had information that LJY had committed a ""very serious"" criminal offence. The ""organisation"" said the offence led its client to lose out and, as a result, LJY was required to pay ""financial recompense"" or there would be consequences. The letter suggested that if the celebrity did not pay, the client's story would be ""convincing"" to the authorities or the media. The ""organisation"" demanded £50,000 to compensate the ""client"" for lost ""financial opportunities"". The details of the case came out in a hearing at the High Court in London, presided over by Mr Justice Nicklin. LJY, after receiving the letter, ran up bills of £25,000 taking legal action to protect himself. He was described in court as a well-known figure in the entertainment business.

2018-01-19,An influential Conservative MP has asked Jeremy Hunt to delay controversial reforms designed to change the way NHS funds are overseen.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180119221238/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-urged-to-delay-nhs-shake-up-to-integrate-health-and-social-care-11214052,"The chair of the Health Committee, Sarah Wollaston, has written to the Health Secretary expressing concerns about the introduction of accountable care organisations (ACOs) There is currently a lawsuit supported by physicist Stephen Hawking which aims to stop the new system due to be introduced in some areas of England in April, amid fears it will benefit private companies while reducing the provision of services. Dr Wollaston writes to Mr Hunt: ""I am writing to request that you delay the introduction of the new contract for accountable care organisations until after the Health Committee has taken the opportunity to hear evidence on the issues around the introduction of accountable care models to the NHS. ""As I am sure you are aware, a great deal of concern has been expressed about the development of ACOs in the NHS. I expect the committee to consider these concerns."" The committee will assess the reforms in February and March, with a view to reporting after Easter. ACOs have been promoted by Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, as a way of integrating health service bodies and providers of social care to the benefit of patients. However, opponents fear it is a route to privatisation, giving the ACOs' control of budgets and incentives to restrict care. Announcing he was challenging the changes, Professor Hawking told the Guardian last month: ""They appear to be being used for reducing public expenditure, for cutting services and for allowing private companies to receive and benefit from significant sums of public money for organising and providing services."" A campaign group called 999 Call for the NHS is raising funds for the legal challenge due to take place at Leeds High Court in April. On its crowdfunding site it says the contract allows the ACOs to ""keep the money left over at the end of the year"". It adds: ""This new payment mechanism is supposed to drive efficiency and incentivise accountable care organisations to 'manage demand' for NHS and social care services, but we are concerned that financial decisions not clinical need would determine patients' access to treatment."" Dr Wollaston told Sky News that there appeared to be a lot of ""misinformation"" about the new scheme and she hoped that ""both sides can put their guns down"", while her committee assesses the evidence. However, that would mean Mr Hunt delaying a key part of his five-year blueprint to modernise the Health Service. Dr Wollaston argues that delaying the introduction of the planned contract changes until the committee has examined both sides of the argument would be ""a sensible step in ensuring that public confidence is maintained in developments in the NHS"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Secretary of State will be responding to the letter from Dr Sarah Wollaston MP and the Health Committee shortly. ""ACOs are about integrating care and bringing services together, so people’s care is coordinated around them – not the other way round. ""ACOs will help deliver more care in the community and patients' homes, improving access to services and meaning fewer trips to hospital."" Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour's shadow health secretary, said Dr Wollaston had made ""an important and welcome contribution to the debate"" about ACOs. He said: ""Ministers have failed to reassure us these won't be a vehicle for large-scale private sector involvement in running local health services. ""Given the Carillion debacle, this call from the Health Select Committee chair is timely and must not be dismissed by Jeremy Hunt."""
2018-01-19,"Carillion, the bankrupt construction group, had financial liabilities worth about £5bn when it went bust this week, according to the most extreme calculation of its obligations to tens of thousands of pension scheme members.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180119221238/https://news.sky.com/story/revealed-carillion-collapsed-with-5bn-of-financial-liabilities-11213303,"Sky News can reveal that private analysis of Carillion's pension deficit on a Section 75 - or full buyout - basis has concluded that it was as high as £2.6bn, a far higher sum than the £587m accounting deficit referred to by its former chief executive in a High Court witness statement. The £2.6bn figure relates to the cost to Carillion of paying an insurance company to guarantee all of its pension liabilities, and is significant because it is likely to be the sum claimed on behalf of the pension schemes as part of the liquidation process, according to insiders. Sources said the full buyout deficit was also relevant because added to Carillion's other debts, including those owed to its banks, it takes Carillion's total financial obligations when it collapsed to roughly £5bn. The vast scale of the company's total indebtedness further dwarfs its comparatively minuscule market capitalisation of just £61m when the Official Receiver was called in on Monday morning. Although the pension schemes will lodge a claim for £2.6bn with the liquidator, there is no prospect of that money being paid, since Carillion failed with just £29m on its balance sheet. :: What ultimately went wrong at Carillion The Pension Protection Fund will now step in to provide compensation to 28,500 pension scheme members, with the total bill facing it likely to be up to £920m. The PPF pays a reduced level of retirement benefits to workers of companies which become insolvent, compared to their original entitlement. In addition to the £2.6bn Section 75 pension deficit, Carillion's liabilities when it went bust included £1.3bn owed to its banking syndicate; £350m arising from early payment facilities with suppliers; cross-guarantees of £630m relating to bonding facilities; £170m of convertible bonds guaranteed by the company; and an unknown debt to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, £16m of which was due by the end of the month. The size and complexity of Carillion's balance sheet are likely to be among the factors investigated during a multitude of probes into the conduct of the company's directors and auditors. Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, has ordered the Insolvency Service to fast-track an inquiry into the Carillion crisis, while the Financial Reporting Council has been asked to examine the work of KPMG, the company's auditor, and individual members. Ministers have scrambled since Carillion's collapse to exert a grip on its fallout, with fears for tens of thousands of subcontractors caught up in one of the biggest disasters to hit a major UK industrial group for decades. While Parliament's Liaison Committee, a consortium of all select committee chairs, was the latest to announce its own inquiry. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: ""I will be proposing we take evidence from the company directors, the trustees, the pensions regulator and the auditors who somehow concluded Carillion was a going concern."" News of the much-larger financial liabilities for Carillion comes days after Keith Cochrane, its interim chief executive, disclosed in a legal statement that the taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had tightened the terms of its funding to Carillion three days before it was forced to call in liquidators. :: The key personnel at Carillion Mr Cochrane, who has yet to speak publicly about the collapse of the company he had been in charge of since a profit warning sent its shares tumbling last July, accused RBS in his statement of taking ""unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". According to Mr Cochrane, RBS informed Carillion last Friday that it wanted the company to pre-fund supplier payments made through the bank, which meant it would need to make those payments two days earlier than cashflow forecasts had assumed. He said this negatively impacted Carillion's liquidity by between £2m and £20m. Santander UK, another member of the committee of Carillion's biggest lenders, was also criticised by Mr Cochrane for causing panic among the lending syndicate on 21 December by writing to the construction giant's suppliers notifying them of immediate changes to an Early Payment Facility (EPF) with the bank. The interim chief's statement details the increasingly frenetic nature of efforts to secure financial support from the Government, the taxman and its lenders in the months before its collapse. Its failure has left 19,500 UK staff fearing for their jobs and uncertainty about the viability of a number of major public sector projects, emboldening the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to declare that private companies should be stripped of Government contracts. A spokesman for Carillion's pension trustees declined to comment on Friday."

When police traced Arshid to a Holiday Inn in Folkestone and seized his laptops, they discovered he had searched online for ""human cremation"", ""butchering the human carcass"", and ""acid bath murderer"". Crispin Aylett QC told the Old Bailey that a Google search eventually led the builder to a Wikipedia page about Haigh, who was hanged in 1949 for murdering six people and disposing of their remains in different ways. He said Arshid was ""inspired"" by Haigh to set up a new Google email address ineedanacidbath@space.com, and viewed a YouTube video entitled ""Woman cut throat"". Officers were able to find Ms Dookhran - who had tape wrapped around her mouth and a sock stuffed inside, with three cuts to the neck slicing through her voice box - after another woman involved in the ordeal gave information from her hospital bed. The court heard how Arshid had allegedly enlisted the help of 28-year-old labourer Vincent Tappu to kidnap both of them by bundling them into the boot of his pick-up truck. They were said to have been bound and gagged as he drove them to a six-bedroom southwest London home he was renovating, and upon arrival they were raped and had their throats cut. The surviving woman only managed to escape after tricking Arshid into thinking they could be together, and she told the court the ""psycho"" builder had told her she had ""10 minutes to live"" after killing her friend. Ms Dookhran's family wept in court as the survivor recounted her experience from her hospital bed, with bandages on her arms. In a police interview, she said they were abducted by Arshid and his Taser-wielding accomplice and described hearing screams and thuds as Barclays worker Ms Dookhran was killed. When Arshid turned on her, the witness - who cannot legally be identified - allegedly told him: ""No, no, no we need to talk."" She told the court: ""I started fighting, I grabbed him, kneed him down below. He did not flinch at all. I grabbed his face. I grabbed the knife. He started to slit me everywhere. I got my neck slit, my wrists. ""He said 'now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down'. I was trying to play dead. ""He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. I sat up and he said 'how have you got so much energy?' I was covered in blood from head to toe. I was swimming in it. ""I started saying things he wanted to hear - 'I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family.' ""He said 'I'm not good enough for you, look what I have done'."" The woman managed to raise the alarm and was rescued by Arshid's brother, who saw her in the back of his truck and took her to St George's Hospital in Tooting. She later told police where they could find 5ft 3in tall Ms Dookhran, who died from a loss of blood and obstruction to the airways, a post-mortem found. Arshid, of no fixed address, and Tappu, of Spencer Road, Acton, west London, deny kidnap, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm with intent. Arshid has also pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder, rape of both women and the previous sexual assault and assault by penetration of the surviving woman when she was about 13. The trial continues."

Ovarian, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectal, lung and breast cancers were detected with an accuracy of 70%, according to the journal Science. In eight out of 10 cases it was even able to narrow down the position of the cancer in the body. The non-invasive test analyses DNA mutations and protein biomarkers. The report said: ""The ultimate goal of CancerSEEK is to detect cancer even earlier, before the disease is symptomatic."" Although encouraging, specialists have said more research needs to be done. ""This looks promising but with several caveats and a significant amount of further research is needed before we can even contemplate how this might play out in screening settings,"" said Mangesh Thorat, deputy director of the Barts Clinical Trials Unit at Queen Mary University of London. ""The sensitivity of the test in stage 1 cancer is quite low, about 40 percent, and even with stage 1 and 2 combined it appears to be around 60 percent.

While details of the Standard's stories are difficult to make out, the scraps appear to feature listings of the day's cultural events and, in one article, the observation that ""boys will be boys"". The artefacts were discovered during rewiring work to remove old, and potentially dangerous, electrical cabling from Buckingham palace. ""These items are vivid reminders of the history that can be found in this building,"" a palace spokesperson told Sky News. ""You set out to replace the wiring and end up find things that, in their own small way, tell us something about the past. And no doubt other treasures will be uncovered as the project evolves."" The project - part of a 10-year reservicing effort - is replacing more than a mile of vulcanised Indian rubber cabling that was installed in the late 1940s. Some parts of the palace's plumbing, electrical and cabling and heating have not been updated since just after the Second World War, according to a Royal trustees reports, and are in urgent need to repair to prevent long-term damage. Replacing the infrastructure has meant pulling up floorboards in rooms including the Queen's private apartments, where audiences with senior figures from around the world are held.

Zombie, released in 1994, was one of The Cranberries' best-known hits, and O'Riordan had been due to sing for a cover with Bad Wolves when she died. Proceeds from the song will now go to her three children, the band said. Bad Wolves singer Tommy Vext said: ""It was the greatest honour to know she liked our version and wanted to sing on it. ""We're deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Dolores and by the fact that she's leaving behind three children, so we are donating the proceeds from the song to her kids. ""It's such a powerful song and the themes are still so relevant, we wanted to release it in her memory."" The original song featured the line: ""It's the same old theme since 1916, in your head, in your head, they're still fighting"" - a reference to IRA attacks. But Vext said the band and O'Riordan had changed this to say ""2018"", adding: ""She was really excited about that, because the nations may have changed but we're still fighting the same battles today. ""Humanity is still fighting to assert itself despite all the conflicts."" “We are shocked and saddened at the news of Dolores’s passing, mere hours before she was to record vocals on our upcoming version of Zombie”. Link below for full statement. https://t.co/CQUQODDXbV According to an interview in Rolling Stone, Bad Wolves had set up the London recording session with O'Riordan but, because of her death, they never found out what her other intentions were for the song. Vext told the magazine: ""I was really hoping to meet her, say thank you for everything - for her music and her willingness to contribute and her approval. ""It was unfortunately something that I didn't get to experience."" Regarding the release of the cover, he said: ""Now the song has a weight and a depth to it that no one outside of being those close to it could possibly imagine. ""It almost feels like we had to do it. It feels like we're compelled to have her work continue on through us."" An inquest into O'Riordan's death has been opened and police have said there are no suspicious circumstances."

2018-01-19,"The NHS faces unsustainable, endemic financial problems despite a series of one-off payments intended to stabilise services.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180119221238/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-faces-endemic-unsustainable-financial-problems-says-national-audit-office-11212857,"A National Audit Office (NAO) report concludes that despite additional funding and planned reforms, the health service is failing to manage increased demand, while performance against treatment targets - including those for A&E services and cancer - is getting worse. The assessment comes as the NHS continues to grapple with a winter crisis exacerbated by the worst flu season in seven years, and with hospitals running at 95% bed occupancy. Doctors' groups, health think tanks and opposition parties said the report endorses the view that the NHS is suffering from under-funding and the lack of a long-term plan. The NAO examined NHS funding arrangements in the 2016-17 financial year, including a £1.8bn one-off cash injection intended to stabilise the financial position of NHS services and prepare them for a future squeeze on revenue. It found that, instead, the money was used to cope with existing pressures and effectively fill a black hole in hospital trust finances. The Sustainability and Transformation Fund (STF) was created after NHS Trusts reported a collective deficit of £2,477m in 2015-16. It was intended to help reform services, with health providers in 44 areas across the country working together to respond to the changing needs of patients. In fact, the money was used to meet existing pressures and help bail out trusts facing huge deficits. By the end of the 2016-17 financial year, even with the additional £1.8bn, the overall deficit stood at £791m. The NHS is currently in the tightest financial squeeze in its history. Health spending in real terms has increased by 3.9% a year since 1948, but on current plans it will average just 1.9% between 2014-15 and 2020-21. The report concludes that despite one-off payments including the STF, and £3.1bn in loans from the Department of Health and Social Care, the ""endemic"" financial problems of NHS bodies ""have not eased"". Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""The NHS has received extra funding, but this has mostly been used to cope with current pressures and has not provided the stable platform intended from which to transform services. ""Repeated short-term funding boosts could turn into the new normal, when the public purse may be better served by a long-term funding settlement that provides a stable platform for sustained improvements."" The British Medical Association said the report demonstrated the NHS was simply ""firefighting"". NHS Providers, which represents hospital and ambulance trust managers, said the NHS faced a ""watershed moment"" that demanded a long-term plan. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the report highlighted ""the Government's flawed and wholly inadequate approach to the sustainable, long term funding of the NHS."" ""Ministers have failed to increase per head spending in real terms each year, a key election promise, and there are still no details of a long overdue pay rise for NHS staff,"" he said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""As this report recognises, the NHS has made significant progress towards balancing the books and returning to a financially stable position - to support this we recently gave it top priority in the Budget with an extra £2.8bn, on top of a planned £10bn-a-year increase in its budget by 2020/21."" The NAO report is the latest in a series of publications that have identified the need for a long-term funding solution for the NHS."
2018-01-19,Black-cab rapist John Worboys could be freed within weeks after the Government decided not to challenge his release.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180119221238/https://news.sky.com/story/john-worboys-government-wont-seek-review-of-black-cab-rapist-release-11213273,"Justice Secretary David Gauke said it would ""not be appropriate"" to seek a judicial review of the case after taking ""considered and expert"" legal advice. He warned the bar would have been ""very high"" and that there was ""no reasonable prospect of success"". Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Gauke told MPs: ""I believe that I owe it to those victims and to the public to consider all the options open to me. ""I therefore took the step of seeking legal advice from specialist leading counsel to establish whether there were grounds to challenge this decision in the courts and therefore to ask the court to stop the release of Worboys before the decision was reconsidered."" He added: ""Having taken considered and expert legal advice I have decided it would not be appropriate for me as Secretary of State to proceed with such a case. ""Honourable members will appreciate that I cannot go further and expose detail of the legal advice I have been given."" Mr Gauke did suggest he supported victims seeking their own advice, saying: ""Just because I am not taking action, does not mean others cannot."" Two women raped by Worboys have launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money to challenge the decision themselves. Labour MP Jo Stevens said that was because legal aid in judicial review cases had been ""severely restricted"" by the previous coalition government - and should be looked at again in light of the Worboys decision. Mr Gauke responded that he would not make a decision until after a review into the Parole Board had finished - expected by Easter. He did reveal the review would be widened to look at the way victims are contacted about their attacker's release. The Parole Board was forced to apologise and accused of leaving victims ""in the dark"" after terrified women attacked by Worboys complained they had not been told about the decision to release him. The Board said widening the review was a ""sensible course of action"" to make sure the public and victims have confidence in how it works. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan also announced he would be seeking a judicial review. Worboys has served a year more than the minimum eight-year sentence he was given for one rape, six sex attacks and the drugging of 12 women. Police believe he attacked at least 100 victims, but more allegations were not pursued either because evidence was poor, or due to the fact that more convictions would not have added to his sentence, prosecutors said."
2018-01-19,"For retailers, it's been a tough day, after a tough Christmas, after a tough year. And for some, it's looking a lot worse than it is for others.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180119221238/https://news.sky.com/story/retail-crisis-what-the-numbers-really-tell-us-about-the-high-street-11213675,"Take Carpetright. Back in the summer of 2015, shares in the company were trading for £6 each. Carpetright was optimistic and apparently doing well. On Friday, it released a miserable trading statement, bemoaning poor sales and a difficult retail environment, and duly saw its shares collapse. They fell by more than 40%, tumbling to around 93p per share. Not quite a Carillion-style decline, but certainly confirmation that customers are keeping a close eye on their money. We tend to buy new carpets at two times - either when we move, or when we're feeling a bit flush with cash. And right now, there's not a huge market in either of those. The housing market has slowed and, with inflation outstripping wage growth, household spending has started to tighten. Mixed into this were Friday's figures about retail sales, which were seized upon as evidence of a spiral of decline. There was widespread coverage that sales had posted their biggest fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum, dropping 1.5%. Annual growth was just 1.4%, down from 1.5% the previous month. But scratch into these figures, and the picture is a little more complicated. :: Mothercare shares slump after profit warning For one thing, those disappointing sales figures are for the quantity of goods being bought. If you change that into the money being spent on them, you see that spending has actually gone up by 4.4% over the past year. So we are spending more money, but we're ending up with fewer things. That's the effect of general inflation, which peaked at the end of last year. It's also the result of something specific - inflation in the shops. Between July 2014 and November 2016, prices on the shelves actually declined as retailers battled against each other to grab a share of the market. Then, as the effect of the currency movement after the referendum started to kick in, retailers decided that they would have to pass on some of the increase in costs to consumers. That's when prices started to go up, which led to inflation, and, with the occasional quiet period, they've been gradually rising ever since. :: Jobs threat as Debenhams issues profit warning But so have sales - yes, the rate of increase has slowed, but both the quantity and value of sales are still going up. Secondly, there's something about these figures that is misleading. It's not so long since December was, by far, the most important month of the year for retailers, but those days have now gone, thanks to Black Friday - which happens in November. Now, a lot of us do our Christmas shopping in November, when the Black Friday sales start. So it turns out that we spent 0.9% less money in December than we did in November, and bought 1.5% fewer things. But if you lump together October, November and December into one quarter then things look healthier. All this matters because household spending has helped to prop up the UK's economy ever since the financial crisis. If it slowed markedly, the economy would suffer. There's no question that retail sales are becoming more sluggish. Even online sales, which have been growing like topsy, have hit a speedbump. But, with the exception of a few specific retail companies, nothing has yet fallen off a cliff."
2018-01-20,"A builder accused of raping and murdering his niece before hiding her body in a freezer was inspired by a serial killer who dissolved his victims in acid baths, a court has heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180120230552/https://news.sky.com/story/celine-dookhran-murder-psycho-uncle-inspired-by-acid-bath-serial-killer-11213899,"Jurors were told how Mujahid Arshid, 33, came across the crimes of John George Haigh as he searched for ways to dispose of the body of 20-year-old Celine Dookhran, who died after being sexually assaulted and having her throat slashed in July last year. When police traced Arshid to a Holiday Inn in Folkestone and seized his laptops, they discovered he had searched online for ""human cremation"", ""butchering the human carcass"", and ""acid bath murderer"". Crispin Aylett QC told the Old Bailey that a Google search eventually led the builder to a Wikipedia page about Haigh, who was hanged in 1949 for murdering six people and disposing of their remains in different ways. He said Arshid was ""inspired"" by Haigh to set up a new Google email address ineedanacidbath@space.com, and viewed a YouTube video entitled ""Woman cut throat"". Officers were able to find Ms Dookhran - who had tape wrapped around her mouth and a sock stuffed inside, with three cuts to the neck slicing through her voice box - after another woman involved in the ordeal gave information from her hospital bed. The court heard how Arshid had allegedly enlisted the help of 28-year-old labourer Vincent Tappu to kidnap both of them by bundling them into the boot of his pick-up truck. They were said to have been bound and gagged as he drove them to a six-bedroom southwest London home he was renovating, and upon arrival they were raped and had their throats cut. The surviving woman only managed to escape after tricking Arshid into thinking they could be together, and she told the court the ""psycho"" builder had told her she had ""10 minutes to live"" after killing her friend. Ms Dookhran's family wept in court as the survivor recounted her experience from her hospital bed, with bandages on her arms. In a police interview, she said they were abducted by Arshid and his Taser-wielding accomplice and described hearing screams and thuds as Barclays worker Ms Dookhran was killed. When Arshid turned on her, the witness - who cannot legally be identified - allegedly told him: ""No, no, no we need to talk."" She told the court: ""I started fighting, I grabbed him, kneed him down below. He did not flinch at all. I grabbed his face. I grabbed the knife. He started to slit me everywhere. I got my neck slit, my wrists. ""He said 'now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down'. I was trying to play dead. ""He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. I sat up and he said 'how have you got so much energy?' I was covered in blood from head to toe. I was swimming in it. ""I started saying things he wanted to hear - 'I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family.' ""He said 'I'm not good enough for you, look what I have done'."" The woman managed to raise the alarm and was rescued by Arshid's brother, who saw her in the back of his truck and took her to St George's Hospital in Tooting. She later told police where they could find 5ft 3in tall Ms Dookhran, who died from a loss of blood and obstruction to the airways, a post-mortem found. Arshid, of no fixed address, and Tappu, of Spencer Road, Acton, west London, deny kidnap, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm with intent. Arshid has also pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder, rape of both women and the previous sexual assault and assault by penetration of the surviving woman when she was about 13. The trial continues."
2018-01-20,Players at a 110-year-old football club are taking to the pitch this weekend worried that they might not be paid. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180120230552/https://news.sky.com/story/more-than-life-death-and-pies-fight-to-save-hartlepool-united-11214398,"After a troubled few years Hartlepool United is on the brink of administration with debts of £1.8m and immediate bills of £200,000. Fans of the North East club have organised a sell-out for today's home game against Wrexham alongside an online fundraising campaign in the hope they can pay the wages until a new owner is found. Club chair and chief executive Pam Duxbury, who has been holding the fort since the beginning of last year, is hopeful someone will buy the club and pump in the £1m a year it takes to keep it afloat. ""I’m reviewing it on a daily basis,"" she said. Her message to potential buyers is simple: ""If you’ve got £1m, I want you to come."" If the club slips into administration it will automatically lose 10 points and could drop out of the National League and down to the sixth tier; a world away from the big money of top-flight football. It's not a future they want to think about at Parker's Bakery on one of Hartlepool’s industrial estates where 1,000 pies are being baked for the 7,500 supporters who will pack out the Wrexham game. Owner Dave Hope, a lifelong Hartlepool fan who admits he doesn't attend matches these days, says the firm will survive if the club folds, but that's not the point. In a town whose fortunes have waned along with the heavy industry and the chemical works that once made it a powerhouse, the difficulties the club is facing are keenly felt. ""We've had things like shops go bust on us,"" he said, ""but it's the football part of it I wouldn’t like to lose."" His worried parting shot echoed legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly, who famously said football was more important than life and death: ""It’s not just that we're supplying pies to them, it’s part of life isn't it."""
2018-01-20,An influential Conservative MP has asked Jeremy Hunt to delay controversial reforms designed to change the way NHS funds are overseen.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180120230552/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-urged-to-delay-nhs-shake-up-to-integrate-health-and-social-care-11214052,"The chair of the Health Committee, Sarah Wollaston, has written to the Health Secretary expressing concerns about the introduction of accountable care organisations (ACOs) There is currently a lawsuit supported by physicist Stephen Hawking which aims to stop the new system due to be introduced in some areas of England in April, amid fears it will benefit private companies while reducing the provision of services. Dr Wollaston writes to Mr Hunt: ""I am writing to request that you delay the introduction of the new contract for accountable care organisations until after the Health Committee has taken the opportunity to hear evidence on the issues around the introduction of accountable care models to the NHS. ""As I am sure you are aware, a great deal of concern has been expressed about the development of ACOs in the NHS. I expect the committee to consider these concerns."" The committee will assess the reforms in February and March, with a view to reporting after Easter. ACOs have been promoted by Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, as a way of integrating health service bodies and providers of social care to the benefit of patients. However, opponents fear it is a route to privatisation, giving the ACOs' control of budgets and incentives to restrict care. Announcing he was challenging the changes, Professor Hawking told the Guardian last month: ""They appear to be being used for reducing public expenditure, for cutting services and for allowing private companies to receive and benefit from significant sums of public money for organising and providing services."" A campaign group called 999 Call for the NHS is raising funds for the legal challenge due to take place at Leeds High Court in April. On its crowdfunding site it says the contract allows the ACOs to ""keep the money left over at the end of the year"". It adds: ""This new payment mechanism is supposed to drive efficiency and incentivise accountable care organisations to 'manage demand' for NHS and social care services, but we are concerned that financial decisions not clinical need would determine patients' access to treatment."" Dr Wollaston told Sky News that there appeared to be a lot of ""misinformation"" about the new scheme and she hoped that ""both sides can put their guns down"", while her committee assesses the evidence. However, that would mean Mr Hunt delaying a key part of his five-year blueprint to modernise the Health Service. Dr Wollaston argues that delaying the introduction of the planned contract changes until the committee has examined both sides of the argument would be ""a sensible step in ensuring that public confidence is maintained in developments in the NHS"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Secretary of State will be responding to the letter from Dr Sarah Wollaston MP and the Health Committee shortly. ""ACOs are about integrating care and bringing services together, so people’s care is coordinated around them – not the other way round. ""ACOs will help deliver more care in the community and patients' homes, improving access to services and meaning fewer trips to hospital."" Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour's shadow health secretary, said Dr Wollaston had made ""an important and welcome contribution to the debate"" about ACOs. He said: ""Ministers have failed to reassure us these won't be a vehicle for large-scale private sector involvement in running local health services. ""Given the Carillion debacle, this call from the Health Select Committee chair is timely and must not be dismissed by Jeremy Hunt."""
2018-01-20,Donald Trump has blamed Democrats for the failure of budget talks that have forced the US government to shut down.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180120230552/https://news.sky.com/story/trump-hits-out-as-us-government-shuts-down-over-failed-budget-talks-11214664,"On the first anniversary of his inauguration as US President, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face going without pay and many have been told not to turn up for work. In a dramatic night in Washington DC, Republican leaders fell short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass a spending bill. This legislation would have provided a fiscal rescue package to keep funding the government until 16 February. And so technically, the US government ran out of money at midnight on Friday (5am Saturday, UK-time). Mr Trump tweeted: ""This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown."" This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown He was forced to cancel his weekend trip to Florida where he was planning to celebrate his first year as president at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Continuing to point the finger of blame, he tweeted: ""Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. ""They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead."" He added: ""For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. ""That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans!"" :: Two opposing realities after a year of Trump Republicans are claiming that Democrats are holding the government hostage over demands to protect 700,000 ""dreamer"" immigrants brought to the country as children and now living in the US illegally. Mr Trump has since tweeted: ""Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can't let that happen!"" As the midnight deadline passed, the White House said it would not negotiate with the Democrats on immigration until the end of the shutdown. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: ""We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. ""When Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform."" But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hit back on Twitter, writing: ""This will be called the #TrumpShutdown. ""There is no one who deserves the blame for the position we find ourselves in more than president Trump."" Fellow Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand wrote on Twitter: ""Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. ""No matter how they spin this shutdown, we know what happened: they abandoned their responsibility."" Instead of protecting Dreamers, renewing health insurance for millions of children, and tackling the real problems hurting our families, the president and his enablers in Congress have manufactured a government shutdown. :: Why has the US Government shut down? The American Federation of Government Employees estimates about 850,000 workers, out of a total 3.5 million, could be told to stay home without pay until Congress reaches an agreement. Food inspections, federal law enforcement, airport security checks, and other vital services will continue, as will social security, other federal benefit programmes and military operations. But most federal workers will not be paid. The last US shutdown lasted for 16 days in October 2013, with around 800,000 workers granted leave. Shortly before the vote, President Trump tweeted that it was ""not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border""."

While details of the Standard's stories are difficult to make out, the scraps appear to feature listings of the day's cultural events and, in one article, the observation that ""boys will be boys"". The artefacts were discovered during rewiring work to remove old, and potentially dangerous, electrical cabling from Buckingham palace. ""These items are vivid reminders of the history that can be found in this building,"" a palace spokesperson told Sky News. ""You set out to replace the wiring and end up find things that, in their own small way, tell us something about the past. And no doubt other treasures will be uncovered as the project evolves."" The project - part of a 10-year reservicing effort - is replacing more than a mile of vulcanised Indian rubber cabling that was installed in the late 1940s. Some parts of the palace's plumbing, electrical and cabling and heating have not been updated since just after the Second World War, according to a Royal trustees reports, and are in urgent need to repair to prevent long-term damage. Replacing the infrastructure has meant pulling up floorboards in rooms including the Queen's private apartments, where audiences with senior figures from around the world are held. Most of the work took place in the summer, when the Queen was in residence at Balmoral Palace. Work is currently under way in rooms including the blue drawing room, white drawing room, music room and throne room.

The claims were made by Fusion GPS boss Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the investigative firm behind the controversial ""Trump dossier"" which was released by former British spy Christopher Steele. The unsubstantiated dossier was put together during the election campaign and was partially funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democrats. It was also given to the FBI. It claimed there was collusion between Mr Trump's presidential campaign and Russia before he entered the White House, and that the Russians have information that could be used to blackmail the President - claims he fiercely denies. However, during his appearance before the committee in November, Mr Simpson said his interest in the Trump campaign's links to UKIP and WikiLeaks were separate from ex-MI6 inteligence officer Mr Steele's investigations. According to a transcript of Mr Simpson's testimony released by the House Intelligence Committee, he claimed WikiLeaks was part of a ""somewhat unacknowledged relationship"" between the Trump team and the ""UKIP people"". He said that Mr Farage became ""someone that we were very interested in"" after the EU referendum vote in June 2016. ""I still think it's very interesting,"" he said. ""And so I have formed my own opinions... that there was a somewhat unacknowledged relationship between the Trump people and the UKIP people and that the path to WikiLeaks ran through that. And I still think that today."" Mr Simpson said while there had been reports of one visit Mr Farage made to the Ecuadorian embassy - where Mr Assange has been living since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden - he believed the pair had met more often than is widely known. ""I've been told and have not confirmed that Nigel Farage had additional trips to the Ecuadoran embassy than the one that's been in the papers and that he provided data to Julian Assange,"" he said. Asked what kind of data, he replied: ""A thumb drive."" Mr Farage was pictured leaving the Ecuadorian embassy on March 9 last year, but at the time refused to say whether he had met with Mr Assange. WikiLeaks has been accused by Mrs Clinton of acting as a ""fully owned subsidiary of Russian intelligence"" after it published damaging emails, allegedly stolen by Russian operatives, during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In June last year, Mr Farage dismissed a report that he was a ""person of interest"" in the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between Mr Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. He campaigned openly for the billionaire businessman and US reality TV star, and was one of the first people to meet him in Trump Tower after his election victory. He also hired the top floor of an exclusive five-star hotel in Washington DC to host a party celebrating Mr Trump's inauguration. Mr Trump also suggested Mr Farage should be appointed the UK's ambassador to the US. Mr Farage issued a one-line statement responding to the claims. He said: ""This is conspiratorial nonsense."""

The country's prime minister Andrew Holness said ""crime and violence, in particular murders"" had been escalating in the parish of St James. The UK Government has told Britons to stay in the confines of their hotels as a ""major"" military operation takes place in St James Parish, which includes Montego Bay. The Foreign Office said: ""You should limit your movements outside of resorts in the area at this time, and exercise particular care if travelling at night. ""Travel to and from the airport or for excursions should be undertaken with organised tour operators, and transport should be arranged or provided by the resort hotels."" Tourist Daniel Blakey, from Waterlooville near Portsmouth, who is staying in Montego Bay with his wife, told Sky News of the increased military and police presence. He said: ""We have seen an increased military presence going in and out of the resort, vehicle checkpoints and inside the resort we have seen police boats which have come up to the resort."" ""This morning there has been an increased police presence in the beach area, nothing much has changed and we are just waiting for further news from our holiday representatives."" Police officers in St. James have listed the top five most wanted men in the parish. They are urged to turn themselves in immediately.

Calling the level of criminal activity ""continued and threatened"", Mr Holness said his security forces had advised him it was ""of such a nature and so extensive in scale as to endanger public safety"". The state of emergency gives officers additional powers, allowing them to search and detain without a warrant and shut down businesses. A curfew has been imposed in both St James and St Catherine parish, west of the capital of Kingston. Vehicles coming in and out of the area will also be searched. Police in St James have released photos of five men wanted in connection with crimes, including murder. #Jamaica Local media have reported that a major military operation is underway in parts of St James.

He said: ""We need your full co-operation in moving forward in restoring peace and order so that the good people can continue to contribute to the well-being of Jamaica"". Around 206,000 British nationals visited Jamaica in 2016. The country - which still has the death penalty - has been plagued by high rates of murder and violence.

2018-01-20,"For retailers, it's been a tough day, after a tough Christmas, after a tough year. And for some, it's looking a lot worse than it is for others.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180120230552/https://news.sky.com/story/retail-crisis-what-the-numbers-really-tell-us-about-the-high-street-11213675,"Take Carpetright. Back in the summer of 2015, shares in the company were trading for £6 each. Carpetright was optimistic and apparently doing well. On Friday, it released a miserable trading statement, bemoaning poor sales and a difficult retail environment, and duly saw its shares collapse. They fell by more than 40%, tumbling to around 93p per share. Not quite a Carillion-style decline, but certainly confirmation that customers are keeping a close eye on their money. We tend to buy new carpets at two times - either when we move, or when we're feeling a bit flush with cash. And right now, there's not a huge market in either of those. The housing market has slowed and, with inflation outstripping wage growth, household spending has started to tighten. Mixed into this were Friday's figures about retail sales, which were seized upon as evidence of a spiral of decline. There was widespread coverage that sales had posted their biggest fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum, dropping 1.5%. Annual growth was just 1.4%, down from 1.5% the previous month. But scratch into these figures, and the picture is a little more complicated. :: Mothercare shares slump after profit warning For one thing, those disappointing sales figures are for the quantity of goods being bought. If you change that into the money being spent on them, you see that spending has actually gone up by 4.4% over the past year. So we are spending more money, but we're ending up with fewer things. That's the effect of general inflation, which peaked at the end of last year. It's also the result of something specific - inflation in the shops. Between July 2014 and November 2016, prices on the shelves actually declined as retailers battled against each other to grab a share of the market. Then, as the effect of the currency movement after the referendum started to kick in, retailers decided that they would have to pass on some of the increase in costs to consumers. That's when prices started to go up, which led to inflation, and, with the occasional quiet period, they've been gradually rising ever since. :: Jobs threat as Debenhams issues profit warning But so have sales - yes, the rate of increase has slowed, but both the quantity and value of sales are still going up. Secondly, there's something about these figures that is misleading. It's not so long since December was, by far, the most important month of the year for retailers, but those days have now gone, thanks to Black Friday - which happens in November. Now, a lot of us do our Christmas shopping in November, when the Black Friday sales start. So it turns out that we spent 0.9% less money in December than we did in November, and bought 1.5% fewer things. But if you lump together October, November and December into one quarter then things look healthier. All this matters because household spending has helped to prop up the UK's economy ever since the financial crisis. If it slowed markedly, the economy would suffer. There's no question that retail sales are becoming more sluggish. Even online sales, which have been growing like topsy, have hit a speedbump. But, with the exception of a few specific retail companies, nothing has yet fallen off a cliff."

Zombie, released in 1994, was one of The Cranberries' best-known hits, and O'Riordan had been due to sing for a cover with Bad Wolves when she died. Proceeds from the song will now go to her three children, the band said. Bad Wolves singer Tommy Vext said: ""It was the greatest honour to know she liked our version and wanted to sing on it. ""We're deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Dolores and by the fact that she's leaving behind three children, so we are donating the proceeds from the song to her kids. ""It's such a powerful song and the themes are still so relevant, we wanted to release it in her memory."" The original song featured the line: ""It's the same old theme since 1916, in your head, in your head, they're still fighting"" - a reference to IRA attacks. But Vext said the band and O'Riordan had changed this to say ""2018"", adding: ""She was really excited about that, because the nations may have changed but we're still fighting the same battles today. ""Humanity is still fighting to assert itself despite all the conflicts."" “We are shocked and saddened at the news of Dolores’s passing, mere hours before she was to record vocals on our upcoming version of Zombie”. Link below for full statement. https://t.co/CQUQODDXbV According to an interview in Rolling Stone, Bad Wolves had set up the London recording session with O'Riordan but, because of her death, they never found out what her other intentions were for the song. Vext told the magazine: ""I was really hoping to meet her, say thank you for everything - for her music and her willingness to contribute and her approval. ""It was unfortunately something that I didn't get to experience."" Regarding the release of the cover, he said: ""Now the song has a weight and a depth to it that no one outside of being those close to it could possibly imagine. ""It almost feels like we had to do it. It feels like we're compelled to have her work continue on through us."" An inquest into O'Riordan's death has been opened and police have said there are no suspicious circumstances."

Moments later, team leader Major Nics Wetherill told Sky News: ""We're feeling so happy right now. ""We're so relieved. It's a complete mix of emotions right now... excitement, relief, happiness... glad this is all over."" Major Wetherill was joined by Major Natalie Taylor, both of the Royal Army Medical Corps, and four others. Together, they travelled up to 27 miles a day, navigating crevasses as they pulled sledges weighing up to 80kg (176lbs) and battling temperatures as low as -50C. The expedition began on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf on 20 November and involved climbing the Transantarctic Mountains, via the Leverett Glacier, to reach the polar plateau. They took in new supplies at the South Pole before they made their way to Hercules Inlet, skiing 373 miles across uneven ground, and spent Christmas Day on the ice before arriving at their final re-supply point at the base of the Thiel Mountains. From there they descended to the Hercules Inlet to the finish line. Major Wetherill told how they were ""lucky with the weather"" and were had prepared well with seven weeks in Norway before the expedition began, allowing them to get ""all our routines down to a tee"". ""Our timings were tight and we worked really well as a team... it meant that we managed to cover some ground over a good amount of time,"" she said, adding: ""We finished a lot faster than we thought."" The other four members of the team were reservist Major Sandy Hennis of the Royal Signals, Captain Zanna Baker and Lieutenant Jenni Stephenson, both of the Royal Artillery, and Honourable Artillery Company reservist Lance Sergeant Sophie Montagne. Major Wetherill told of the challenges they faced, saying: ""I'm glad to say that everyone has all their 10 fingers, 10 toes, two ears and one nose."" Major Taylor told Press Association: ""I have spent the last few days trying to imprint this beautiful landscape in my mind. We have called it home for close to two months now and I will, in a strange way, miss it a lot. ""The snow sparkles like there is a layer of pearls on the surface and everywhere you look there is beauty and stillness. The photos just don't do it justice."""

The shaven style comes after years of jokes about his premature hair loss from wife Kate and brother Prince Harry. It was reportedly done during a private session at Kensington Palace at a cost of £180. The Prince is understood to have got advice from Kate's hairdresser, Richard Ward, before taking the plunge. However one of Ward's deputies, Joey Wheeler, reportedly carried out the royal cut. Mr Ward charges a base fee of £125 for a men's cut and finish, according to his website. ""Wills sought Richard's advice, but it was Joey who was the one to visit the Palace and give him his new buzz cut,"" a source close to the hairdressers told The Sun. The real news about Prince William’s haircut is that mine is virtually identical to his and cost £6. Some expressed disbelief at the price of the Prince's haircut, with Twitter user Andrew S saying: ""The real news about Prince William's haircut is that mine is virtually identical to his and cost £6."" ""Why did Prince William's haircut allegedly cost £180? He hasn't got much of it left to cut!"" posted RC Robjohn. Why did Prince William’s haircut allegedly cost £180? He hasn’t got much of it left to cut! The Duke, 35, has long been teased by his family for his receding hairline. Prince Harry once said that his brother ""was already bald aged 12"". In 2014, Kate was on tour in Australia when she was shown a tuft of alpaca wool, similar in colour to William's hair. Pointing to her husband's head, she said: ""You need it more than me."" Bookmakers William Hill are now offering odds of 6/4 that he will sport a completely shaved head for Prince Harry's wedding. Odds are 1/2 that he'll stick with the current shaved style, and 16/1 that he will have a hair transplant. Award-winning British barber and charity founder Tom Chapman said Prince William was joining a number of well-known names in ""making the bald head sexy"". He added: ""It's a timeless look that has been on trend for many decades now. ""It's usually a cost effective cut, unless you're a royal! ""It's definitely an improvement and he should have done it many moons ago."""

Speaking at the Kennedy Forum mental health conference in Chicago, 32-year-old Phelps said: ""After every Olympics I think I fell into a major state of depression."" Phelps, who is the most decorated Olympian of all-time with 28 medals, said he remained in his room for four days without food or sleep after the 2012 London Games when he won four golds and two silvers. He said: ""I didn't want to be in the sport anymore. I didn't want to be alive. You do contemplate suicide."" The American sports star said he had battled depression and anxiety for the past 17 years. ""We're supposed to be this big, macho, physically strong human beings, but this is not a weakness,"" he said. ""We are seeking and reaching for help."" Phelps won his first gold medal in 2004 at the Athens Olympic Games and it was that year the 15-year-old from Baltimore experienced his first ""depression spell"". He said it had led him to abuse drugs and alcohol and in 2008, after winning a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Games, he was photographed smoking from a bong. He has also been arrested twice for drink-driving. Phelps said: ""It would be just me self-medicating myself, basically daily, to try to fix whatever it was that I was trying to run from.” Other Olympic heroes have also battled with mental health problems, including Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe, who broke 22 world records and wrote in his 2012 autobiography that as well as considering suicide, he also planned ways and places to do it. Thorpe chose to ""self-medicate"" with alcohol to control his violent mood swings and negative thoughts going through his head. Phelps said he wanted to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness. He said: ""Mental illness has a stigma around it and that's something we still deal with every day. ""I think people actually finally understand it is real. People are talking about it and I think this is the only way that it can change”. Phelps retired after the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, Brazil."

Of the 2,700 mums and dads who took part in the study published by the charity Working Families, nearly one in five said they had deliberately stalled their careers and more than one in 10 said they had had to rejected a promotion to try to regain some balance in the home. The charity's chief executive, Sarah Jackson, says the findings show how becoming a parent ""looks like a bad career move"". ""I think what we're seeing is the beginnings of a very perverse form of equality, that young men and young women may equally seem to be a bad investment for an employer because the employer doesn't know who is going to be the primary carer at home."" Employers often like to brag about their flexible working policies but in reality, according the findings, it isn't making much of a difference. Fewer than half - 44% - felt that flexible working was a genuine option in their place of work. Of those who were working flexibly, nearly one third (31%) said they had restrictions from their employer about where they had to work and one fifth said they had no control over their start and finish times. Richard Cahill, a dad of two, gets a little frustrated by the term. ""My personal experience has been that employers talk a good talk, but unfortunately when push comes to shove they're not as flexible as they'd like to be."" He found out for himself when he tried to switch jobs. Although he wanted to work less hours to fit around school pick-up times, he found employers struggled to grasp why a man would want to work part-time. ""Ultimately when it came to having our second child we realised that something had to change. We sat down and worked out what would be best for our family and that would be for me to get part-time work. ""I've certainly experienced discrimination, I've been asked at numerous interviews why is my wife not collecting the children, why is it down to me?"" On a daily basis, James Tugendhat - managing director of Bright Horizons nurseries that helped with the study - says his staff see how our long hours culture is taking its toll on families. ""The balance between work and life is just getting really hard and, with the financial squeeze that a lot of families are under now, life is becoming a real misery for some parents."""

2018-01-20,"Carillion, the bankrupt construction group, had financial liabilities worth about £5bn when it went bust this week, according to the most extreme calculation of its obligations to tens of thousands of pension scheme members.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180120230552/https://news.sky.com/story/revealed-carillion-collapsed-with-5bn-of-financial-liabilities-11213303,"Sky News can reveal that private analysis of Carillion's pension deficit on a Section 75 - or full buyout - basis has concluded that it was as high as £2.6bn, a far higher sum than the £587m accounting deficit referred to by its former chief executive in a High Court witness statement. The £2.6bn figure relates to the cost to Carillion of paying an insurance company to guarantee all of its pension liabilities, and is significant because it is likely to be the sum claimed on behalf of the pension schemes as part of the liquidation process, according to insiders. Sources said the full buyout deficit was also relevant because added to Carillion's other debts, including those owed to its banks, it takes Carillion's total financial obligations when it collapsed to roughly £5bn. The vast scale of the company's total indebtedness further dwarfs its comparatively minuscule market capitalisation of just £61m when the Official Receiver was called in on Monday morning. Although the pension schemes will lodge a claim for £2.6bn with the liquidator, there is no prospect of that money being paid, since Carillion failed with just £29m on its balance sheet. :: What ultimately went wrong at Carillion The Pension Protection Fund will now step in to provide compensation to 28,500 pension scheme members, with the total bill facing it likely to be up to £920m. The PPF pays a reduced level of retirement benefits to workers of companies which become insolvent, compared to their original entitlement. In addition to the £2.6bn Section 75 pension deficit, Carillion's liabilities when it went bust included £1.3bn owed to its banking syndicate; £350m arising from early payment facilities with suppliers; cross-guarantees of £630m relating to bonding facilities; £170m of convertible bonds guaranteed by the company; and an unknown debt to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, £16m of which was due by the end of the month. The size and complexity of Carillion's balance sheet are likely to be among the factors investigated during a multitude of probes into the conduct of the company's directors and auditors. Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, has ordered the Insolvency Service to fast-track an inquiry into the Carillion crisis, while the Financial Reporting Council has been asked to examine the work of KPMG, the company's auditor, and individual members. Ministers have scrambled since Carillion's collapse to exert a grip on its fallout, with fears for tens of thousands of subcontractors caught up in one of the biggest disasters to hit a major UK industrial group for decades. While Parliament's Liaison Committee, a consortium of all select committee chairs, was the latest to announce its own inquiry. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: ""I will be proposing we take evidence from the company directors, the trustees, the pensions regulator and the auditors who somehow concluded Carillion was a going concern."" News of the much-larger financial liabilities for Carillion comes days after Keith Cochrane, its interim chief executive, disclosed in a legal statement that the taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had tightened the terms of its funding to Carillion three days before it was forced to call in liquidators. :: The key personnel at Carillion Mr Cochrane, who has yet to speak publicly about the collapse of the company he had been in charge of since a profit warning sent its shares tumbling last July, accused RBS in his statement of taking ""unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". According to Mr Cochrane, RBS informed Carillion last Friday that it wanted the company to pre-fund supplier payments made through the bank, which meant it would need to make those payments two days earlier than cashflow forecasts had assumed. He said this negatively impacted Carillion's liquidity by between £2m and £20m. Santander UK, another member of the committee of Carillion's biggest lenders, was also criticised by Mr Cochrane for causing panic among the lending syndicate on 21 December by writing to the construction giant's suppliers notifying them of immediate changes to an Early Payment Facility (EPF) with the bank. The interim chief's statement details the increasingly frenetic nature of efforts to secure financial support from the Government, the taxman and its lenders in the months before its collapse. Its failure has left 19,500 UK staff fearing for their jobs and uncertainty about the viability of a number of major public sector projects, emboldening the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to declare that private companies should be stripped of Government contracts. A spokesman for Carillion's pension trustees declined to comment on Friday."

In a statement on his official Facebook page, Petty's widow Dana and daughter Adria revealed the results of a coroner's report into his death. They said Petty had ""passed away due to an accidental drug overdose as a result of taking a variety of medications"". ""Unfortunately Tom's body suffered from many serious ailments including emphysema, knee problems and most significantly a fractured hip,"" their statement said. ""Despite this painful injury he insisted on keeping his commitment to his fans and he toured for 53 dates with a fractured hip and, as he did, it worsened to a more serious injury. ""On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication."" Petty's family said he had been prescribed various pain medications including Fentanyl - the powerful painkiller which was also linked to Prince's death. ""We feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident,"" they added. Dana and Adria Petty said they hoped revealing the findings of the coroner's report would help save lives by sparking a ""healthy and necessary discussion"" on the ""opiod crisis"". ""Many people who overdose begin with a legitimate injury or simply do not understand the potency and deadly nature of these medications"", they said. They added that Petty had died ""painlessly and beautifully exhausted after doing what he loved the most"" following his 40th anniversary tour with his band, The Heartbreakers. ""He was extremely proud of that achievement in the days before he passed,"" the family said. ""We continue to mourn with you and marvel at Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' incredible positive impact on music and the world. And we thank you all for your love and support over the last months."" Petty, whose hits included American Girl, Free Fallin', I Won't Back Down and Don't Come Around Here No More, suffered a cardiac arrest at his Malibu home and could not be revived.

He warned the bar would have been ""very high"" and that there was ""no reasonable prospect of success"". Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Gauke told MPs: ""I believe that I owe it to those victims and to the public to consider all the options open to me. ""I therefore took the step of seeking legal advice from specialist leading counsel to establish whether there were grounds to challenge this decision in the courts and therefore to ask the court to stop the release of Worboys before the decision was reconsidered."" He added: ""Having taken considered and expert legal advice I have decided it would not be appropriate for me as Secretary of State to proceed with such a case. ""Honourable members will appreciate that I cannot go further and expose detail of the legal advice I have been given."" Mr Gauke did suggest he supported victims seeking their own advice, saying: ""Just because I am not taking action, does not mean others cannot."" Two of Worboys' victims have launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money to challenge the decision themselves. Labour MP Jo Stevens said that was because legal aid in judicial review cases had been ""severely restricted"" by the previous coalition government - and should be looked at again in light of the Worboys decision. Mr Gauke responded that he would not make a decision until after a review into the Parole Board had finished - expected by Easter. He did reveal the review would be widened to look at the way victims are contacted about their attacker's release. The Parole Board was forced to apologise and accused of leaving victims ""in the dark"" after terrified women attacked by Worboys complained they had not been told about the decision to release him. The Board said widening the review was a ""sensible course of action"" to make sure the public and victims have confidence in how it works. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan also announced he would be seeking a judicial review. Worboys has served a year more than the minimum eight-year sentence he was given for one rape, six sex attacks and the drugging of 12 women. Police believe he attacked at least 100 victims, but more allegations were not pursued either because evidence was poor, or due to the fact that more convictions would not have added to his sentence, prosecutors said."

A total of 1,155 men were being held at HMP Liverpool when it was assessed in September. Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said the prison had failed to act following a previous inspection in 2015, when 89 recommendations were made. He said there was an ""abject failure... to offer a safe, decent and purposeful environment"". The damning report found: :: Of those prisoners assessed, more than a third (37.5%) tested positive for drug use. :: More than a third of prisoners said they felt unsafe and half said they had been victimised by staff. :: Some cells had broken windows and emergency call bells that did not work; some areas had rats and cockroaches. :: Prisoners with mental health problems waited several months for an appointment. :: There was a backlog of some 2,000 maintenance tasks. :: Violence of all kinds had increased, with assaults on staff more than tripling since the 2015 assessment. :: Urgent alert over 'fundamentally unsafe' Nottingham prison Mr Clarke wrote in his report: ""The inspection team was highly experienced and could not recall having seen worse living conditions than those at HMP Liverpool. ""The presence of inspectors seemed to provoke some piecemeal and superficial attempts at cleaning and the like, but the fear was that this would stop as soon as we left, which is clearly what happened after the last inspection."" He criticised the ""squalid"" environment and said many cells were ""not fit to be used"". One recently released prisoner told Sky News: ""It's absolutely appalling in there. They do absolutely nothing for you."" Having also been in a number of other prisons, he said HMP Liverpool was ""a different world compared to the other ones"". ""If you're scared of going to hell, trust me, come in here and you're not going to be scared of going to hell after this. ""I know we're criminals, we've done something wrong... but at the end of the day it's inhumane."" The Commons Justice Committee is to hold an evidence session on the findings next week. Michael Spurr, chief executive of HM Prison and Probation Service, acknowledged conditions at the prison were ""unacceptable"" and said ""immediate"" action was taken to fix the situation following the assessment. A new governor has been appointed, cleanliness has been improved and the maintenance backlog almost halved, he said. ""We are committed to fixing this, have already made changes where we can, and have today published a comprehensive action plan to address the chief inspector's concerns."""

However, the case has now been dropped after fresh evidence, including a diary that supported his case, was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service last week. Surrey Police has admitted ""there were flaws in the investigation"" after the force failed to examine the woman's ""digital media"" or follow ""a reasonable line of enquiry"". The woman's digital media was only handed to prosecutors on Monday. Prosecutor Sarah Lindop told Guildford Crown Court on Friday that the case was ""finely balanced"" from the start and the new material ""tips the balance"" in favour of Mr Mears. Judge Jonathan Black demanded the head of the CPS rape and sexual offences unit write to him within 28 days ""with a full explanation of what went wrong"" before he decides whether any action is required ""at CPS or police level"". ""It seems to me in a case which is as finely balanced as you say it was, there have been unnecessary delays in investigating... leading to what seems to be a completely unnecessary last-minute decision in this case,"" he said. The judge said that both Mr Mears and the complainant would not have had the ""matter hanging over their heads for two years"" if ""the investigation had been carried out properly in the first instance"". :: Student after rape trial thrown out: ""I've spent two years living in fear"" Ms Lindop admitted there were ""some disclosure matters"" in Mr Mears's case, but said it ""is not a disclosure case per se"". ""There was a diary produced. Part of that was disclosed, we asked for the full copy of it,"" she told the judge. The court heard Mr Mears's lawyers asked to see the full diary in October last year and the prosecutor explained: ""The police have been trying to secure that."" Surrey Police said the case was dropped for ""a number of reasons"", only one of which related to the force. ""On January 5 2018, the CPS requested that we provide materials from the victim's digital media,"" a spokesman for the force said. ""We then contacted the victim, obtained the devices and provided the available material to the CPS on January 15. ""Surrey Police deeply regrets mistakes made in the efficacy of investigations and will always seek to implement continual improvement and specific learning points. "" The force has launched a joint review of the case with the CPS. A CPS spokesman said that following a review of the case, ""prosecutors were not satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction"". It comes after Scotland Yard announced a review of every one of its sex crime investigations, where a suspect has been charged, following the collapse of two rape prosecutions in a week. The CPS offered no evidence against both Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary after the late disclosure of evidence that could have assisted the defendants."

Sky News also understands, from British sources, that French President Emmanuel Macron replied: ""I agree, let's do it."" :: Macron: UK must pay for City deal after Brexit During Thursday's summit, Mr Johnson - a leading Brexit supporter - had hailed the ""important work"" taking place. He posted on Twitter: ""I'm especially pleased we are establishing a panel of experts to look at major projects together. ""Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. ""Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?"" He later posted a picture of himself and Mr Macron both making a thumbs up gesture. It was reported that Mr Johnson had specifically spoken of a potential bridge across the Channel. Industry groups have poured scorn in the idea of a bridge across the Channel. Jonathan Roberts, communications director at UK Chamber of Shipping, told Sky News: ""Building a huge concrete structure in the middle of the world's busiest shipping lane might come with some challenges.

The UK Chamber of Shipping also posted: ""Building a huge concrete structure in the middle of the world's busiest shipping lane might come with some challenges."" Prior to the building of the Channel Tunnel, opened in 1994, the prospect of a road bridge between Britain and France had been considered. A submission for a £3bn three-lane motorway link was made to transport officials in 1981, according to the National Archives. Over the past decade, China has built some of the world's longest bridges, with the cross-water Jiaozhou Bay link spanning more than 25 miles."

The claims were made by Fusion GPS boss Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the investigative firm behind the controversial ""Trump dossier"" which was released by former British spy Christopher Steele. The unsubstantiated dossier was put together during the election campaign and was partially funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democrats. It was also given to the FBI. It claimed there was collusion between Mr Trump's presidential campaign and Russia before he entered the White House, and that the Russians have information that could be used to blackmail the President - claims he fiercely denies. However, during his appearance before the committee in November, Mr Simpson said his interest in the Trump campaign's links to UKIP and WikiLeaks were separate from ex-MI6 inteligence officer Mr Steele's investigations. According to a transcript of Mr Simpson's testimony released by the House Intelligence Committee, he claimed WikiLeaks was part of a ""somewhat unacknowledged relationship"" between the Trump team and the ""UKIP people"". He said that Mr Farage became ""someone that we were very interested in"" after the EU referendum vote in June 2016. ""I still think it's very interesting,"" he said. ""And so I have formed my own opinions... that there was a somewhat unacknowledged relationship between the Trump people and the UKIP people and that the path to WikiLeaks ran through that. And I still think that today."" Mr Simpson said while there had been reports of one visit Mr Farage made to the Ecuadorian embassy - where Mr Assange has been living since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden - he believed the pair had met more often than is widely known. ""I've been told and have not confirmed that Nigel Farage had additional trips to the Ecuadoran embassy than the one that's been in the papers and that he provided data to Julian Assange,"" he said. Asked what kind of data, he replied: ""A thumb drive."" Mr Farage was pictured leaving the Ecuadorian embassy on March 9 last year, but at the time refused to say whether he had met with Mr Assange. WikiLeaks has been accused by Mrs Clinton of acting as a ""fully owned subsidiary of Russian intelligence"" after it published damaging emails, allegedly stolen by Russian operatives, during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In June last year, Mr Farage dismissed a report that he was a ""person of interest"" in the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between Mr Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. He campaigned openly for the billionaire businessman and US reality TV star, and was one of the first people to meet him in Trump Tower after his election victory. He also hired the top floor of an exclusive five-star hotel in Washington DC to host a party celebrating Mr Trump's inauguration. Mr Trump also suggested Mr Farage should be appointed the UK's ambassador to the US. Mr Farage issued a one-line statement responding to the claims. He said: ""This is conspiratorial nonsense."""

In 1991 the country, neighbouring the province, became known as The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - or FYROM - after declaring independence. Greece has opposed the name ever since, saying its region has been named Macedonia since Alexander the Great - also known as Alexander III of Macedon - ruled from 336 BC. Athens argues the name Macedonia suggests Skopje has territorial claims to the northern Greece region. Rally organisers claimed 400,000 people took part in Sunday's protest, while police estimated the crowd at 100,000. The rally was poignantly staged in front of the statue of Alexander the Great. In 2004, then US President George W Bush caused anger in Greece when he recognised the FYROM as Macedonia. Until then all NATO allies, apart from Turkey, had joined Greece in refusing to recognise the Balkan state's new name. Central Macedonia, in Greece, is the country's most popular tourist destination."
2018-01-21,"For retailers, it's been a tough day, after a tough Christmas, after a tough year. And for some, it's looking a lot worse than it is for others.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180122000233/https://news.sky.com/story/retail-crisis-what-the-numbers-really-tell-us-about-the-high-street-11213675,"Take Carpetright. Back in the summer of 2015, shares in the company were trading for £6 each. Carpetright was optimistic and apparently doing well. On Friday, it released a miserable trading statement, bemoaning poor sales and a difficult retail environment, and duly saw its shares collapse. They fell by more than 40%, tumbling to around 93p per share. Not quite a Carillion-style decline, but certainly confirmation that customers are keeping a close eye on their money. We tend to buy new carpets at two times - either when we move, or when we're feeling a bit flush with cash. And right now, there's not a huge market in either of those. The housing market has slowed and, with inflation outstripping wage growth, household spending has started to tighten. Mixed into this were Friday's figures about retail sales, which were seized upon as evidence of a spiral of decline. There was widespread coverage that sales had posted their biggest fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum, dropping 1.5%. Annual growth was just 1.4%, down from 1.5% the previous month. But scratch into these figures, and the picture is a little more complicated. :: Mothercare shares slump after profit warning For one thing, those disappointing sales figures are for the quantity of goods being bought. If you change that into the money being spent on them, you see that spending has actually gone up by 4.4% over the past year. So we are spending more money, but we're ending up with fewer things. That's the effect of general inflation, which peaked at the end of last year. It's also the result of something specific - inflation in the shops. Between July 2014 and November 2016, prices on the shelves actually declined as retailers battled against each other to grab a share of the market. Then, as the effect of the currency movement after the referendum started to kick in, retailers decided that they would have to pass on some of the increase in costs to consumers. That's when prices started to go up, which led to inflation, and, with the occasional quiet period, they've been gradually rising ever since. :: Jobs threat as Debenhams issues profit warning But so have sales - yes, the rate of increase has slowed, but both the quantity and value of sales are still going up. Secondly, there's something about these figures that is misleading. It's not so long since December was, by far, the most important month of the year for retailers, but those days have now gone, thanks to Black Friday - which happens in November. Now, a lot of us do our Christmas shopping in November, when the Black Friday sales start. So it turns out that we spent 0.9% less money in December than we did in November, and bought 1.5% fewer things. But if you lump together October, November and December into one quarter then things look healthier. All this matters because household spending has helped to prop up the UK's economy ever since the financial crisis. If it slowed markedly, the economy would suffer. There's no question that retail sales are becoming more sluggish. Even online sales, which have been growing like topsy, have hit a speedbump. But, with the exception of a few specific retail companies, nothing has yet fallen off a cliff."

Of the 2,700 mums and dads who took part in the study published by the charity Working Families, nearly one in five said they had deliberately stalled their careers and more than one in 10 said they had had to rejected a promotion to try to regain some balance in the home. The charity's chief executive, Sarah Jackson, says the findings show how becoming a parent ""looks like a bad career move"". ""I think what we're seeing is the beginnings of a very perverse form of equality, that young men and young women may equally seem to be a bad investment for an employer because the employer doesn't know who is going to be the primary carer at home."" Employers often like to brag about their flexible working policies but in reality, according the findings, it isn't making much of a difference. Fewer than half - 44% - felt that flexible working was a genuine option in their place of work. Of those who were working flexibly, nearly one third (31%) said they had restrictions from their employer about where they had to work and one fifth said they had no control over their start and finish times. Richard Cahill, a dad of two, gets a little frustrated by the term. ""My personal experience has been that employers talk a good talk, but unfortunately when push comes to shove they're not as flexible as they'd like to be."" He found out for himself when he tried to switch jobs. Although he wanted to work less hours to fit around school pick-up times, he found employers struggled to grasp why a man would want to work part-time. ""Ultimately when it came to having our second child we realised that something had to change. We sat down and worked out what would be best for our family and that would be for me to get part-time work. ""I've certainly experienced discrimination, I've been asked at numerous interviews why is my wife not collecting the children, why is it down to me?"" On a daily basis, James Tugendhat - managing director of Bright Horizons nurseries that helped with the study - says his staff see how our long hours culture is taking its toll on families. ""The balance between work and life is just getting really hard and, with the financial squeeze that a lot of families are under now, life is becoming a real misery for some parents."""

Club chair and chief executive Pam Duxbury, who has been holding the fort since the beginning of last year, is hopeful someone will buy the club and pump in the £1m a year it takes to keep it afloat. ""I’m reviewing it on a daily basis,"" she said. Her message to potential buyers is simple: ""If you’ve got £1m, I want you to come."" If the club slips into administration it will automatically lose 10 points and could drop out of the National League and down to the sixth tier; a world away from the big money of top-flight football. It's not a future they want to think about at Parker's Bakery on one of Hartlepool’s industrial estates where 1,000 pies are being baked for the 7,500 supporters who will pack out the Wrexham game. Owner Dave Hope, a lifelong Hartlepool fan who admits he doesn't attend matches these days, says the firm will survive if the club folds, but that's not the point. In a town whose fortunes have waned along with the heavy industry and the chemical works that once made it a powerhouse, the difficulties the club is facing are keenly felt. ""We've had things like shops go bust on us,"" he said, ""but it's the football part of it I wouldn’t like to lose."" His worried parting shot echoed legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly, who famously said football was more important than life and death: ""It’s not just that we're supplying pies to them, it’s part of life isn't it."""
2018-01-21,An influential Conservative MP has asked Jeremy Hunt to delay controversial reforms designed to change the way NHS funds are overseen.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180122000233/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-urged-to-delay-nhs-shake-up-to-integrate-health-and-social-care-11214052,"The chair of the Health Committee, Sarah Wollaston, has written to the Health Secretary expressing concerns about the introduction of accountable care organisations (ACOs) There is currently a lawsuit supported by physicist Stephen Hawking which aims to stop the new system due to be introduced in some areas of England in April, amid fears it will benefit private companies while reducing the provision of services. Dr Wollaston writes to Mr Hunt: ""I am writing to request that you delay the introduction of the new contract for accountable care organisations until after the Health Committee has taken the opportunity to hear evidence on the issues around the introduction of accountable care models to the NHS. ""As I am sure you are aware, a great deal of concern has been expressed about the development of ACOs in the NHS. I expect the committee to consider these concerns."" The committee will assess the reforms in February and March, with a view to reporting after Easter. ACOs have been promoted by Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, as a way of integrating health service bodies and providers of social care to the benefit of patients. However, opponents fear it is a route to privatisation, giving the ACOs' control of budgets and incentives to restrict care. Announcing he was challenging the changes, Professor Hawking told the Guardian last month: ""They appear to be being used for reducing public expenditure, for cutting services and for allowing private companies to receive and benefit from significant sums of public money for organising and providing services."" A campaign group called 999 Call for the NHS is raising funds for the legal challenge due to take place at Leeds High Court in April. On its crowdfunding site it says the contract allows the ACOs to ""keep the money left over at the end of the year"". It adds: ""This new payment mechanism is supposed to drive efficiency and incentivise accountable care organisations to 'manage demand' for NHS and social care services, but we are concerned that financial decisions not clinical need would determine patients' access to treatment."" Dr Wollaston told Sky News that there appeared to be a lot of ""misinformation"" about the new scheme and she hoped that ""both sides can put their guns down"", while her committee assesses the evidence. However, that would mean Mr Hunt delaying a key part of his five-year blueprint to modernise the Health Service. Dr Wollaston argues that delaying the introduction of the planned contract changes until the committee has examined both sides of the argument would be ""a sensible step in ensuring that public confidence is maintained in developments in the NHS"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Secretary of State will be responding to the letter from Dr Sarah Wollaston MP and the Health Committee shortly. ""ACOs are about integrating care and bringing services together, so people’s care is coordinated around them – not the other way round. ""ACOs will help deliver more care in the community and patients' homes, improving access to services and meaning fewer trips to hospital."" Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour's shadow health secretary, said Dr Wollaston had made ""an important and welcome contribution to the debate"" about ACOs. He said: ""Ministers have failed to reassure us these won't be a vehicle for large-scale private sector involvement in running local health services. ""Given the Carillion debacle, this call from the Health Select Committee chair is timely and must not be dismissed by Jeremy Hunt."""
2018-01-21,The number of people murdered in Mexico reached a record high in 2017 as a wave of violence sweeps across the country.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180122000233/https://news.sky.com/story/mexico-murder-rate-soars-as-more-than-25000-people-killed-in-2017-11217119,"The body count for last year reached 25,339 as gang warfare and furious battles against drug lords are being waged in more regions than ever before. Figures based on murders between January and November had already established 2017 as a record-breaking year for homicides in the country - but an additional 2,219 people were killed in December alone. The previous record for murders in Mexico was 22,409, in 2011. Many areas of the country have been seemingly under siege as criminals, police and military fight for control since Felipe Calderon launched a controversial anti-drug operation in 2006. Some 200,000 people are thought to have died in the violence. The figures for 2017 do not outline what percentage of the murders are related to organised crime but experts predict it is a large majority. The bulk of murders were recorded in states where drug cartels are deeply entrenched. They include Guerrero in the south, where tourists have enjoyed the bay of Acapulco, and Veracruz in the east. But the bloodshed has also spread to areas previously untouched, including Baja California Sur, Colima and Guanajuato. It comes after the capture of key cartel leaders, which analysts say may have sparked a rise in the number of autonomous criminal groups. In an attempt to address the rise in attacks, Mexico's congress has approved another controversial law that formalised the military's role in security. The move drew criticism from rights groups who are concerned about militarisation of the country. The homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants in Mexico is now 20.51 - up from 16.80 in 2016 when 20,545 people were murdered."

The flight, from Gatwick to Mauritius, was scheduled to leave at 8.20pm on Thursday, but it was delayed at the gate as officers boarded the plane and removed the pilot. The incident delayed the flight's departure by over two hours. Police said a 49-year-old man from Harmondsworth, Hillingdon, was ""arrested on suspicion of performing an aviation function while his alcohol level was over the prescribed limit"". He was taken into custody and later released under investigation on Friday. British Airways said it was taking the matter ""extremely seriously"" and is assisting police with their inquiries. A spokesperson said: ""We are sorry for the delay to our customers. The aircraft remained at the gate until an alternative third pilot joined the crew. ""The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority."""

He warned the bar would have been ""very high"" and that there was ""no reasonable prospect of success"". Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Gauke told MPs: ""I believe that I owe it to those victims and to the public to consider all the options open to me. ""I therefore took the step of seeking legal advice from specialist leading counsel to establish whether there were grounds to challenge this decision in the courts and therefore to ask the court to stop the release of Worboys before the decision was reconsidered."" He added: ""Having taken considered and expert legal advice I have decided it would not be appropriate for me as Secretary of State to proceed with such a case. ""Honourable members will appreciate that I cannot go further and expose detail of the legal advice I have been given."" Mr Gauke did suggest he supported victims seeking their own advice, saying: ""Just because I am not taking action, does not mean others cannot."" Two of Worboys' victims have launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money to challenge the decision themselves. Labour MP Jo Stevens said that was because legal aid in judicial review cases had been ""severely restricted"" by the previous coalition government - and should be looked at again in light of the Worboys decision. Mr Gauke responded that he would not make a decision until after a review into the Parole Board had finished - expected by Easter. He did reveal the review would be widened to look at the way victims are contacted about their attacker's release. The Parole Board was forced to apologise and accused of leaving victims ""in the dark"" after terrified women attacked by Worboys complained they had not been told about the decision to release him. The Board said widening the review was a ""sensible course of action"" to make sure the public and victims have confidence in how it works. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan also announced he would be seeking a judicial review. Worboys has served a year more than the minimum eight-year sentence he was given for one rape, six sex attacks and the drugging of 12 women. Police believe he attacked at least 100 victims, but more allegations were not pursued either because evidence was poor, or due to the fact that more convictions would not have added to his sentence, prosecutors said."

Moments later, team leader Major Nics Wetherill told Sky News: ""We're feeling so happy right now. ""We're so relieved. It's a complete mix of emotions right now... excitement, relief, happiness... glad this is all over."" Major Wetherill was joined by Major Natalie Taylor, both of the Royal Army Medical Corps, and four others. Together, they travelled up to 27 miles a day, navigating crevasses as they pulled sledges weighing up to 80kg (176lbs) and battling temperatures as low as -50C. The expedition began on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf on 20 November and involved climbing the Transantarctic Mountains, via the Leverett Glacier, to reach the polar plateau. They took in new supplies at the South Pole before they made their way to Hercules Inlet, skiing 373 miles across uneven ground, and spent Christmas Day on the ice before arriving at their final re-supply point at the base of the Thiel Mountains. From there they descended to the Hercules Inlet to the finish line. Major Wetherill told how they were ""lucky with the weather"" and were had prepared well with seven weeks in Norway before the expedition began, allowing them to get ""all our routines down to a tee"". ""Our timings were tight and we worked really well as a team... it meant that we managed to cover some ground over a good amount of time,"" she said, adding: ""We finished a lot faster than we thought."" The other four members of the team were reservist Major Sandy Hennis of the Royal Signals, Captain Zanna Baker and Lieutenant Jenni Stephenson, both of the Royal Artillery, and Honourable Artillery Company reservist Lance Sergeant Sophie Montagne. Major Wetherill told of the challenges they faced, saying: ""I'm glad to say that everyone has all their 10 fingers, 10 toes, two ears and one nose."" Major Taylor told Press Association: ""I have spent the last few days trying to imprint this beautiful landscape in my mind. We have called it home for close to two months now and I will, in a strange way, miss it a lot.

The Met Office has updated a yellow ""be aware"" warning of snow and ice to cover much of Scotland, north Wales and England down to southern parts. The warning, which is effective from 6am to 6pm on Sunday, predicts snow on higher routes and says that rain may fall onto frozen surfaces for a time. People are being warned to take extra care as icy patches are likely on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths. There is also a possibility of some disruption to journeys by road, bus and train on affected routes. :: UK Weather: The latest Sky News forecast Traffic Scotland said drivers should check their routes before setting off and make sure they are carrying emergency supplies in case they are stranded. North Wales Police said conditions on the roads were poor because of snow and ice, particularly on routes in Snowdonia and on the Isle of Man. Snowy conditions have seen crowds flock to Scottish ski resorts over the weekend. On Friday in Glencoe, blizzard conditions hampered a rescue operation to save two skiers stranded without shelter at 3,000ft. They were winched into a coastguard helicopter at first light on Saturday and taken to hospital by ambulance. Skiers heading to resorts are being warned not to park on the verges after disruption on Saturday and warned that cars causing obstructions may be seized. Skiers faced six-mile tailbacks on their way to the slopes at Glencoe Mountain Resort to take advantage of the snowy conditions. Drivers were forced to abandon their cars on the roads as they tried to reach the resorts where car parks were full. Saturday night brought the coldest temperature in the UK since 14 February 2016, when -14.1C (6.6F) was recorded at Braemar in Aberdeenshire. Homes have been evacuated and roads are blocked in north Devon following widespread flooding caused by heavy rain, police said. People were forced to flee homes in Kentisbury, near Barnstaple, and other properties were flooded in Combe Martin on nearby Exmoor, Devon and Cornwall Police said. The A399 at Combe Martin has been closed following a landslide reported at 10.35am on Sunday with a police spokesman saying part of the carriageway has collapsed. The A361 is also closed near Landkey in Barnstaple and mudslides have been reported at Muddiford, north of Barnstaple. Sky News weather presenter Isobel Lang said temperatures will pick up during the new week. She added: ""This is probably the last day of winter warnings. ""Any for the coming week will be wind and rain warnings. There could be some flooding from the combination of rain and snowmelt."""
2018-01-21,"France would ""probably"" have voted to leave the EU if it had held an in/out referendum, according to the country's leader.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180122000233/https://news.sky.com/story/emmanuel-macron-french-would-probably-vote-to-leave-eu-11216872,"Emmanuel Macron attributed the UK's decision to leave the EU to British voters' loss of faith in globalisation and unrestricted free markets. The French President suggested there is ""always a risk"" with votes such as Britain's 2016 referendum, when asking the public ""just 'yes' or 'no' in a very complicated context"". Asked whether a Leave or Remain vote in France could have ended with the same result, Mr Macron told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Yes, probably. Probably in a similar context. But our context was very different so I don't want to take any bets."" Mr Macron, as a committed supporter of European integration, added he would fight ""very hard"" to keep France in the EU if it were to hold a referendum on membership of the bloc. He added: ""It's a mistake when you just ask 'yes' or 'no', when you don't ask people how to improve the situation and to explain how to improve it."" Offering his interpretation of Britain's vote to leave the EU, Mr Macron said: ""My understanding is that middle-classes and working-classes - and especially the oldest in your country - decided that the recent decades were not in their favour. ""And that the adjustments made by both [the] EU and globalisation - for me it was a mix of both of them - was not in their favour. ""And second I think one of the reasons was precisely an organisation of our EU probably which gets too far in terms of freedom without cohesion. ""Towards free market without any rules and any convergence."" Also appearing on the show, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell claimed he agreed with Mr Macron's assessment that Brexit was due to a sense that ""neoliberalism has alienated people"". The French President, who visited Britain last week for a major UK-France summit, also used the interview to repeat his insistence that full access to the EU's single market for UK financial services ""is not feasible"" after Brexit. But he did claim the UK will secure a bespoke trade deal, although only in the context of preserving the bloc's single market. The Prime Minister has repeatedly outlined her wish for a post-Brexit trade deal including both goods and services. Mr McDonnell suggested Mr Macron was being ""fairly hard-nosed"" about the EU's approach to UK financial services as he predicted a ""softening"" once Brexit negotiations on a future relationship begin. Mr Macron's suggestion is not the first time he has warned French voters might seek a ""Frexit"". Shortly before being elected to the presidency last year, in which he came head-to-head with eurosceptic far-right campaigner Marine Le Pen, Mr Macron told how people in France were impatient and so angry that the ""dysfunction"" of the EU was ""not sustainable"". Mr Macron has insisted the bloc is in need of reform and vowed to make it one of his main areas of focus, laying out plans for a Europe-wide finance minister as part of a process of deeper integration."

The funeral mass is expected to be broadcast live by local radio. The 46-year-old Cranberries frontwoman was found dead in a hotel in London last Monday. She was in the city for a recording session when she was discovered in her room. Police have said they believe her death to be non-suspicious. It comes as an inquest into O'Riordan's sudden death was opened on Friday in London, during which it was heard that a series of tests were carried out to establish a cause of death. The hearing has been adjourned until 3 April, when a date for a full inquest will be set. The musician rose to fame in the 1990s and became renowned for her distinctive voice. The Cranberries enjoyed huge success with tracks such as Linger and Zombie.

When police traced Arshid to a Holiday Inn in Folkestone and seized his laptops, they discovered he had searched online for ""human cremation"", ""butchering the human carcass"", and ""acid bath murderer"". Crispin Aylett QC told the Old Bailey that a Google search eventually led the builder to a Wikipedia page about Haigh, who was hanged in 1949 for murdering six people and disposing of their remains in different ways. He said Arshid was ""inspired"" by Haigh to set up a new Google email address ineedanacidbath@space.com, and viewed a YouTube video entitled ""Woman cut throat"". Officers were able to find Ms Dookhran - who had tape wrapped around her mouth and a sock stuffed inside, with three cuts to the neck slicing through her voice box - after another woman involved in the ordeal gave information from her hospital bed. The court heard how Arshid had allegedly enlisted the help of 28-year-old labourer Vincent Tappu to kidnap both of them by bundling them into the boot of his pick-up truck. They were said to have been bound and gagged as he drove them to a six-bedroom southwest London home he was renovating, and upon arrival they were raped and had their throats cut. The surviving woman only managed to escape after tricking Arshid into thinking they could be together, and she told the court the ""psycho"" builder had told her she had ""10 minutes to live"" after killing her friend. Ms Dookhran's family wept in court as the survivor recounted her experience from her hospital bed, with bandages on her arms. In a police interview, she said they were abducted by Arshid and his Taser-wielding accomplice and described hearing screams and thuds as Barclays worker Ms Dookhran was killed. When Arshid turned on her, the witness - who cannot legally be identified - allegedly told him: ""No, no, no we need to talk."" She told the court: ""I started fighting, I grabbed him, kneed him down below. He did not flinch at all. I grabbed his face. I grabbed the knife. He started to slit me everywhere. I got my neck slit, my wrists. ""He said 'now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down'. I was trying to play dead. ""He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. I sat up and he said 'how have you got so much energy?' I was covered in blood from head to toe. I was swimming in it. ""I started saying things he wanted to hear - 'I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family.' ""He said 'I'm not good enough for you, look what I have done'."" The woman managed to raise the alarm and was rescued by Arshid's brother, who saw her in the back of his truck and took her to St George's Hospital in Tooting. She later told police where they could find 5ft 3in tall Ms Dookhran, who died from a loss of blood and obstruction to the airways, a post-mortem found. Arshid, of no fixed address, and Tappu, of Spencer Road, Acton, west London, deny kidnap, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm with intent. Arshid has also pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder, rape of both women and the previous sexual assault and assault by penetration of the surviving woman when she was about 13. The trial continues."

She was taken to hospital but died soon afterwards. A post-mortem examination will take place on Monday to establish the exact cause of Mylee's death. A 54-year-old man, with a stab wound to his stomach, was arrested in connection with the incident. He is in a critical condition in hospital. Detective Inspector Jim Colclough, from the homicide unit, said: ""This is an absolutely tragic set of circumstances and my thoughts are with everyone who has been affected. ""We are still at the early stages of understanding exactly what happened and why - but I can confirm we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this investigation."" Neighbours said they were stunned to hear that a child had died. Bob Weir, whose home is two doors away from the bungalow where the incident happened, said a middle-aged man lived at the now sealed-off property, apparently on his own. Mr Weir, 72, added: ""I didn't hear until this morning what it was and I was absolutely shocked - I didn't know the bloke who lived there and he hadn't lived there long, maybe six months, if that. ""There were police cars both sides of the road, ambulances... all sorts."" He added: ""I didn't know there were any kids in there. I thought he just lived on his own.

The area is highly regarded because an unsuccessful fight in the 1870s to prevent Manchester Corporation from flooding the valley was one of the driving forces behind the birth of the conservation movement in the UK. Developer Treetop Trek says their scheme complies with national park planning policy and would broaden the range of people enjoying the Lake District. Their plans state the zip wires and a cycleway below would create 53 jobs and attract 127,000 visitors a year, including youngsters. But the Ministry of Defence claims the plans would cause a ""significant hazard"" and has submitted a formal objection. A letter from the Defence Infrastructure Organisation states: ""The Lake District is used by both experienced crews and students undertaking Basic Fast Jet Training, Advanced Flying Training and those from the Defence Helicopter School. ""[That] activity stands to be severely affected, with impacts recognised in safety, cost, efficiency and output."" A Cumbrian protest group called Zip Off has been campaigning against the scheme and has plans for a mass rally in the valley next weekend. Campaigner and local film maker Terry Abraham believes the proposal goes against everything the area stands for. ""National parks were set up to protect, preserve and enhance these special special landscapes,"" he said. ""I just find it shocking, really audacious of Treetop Trek to think a theme park ride... would be appropriate in this location."" Mike Turner, the owner of Treetop Trek, said the MOD had previously stated that it would not object to the project. ""We are therefore very surprised by this apparent change in stance and are currently seeking their further clarification,"" he said. The Lake District National Park Authority will provide an update on the scheme this week and say whether or not it will debate the proposal at its meeting next month."
2018-01-21,UKIP's ruling body has passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in party leader Henry Bolton following a row over his 25-year-old girlfriend.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180122000233/https://news.sky.com/story/ukip-leader-henry-bolton-loses-no-confidence-vote-11217393,"The party's National Executive Committee (NEC) held an emergency meeting on Sunday after married father-of-three Mr Bolton, 54, faced growing calls to quit over his relationship with model Jo Marney. Mr Bolton ended the ""romantic element"" of their relationship last week, when it emerged party activist Ms Marney had sent offensive messages about Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle. She was also reported to have sent separate messages making jokes about child sexual abuse. UKIP members will now decide whether to endorse or reject the ruling body's assessment of Mr Bolton's leadership at an emergency general meeting. The news comes less than four months since he was elected. Following Sunday's meeting, party chairman Paul Oakden said: ""In an emergency meeting of the UKIP National Executive today, a discussion took place on recent press coverage of the party leader, Henry Bolton. ""Having heard a statement from Mr Bolton, the NEC asked a number of questions pertaining to that coverage. ""At the conclusion of that discussion, the committee took the decision to hold a vote of no confidence in the leadership of Henry Bolton. ""The vote was carried unanimously, with the exception of the leader. ""This decision will automatically trigger an EGM of the party, to allow the membership of UKIP the democratic opportunity to decide to endorse or reject that vote of no confidence."" This meeting will be held within the next month - unless Mr Bolton resigns first. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Bolton had defiantly refused to stand down and insisted the party ""cannot afford"" a third leadership contest in the space of two years. Telling UKIP bosses they would have to force him out, Mr Bolton told Sky News: ""The party cannot afford the disruption of a change in leadership - so I'm not going anywhere."" The former British Army officer also suggested that, if UKIP's NEC acted against him, it could spell the party's end. His assertion was backed up by former leader Nigel Farage, who admitted he was ""concerned"" about the future of the party and wondered whether UKIP would survive another leadership election. Since Mr Farage stood down after the Brexit vote in 2016, UKIP has had three permanent leaders and two acting leaders, including a temporary return by Mr Farage himself. Commenting on Sunday's decision by UKIP's ruling body, the party's Brexit spokesman Gerard Batten posted on Twitter: ""UKIP NEC passed a unanimous vote of No Confidence in Henry Bolton. ""He should do the decent thing and resign. For God's sake GO!"""

He had just returned home to England after completing a tour in Florida with The Zombies with his final on-stage appearance coming on 14 January. His cousin and the band's frontman Rod Argent paid tribute to his ""dear cousin and lifelong friend"", writing on the band's Facebook page: ""It is with deep sadness that I learned this morning that my dear cousin and lifelong friend, Jim Rodford, died this morning after a fall on the stairs. ""Jim was not only a magnificent bass player, but also from the first inextricably bound to the story of The Zombies."" Argent said Rodford was dedicated to music ""to the end"" and added he ""was unfailingly committed to local music"". The Kinks' Dave Davies paid tribute on Twitter, writing: ""I'm devastated Jim's sudden loss I'm too broken up to put words together it's such a shock ""I always thought Jim would live forever in true rock and roll fashion - strange - great friend great musician great man - he was an integral part of The Kinks later years RIP."" Walter James ""Jim"" Rodford was born 7 July, 1941 and began playing bass in the late '50s with St Albans' skiffle band The Bluetones. He helped Argent form The Zombies in 1961, declining an invitation to join the group but coached them through their first rehearsals. Following the break-up of The Zombies in 1968, he joined Argent's new band - the eponymously named Argent - with gold records and chart success following as they released Hold Your Head Up and God Gave Rock & Roll To You. When Argent split in 1976 Rodford joined The Kinks during their later years and until their dissolution in 1996 when he came full circle by eventually joining The Zombies, as they were resurrected by Argent and Colin Blunstone in 1999. He spent the next 18 years recording and touring with The Zombies until his last performance in Florida. Rodford had been working on his autobiography at the time of his death and is survived by his wife of 56 years, Jean and three generations of Rodfords."
2018-01-21,"Carillion, the bankrupt construction group, had financial liabilities worth about £5bn when it went bust this week, according to the most extreme calculation of its obligations to tens of thousands of pension scheme members.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180122000233/https://news.sky.com/story/revealed-carillion-collapsed-with-5bn-of-financial-liabilities-11213303,"Sky News can reveal that private analysis of Carillion's pension deficit on a Section 75 - or full buyout - basis has concluded that it was as high as £2.6bn, a far higher sum than the £587m accounting deficit referred to by its former chief executive in a High Court witness statement. The £2.6bn figure relates to the cost to Carillion of paying an insurance company to guarantee all of its pension liabilities, and is significant because it is likely to be the sum claimed on behalf of the pension schemes as part of the liquidation process, according to insiders. Sources said the full buyout deficit was also relevant because added to Carillion's other debts, including those owed to its banks, it takes Carillion's total financial obligations when it collapsed to roughly £5bn. The vast scale of the company's total indebtedness further dwarfs its comparatively minuscule market capitalisation of just £61m when the Official Receiver was called in on Monday morning. Although the pension schemes will lodge a claim for £2.6bn with the liquidator, there is no prospect of that money being paid, since Carillion failed with just £29m on its balance sheet. :: What ultimately went wrong at Carillion The Pension Protection Fund will now step in to provide compensation to 28,500 pension scheme members, with the total bill facing it likely to be up to £920m. The PPF pays a reduced level of retirement benefits to workers of companies which become insolvent, compared to their original entitlement. In addition to the £2.6bn Section 75 pension deficit, Carillion's liabilities when it went bust included £1.3bn owed to its banking syndicate; £350m arising from early payment facilities with suppliers; cross-guarantees of £630m relating to bonding facilities; £170m of convertible bonds guaranteed by the company; and an unknown debt to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, £16m of which was due by the end of the month. The size and complexity of Carillion's balance sheet are likely to be among the factors investigated during a multitude of probes into the conduct of the company's directors and auditors. Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, has ordered the Insolvency Service to fast-track an inquiry into the Carillion crisis, while the Financial Reporting Council has been asked to examine the work of KPMG, the company's auditor, and individual members. Ministers have scrambled since Carillion's collapse to exert a grip on its fallout, with fears for tens of thousands of subcontractors caught up in one of the biggest disasters to hit a major UK industrial group for decades. While Parliament's Liaison Committee, a consortium of all select committee chairs, was the latest to announce its own inquiry. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: ""I will be proposing we take evidence from the company directors, the trustees, the pensions regulator and the auditors who somehow concluded Carillion was a going concern."" News of the much-larger financial liabilities for Carillion comes days after Keith Cochrane, its interim chief executive, disclosed in a legal statement that the taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) had tightened the terms of its funding to Carillion three days before it was forced to call in liquidators. :: The key personnel at Carillion Mr Cochrane, who has yet to speak publicly about the collapse of the company he had been in charge of since a profit warning sent its shares tumbling last July, accused RBS in his statement of taking ""unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". According to Mr Cochrane, RBS informed Carillion last Friday that it wanted the company to pre-fund supplier payments made through the bank, which meant it would need to make those payments two days earlier than cashflow forecasts had assumed. He said this negatively impacted Carillion's liquidity by between £2m and £20m. Santander UK, another member of the committee of Carillion's biggest lenders, was also criticised by Mr Cochrane for causing panic among the lending syndicate on 21 December by writing to the construction giant's suppliers notifying them of immediate changes to an Early Payment Facility (EPF) with the bank. The interim chief's statement details the increasingly frenetic nature of efforts to secure financial support from the Government, the taxman and its lenders in the months before its collapse. Its failure has left 19,500 UK staff fearing for their jobs and uncertainty about the viability of a number of major public sector projects, emboldening the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to declare that private companies should be stripped of Government contracts. A spokesman for Carillion's pension trustees declined to comment on Friday."

Mrs McDonald called on supporters at Sinn Fein's AGM to ""build our new Ireland"", and a special party conference to ratify a new leader will be held on 10 February. Mrs McDonald, who has been Mr Adams' deputy, is an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin. The Dublin Central TD was the only person to put her name forward for the role as party' leader before nominations closed on Friday. Speaking in Belfast, the president-elect told supporters that Irish unity was ""the best solution, the best collective arrangement"" and that she believed it could be done ""in an atmosphere that isn't toxic or bigoted...but is...respectful"". To applause, she said: ""I won't fill Gerry's shoes, but the news is that I brought my own. ""I will fill my shoes, I will walk in my shoes and we together over the coming years will walk a journey that is full of opportunities, full of challenges. ""But which I believe marks a defining epoch, a defining chapter in our achievement of a united Ireland and the ending of partition.

""I have seen right across Ireland the energy, the ingenuity, of republican activists. Together, united and strong, let's go forward and let's build our new Ireland."" Earlier, Mr Adams had told the crowd the current political atmosphere in Northern Ireland was ""very toxic"", adding: ""In my view, this is not good for anyone expect a small minority of bigots"". Mr Adams also said a united Ireland was not a ""pipe dream"", adding: ""It is very achievable - we can do it"". ""It is for Sinn Fein...to keep a united Ireland on the political agenda, south and north."" Sky News Ireland Correspondent David Blevins said the change in leadership was ""significant"", adding that Mrs McDonald is the first woman to lead Sinn Fein and comes from a middle class background. She became Sinn Fein's first MEP in the Republic of Ireland in 2004 and Blevins said she had ""lots of political experience and is well known for voicing her views, rather strongly on occasion"". Blevins said: ""She's not a woman who anyone would want to take lightly."""

The city's homicide unit had said that both Mr and Mrs Sherman were strangled to death but did not classify the deaths as homicides. Officers ruled out murder after the husband and wife were found hanging in their home. According to Canadian media, they believed Mr Sherman killed his wife and hung her before hanging himself. But the couple's four children told the Toronto Star a murder-suicide did not make any sense and hired a lawyer to probe deeper into the deaths. The lawyer, Brian Greenspan, hired private detectives and asked for another post-mortem examination of the bodies. The pathologist and detectives - some of whom are former Toronto homicide investigators - reportedly found markings on Mr and Mrs Sherman's wrists. They said it showed their hands had been tied with a cord or plastic zip tie, despite the pair being found with their hands untied and no sign of ropes or cords nearby. Toxicology reports showed no signs of abnormal drug use. The hired team claimed Mr and Mrs Sherman were actually strangled to death with men's leather belts. The newspaper said sources close to the family had described the deaths as ""professional"", a ""staged homicide"" and a ""contract killing"". According to the Star, there was no signs of damage, forced entry or evidence of a home invasion at the property. A review by police and the private investigators of CCTV footage taken from nearby homes has not sparked any leads, the newspaper said. Mr Sherman founded his company, which employs more than 11,000 people, in 1974. He is often credited with revolutionising the drugs industry in Canada."
2018-01-21,"British business leaders have lambasted Theresa May's cabinet for infighting over the UK's trade position, accusing ministers of putting ideology before jobs and investment.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180122000233/https://news.sky.com/story/time-running-out-for-brexit-progress-british-industry-group-warns-11216469,"Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), will warn the Government that time is running out to make progress on Brexit and urge the Prime Minister to put replicating the customs union at the top of the trade agenda. ""This is a time - we believe - for revisiting some of the red lines,"" Ms Fairbairn told Sky News. ""If there is one thing business knows about, it's about negotiations and it's not the opening position that matters, it's the closing position that matters. ""This is a time, particularly as we know how urgent the decisions are, for revisiting. ""(With) the customs union, there have been doors that have been left open along the way. ""Let's take them because the business case, the common sense pragmatic case, for a customs union with the EU - negotiated effectively - is very strong. ""It's about jobs in the Midlands. It's about small manufacturers that need to trade in a friction-less way."" Ms Fairbairn will also tell the Government in the major speech on Monday that business needs a transition deal in place by March, with the outline of a final deal signed with the EU by October. ""We need to end this game of who-blinks-first and instead find a new spurt of urgency,"" Ms Fairburn will tell her audience at Warwick University. ""The UK team can't agree with itself, let alone with the EU. There's too much ideology, too little urgency."" The UK and EU have agreed to a two-year transition period when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. But the two sides have yet to agree the terms of that relationship or even discuss what a post-Brexit trade deal will look like. Mrs May said last year that Britain was leaving the customs union but would seek to either ""reach a completely new customs agreement to become an associate member of the customs union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it"". But the issue deeply divides her cabinet. Many Brexiteers are opposed to remaining in customs arrangements with the EU for fear it would hamper Britain's ability to strike free-trade agreements with other countries. But Remain supporting MPs have left the option on the table, with Chancellor Philip Hammond insisting earlier this year that negotiations would ""be guided by what delivers the greatest economic advantage to the UK."" Ms Fairbairn's intervention prompted a furious response from the pro-Leave camp. One government source, who backed the Vote Leave campaign, told Sky News: ""The CBI's position is at odds with most UK businesses and its defeatist position on the customs union is damaging to the UK's strategy for the forthcoming negotiations."" Richard Tice, businessman and co-chair of Leave Means Leave, also attacked the business lobby group for trying to ""handcuff British business to unnecessary EU rules and regulations"" despite the face that only about 10% of firms in the UK export goods to the EU."" He said: ""We've always been crystal clear…that we need to leave the single market and the customs union. ""It's the CBI that is actually damaging our national interest by undermining the negotiating leverage of David Davis, the Prime Minister and our negotiating team. They should be ashamed of themselves."" Mrs May has yet to outline her own position on Britain's future trading relationship with the UK but will have a series of crunch meetings with her core Brexit cabinet this month to try to agree a negotiating position. The Government is still pushing a ""have our cake and eat it "" strategy despite the EU's insistence that London cannot have a deal that gives Britain as many of the benefits of EU membership while shedding obligations. For its part, the EU has indicated that Mrs May's Brexit red lines mean the only option available to the UK is a Canada-style free trade deal, which could limit the free trade of financial services between the UK and the EU. Ms Fairbairn will say next week that a Canada-style deal would not be suitable for Britain because of those constraints, while a Norway-style single market deal is also a non-starter given that it would require continued free movement and payments into the EU. Instead the CBI wants the Prime Minister to carve out a trading relationship that is as closely aligned to current relationships as possible. Ms Fairbairn told Sky News: ""Let's start with what we have the EU has built up with the UK 40 years of shared standards and regulations that have been very good for business whatever we come up with let's start with that position and move forward."""

In the wake of the collapse of Carillion, which held around 450 public sector contracts, Theresa May has vowed to introduce tough new rules to end the ""unacceptable abuse"" by irresponsible business chiefs. The construction and outsourcing giant - which employs 43,000 people - was left mired in £1.3bn of debt and saddled with a £600m pensions deficit after going into liquidation this week. Thousands of suppliers and subcontractors owed money have been left in limbo and seen work paused on building sites, prompting anger over pay awards enjoyed by the firm's bosses. Writing in the Observer, the Prime Minister said top executives had too often reaped ""big bonuses for recklessly putting short-term profit ahead of long-term success"". ""In the spring, we will set out new tough new rules for executives who try to line their own pockets by putting their workers' pensions at risk - an unacceptable abuse that we will end,"" she wrote. ""By this time next year, all listed companies will have to reveal the pay between bosses and workers. ""Companies will also have to explain how they take into account their employees' interests at board level, giving unscrupulous employers nowhere to hide."" :: Tom Rayner: Can May back up her tough words on bosses' pay? Speaking to Sky News about the Prime Minister's promise, Mr Field urged the Government to consider huge fines on company bosses who rack up large pension deficits. ""One would hope, of course, that one wouldn't have to levy the fines,"" he said. ""The mere fact that they're there and that we would have a pension regulator who really just puts the fear of God into people to behave properly."" During the collapse of BHS, Mr Field said his committee proposed fining the company's former owner Sir Philip Green £1bn, due to the high-street chain's multi-million pound pensions deficit on its demise. ""I would have thought - given that these fines would be levied on the individuals, not on the companies, with the aim of actually stripping out peoples' personal wealth who have gained so much and behaved so poorly in the stewardship of their company - would have helped concentrate minds wonderfully,"" Mr Field said. The former welfare minister also questioned the role of the pension regulator in the collapse of Carillion, as he demanded a regulator that is ""really proactive"". A task force involving businesses and trade unions has been set up to support companies and workers affected by Carillion's collapse. The Prime Minister used her newspaper article to insist the state had a ""role to play"" when companies fail but ""not by bailing out the directors with a blank cheque"". Labour have seized on the firm's demise to repeat their call for private-public partnerships to be brought back under Government control. But Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, pushed back against Labour's calls for the recall of Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell dubbed such schemes ""wrong"" on Sunday, with his party also promising to renationalise major industries. Ms Truss told Sky News: ""People shouldn't think there's some magic alternative. ""If politicians end up running companies as John McDonnell is proposing, that would mean huge liabilities on the public balance sheet. ""It would mean that those losses would all come to the taxpayer. ""I don't think we want to live in a country where politicians run major companies and all of the impact that that would have."""

The 51-year-old former world footballer of the year, whose clubs included Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco and AC Milan, told the crowd: ""I have spent many years of my life in stadiums, but today is a feeling like no other"". The 1995 Ballon D'Or winner cautioned: ""It is time to be honest with our people. Though corruption is a habit among our people, we must end it.

More than 60% of its 4.6-million citizens are aged under 25, and many voted for Mr Weah in the belief he would quickly boost employment. Liberia is ranked 177th on the 188 countries in the UN's human development index. He also spoke of the country's civil wars adding ""We have arrived here on the blood, sweat and tears and suffering of so many of our citizens, too many of whom died long before real equality."" Mr Weah replaced Africa's first female president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, at the Monrovia stadium which she opened in 2014 where citizens took refuge during the Ebola crisis. In her final week in office, she signed an executive order on domestic violence protecting people against ""physical, sexual, economical, emotional and psychological abuses"". Mr Weah was a senator for Montserrado County for three years after failing to win as a vice-president in 2012. Arsene Wenger, who discovered Mr Weah when he was Monaco manager, said he remembered seeing him for the first time looking a ""bit lost"" and ""not being rated as a player"". Mr Wenger visited Liberia with Mr Weah during the 1989-1997 civil war and said the footballer ""suffered"" as his country was wracked by conflict."

They said they worked with ""partner agencies"" including the RSPCA, a re-homing charity and vets to try and calm the dog but said the ""difficult decision was made to destroy it"". The statement said the dog became ""increasingly aggressive as time went on"" and that attempts were made to find the animal's owner but they were unsuccessful. However, Cleveland Police's post attracted more than 1,400 angry reactions and almost 3,000 comments. ""You are a disgrace. Absolutely shameful.

""All attempts to calm the dog failed. Vets advised that they were unable to sedate the dog due to not being able to approach it and not having equipment to sedate from a distance.

Jurors were told how builder Arshid enlisted the help of labourer Vincent Tappu to kidnap the women by bundling them into the boot of his pick-up truck and driving them to an empty house he was renovating in Kingston, southwest London, on the morning of 19 July last year. Both men allegedly hid their faces during the kidnapping, with Arshid - who prosecutors claim was trying to fulfil his ""sexual fantasies"" during the ordeal - dressed in pyjamas. It is claimed that over the course of the day, Arshid molested the women and cut their throats, with the survivor - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - able to escape after tricking him into thinking they could be together. She told the court of how she managed to get away: ""When eventually I got hold of my phone, my first instinct was to call someone for help."" She texted her boyfriend: ""Don't message or call. Or reply. I have been kid booed (sic). Kidnapped."" And later in the afternoon, she texted her mother: ""He's going to kill me. Don't reply."" The woman managed to raise the alarm and was rescued by Arshid's brother, who saw her in the back of his truck and took her to St George's Hospital in Tooting, where she went on to have two operations as she recovered from knife wounds. She told police where they could find 5ft 3in tall Ms Dookhran, whose throat was said to have been slit in a bathroom at the six-bedroom property. ""He brought Celine down in a bag, picked her up and put her into the chest freezer,"" she told officers from her hospital bed. ""All I could see was her legs sticking out. I had to act like it was not affecting me."" Ms Dookhran was still wearing her Barclays bank work uniform when she was dumped in the freezer. Arshid, of no fixed address, denies murder, attempted murder, rape of both women and the previous sexual assault and assault by penetration of the surviving woman when she was about 13. Along with Tappu, 28, of Spencer Road, Acton, west London, he has also pleaded not guilty to both women's kidnap and false imprisonment, and possession of a firearm with intent. The trial continues."

He was found away from the university and the circumstances are not suspicious. Six other youngsters at the Russell Group university are thought to have committed suicide since October 2016. Mark Ames, director of student services at the university, said: ""It is immensely distressing for members of our university community to learn that one of our students has died. We know that this will be especially difficult for those who knew and studied with Justin.

Three first year students - Miranda Williams, 19, Kim Long, 18, and Daniel Green, 18 - all took their own lives just weeks into their degrees in October 2016. Inquests found that none of the deaths were linked. A university spokesman told Sky News: ""In the context of increasing national concerns about student mental health, the university began a review of our support for students in the summer of 2016. ""This work was done in conjunction with our students and the Students’ Union. As a result we are investing an additional £1m annually in a new Student Wellbeing Service that will complement existing services.

2018-01-22,"The boss of outsourcing giant Serco has taken aim at the Government after the collapse of rival Carillion, saying it had created a market where only the ""dumb and the desperate"" would bid for public sector contracts.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180123003018/https://news.sky.com/story/carillion-government-blamed-for-creating-dysfunctional-market-11218076,"Rupert Soames said in a newspaper article that ministers could not escape ""some responsibility"" for forcing companies to take big risks when carrying out public services. Carillion, which employed 43,000 people including 20,000 in the UK, went into liquidation a week ago, mired in £1.3bn debt and also saddled with a vast pensions deficit. It was engaged on a variety of public sector contracts from helping construct the HS2 rail link to delivering school meals, maintaining prisons and building hospitals. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Soames described how Serco had faced similar issues in 2014, wiping £1.5bn off its balance sheet and taking £450m of losses on Government contracts – but had ""made it through the valley of the shadow of death"". He pointed to the problem of long-term fixed price public sector contracts potentially being derailed by unexpected changes such as the increase in the minimum wage. Mr Soames added that the deals could be ""punitive"" and very costly to exit, resulting in a market which is over reliant on large businesses. ""Government, as the sole customer, cannot escape some responsibility if the result is a dysfunctional market, in which only the dumb and the desperate want to compete,"" he said. Mr Soames rejected arguments advanced by some that services ought to be brought back into the public sector. He argued that monopolies ""always become inefficient and focused on protecting their own interests, rather than those of their customers"". Mr Soames did not lay all blame on the Government, also highlighting the way some firms were loading up with debt and how banks were allowing them to do so. But he said that having favoured private companies too much in the 1990s and 2000s, the pendulum has now ""swung too far the other way"" on public sector outsourcing. ""We need to bring it back to centre if suppliers are going to want to work for Government to deliver public services,"" he said. ""And suppliers need to stop over-promising and under-performing, stop accepting risks they know they cannot manage, and be more transparent and accountable."" The comments come as, in the wake of Carillion's collapse, the Prime Minister said she was preparing to set out ""tough new rules for executives who try to line their own pockets by putting their workers' pensions at risk"". In response, the Institute of Directors said any new plans ""must ensure that there are no unintended consequences that might impact the health of currently successful companies""."
2018-01-22,A new inquest will look into the death of a young soldier who died from gunshot wounds at the Deepcut army barracks in 1995.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180123003018/https://news.sky.com/story/deepcut-private-sean-bentons-sister-wants-the-truth-at-new-inquest-11218817,"The inquest will open on Wednesday into the death of Private Sean Benton. It is thought that he had been bullied; a previous inquest decided he took his own life. But after three other recruits died in the following seven years, we now know much more about the culture of abuse at the military base. Private Benton's family hope that this inquest will get to the truth, but his parents did not live long enough to see the investigation they long demanded. His father died in 2011 and his mother four years later. His sister, Tracey Lewis, told Sky News she now wants closure: ""It's been too long. My mum tried. It was like hitting a brick wall. There's been allegations of abuse, physically and mentally. ""I want the truth what happened to him. Why was he in that environment, that culture?"" She says her brother was ""kind, sensitive and thoughtful"", but it is possible such qualities were seen as signs of weakness and may have made him a target. Last year, at a new inquest into the death of Private Cheryl James, who also died in 1995, the Army said major changes had now been made to the way young recruits were supervised. In fact the latest recruitment campaign focuses on mental and emotional support for young soldiers. Ms Lewis agrees such a proactive approach may have made a difference to her brother: ""Because people don't want to join the Army, they're taking that different approach. But I don't think it's a bad thing."" She said it would ""definitely"" have saved his life. Her solicitor, Emma Norton, said: ""The way the Army deals with mental health, the way it supports soldiers who've returned from operations overseas, the welfare support that it gives them, the way it looks after women in particular, these are still issues it still needs to work on. ""So we don't accept that you can just consign this to history."" The original coroner's hearing was wrapped up in less than two hours. The new inquest is expected to last several weeks."

The princess began dating the brand ambassador of Casamigos Tequila about seven years ago after they met while skiing in the Swiss resort of Verbier. Speaking to the BBC's The One Show, with her fiance by her side, the princess, 27, said the proposal took place near a lake. She said: ""The lake was so beautiful, the light was a special light I've never seen. ""I actually said, 'This is an incredible moment', and then he popped the question, which was really surprising even though we've been together seven years - a complete surprise. ""It was like this perfect moment, we couldn't be happier because we knew it was going to end up this way."" She added: ""I was over the moon, crying."" When asked about the Queen's involvement, Eugenie replied: ""Granny actually knew right at the beginning, she was one of the very few people at the beginning, we left her this weekend and had a lovely time and she was very happy, as was my grandfather."" #jackandeugie @TheDukeOfYork @yorkiebea pic.twitter.com/CWZ6XqMhz1 Mr Brooksbank, 31, added: ""It was amazing. I found a ring in a jewellers and then proposed to Eugenie without it and came back and we designed the diamonds around this padparadscha sapphire. ""And what's amazing about it is that it changes colour from every different angle that you look at it, which is what I think of Eugenie. That she changes colour and is just so amazing."" Eugenie's engagement to her long-term partner has been greeted with joy by her parents the Duke and Duchess of York. Prince Andrew said: ""I'm absolutely overjoyed. I'm thrilled."" Sarah Ferguson tweeted a picture of the couple overlaid with the words: ""They make laughter. And we feel the joy. Thank-you for the magic. Jack and Eugie. So proud of you."" The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh also expressed their delight at the news, wishing their granddaughter and her fiance ""all the best"". A series of engagement photographs, with Eugenie proudly showing off her padparadscha sapphire and diamond engagement ring in pictures taken in Buckingham Palace's Picture Gallery, was released to mark the announcement. The couple plan to marry this autumn in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle - the same venue as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding in May - but Andrew said a date had yet to be chosen."

Universities UK (UUK) - the representative organisation for the country's universities - wants to change the scheme from giving a guaranteed retirement income to one subject to changes in the stock market, which it says would tackle the scheme's financial deficit and rising future costs but still offer attractive benefits to members. ""UUK's priority is to put USS (Universities Superannuation Scheme) on a secure and sustainable footing while offering attractive, market-leading pensions - the very best that can be afforded by both employers and employees,"" a spokesman said. ""A solution to the significant funding challenges facing USS needs to be found."" The union said it hoped that the ""overwhelming mandate for strike action"" would put pressure on UUK to agree a deal, adding that it was happy for talks to be extended in an attempt to resolve the issue without strike action. The discussions are scheduled to end on Tuesday. General secretary Sally Hunt said: ""UCU members have made it quite clear that they are prepared to take sustained strike action to defend their pensions. ""USS already offers worse benefits than other schemes available in universities, and UUK's proposals would make matters worse. ""I hope more vice-chancellors will pressure their negotiators to work with us to resolve the matter without strike action."" Sixty-one universities are set to be affected from as early as next month, including Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, Edinburgh and Goldsmiths. Should industrial action go ahead, it will mark the first time UCU has taken action over USS since November 2014, when it staged a boycott of assessment and marking. It was called off after two weeks for fresh talks, which resolved the issue."
2018-01-22,The war on plastic waste could spark the return of the neighbourhood milkman as figures show demand for milk in glass bottles is on the rise.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180123003018/https://news.sky.com/story/milkman-resurgence-as-drinkers-ditch-plastic-for-nostalgic-glass-bottles-11218272,"In 1975, 94% of the UK's milk was transported in glass bottles compared to just under 3% in 2016 - but that could soon change. Milkmen are reporting a rise in demand for traditional glass bottles with consumers appearing to boycott the plastic alternatives, which took over the market in the 1990s. Steve Hayden, of Parker Dairies in east London, said the company has already picked up 100 new customers in 2018 - most of whom wanted their milk in glass bottles. He said it was down to ""tradition"" and ""nostalgia"" but also because the bottles are returnable and better for the environment. ""One of these bottles makes at least 20 trips before it breaks,"" the milkman of 30 years told Sky News. ""It takes them back to their childhoods."" Another milkman has even resorted to refurbishing his disused milk float to cope with orders. Mark Woodman, of Woodman's Dairy in Cardiff, also puts the surge in sales down to the public's distaste for plastic waste. ""This week and last week we’ve been inundated with phone calls asking us if we deliver glass bottles,"" he told WalesOnline. ""We've had 50 to 100 people call in this week, with 30 to 40 new customers off the internet looking to cut down on their use of plastic. ""It's great for us – anything that gives us a bit of business back from the supermarkets is really good for us."" Mr Woodman said he was receiving about 140 enquiries a week from those looking to ditch plastic for glass and that his business had seen a ""real resurgence"" in the past two years. Home deliveries in the UK are up to about a million a day, according to Dairy UK, which represents the Britain's milk industry. The enthusiasm for glass bottles comes as Theresa May pledged to tell supermarkets to sell fruit and vegetables loose - instead of in plastic packaging - in her 25-year Environmental Plan. The Prime Minister hopes to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste by 2042."

At the time, the streets were busy with worshippers attending Ramadan night prayers. Osborne, of Glyn Rhosyn in Cardiff, denies the murder of Mr Ali and the attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"". Osborne appeared calm as the prosecution read out its opening statement, speaking only to confirm his name, saying ""that's my name the last time I checked"". Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC told Woolwich Crown Court that the ""evidence establishes that the defendant was trying to kill as many of the group as possible"". ""In the event, he killed one person - a 51-year-old man called Makram Ali - and in addition, he injured many others, some of them seriously."" Mr Rees also said that, after the incident some of the men at the scene had tried to prevent Osborne from escaping, pinning him down as he said: ""I want to kill more Muslims"". The prosecutor added that Osborne initially claimed to have lost control of the van, saying he had drunk a couple of pints; but a road-side breath test showed no alcohol in his system. A key piece of evidence, the prosecution said, is a note allegedly handwritten by Osborne, an unemployed father of four. Mr Rees described it as showing Osborne's extreme views and hatred of Muslims. The note pointed to recent terror attacks at Westminster, Manchester Arena and London Bridge as well as the Rotherham grooming scandal, and accused politicians and celebrities of not doing enough to stop it. ""Where were you in Rotherham Lily Allen, Jeremy Corbyn, nowhere to be seen,"" it read. ""Just thinking about how many inbred migrants you could bring into the country."" Mr Rees told the court: ""Against that background, the defendant decided to take matters into his own hands. ""He planned to make a public statement by killing Muslims, knowing that his handwritten note would be recovered by the authorities."" Mr Rees added: ""To seek to kill someone merely because of their religion is a terrible thing. ""And what makes this act particularly horrific is that the group he drove into had gathered in the street in order to help Makram Ali, the deceased, who had collapsed as he walked along Seven Sisters Road a couple of minutes before the defendant carried out his attack."" Osborne's trial, before a jury and Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, is expected to last for two weeks."
2018-01-22,"Donald Trump's US tax cuts will help lift global growth further over the next few years though the UK looks set to trail behind, according to latest forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180123003018/https://news.sky.com/story/us-tax-cuts-to-lift-global-growth-but-uk-left-behind-says-imf-11218400,"The IMF's World Economic Outlook pencils in expansion of 3.9% for the world economy for this year and next - an upgrade of 0.2 percentage points in each case. But it forecasts growth in the UK at 1.5% in each of 2018 and 2019, lagging well behind the average pace of fellow advanced economies - having led the pack as recently as 2016. For the year 2019, the outlook represents a 0.1 percentage point downgrade for Britain. IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said the main sources of the upturn in world GDP were in Europe and Asia, with the US and Canada and a return to expansion for large emerging markets Brazil and Russia - which shrank in 2016 - as well as Turkey. The body also said recently-implemented US tax cuts would stimulate growth, adding 1.2% to the world's biggest economy by 2020 - though due to the temporary nature of the some of the policies it would lower growth from 2022 onwards. The IMF said the impact on the US and its trading partners would ""contribute about half of the cumulative revision to global growth over 2018-19"". Mr Obstfeld said: ""As the year 2018 begins, the world economy is gathering speed. ""This is good news. But political leaders and policy makers must stay mindful that the present economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long."" He warned that ""the next recession may be closer than we think"" and that it may be harder to deal with than a decade ago given the scale of public sector debt. UK growth has been slowing in the wake of the Brexit vote. It had been, together with Germany, the fastest-growing of the G7 economies in 2016. The pace of growth of the advanced nations was 1.7% in that year and is expected to have advanced to more than 2% for last year, this year and next. But the UK is forecast to go in the opposite direction, with growth pencilled in by the IMF at 1.7% for 2017 before slipping further. Last year's slowdown has been blamed on the squeeze on consumers caused by higher inflation - largely the result of the pound's plunge after the Brexit vote - as well as uncertainty over Britain's future outside the EU. However, survey reports have also pointed to a boost to Britain's manufacturing sector as the weakness of the pound, combined with the strength of the global economy, lifts exports. The IMF's latest report cited possible trade barriers and regulatory shake-ups as risks to growth as the UK seeks a new relationship with Europe after Brexit and the US renegotiates its free trade treaty with neighbours Mexico and Canada. A Treasury spokesperson responded to the report by saying: ""We are building a Britain that is fit for the future by improving skills, backing innovation and investing in infrastructure to deliver a stronger economy and guarantee a better future for the next generation."" Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The IMF report out today confirms what others have been saying - the UK economy is not growing as fast as many other advanced economies. It further exposes the effect of the last seven years of Tory economic failure. ""Philip Hammond should drop his plans to continue the austerity policies that have weakened our economy. We urgently need a change of direction from the Chancellor. There is no excuse for a 'more of the same' approach. ""The next Labour government will provide the serious investment our country needs, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, to build a high wage, high skill economy for the many not the few."""

Mr Bolton said it had lost his confidence and that of members, branding it ""unfit for purpose"". Announcing a purge of his critics from UKIP outside the hotel where he has been living in Folkestone, Kent, he said: ""It is now time to put an end to the factional in-fighting within the party and to remove those who have been a part of that. ""In a single phrase, it is time to 'drain the swamp'."" The line echoes a popular chant coined by Donald Trump to attack the Washington establishment when he was running for US president. Mr Bolton accused the NEC of ""severely handicapping"" UKIP's progress for several years - ""as all recent leaders will attest"". But he vowed that making sure the Government did not ""betray"" people on Brexit was ""the object to which I shall be directing all of my energies in the coming weeks"". Asked to respond to criticism from at least 10 UKIP spokespeople who resigned in protest at his leadership, Mr Bolton simply said: ""No comment."" UKIP general secretary Paul Oakley responded with a post on Twitter of a depressed Garfield the cat cartoon captioned ""sigh"". But Mr Bolton did get the support of Jo Marney, the girlfriend he dumped after offensive messages she sent were exposed. Ms Marney, with whom he was pictured on a train after breaking up, tweeted Mr Bolton with a thumbs up emoji and the message ""#FlushTheBog"". The UKIP leader left open the possibility of rekindling a romance with her in an interview on LBC. ""We're still in contact, of course there are strong emotions there, but we both need to sort our own private lives out,"" he said. ""So the romantic side of the relationship is off, certainly at the moment, and going forward, who knows what the future holds?"" The UKIP leader was being quizzed by one of his predecessors, Nigel Farage, who suggested the saga was becoming ""cringe-making"". But Mr Farage later backed Mr Bolton and his bid to overhaul the party, saying it must ""reform or die"". He wrote in the Telegraph: ""His refusal to accept the NEC decision to quit, and his insistence on carrying out a full EGM (Emergency General Meeting), could provide a lifeline for UKIP. ""For this crisis is about more than Henry Bolton. It is about whether UKIP is fit for purpose."""

His case is being heard in the family division of the High Court in London, where specialists at King's College Hospital in London have said giving the baby further intensive care treatment is ""futile, burdensome and not in his best interests"". His mother Takesha Thomas, however, told Sky News that Isaiah deserved a ""chance to live"". Ms Thomas, 36, said: ""Don't just give up on him and say it's a hopeless case, because many children have been born in Isaiah's similar case and their parents didn't give up on them, either. ""And with love, that's one thing I know: give a child love and they will thrive. ""It doesn't matter what condition they are, just give them love. ""And that's what everyone needs.""

""We'll take legal advice at that point on what to do but we are hopeful that his lordship will reach the right and fair decision in Isaiah's best interests. ""In our opinion, his best interest is to come home to his family and live."" Doctors have already told the court that Isaiah is in a low level of consciousness and is connected to a ventilator. He cannot move or breathe independently and he does not respond to stimulation, they have said. One specialist told Mr Justice MacDonald: ""(He has) no smile, no perceived movement, no way that anyone can tell whether he is expressing any emotional connection. ""There is definitely an emotional connection from mother to baby but whether there is an emotional connection from Isaiah to mother, I don't know how you would ever be able to establish that.""

The deadlock saw hundreds of thousands of federal employees off work without pay, and national landmarks including the Statue of Liberty closed to the public. Republicans needed 60 votes to unlock the funds, but with only 51 of the 100 Senate seats they were reliant on Democrats to get the vote through. Democrats agreed to drop their objections to the bill, in return for a Republican assurance to look at the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme. :: Why has the US government shut down? The programme - which shields more than 700,000 immigrants who entered the US illegally as children - is scheduled to end in March, following an order from President Trump last year. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell had urged Democrats to end their blocking tactics, saying: ""Every day we spend arguing about keeping the lights on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA or defence spending or any of our other shared priorities."" The stop-gap funding measure that has now been approved will allow the government to get back up and running until 8 February. President Trump said he was pleased the Democrats had ""come to their senses"", but said he would only make a long-term deal on immigration ""if and only if it's good for our country."" Following the vote, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the President's focus was now on border security. While she said she was ""hopeful"" for an agreement, she said any deal on the 'dreamers', as the immigrants aided by DACA are known, would be tied to funding for border security, which includes Mr Trump's wall. Sky News US Correspondent Mark Austin said: ""It seems to be the Democrats who have blinked here. The issue of the children of illegal immigrants has been knocked down the road for about three weeks. Democrats may say Trump “sat on the sidelines” . But he sat on the sidelines and won !

That was reflected in its Christmas trading figures which showed like-for-like sales rising 1.9% in the six weeks to 6 January, with food up 3.4% on the same period last year."
2018-01-22,The American government may be in shutdown but that hasn't stopped it sending two of its most senior officials on forays abroad.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180123003018/https://news.sky.com/story/tillerson-left-to-pick-up-the-pieces-from-trumps-pronouncements-11218049,"Both face severe challenges thanks to recent pronouncements by their boss, Donald Trump. Vice President Mike Pence is touring the Middle East on a trip that has been complicated by his President's contentious decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Key figures are either refusing to meet Mr Pence, or giving him lectures on the region's politics when they do instead. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in London, the first stop of a tour of Europe. His main aim: to push for a harder line on Iran and commitments from European allies to ""fix"" the nuclear deal with that country. This would be challenging enough. Mr Trump has threatened to remove America's support for the deal unless it is altered. The President says he believes it is a bad agreement but has thus far stopped short of scuppering it. The deal removed some sanctions against Iran in return for measures that verifiably curtail its alleged nuclear weapons programme. If Mr Trump walked away from the deal, his generals have warned, it would give the Iranians the green light to go hell for leather to make the bomb. So instead the President says it should be revised to deter Iran from meddling in other countries and from continuing a ballistic missile programme. There are two problems with that position. Firstly, the deal was deliberately designed only to cover nuclear weapon development, not other issues. Secondly, the countries that negotiated it along with America have made it clear they do not believe it should or can be renegotiated. When Mr Tillerson meets Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson we will likely hear plenty of tough talk about Iran's conduct, but progress towards a revised nuclear deal will be problematic to say the least. US-British relations have been complicated due to the President's bizarre interventions on Twitter. His apparent endorsement of a far-right British group on Twitter plunged relations to a new low when Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to express her disapproval. As an apparent sign of his disgruntlement at that, Mr Trump has ruled out coming to London to open the new US embassy. Mr Tillerson, who is reported to have called the President a ""moron"" previously, is left to pick up the pieces. It would be quite a task even for a seasoned diplomat. He has precious little experience in the field, having spent most of his life in the oil industry."

He described it as ""love at first sight"". He is the son of company director Nicola, 64, and accountant George, 68, and is reportedly very distantly related to his wife-to-be. According to The Daily Telegraph, the Duchess of York is the great great granddaughter of Lady Julia Coke, who is the daughter of Mr Brooksbank's great great grandfather, Thomas Coke. Mr Brooksbank also has a younger brother, Thomas, 29, and since 2001 the family's home has been an apartment in a gated period conversion in Wandsworth. :: Princess Eugenie's perfect moment when Jack Brooksbank proposed Mr Brooksbank was educated at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire, but he did not go on to attend university. Instead he went into the hospitality industry. He worked at the Admiral Codrington pub in Chelsea. Then he was poached by Piers Adam, the millionaire owner of some of London's most trendy venues, to join the Chelsea gastropub Markham Inn. He spent three years there and, during that time, he was introduced to Prince Harry. Among his other workplaces was Mayfair's Mahiki, but he is now brand ambassador for Casamigos tequila. Casamigos was founded by actor George Clooney, along with two other men, but was sold last year to Diageo. Mr Brooksbank has previously spoken about an ambition to run his own business, telling the Daily Mail: ""I want to create a chain of pubs. ""It has been my dream since I was 18. ""I have fond memories of Sunday roasts in pubs with log fires, and it's something I want to recreate."" Since he met Eugenie, he has been seen at a number of high-profile events, including Royal Ascot, and their relationship even survived the time his now-fiancee spent working in the US."

Armfield was part of Sir Alf Ramsey's 1966 World Cup winning squad. Although injury denied him an appearance at the tournament he still received a winners' medal. He played 627 matches for Blackpool - his only club - over a career spanning 17 years. Blackpool Football Club said it was ""deeply saddened to learn of the passing of its record appearance holder and vice-president"". ""Our heartfelt condolences go out to Jimmy's wife Anne, his two sons, Duncan and John, and the rest of the Armfield family at this time,"" it added in a statement. Armfield captained Blackpool for more than 10 years and won 43 caps for England, with 15 of those occasions as skipper. Bloomfield Road's newly-constructed South Stand was named in his honour in 2010 with a statue commissioned by the Blackpool Supporters' Association erected outside the ground the following year. Relatives said in a statement to the Blackpool Gazette that Armfield ""has passed away peacefully surrounded by his immediate family"". ""We have many wonderful messages of love and support, for which we are grateful, and moved by all the kind words. ""We would also like to thank all the magnificent and dedicated NHS staff who have kept Jimmy, and the family, as well as possible over the ten years of his illness. ""During the last few days Trinity Hospice in Blackpool made a big difference to Jimmy as he slipped away, pain free at last. ""Jimmy had two great loves, first and foremost was his family, to which he was devoted and loved dearly. The other was football, especially Blackpool, England and his colleagues at the PFA. ""Once again, the family extends its thanks as we try to come to terms in a world without Jimmy."" Armfield was made a CBE in 2009 for services to the Lancashire community, had stints in management with Bolton and Leeds before moving into broadcasting where he spent more than 30 years working for the BBC."
2018-01-22,Two men have each been jailed for 34 years for the murder of a businessman who was shot dead during a botched burglary at his £1m home.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180123003018/https://news.sky.com/story/kevin-downton-and-jason-baccus-guilty-of-murdering-businessman-in-botched-burglary-11218468,"Guy Hedger,61, was killed after intruders entered his home in Castlewood, Ashley, near Ringwood, Hampshire, at about 3am on 30 April 2017. Jason Baccus, 42, of Verney Close, Bournemouth, Dorset, and Kevin Downton, 40, of Winterborne Stickland, near Blandford, were found guilty after a trial at Winchester Crown Court that lasted 40 days. A third man, Scott Keeping, 44, also of Verney Close, was found not guilty of murder. His wife, Helen Keeping, 40, was also cleared of two counts of assisting an offender. They were also convicted of offences of aggravated burglary with a firearm, possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and two charges of burglary of industrial buildings. Scott Keeping was cleared of these offences as well. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told the court that Downton and Baccus wore masks when they stormed into the bedroom where Mr Hedger was with his husband Simon Hedger-Cooper, and ordered both naked men to face the wall. Downton shot Mr Hedger with a sawn-off shotgun after Mr Hedger-Cooper set off a panic alarm causing the thieves to flee, the court heard. Mr Hedger-Cooper, 48, described in a video interview showed to the court, how his partner began to tell the raiders the code for their personal safe but then froze. He said: ""All the alarms outside went on and flashing, alarms going off. As it happened I heard an almighty boom, shot, and Guy said 'I have been hit, I have been hit'."" Jewellery and other valuable items such as Louis Vuitton bags worth a total of £124,000 were stolen during the raid. Mr Hedger was a director of the Avonbourne International Business and Enterprise Trust, which runs colleges and a primary school in the Bournemouth area. The Prosecution said that Baccus was the second man in the house while Keeping remained in the getaway car. In the first 24 hours of the shooting police admitted they had no idea who may have been involved but the major breakthrough came when they found discarded cigarette butts around the corner from Mr Hedger's home. They contained the DNA of Baccus and detectives were then able to identify his known associates and track their movements at the time of the shooting. A search of Downton's Vauxhall Astra found a number of items in a hidden space in the ceiling including a scarf which had gunshot residue on it as well as a mobile phone and SIM card linked to the raid, the jury heard. Downton denied being involved in the raid and said he had been involved in a burglary earlier that night at sandwich shop. Mr Keeping, a drug addict, said he had stayed at home that night after drinking while watching TV, a claim supported by his wife who denied selling on the property. During sentencing, Mr Justice Jay, told them that the planning of the raid ""was amateurish and incompetent but that doesn't diminish the culpability of what happened"". Addressing Downton, he added: ""You have a cold, callous streak and show no remorse."" To Baccus, he said: ""I would not describe you as ruthless but I have seen no signs of remorse from you."""

JLR made its decision against as the sector demands clarity on the country's future trading relationship with the EU amid fears potential trade tariffs would drive away UK competitiveness in its biggest market - Europe. Industry figures have shown that total UK vehicle production fell 2% in 2017 while new car sales in the domestic market were almost 6% lower. JLR said: ""The automotive industry continues to face a range of challenges which are adversely affecting consumer confidence. ""Ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit is being felt by customers at home (with demand for new cars down 5.7% in 2017) and in Europe where collectively we sell approximately 45% of total UK production.

It said it was ""sensible business practice"" to reflect market forces as volumes had remained at ""peak"" levels. ""Halewood has enjoyed an extraordinary transformation since the introduction of the Range Rover Evoque in 2011 and Discovery Sport in 2014 thanks to more than £700m of investment,"" JLR said. It is not the only carmaker in the UK to announce production reductions in recent weeks. Earlier this month the new owner of Vauxhall, PSA Peugeot Citreon, said it was to slash 250 more jobs at the Ellesmere Port factory which makes the Astra. That was on top of 400 staff cuts announced in October. The leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said he had been told at a meeting in Paris with PSA boss Carlos Tavares that the company wanted to work with the union to ""construct a roadmap"" for future operations in the UK. Unite said in response to JLR's announcement: ""Unite is in close dialogue with the company and will be monitoring the situation closely. ""Economic and Brexit uncertainty are contributing factors along with the Government's confused policy on diesel engines. ""Car workers and manufacturing communities will be looking to the government to provide certainty over the UK's future trading relationship with Europe and to get the economy out of the slow lane. ""Workers will also be looking for a clear strategy from Government ministers on how they will support and invest in cleaner engine systems, such as electric, and ensure the UK car industry remains a world leader."""

Bill Billingham, 54, is in a critical condition in hospital after he was discovered with a stab wound to his stomach, and is expected to have surgery. The pair were found by police officers who were called to a house in Brownhills, near Walsall, in the West Midlands, at about 9.15pm on Saturday. The suspect posted a picture of Mylee on his Facebook page, shortly before the emergency services were alerted, with the caption: ""Pitza on bed lv moo x."" The schoolgirl is pictured in bed, smiling, with two plates of pizza. West Midlands Police said Billingham is yet to be questioned by officers due to his condition. A post-mortem examination will take place later to establish the exact cause of Mylee's death. Her headteacher said staff and pupils at St James Primary School in Brownhills were ""numb"" with ""shock"". ""Everyone at the school is completely devastated,"" said Andy Nicholls.

He said she was a ""fun-loving"" and ""happy"" girl ""who had her whole life in front of her"" and particularly enjoyed ""singing and performing"". Mr Nicholls added: ""She was just a lovely girl. Our hearts go out to her family at this difficult time."" Flowers and teddy bears have been left outside the property in memory of the child. One tribute read: ""Mylee, our superstar dancer, you will be the brightest star shining in the sky tonight. We will never forget your happy, smiling face. Fly high xxxx.""

Detective inspector Jim Colclough said: ""This is an absolutely tragic set of circumstances and my thoughts are with everyone who has been affected. ""We are still at the early stages of understanding exactly what happened and why - but I can confirm we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this investigation."" Bob Weir, whose home is two doors away from the bungalow where Mylee was stabbed, said a middle-aged man lived at the now sealed-off property, apparently on his own. He said: ""I was absolutely shocked - I didn't know the bloke who lived there and he hadn't lived there long, maybe six months, if that. ""There were police cars both sides of the road, ambulances...all sorts."" He added: ""I didn't know there were any kids in there. I thought he just lived on his own. I never saw a girl or a woman there."""

Across the UK, one in four eligible women (aged 25-64) do not take up their smear test invitation. This rises to one in three among 25 to 29-year-olds. The charity is releasing its new data at the start of Cervical Cancer Prevention Week (22-28 January). Robert Music, chief executive Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, says it is a ""big worry"" because smear tests prevent 75% of cervical cancers. ""Please don't let unhappiness or uncertainty about your body stop you from attending what could be a life-saving test. Nurses are professionals who carry out millions of tests every year, they can play a big part in ensuring women are comfortable,"" he said. Jilly Goodfellow, senior sister and nurse practitioner for colposcopy and gynaecology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ""Nurses who take smears see hundreds of women but should never forget that the procedure may be embarrassing for some women. ""The nurse's focus is to make women feel welcome, comfortable and ensuring their dignity is maintained, while obtaining a good sample."" Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35. Almost all (99.7%) cervical cancers are caused by the persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) which causes changes to the cervical cells.

Asked why he only referred to men in his post, he replied: ""When I said morning men I thought the women would of been busy preparing breakfast/getting kids ready/making the beds-sorry morning women!"" The 41-year-old deleted the posts and took down his Twitter account as criticism grew. A short time earlier, he had told his 1.6 million followers he was ""extremely proud and honoured"" to be joining the Lionesses. He is replacing Mark Sampson, who was sacked following evidence of ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" behaviour in a previous role. Neville, who earned 59 England caps and had a distinguished career with Everton after his time at Old Trafford, has been given a contract with the England women's team until the end of the 2021 European Championship. It is his first managerial post, having previously worked as a coach at Manchester United and Valencia and with the England men's U21 setup.

According to an indictment published on Tuesday, the 30-year-old's cause of death is yet to be confirmed - but it is believed she was strangled, or her throat was cut. The freelance journalist was on Madsen's home-built submarine off the coast of Copenhagen in August 2017 to interview him for an article. She was reported missing after failing to return home from the trip on the 18m (60ft) Nautilus submarine, which then sank. Madsen, who was rescued from the sinking vessel, has admitted dismembering Ms Wall on board and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he denies murdering or sexually assaulting her. He has also been charged with indecent handling of a corpse, dismemberment, and having sexual relations with Ms Wall of a ""particularly dangerous nature"". In October, officers searching his laboratory found a hard drive containing images of what appeared to be women being strangled and decapitated. Later that month, police confirmed that investigators had found 14 interior and exterior stab wounds to the journalist's genitals. Kim Wall had written for publications such as The New York Times, Harper's Magazine and The Guardian - reporting from countries including Haiti, Cuba and China. Prosecutors are likely to seek a life sentence for Madsen, which typically involves 15 years in jail without parole. A request has been made for Madsen to be held in custody until his trial begins on 8 March."

2018-01-23,"It is no surprise that Squadron Leader Andy Edgell, the test pilot for the new F-35 fighter jets being bought by the RAF and Royal Navy, says the computer game generation take to the £92m aircraft so easily.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180124004646/https://news.sky.com/story/flying-the-f-35-fighter-jet-is-childs-play-to-gamers-11220102,"Because climbing into the cockpit of one of these planes, which will form the backbone of the UK's airborne defences for the next few decades, is just like entering a giant computer game. The pilot is surrounded by graphics from all sides, providing instant analysis of the speed at which the aircraft is travelling, navigational aids, mapping and terrain information, along with camera images from all sides giving every conceivable view from the aircraft. This latter factor effectively enables the pilot to ""see through"" the aircraft and look at the land below them. Targeting information, navigation and altitude information is in one place, on one screen, making it exceptionally simple for the pilot to assess the situation. It's called 'sensor fusion'. And added to and enhancing that information is a helmet that is wired into the plane that enables the pilot to see, at all times, the position of enemy aircraft and any incoming missiles they may have fired, as well as friendly aircraft. When the pilot moves their head to the left or right, the data goes with them, so at no point is there any blind spot. All of that makes it exceptionally easy for pilots like Sqn Ldr Edgell to fly the aircraft. Landing the plane is simplicity itself, even for someone like me, who has never flown before. The aircraft handles exceptionally well and only the slightest touch on the controls will coax the mighty beast on the course set by the pilot. Landing a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean might sound like trying to place a football on a sixpence from the other end of the field but the plane does all of the work. The ""lift fan"" on the aircraft, mounted just behind the cockpit, means that the jet can not only take off from a very short distance, but can also ""hover"" above the deck prior to landing, like a Harrier jump jet, making vertical landing possible. When taking off or landing, the pilot can also see an image of the lift fan, helping them know precisely where they are in the process. As for the cockpit itself, it is light and comfortable, because the aim of the manufacturer has been to ensure the comfort of the pilot at all times. Which is understandable: if you're caught up in a dogfight with the enemy, or even simply patrolling the nation's airspace while armed to the teeth with an array of deadly laser-guided missiles, you want to feel comfortable."

Scotland Yard is now investigating the claim against the 60-year-old, who has not been arrested. Worboys, a former black cab driver, was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years for drugging and sexually assaulting female passengers. He was convicted of 19 offences relating to 12 victims, but has been linked to more than 100 complaints in total. A controversial Parole Board decision to approve his release later this month, following his minimum eight-year term, has led to a moral outcry - with lawyers for his victims describing the move as ""extremely distressing"". Over the weekend, Worboys was reportedly transferred from HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire to HMP Belmarsh in southeast London - prompting outrage from MPs. Justice Secretary David Gauke is facing demands for Worboys to be kept out of the capital - the area in which he preyed on his victims. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith told the minister that Worboys' proposed release ""has absolutely horrified and terrified his many, many victims"". Labour MP Neil Coyle told the House of Commons that Worboys ""is not welcome back"" to his home in Rotherhithe, south London, in the MP's constituency. ""He has not served the sentence he was given and was not prosecuted for the vast majority of his crimes,"" he said. Mr Gauke said he had stressed to officials ""the need to ensure that the concerns of victims are at the heart of the process"" in deciding Worboys' licence conditions. He also pressed the need for the ""most stringent"" conditions to be placed on Worboys' release. A source told Sky News it would be ""completely untrue"" to suggest Worboys will be released imminently. Upon release, Worboys would be expected to spend several months in a probation hostel, which would be staffed 24 hours a day and impose a night-time curfew. Last week, Mr Gauke revealed the Government will not be seeking a judicial review of the decision to release Worboys. Lawyers for two victims have said they intend to pursue the case in the courts. Commenting on reports of Worboys' prison transfer, Richard Scorer, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon, which represented a number of his victims, said: ""This is extremely distressing for our clients as yet again they have not been informed about developments in the Worboys case. ""It is an insult that they have had to find out from the media of every new development in this case and it is crucial that they are kept updated."" The Ministry of Justice said they do not comment on individual cases."

Woolwich Crown Court has heard evidence from several witnesses who said Osborne had been asked to leave his local pub near his home city the day before the attack, after upsetting drinkers and staff with Islamophobic statements. It is alleged he said ""all Muslims are terrorists"" and that he was ""going to take matters into my own hands"". One witness, Calum Spence, was asked to help remove Osborne, who was speaking in an ""aggressive and agitated manner"". When Mr Spence said he was in the Army, Osborne said he was too but would not say which regiment he was in. ""You’ll find out tomorrow,"" he is alleged to have said. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said Osborne drove to London the next day and attempted to target an Islamic march but couldn’t gain access. Video footage showing Mr Ali collapsing on Seven Sisters Road, and the van subsequently hitting the crowd was played to the jury on Monday and Tuesday. A warning was given by the judge before the footage was played out due to its graphic nature. Mr Ali's family were present in court on both days. Images showing Osborne hiring a van in Pontyclun, Wales and later writing a letter (believed to be the same letter found inside the van following the attack) were also shown to the jury. The prosecution accuse him of carrying out the ""act of terrorism"". Earlier in the trial, the court heard how Osborne’s internet search history and social media records showed he had researched Islamic State, murdered soldier Lee Rigby, Britain First, EDL founder Tommy Robinson and Britain First's deputy leader Jayda Fransen. The jury was also shown evidence that Osborne had received emails from an account linked to Tommy Robinson and a twitter message from Jayda Fransen. The messages did not appear to be personally written by the individuals but are understood to be from mailing lists. The content urged Osborne to join a rally and pledge money to a legal campaign. Osborne denies murder and attempted murder. The trial is expected to last for two weeks."

His mother, Takesha Thomas, and father, Lanre Haastrup, both 36, are arguing at the family division of the High Court that his treatment should continue and he ""deserves a chance"". Medical professionals have said he is suffering from a ""catastrophic brain injury"" with ""a profoundly low level of consciousness"" and there is no indication that he will improve. Specialists treating the baby say it would be ""futile"", ""burdensome"", and ""not in his best interests"" to continue giving him further intensive care treatment. Ms Thomas told the court: ""That's not their decision to make, that's for me within myself to make."" She continued: ""Can you handle a child that is so poorly? Can you give him love?... I am a good mother, I can give him love."" She also insisted that her son is responsive and that she spends more time with him than medical staff, who she said only assess him for ""two minutes"". Ms Thomas said she believes Isaiah has an emotional connection to her. She told the High Court: ""When I pick him up for cuddles, when I sing to him, when I rock him... he falls asleep in my arms."" She described to the court how she had seen him move his head, his thumb and open his eyes. ""One of the things I live by is that if you give a child love it will thrive,"" she said. A medical expert who assessed Isaiah independently told the court on Tuesday that his disabilities were ""profound"" and that he wasn't able to convince himself that the baby ""had any awareness at all"". The witness said that, in his experience, there is often ""a mismatch between what parents perceive and what carers perceive to be purposeful responses or emotional responses"". He also said that from his examination he concluded that Isaiah did not have ""any useful respiratory drive that would be life sustaining"". He added: ""I have never seen a patient as severe as him survive."" Isaiah was born on 18 February, 2017 at King's College Hospital in London by emergency caesarian. The trust accepts that a delay in carrying out the operation contributed to his brain damage. On Monday, Fiona Paterson, representing the hospital trust, told Mr Justice MacDonald: ""Anybody in these proceedings can understand the pain and suffering the parents have endured and continue to endure and how much they have put Isaiah's needs above their own."" She added the ""overwhelming medical evidence"" after many months of careful assessment and care was that it was in his best interests for treatment to be withdrawn. The judge is hearing evidence at a private trial and has ruled that the case can be reported but medics involved in his care cannot be identified. The hearing continues."

Speaking at the Charity Commission's annual public meeting in central London, he said: ""Some of my earliest memories relate to times that my parents spoke to me - or even better, showed me - what it meant to have both privilege and responsibilities. ""I remember being taken by my mother to a homelessness shelter at a young age, her explaining to me why the people I met there matter, why no society can be healthy unless we take other people seriously."" As well as paying tribute to his mother, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Prince, who is second in line to the throne, spoke about his father, the Prince of Wales. :: Royals pledge £2m to boost UK's mental health ""From my father, I learned how central charity was to his life his sense of purpose,"" he said. ""The Prince's Trust is not an arms-length organisation for my father. ""He cares deeply about The Prince's Trust because it is a living projection of his values."" Praising the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's commitment to charities, he said his family did not support good causes because ""it looks good"" but because ""charity is not an optional extra in society"". While William was speaking at the Charity Commission, the Duchess of Cambridge was launching a website aimed at helping teachers to avoid giving bad mental health advice. Kate joined Year Three pupils at the Roe Green Junior School in Brent, northwest London, before speaking to teachers about the initiative. The Duchess, who is six months pregnant, was wearing a royal blue dress by her favourite maternity outfitter, Seraphine, with a tanzanite pendant necklace and earrings made by jewellers G Collins and Sons. She said the pilot scheme, funded by the Royal Foundation, had been launched in 50 schools. ""I am so excited to see where this work will take us in the future,"" she told teachers and parents. The website is the next step on from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry's Heads Together campaign, encouraging people to speak about their mental health problems."

He becomes only the sixth British man to reach the semi-finals of a Grand Slam in the Open era. ""I really held my nerve in that last game and prayed that ball was out,"" he said. ""I want to keep going. Enjoy it today and be ready for Thursday.""​​​​ With former world number one Andy Murray absent through injury, the British media spotlight has been firmly focused on Edmund in recent days. Despite having never played in a Grand Slam quarter-final, it showed little sign of affecting him as he subdued a nervy Dimitrov. The Bulgarian struggled to reproduce the form that saw him beat home favourite Nick Kyrgios in the previous round, with his serve especially vulnerable. Edmund - watched from the front row of the Rod Laver Arena by former British number one Tim Henman - broke decisively at 4-4 in the opening set with a thunderbolt forehand off a weak second serve. Dimitrov took the second set but never looked completely comfortable against the ultra-aggressive Edmund and a double-fault at 3-4 in the third set proved costly. The players swapped breaks in the fourth set but Edmund broke again for a 5-4 lead to serve for the match. A tense final game saw Edmund double-fault before serving an ace which brought up match point. Dimitrov then sliced a backhand long which was confirmed by Hawk-Eye after an agonising wait, bringing the clash to a close after two hours and 49 minutes. Edmund is the first British man other than Murray to reach last four of the Australian Open since 1977. ""I know what it feels like to be Andy Murray for the last eight years,"" he joked. ""It comes with the territory. The better you do, the more attention you get. It's probably the first time I've done well on my own, so there's more attention, but you try to take it in your stride and try to embrace it as much as possible. ""It's a good problem to have. The more I keep winning, the better."" Murray himself seemed almost speechless by Edmund's stunning win, simply tweeting: ""Wow!"" Edmund's game in numbers"

Current leader Henry Bolton is refusing to resign despite a vote of no confidence in him being passed by UKIP's ruling body, and multiple resignations from his team of spokespeople. Mr Bolton is now placing the fate of his leadership in a ballot of 24,000 party members, who will decide whether to endorse or reject the verdict of UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) at an emergency general meeting, scheduled for next month. In refusing to quit, the former army officer has vowed to reform UKIP and, repeating an oft-used phrase of US President Donald Trump, promised to ""drain the swamp"". Despite not supporting Mr Bolton's leadership outright, Mr Farage is, however, backing the 54-year-old's decision to ignore the NEC's vote of no confidence. He told Sky News: ""Regardless of whether Bolton wins or not, this is now about more than Henry Bolton. ""This EGM and the run-up to it is the opportunity for, particularly the former leaders, to say to members of the party: 'You know this thing is now an amateur shambles, it doesn't work at virtually any level'. ""This is the chance to put fundamental reform in place, to get a party where a leader can actually lead. ""Because, I think, in their hearts, UKIP members know that's true. Simply, it's reform or die. ""If it goes on being run by a group of amateurs, within 18 months it will be worthless."" But, casting doubt on Mr Bolton's effectiveness as UKIP leader, Mr Farage added: ""Will he succeed? Will he fail? Is he good enough? I don't know."" The row over Mr Bolton has been prompted by the married father-of-three's relationship with his 25-year-old girlfriend Jo Marney. The model and UKIP activist has been accused of sending racist messages about Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle. Asked whether he is still in a relationship with Ms Marney, Mr Bolton told Sky News: ""My personal life has been put in a box to one side. I am focused entirely on delivering for the party."" In addition to losing Sunday's vote of no confidence by UKIP's NEC, Mr Bolton has seen one resignation after another by party spokespeople in a bid to force him to go. On Tuesday, MEP Jonathan Bullock joined the ranks of those demanding Mr Bolton stand down as he quit as UKIP energy spokesman. But the party leader has insisted he will fight on until the ballot of party members, which he revealed has been pencilled in for 17 February. Asked what it would take for him to stand down, Mr Bolton told Sky News: ""It will take a vote of the members at the EGM. ""If that goes against me, then I will stand down. ""It won't be a case of a resignation, that will be the end of my time as leader."""

Guerrero state prosecutors said she was not heard from again and authorities now believe she was murdered and dismembered. State security spokesman Roberto Alvarez said the woman's remains were found inside pots on a stove, adding: ""It is presumed that she was cooked."" He said the victim's ex-husband was the ""chief suspect"" and that the death was being investigated as a femicide - the killing of a woman directly motivated by their gender. According to a report last month by the Mexican government and the UN Women agency, murders of women in Mexico have risen sharply over the last 10 years. Of the 52,210 killings of women reported in the country since 1985, almost a third of them have taken place since 2011. The report said that Guerrero registered the second highest femicide rate per state in 2016."

The last search ended in January last year after covering more than 46,000 sq miles, with the bulk of the aircraft never found. Families of MH370 victims have previously spoken of their hopes that a new search would be launched, saying they had been left in ""constant limbo"". The Malaysian government has agreed to pay US firm Ocean Infinity up to $70 million (£50 million) if it finds the missing plane within 90 days. Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off MH370's radar before diverting it over the Indian Ocean. Debris was previously collected from islands in the Indian Ocean and Africa's east coast, with at least three pieces confirmed as coming from the aircraft. A search vessel, named the Seabed Constructor, set off from South Africa on 3 January and began its search on Monday, Malaysia’s Department of Civil Aviation said. It is moving towards a spot that Australia's scientific agency believes with ""unprecedented precision and certainty"" is the most likely location of the aircraft. The Seabed Constructor is carrying eight underwater vehicles that will scour the seabed with scanning equipment for information to be sent back for analysis. Charitha Pattiaratchi, professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia, said the underwater vehicles can cover an area of sea floor much faster than previous search efforts. He said: “If they don't find anything in the 90 days ... I think that would be the end for decades - this is like the final effort, if you like.” Ocean Infinity has said its search could be completed within three or four weeks, covering up to 23,000 sq miles in 90 days."

Confident and cool in the big moments, it's the stuff that champions are made of. But it hasn’t always been the case – something has clicked spectacularly in Melbourne. The killer instinct that many thought he lacked has been there in every match Down Under. He’s had to fight hard for his wins, at times in extreme heat, and his gutsy style of play is winning him more fans by the day. Clearly the 23-year-old has put his lowest moments of 2017 behind him, when he was losing matches he should have won, and found some mental metal – some proper Yorkshire grit. Indeed, famous former players are describing his forehand as the best in the game right now. Edmund doesn’t talk himself up much but quipped after his biggest ever win: ""I now know what it feels like to be Andy Murray for the last eight years."" That's one of the few jokes he was able to come up with in his post-match interviews – it’s clear that's part of his success he doesn’t enjoy. He is still slightly awkward when talking to the on-court reporter post-match. He's not a natural in front of the microphone, he's not an extrovert, but increasingly there is a belief he can win any match. I’ve always found him to be easygoing and friendly, and slightly baffled at times that anyone would be interested in talking to him. During Great Britain’s Davis Cup win two years ago, he was sometimes the butt of team jokes about repeating himself in his interviews. And while he’s no longer a rookie (although there are very few players above him in the rankings who are younger), his former coaches say that when it comes to work ethic he’s always had a maturity beyond his years. One of his old coaches, Colin Beecher, said: ""He likes his routine, so after each match he would wind down by going to the cinema, followed by a trip to the organic supermarket Wholefoods."" He’s put in plenty of hours on court in Miami with Andy Murray, learning from the best what it takes to be a champion and taking on the advice. But with new coaching set up of Fredrik Rosengren, a vastly experienced and well respected 57-year-old Swede, and Brit Mark Hilton, who helped Dan Evans into the top 50, Edmund seems to have found a winning formula. He’s made his training base in the Bahamas at Lleyton Hewitt’s new academy and has followed a punishing schedule in the off-season. It’s paying off and people are taking notice, especially in the locker room, and he doesn’t want it to end yet."

Each helicopter has been picking up seven people at a time and ferrying them to a school gymnasium in nearby San Valentino. A nearby guesthouse was also evacuated, and the whole village was cut off from the nearest major road by the heavy snowfall. Teams are now working to open roads to Val Senales, where thousands of tourists and residents had been isolated since Monday above Merano. Avalanche barriers have so far protected the town, according to the civil protection agency in Bolzano. Snowfall of up to 2m (6.6ft) has caused disruption across the Alps - beating record levels dating back to the early 1980s. The Chamonix ski area in France has also been closed due to avalanche risk, and several major roads and tunnels in the area have been shut down. Schools in parts of rural western Austria have also been closed. Main roads and rail lines in Switzerland have been blocked due to blizzard conditions, and some ski resorts have been closed. The World Economic Forum in Davos has also been affected, with snow delaying the arrival of some delegates.

Mr Martin added that the UK had so far been lucky to avoid such an attack and that the country is working on ""offensive cyber"" to give it the option of retaliating. The worst attack so far has been last year's WannaCry ransomware hack that caused problems across the world and demanded payment to restore systems. In the UK, it infected machines at 81 health trusts across England - a third of the 236 overall. US authorities have accused North Korea of being reponsible. Wannacry was classed as category two because there was no danger to life. But Mr Martin told the Guardian: ""I think it is a matter of when, not if and we will be fortunate to come to the end of the decade without having to trigger a category one attack."" Russia, Iran and China have been blamed for intrusions into UK computer systems. These may have been intelligence gathering for future attacks, according to Mr Martin. ""What we have seen from Russia thus far against the UK is a series of intrusions for espionage and possible pre-positioning into key sectors but in a more controlled form of attack from others,"" he said. Hitting back against malicious attacks also looks like becoming a more important option. ""Offensive cyber will be an increasing part of the UK's security toolkit,"" added Mr Martin. The National Cyber Security Centre was launched in 2016 and is part of GCHQ. It was set up to protect critical services and deal with any major attacks. Mr Martin's warning comes after the head of the Army said this week that the UK could be at risk from a hybrid attack by the likes of Russia, in which conventional warfare is used alongside cyberattacks. Sir Nick Carter said: ""The threats we face are not thousands of miles away but are now on Europe's doorstep - we have seen how cyberwarfare can be both waged on the battlefield and to disrupt normal people's lives - we in the UK are not immune from that."""

Authorities raised the alert level from three to the second-highest level of four on Monday, meaning that a ""hazardous eruption is imminent"", and the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has previously warned of ""the danger of rockfalls, landslides and sudden explosions"". Some 56,217 people are taking shelter in 46 evacuation camps and army troops and police are continuing to help move more villagers from their homes. More than 30,000 ash masks and about 5,000 sacks of rice, along with medicine, water and other supplies have been taken in. One disaster relief official warned that anyone who does not evacuate faces ""a death penalty"". ""If pyroclastic flows hit people, there is no chance for life,"" Cedric Daep told a news conference. ""Let us not violate the natural law, avoid the prohibited zone, because if you violate, the punishment is the death penalty."" The danger zone around the crater has been expanded from 6km (3.7m) to 8km (5m), but some residents have still tried to sneak back to their homes to check on them and even watch a popular cockfight in Albay province's Santo Domingo town. Quitin Velardo, a 59-year-old farmer, wanted to return to his village to take his cow and water buffalo to safety. ""We couldn't sleep last night because of the loud rumblings,"" he said. ""It sounded like an airplane that's about to land."" Nearby villages have been plunged into darkness by the daytime eruptions, with lava, rocks and debris sent hurtling down the mountain's slopes. There have been no deaths or injuries reported, but schools have been closed and flights have been cancelled, with the country's civil aviation authority shutting the airport in the southeastern city of Legazpi. Nine international and 16 domestic flights have been affected. Public and private offices in at least three towns were also closed as a heavy fall of ash hit urban areas. ""It was like night time at noon; there was zero visibility in some areas because the ash fall was so thick,"" said Albay disaster response officer Jukes Nunez. Authorities have warned a violent eruption may occur in hours or days, characterised by more rumblings and flows of superheated gas and volcanic debris racing down the slopes at high speeds. The 8,070ft (2,460m) high volcano last erupted in 2014, with lava flows forcing thousands of people to evacuate, and was at its most deadly in February 1841, when 1,200 people were killed and lava buried a town. But the most powerful explosion to hit the Philippines in recent times was from Mount Pinatubo, about 100km (62m) northwest of Manila, which killed more than 800 people when it erupted in 1991."

""Despite not just one profit warning, but three profit warnings, the Government went on to award over £2bn worth of contracts to Carillion."" Carillion went into liquidation last week leaving uncertainty for government contacts and thousands of jobs. Under Whitehall guidelines a company is considered ""High Risk"" if it issues ""a profits warning to a stock exchange"".In response the Government's ""Crown Representative"" is required work with the company to develop a strategy - an ""Improvement Plan"".In an opposition day debate Labour will call on the Government to reveal documents relating to these improvement plans.Labour's motion will use the same Parliamentary procedure as it did to force the Government to produce the Brexit impact assessments.Labour will demand the papers be released to the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee which would then have the right to review the material and determine what information is put in the public domain. Labour will argue that with Carillion, not only is there no evidence these strategic plans were implemented, but at times there wasn't a Crown Representative overseeing the situation. However, taking HS2 as an example, the department of transport argues that when the Carillion contract was entered into, there may have been a profit warning, but it wasn't a single company contract. HS2 was as a joint venture with other companies that came with assurances that the others would act as a safety net if one went bust. A Government spokesperson said: ""We closely monitor the financial situation of all of our strategic suppliers. ""There is a clear policy on how the Government manages suppliers, including for those that are deemed high risk, a requirement to submit an improvement plan. ""But it is not only this policy that allows Government to deal with suppliers in financial distress. ""Large contracts contain clauses that allow the contracting customer to terminate the agreement if necessary, and financial tests are applied during procurement to exclude suppliers who don't have the financial capacity to execute the contract."""
2018-01-23,The American government may be in shutdown but that hasn't stopped it sending two of its most senior officials on forays abroad.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180124004646/https://news.sky.com/story/tillerson-left-to-pick-up-the-pieces-from-trumps-pronouncements-11218049,"Both face severe challenges thanks to recent pronouncements by their boss, Donald Trump. Vice President Mike Pence is touring the Middle East on a trip that has been complicated by his President's contentious decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Key figures are either refusing to meet Mr Pence, or giving him lectures on the region's politics when they do instead. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in London, the first stop of a tour of Europe. His main aim: to push for a harder line on Iran and commitments from European allies to ""fix"" the nuclear deal with that country. This would be challenging enough. Mr Trump has threatened to remove America's support for the deal unless it is altered. The President says he believes it is a bad agreement but has thus far stopped short of scuppering it. The deal removed some sanctions against Iran in return for measures that verifiably curtail its alleged nuclear weapons programme. If Mr Trump walked away from the deal, his generals have warned, it would give the Iranians the green light to go hell for leather to make the bomb. So instead the President says it should be revised to deter Iran from meddling in other countries and from continuing a ballistic missile programme. There are two problems with that position. Firstly, the deal was deliberately designed only to cover nuclear weapon development, not other issues. Secondly, the countries that negotiated it along with America have made it clear they do not believe it should or can be renegotiated. When Mr Tillerson meets Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson we will likely hear plenty of tough talk about Iran's conduct, but progress towards a revised nuclear deal will be problematic to say the least. US-British relations have been complicated due to the President's bizarre interventions on Twitter. His apparent endorsement of a far-right British group on Twitter plunged relations to a new low when Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to express her disapproval. As an apparent sign of his disgruntlement at that, Mr Trump has ruled out coming to London to open the new US embassy. Mr Tillerson, who is reported to have called the President a ""moron"" previously, is left to pick up the pieces. It would be quite a task even for a seasoned diplomat. He has precious little experience in the field, having spent most of his life in the oil industry."
2018-01-23,"Thousands of Sainsbury's store staff are facing an uncertain future as the company looks to restructure senior roles in an ""efficiency"" drive.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180124004646/https://news.sky.com/story/thousands-of-sainsburys-staff-hit-by-shake-up-11219460,"The UK's second-largest supermarket chain would not say how many jobs could be lost under the process - announced 24 hours after a similar move affecting 1,700 roles was revealed by its biggest rival, Tesco. It said it was consulting on plans that will see the number of senior in-store posts across its larger stores and convenience operations slimmed down and replaced with fewer management roles. Staff will be given the choice of applying for the new roles, accepting a more junior position or face redundancy consultation. Simon Roberts, the company's retail and operations director, said: ""We're proposing a store management structure that will deliver best in class leadership and, in many cases, will offer an improved reward package for new management roles. ""The proposals will introduce a more efficient and effective structure, designed to meet the challenges of today's retail environment. ""They will deliver cost savings to be invested in our customer offer and in our colleagues as they continue to provide the very best service for our customers. ""Our intention is not to reduce overall headcount as a result of these proposals. ""I appreciate this will be a difficult time for those affected and we will fully support our people through these changes."" The grocery sector remains in the grip of a price war as the major established chains - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons, battle to limit the challenge to their market shares posed by discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. The big chains have slashed thousands of back office jobs in recent years as part of their efforts to save money - cash which can then be invested in lowering prices for shoppers. Sainsbury's revealed its latest shake-up on the back of plans, announced last year, to slash 3,000 roles in its human resources, head office and payroll departments. While the company used the release of its Christmas sales figures earlier this month to signal that trading remained ""challenging"", it raised its profit guidance to account for better-than-expected savings from its takeover of Argos in 2016. Bev Clarkson, the Unite union's acting national officer for food and drink, said of the latest employment shake-up: ""Unite will be seeking guarantees from the management during the 45-day consultation period that there will be no compulsory redundancies for our members. ""We appreciate that Sainsbury's has a good record of redeployment of staff in these situations and we will be exploring every avenue to ensure the continuing employment for our members."""

The firm manages about £600bn of assets around the globe - equivalent to about £80 for every person in the world. Mr Gilbert told Sky News that he considered world growth to be ""very strong"" and said the US economy was ""booming"". But he also stated he was confident that the UK economy would cope with Brexit better than many had expected. Mr Gilbert said: ""I think Brexit won't be as bad as we thought it might be because we all tend to overshoot on the downside when we make predictions. ""The borrowing figures suggest the UK economy is doing okay. Job figures are good. I think it is going to be better than people imagine. ""Companies in the UK are also doing okay. You have to remember to disregard what economists are saying and look at corporate results. ""Some British companies, especially domestic companies, seem to be doing quite well. Certainly we're not yet seeing the recession that was predicted."" Mr Gilbert said the financial services sector in the UK was still troubled by the uncertainty over Brexit negotiations, and added: ""The issue that the Government didn't get is that we in the financial services industry would have to press the contingency button so quickly. ""We can't just press it the day before the two years is up. So all the banks are preparing their contingency to set up another office in Europe - normally Dublin. Dublin's doing quite well out of this."" But Gilbert, like some other major business leaders, believes there is another issue looming for global companies, and that is growing disquiet about the effects of global capitalism. He told me: ""If you speak to the younger generation they have fallen out of love with capitalism, so it does need to change and become more user friendly going forward. ""There is no faith in the system from younger people than myself. ""In the case of asset management, we have to become more transparent and appeal to youngsters. ""They want to know how much they're paying - how much they're paying in fees, what we're investing in and why we're investing in them. They don't want to invest in companies that aren't doing the right thing."""
2018-01-23,The pound has climbed to $1.40 against the US dollar as it reached a fresh post-Brexit vote high.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180124004646/https://news.sky.com/story/pound-tops-140-for-the-first-time-since-brexit-vote-11219475,"It came as sterling continued to rally thanks to growing optimism about the UK economy and protracted weakness for the US currency. There is also growing optimism that Britain can secure a favourable Brexit deal. The pound collapsed from $1.50 in the wake of the European referendum result in June 2016 to reach its lowest level against the dollar since the mid-1980s. It slid as low as $1.20 in ensuing months but steadily gained ground during the course of 2017. The pound hit a post-referendum high of $1.37 earlier this month and has since continued its rally, edging above $1.40 in the early hours of Tuesday before slipping back a little later in the session. It comes as the dollar has weakened, not helped by anxiety over the recent US government shutdown. The pound's weakness since the referendum has had a major impact on the British economy, pushing up import prices which have filtered through to consumer inflation - at a time when household incomes are struggling to keep pace. That has weighed on spending, dragging on the retail sector and wider services industry which dominates UK economic output. However, the pound's weakness has provided a boost to Britain's factories, making their products more attractively priced for overseas customers. Sterling's latest rise leaves it not far off its level against the dollar in the months leading up to the Brexit vote, when it at times dipped to around $1.40. If maintained it will mean more spending power for British holidaymakers this summer compared to mid-2016, when a pound would only buy around $1.30. Sterling's recent performance against the euro has been more choppy and it was little changed in the latest session at around €1.14, compared to a pre-referendum high of about €1.30."

He said police were looking to question two other girls in the district, which is on the Mozambique border, so they can help with information on the men who impregnated them. Men who get schoolgirls pregnant in the East African nation face at least 30 years in prison. The sentences are meant to stop girls under the legal age of 18 getting married as well as teenage pregnancies, which lead to school dropouts. However, the authorities have been highly criticised for not allowing girls back to school after they have given birth. In June last year, Tanzania's president John Magufuli faced condemnation after sending out a threatening warning. He told a rally of schoolgirls: ""After getting pregnant, you are done."" In 2002, a law was passed which allowed girls to be expelled from school for getting pregnant. The law says girls can be expelled and excluded from school for ""offences against morality"" and ""wedlock"". Human Rights Watch said many girls experience sexual harassment and exploitation by teachers and schools lack adequate protection and confidential reporting mechanisms."

Parts of Alaska and the west coast of Canada were issued with a tsunami warning, while a tsunami watch was put in place for the entire US west coast - with ""hazardous waves"" said to be possible within the first three hours of the earthquake. However, the watch status was later cancelled throughout the US and Canada by the National Tsunami Centre, barring areas local to the quake itself in Alaska. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had said when news of the quake broke: ""Based on all available data a tsunami may have been generated by this earthquake that could be destructive on coastal areas even far from the epicentre."" Watches were put in place for British Columbia in Canada, as well as Washington state, Oregon, California and Hawaii. People in Alaska's largest city, Anchorage, reported feeling the quake, despite being hundreds of miles away. Resident and KTVA reporter Emily Carlson told Sky News she felt the ""slow groan"" of the tremor for about 30 or 40 seconds, but that the city was not under threat. She said: ""People are generally trying to stay very calm. I think people are worried and I've heard a lot of people heading to higher ground, but we're still monitoring it on social media. In the middle of the night, not everybody is by their phone. ""Where we are we are not in tsunami danger. Kodiak Island is where the earthquake is closest to and I've seen on social media people are evacuating and heading to the high school. ""Earthquakes to me are the scariest natural disaster that you could imagine because with earthquakes come tsunamis. But we live in Alaska so we hear about earthquakes all the time; so while people are worried, it's very measured, they're calm, and they're just waiting to see what happens."" In Kodiak, one of seven communities on Kodiak Island, schools were used as shelters for people who evacuated their homes, with police there telling residents to retreat to higher ground and await further updates. In a video posted to the Kodiak Police Department Facebook page shortly after the quake, one officer said: ""This is not a drill - this is an actual tsunami warning. ""Everybody get at least 100ft above sea level. Everybody get out of your homes and to a safe place. Best place right now is the high school parking lot."" The department later said in a statement: ""Remain at high ground. We have received two reports that the tide levels have been fluctuating in the channel six inches to one foot."" But no areas appeared to be under immediate threat, with waves missing their predicted landfall time in Kodiak, which would likely have been the first community to be hit. Alaska resident @emilyreporting describes her experience during the earthquake and has the latest on the US west coast tsunami warning pic.twitter.com/WyW1SUBjwi In a wider warning for Alaska and British Columbia issued earlier, the Anchorage Office of Emergency Management said: ""If you are located in this coastal area, move inland to higher ground.

However, the campaign website was not providing any live advice or updates due to the US government shutdown. Only four earthquakes with a greater magnitude have ever been recorded in the US, all of which were in Alaska and caused a tsunami. The most powerful came on 27 March 1964, when a 9.2 magnitude quake caused ground fissures, collapsed buildings and killed 139 people.

On Monday night, council leader Simon Dudley survived a vote of no confidence at a private meeting of Conservative councillors. According to the Maidenhead Advertiser, seven councillors voted in favour of the motion but 26 were needed for it to pass. After the meeting, both Mr Majeed and Mr Brimacombe announced they could not continue to back Mr Dudley and said they will instead now serve as independent Conservative councillors. In a joint statement, they said: ""Immediately following the announcement of the result of the no-confidence vote, Cllr Majeed and Cllr Brimacombe resigned from the Conservative Group and departed the meeting. ""It was not considered appropriate by them to wholeheartedly disagree with the will of group on this fundamental issue and yet to remain within the group. ""With the departure of the last of the few dissenting voices within the Conservative group possibly an even more cohesive and purposeful Conservative group will emerge."" They will continue to represent the residents of Oldfield and Cox Green as independent Conservative councillors, ""with the same core values upon which they were elected"", the statement said. At the beginning of this month, Mr Dudley sent a letter to Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfield expressing his concerns about ""aggressive begging"" in Windsor. The Berkshire town will host Prince Harry's wedding to actress Meghan Markle on 19 May. In the letter, copied to the Prime Minister, Mr Dudley claimed there was evidence ""a large number of adults that are begging in Windsor are not in fact homeless"", while some were sleeping rough as a ""voluntary choice"", he said. Citing Windsor's ""national importance"" and the upcoming Royal wedding, Mr Dudley urged police to consider anti-social behaviour orders to deal with the ""totally unacceptable"" situation. The letter followed tweets sent by Mr Dudley in which he suggested there was ""an epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy"" in Windsor and revealed he would be writing to police ""asking them to focus on dealing with this"" before the Royal wedding. Mr Dudley's letter and Twitter post sparked anger from a local homeless charity, which condemned his ""sickening"" remarks. At the time, Theresa May, who is MP for Maidenhead, said she did not agree with the local council leader. ""I think it is important that councils work hard to ensure that they are providing accommodation for those people who are homeless, and where there are issues of people who are aggressively begging on the streets then it's important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive begging,"" she said."

""We have made it clear that we are not going to campaign to de-select anyone, at all, anywhere,"" he said in an interview with The Independent. ""Momentum nationally is not going to campaign to deselect any MP and we will stick by that. We are not going to campaign to deselect any individual MP."" Mr Lansman claims a Sunday Times report last weekend about a ""deselection hit list"" of MPs critical to Mr Corbyn had ""no factual basis whatsoever"". But in a warning that will alarm some Labour MPs, he says it ""wouldn't be surprising"" if local constituency parties use a trigger ballot process to ditch MPs who don't try to perform well. ""No Labour MP that works hard and campaigns and listens to their members has anything to fear from the selection process,"" Mr Lansman - a former aide to Tony Benn - adds. The Sunday Times claimed up to 50 Labour MPs are on a Momentum hit list and that a Labour whip has told moderate MPs not to rock the boat or they could face deselection. Neil Coyle, a critic of Mr Corbyn who has been the target of Twitter attacks by supporters of the Labour leader, told The Independent that Mr Lansman's comments were welcome. But he added: ""Lansman's real challenge is in ensuring Momentum members at local level adhere to his commitment."" Chris Leslie - an anti-Brexit rebel named on the reported deselection hit list - said: ""The Momentum leadership are constantly obsessing about process. ""It is an attempt to instil fear into every single member of the Parliamentary Labour Party, whether they are on the frontbench or the backbench, that the threat to their job is always there if they dare disagree."" At the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday, Mr Leslie challenged chief whip Nick Brown on The Sunday Times claims, but Mr Brown said there was no deselection hit list."

Witness Ibrahim Benaounda described the impact as like being ""on a rollercoaster"", saying he could feel his bones breaking as he spun in the air. Prosecutors allege that 48-year-old Darren Osborne, from Cardiff, targeted the worshippers deliberately. Makram Ali, 51, collapsed after leaving Ramadan prayers and was being helped by a crowd before a van drove into him. He died and nine others were injured. A 999 call, played to the court, was made after Mr Ali collapsed. It includes the moment the van ran into the crowd. The caller is heard saying: ""Someone's just come with a big van and run over a lot of people. People are dying, he's just run over everyone. People are dying man."" Adnan Mohamud said he heard the driver speaking after he had been wrestled to the ground. ""Whilst this male was on the floor, I remember him saying, 'I have done my job, you can kill me now'. He was smiling as he said it,"" Mr Mohamud said in a statement to the court. ""Something I will never forget was that he was constantly smiling. I knew at this point that what he did was not an accident - it was definitely deliberate,"" Mr Mohamud added. Mohammed Geedi, 28, told the court: ""I see the big white van, I can see the headlights... I can hear a rev."" Following the impact, Mr Geedi ""looked at a lot of people just splattered all over the place"". Susan Can said in a statement that as the van driver was detained and put in the back of a police van, she saw him ""blow a kiss at the crowd"". This made a ""very angry"" crowd ""angrier still"". After the driver was set upon by a group of about 10 to 15 people who threw punches at him ""from almost every direction"", Imam Mohammed Mahmoud told them to stop. ""It was a natural response,"" Mr Mahmoud told the court. ""He posed no harm to anybody. He was immobilised. ""He wasn't a threat and therefore he should answer for his crime in a court such as this, which he is doing now, and not in a court in the streets."" Darren Osborne denies the murder of Mr Ali and the attempted murder of ""persons at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Whadcoat Street, London"". The trial continues."

""While we are world-leading in offering free treatment for addiction, we cannot be complacent. That's why I've asked PHE to conduct this review.

The PHE review will examine why: It will also consider the number of adults taking prescription-only painkillers not prescribed to them. A recent poll suggested the figure may be as high as 7.6%. The review will look at benzodiazepines and z-drugs, pregabalin and gabapentin, opioid pain medicines and antidepressants and make recommendations on how to address the issue of dependency. Rosanna O'Connor, director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco at PHE, said: ""It is of real concern that so many people find themselves dependent on or suffering withdrawal symptoms from prescribed medicines.

In a statement, the organisation said: ""The trustees have decided that the Presidents Club will not host any further fundraising events. ""Remaining funds will be distributed in an efficient manner to children's charities and it will then be closed."" The Presidents Club's accounts reveal it hands millions of pounds a year to charitable causes. But allegations about the secretive Dorchester dinner, published after an undercover investigation by the Financial Times, have prompted an outpouring of criticism for the event's organisers and more than 300 male guests. Businessman David Meller, who is on the board of the Presidents Club charitable trust, has left his non-executive role with the Department of Education amid the scandal. Opposition MPs have also raised questions about the attendance of Tory minister Nadhim Zahawi at the London dinner, which has been an annual event for more than 30 years. The politician, said to have left the dinner early, branded reports of behaviour at the event ""shocking"" and vowed never to attend a men-only function again. Leading businessmen and prominent celebrities are also reported to be among past and recent attendees of the annual event. One of Mr Zahawi's government colleagues, digital minister Margot James, branded the ""ghastly"" dinner an event for ""slimeballs"". In the House of Commons, furious MPs suggested allegations of groping and indecent exposure should be passed to the Met Police as they claimed the dinner had seen women ""bought as bait for rich men"". London's Great Ormond Street Hospital said it will return all previous donations from the Presidents Club following the claims. Madison Marriage, the undercover reporter who posed as one of the 130 women hired as hostesses at the dinner, described a ""huge amount of testosterone in the room"". She told BBC Newsnight: ""I was groped several times and I know there were numerous other hostesses who said the same thing had happened to them. ""It's hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going around your waist unexpectedly. ""One of the strangest things was you could be talking to a man and he would suddenly start holding your hand."" The journalist claimed one woman was ""asked if she was a prostitute"". Earlier on Wednesday, advertising giant WPP ended its association with the Presidents Club having traditionally sponsored a table at the dinner. Another table sponsor, leading real estate fund manager Frogmore, also cut its ties with the charity. Comedian David Walliams, who hosted last Thursday's fundraiser, said he was there in a ""strictly professional capacity and not as a guest"". ""I left immediately after I had finished my presenting on stage at 11.30pm,"" he added. ""I did not witness any of the kind of behaviour that allegedly occurred and am absolutely appalled by the reports."" A spokesman said Mr Walliams' fee for the evening had been donated to a children's charity. Lots at the dinner's charitable auction reportedly included lunch with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, tea with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, a night at Soho's Windmill strip club, and a course of plastic surgery to ""add spice to your wife"". Mr Johnson was said to have known ""nothing"" of his inclusion in any auction and had in no way endorsed the event, while the Bank of England said the offer of tea with Mr Carney had been re-auctioned as a prize from another unrelated charitable event without their knowledge. They withdrew the offer. TV presenter Jonny Gould, who hosted the auction, said: ""I have auctioneered at this event for the last five years, raising millions for the charities the event supports. ""I have never witnessed any of the alleged behaviour of guests at this event nor in previous years. If I had I would not have continued to work at the event."" Downing Street said the Prime Minister was ""uncomfortable"" about the reports of the event, as well as the male-only aspect of it. But Theresa May retains full confidence in Mr Zahawi, who regrets his decision to attend the dinner, the Prime Minister's spokesman added."
2018-01-24,The UK's two biggest selling newspapers have threatened legal action unless the reasons for the decision to free sex attacker John Worboys are released. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180125012222/https://news.sky.com/story/legal-action-threatened-over-rapist-worboys-parole-report-11220400,"The Sun and the Daily Mail have jointly written to the Parole Board and the Justice Secretary. The letter says that unless the reasons behind the decision to recommend the rapist's release from prison are published within seven days, lawyers will apply for a full judicial review to have that decision overturned. It says the report is a ""matter of profound public interest"" and keeping it secret is a breach of open justice. The controversial Parole Board decision to approve his release later this month, following his minimum eight-year term, has led to a moral outcry - with lawyers for his victims describing the move as ""extremely distressing"". Black cab driver Worboys was jailed indefinitely in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting women passengers. He was convicted of 19 offences relating to 12 victims but is suspected to have been linked to 102 complaints in total. It is understood that a fresh allegation of historical sexual assault has been made against the 60-year-old. The incident, which was reported to the police earlier this month, is reported to have taken place in 1997. Scotland Yard is now investigating the claim against Worboys, who has not been arrested. Over the weekend, he was reportedly transferred from HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire to HMP Belmarsh in southeast London. Justice Secretary David Gauke is facing demands for Worboys to be kept out of the capital - the area in which he preyed on his victims. Mr Gauke said he had stressed to officials ""the need to ensure that the concerns of victims are at the heart of the process"" in deciding Worboys' licence conditions. A source told Sky News it would be ""completely untrue"" to suggest Worboys will be released imminently. Upon release, Worboys would be expected to spend several months in a probation hostel, which would be staffed 24 hours a day and impose a night-time curfew. Last week, Mr Gauke revealed the Government will not be seeking a judicial review of the decision to release Worboys. Lawyers for two victims have said they intend to pursue the case in the courts."

Not her type, apparently. But, on Wednesday night, Mrs May landed in Davos to rub shoulders with the global elite she purports to disdain. The annual World Economic Forum gathering at the Swiss Alpine resort attracts global leaders, billionaire businessmen and corporate financiers. A political powerhouse of attendees including US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. From business, the chief executives of the world's biggest companies: Microsoft, Alibaba and Google. Mrs May, swapping her trademark kitten heels for a £120 pair of Sorel snow boots, will - like other global leaders - deliver a keynote speech. Hers will be on Thursday afternoon, continuing her crusade for social media companies to play their part in stamping out online extremism. But, the talking point around Mrs May will not be what happens in her setpiece address, but what happens on the sidelines between her and Mr Trump. There was a question over whether the two leaders would even meet in Davos, after the US President scrapped a visit to open the new American embassy in London. Mr Trump blamed it on the new building being off location (moving from Mayfair to Vauxhall) and too expensive - a ""bad deal"", he claimed. But it raised suspicion that the ""special relationship"" was under strain: a trip to London ditched on the heels of a very public falling out between the two leaders last November, after Mrs May criticised Mr Trump for retweeting propaganda videos from far-right group Britain First. A chance then to clear the air after a bumpy few months, with the two leaders expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. She is still hoping for a swift post-Brexit trade deal. And what of that Trump trip to the UK? The US President has accepted an invitation for a state visit, but no date has been confirmed amid the expectation there will be widespread protests on the streets. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has forcefully voiced his opposition to the red carpet being rolled out for Mr Trump in the capital. And more than 1.86 million people signed a petition against Mr Trump's state visit. Of course, one big event in 2018 where he would be received by cheering crowds is the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. A trip to Windsor Castle for a Royal wedding is an American fairy tale that would no doubt delight Mr Trump. But Prince Harry is closer to the former White House incumbent Barack Obama than the current president. And adding the Trumps to the guestlist is not in Mrs May's interest. It could prove a diplomatic incident not of her making, but damage her all the same."
2018-01-24,A letter has emerged allegedly revealing the fate of three criminals who pulled off a historic escape from Alcatraz and disappeared without a trace more than 40 years ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180125012222/https://news.sky.com/story/escape-from-alcatraz-does-letter-finally-solve-mystery-of-prisons-most-infamous-escapees-11220573,"On the night of 11 June 1962, brothers John and Clarence Anglin and fellow inmate Frank Morris pulled off a prison break so daring it went on to inspire Hollywood thriller Escape from Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. Aided by another prisoner, Allen West, they used saw blades, spoons and a drill over the course of six months to gradually forge an exit through ventilation ducts in their cells. The men sculpted dummy heads from papier mache and plaster, and piled towels and clothing under their blankets to conceal their absence, before climbing to the roof through a ventilation shaft and making their way down to the shoreline. They made their getaway on an inflatable raft - never to be seen or heard from again. One popular theory to have emerged since then is that they never made it back to land, but their bodies were never found in the depths of San Francisco Bay. Now - almost 46 years on - a letter claiming to be written by John Anglin alleges that they did survive. It reads: ""My name is John Anglin. I escape (sic) from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris. ""I'm 83-years-old and in bad shape. I have cancer. Yes we all made it that night but barely! “If you announce on TV that I will be promised to first go to jail for no more than a year and get medical attention, I will write back to let you know exactly where I am. This is no joke.” The letter - obtained by CBS San Francisco - was allegedly sent to the city's Richmond police station in 2013 and claims that Clarence Anglin died in 2011 and Morris in 2008. Since the escape, John Anglin is said to have spent many years living in Seattle, followed by an eight-year spell in North Dakota. At the time of writing the letter, he apparently lived in the south of California. It was tested for fingerprints by the FBI as part of its most recent reopening of the mysterious case, but results were said to be ""inconclusive"". The agency has previously asserted that the men died after being swept out to the Pacific Ocean. But back in 2012, US marshal Michael Dyke, who inherited the case in 2003, said he had seen enough evidence to make him wonder if they could be alive. This included reports that the brothers' mother received flowers without ever a card for several years after their disappearance, and that they attended her funeral in 1973 disguised in women's clothes. In Alcatraz's 30 years of operation, the brothers and Morris are three of just five criminals to have been unaccounted for following escape attempts, with 23 caught, six shot and killed, and two having drowned. The prison shut in 1963 due to spiralling costs and the island is now a popular tourist attraction."

The Association of British Insurers (ABI) released the data and said the overall average for the whole of 2017 was £481. That represents a £40 or 9% increase on 2016. The average motor insurance policy has jumped 29% since 2014, the ABI added. It is calling for insurance premium tax - which the Government has put up several times in recent years - to be frozen to help drivers lower their motoring costs. The standard rate is now 12% - double what it was between 2011 and the end of 2015. Whiplash claims and changes to lump-sum compensation payments for people with long-term injuries are also blamed for the increase. Rob Cummings, the ABI's head of motor and liability, said: ""The rising cost of motor insurance shows no sign of abating. ""Changes to how compensation payouts are calculated, insurance premium tax, more whiplash-style claims and rising repair bills are all piling on the pressure for cash-strapped drivers."" While the average is now £493, there are large regional differences. Research last year unsuprisingly named London as the most expensive, with average premiums of £1,000, while the cheapest areas were Scotland and southwest England.."

Shocked tourists posted pictures of the delicacy on social media which prompted an investigation into the stall selling them. The market's manager, Wichai Thanessanurak, admitted he had not carried out the proper checks and controls on all products being sold. He said selling seahorses to eat tainted the town's tourism sector, something it relies heavily on. On Wednesday the vendor was banned from the market. Paisri Worawong said she had been selling the fish for about a month to Chinese tourists who believe eating seahorses can give them energy and cure erectile dysfunction. She had been buying the fish from a medicine shop in Bangkok for 80 baht (£1.80) and selling them for a marked-up price. Ms Worawong told Thai media: ""I did it because of my ignorance."" She is not facing legal action because seahorses are not protected in Thailand. However, the government is signed up to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which banned the import or export of seahorses in 2016. Seahorses are essential to maintain balance of the entire marine food chain, Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine ecologist told the SCMP. ""Seahorses are important to the marine ecosystem because they help balance the quantity of plankton on the seabed,"" he said. ""If they keep being caught in such large numbers and sold commercially it will affect the entire marine food chain."" The kebab incident has prompted the Thai Fisheries Department to seriously consider banning the fishing of seahorses. Officials were sent on Tuesday to find out whether the seahorses being sold were farmed or fished, deputy director general Umaporn Pimolbutr said. Ms Umaporn added: ""It is not a protected species yet. ""Right now we can't press any charges against domestic traders but the department plans to issue a ban on fishing for seahorses in all Thai waters soon. ""This means fishermen and trawlers will not be able to target them primarily. They can only sell them if they are caught accidentally."" Research has found hundreds of thousands of seahorses are fished mistakenly by Thai trawlers each year."

It is thought that he had been bullied and a previous inquest decided he took his own life. But after three other recruits died in the following seven years, we now know much more about the culture of abuse at the military base. Private Benton's family hope that this inquest, which is held in Woking and is expected to continue until the end of March, will get to the truth, but his parents did not live long enough to see the investigation they long demanded. His father died in 2011 and his mother four years later. His sister, Tracey Lewis, told Sky News she now wants closure: ""It's been too long. My mum tried. It was like hitting a brick wall. There's been allegations of abuse, physically and mentally. ""I want the truth what happened to him. Why was he in that environment, that culture?"" She says her brother was ""kind, sensitive and thoughtful"", but it is possible such qualities were seen as signs of weakness and may have made him a target. Last year, at a new inquest into the death of Private Cheryl James, who also died in 1995, the Army said major changes had now been made to the way young recruits were supervised. In fact the latest recruitment campaign focuses on mental and emotional support for young soldiers. Ms Lewis agrees such a proactive approach may have made a difference to her brother: ""Because people don't want to join the Army, they're taking that different approach. But I don't think it's a bad thing."" She said it would ""definitely"" have saved his life. Her solicitor, Emma Norton, said: ""The way the Army deals with mental health, the way it supports soldiers who've returned from operations overseas, the welfare support that it gives them, the way it looks after women in particular, these are still issues it still needs to work on. ""So we don't accept that you can just consign this to history."" The original coroner's hearing was wrapped up in less than two hours. The new inquest is expected to last several weeks."

Andrew and Elad, who met while Andrew studied in Israel, are both listed on the birth certificates of the children, who were born in Canada via a surrogate using donor eggs and sperm from each father. Their latest battle comes after they moved to Canada to get married as they were unable to do so in either Israel or the United States. They filed their case after moving to Los Angeles and Ethan's tourist visa expiring last month. Elad, 32, said: ""What we're trying to do is pursue justice for Ethan and correct a wrong that the State Department is continuing to pursue that might affect other couples."" LGBTQ immigrants rights group Immigration Equality, which filed the case, said the children of US citizens who marry abroad are entitled to citizenship at birth, regardless of where they are born - and even if the other partner is foreign. The organisation said the policy was designed for children born out of wedlock and was wrongly being applied to married same-sex couples. Immigration Equality executive director Aaron Morris said: ""If a mother and father walk into a consulate and have a marriage certificate and birth certificate, they're never asked any questions about the biology of the child. ""But the converse is also true and every same-sex couple will be asked that."" The State Department said it would not comment on an ongoing case but gave directions to guidance on its website which said a biological connection to a US citizen was necessary for a child to become a citizen at birth. The couple knew who the boys' biological fathers were but planned on keeping it secret. However, they were made to take a DNA test or risk both being rejected citizenship. ""I started crying,"" said Andrew, 37. ""These are twins, how can you differentiate between them? They were born minutes apart."" After submitting the DNA results, Aiden was given a US passport but his brother's application was denied."

On Wednesday Roisin Wood, who heads football's equality and inclusion organisation, Kick it Out, asked whether the 41-year-old's ""misogynistic and sexist"" posts would be examined by the FA. In response, the governing body's chief executive, Martin Glenn, said the comments did not meet the ""threshold for issuing a charge"". However, Mr Glenn added that the coach would be ""educated on all aspects of the FA's regulatory functions and his responsibilities thereunder"". Neville has been ""warned that any future comments that are deemed to cross the charging threshold will be treated with the utmost seriousness and may lead to disciplinary action"". Neville, who played 59 times for England, wrote in 2012: ""Morning men couple of hours cricket be4 work sets me up nicely for the day."" Asked why he had referred only to men in his post, he replied: ""When I said morning men I thought the women would of been busy preparing breakfast/getting kids ready/making the beds-sorry morning women!"" A further tweet from the account, seemingly intended as a joke, read: ""Relax I'm back chilled - just battered the wife!!! Feel better now!"" Another from December 2012 said: ""U women of [sic] always wanted equality until it comes to paying the bills. #hypocrites."" Kick It Out said it had ""serious concerns"" over Neville's suitability to be the Lionesses' coach, while the Female Coaching Network described the appointment as ""mind-blowingly wrong"". ""What can all too easily be passed off as banter can actually be extremely harmful,"" said Sian Hawkins from Women's Aid. In a letter to Roisin Wood, Mr Glenn said that prior to appointing Neville, the FA had been aware of ""some, but not all"" of the historic tweets related to women. Responding to claims that Neville lacked any experience in women's football, Mr Glenn said the appointment process had been ""rigorous and fair"". He wrote: ""I hope you will appreciate that this has not been a straightforward process. ""We have been determined to find someone who we think can inspire the team to the very highest levels. ""I have personally been impressed by Phil's determination, his integrity and values that came through strongly in his background checks and references."" Neville's action in deleting his Twitter account was his own decision, Mr Glenn said. In an Instagram post, Neville's wife Julie described him as ""the most honest, kind, generous, gentle and hard-working man I have ever met""."

Although she is expected to praise the potential of technology to ""transform lives"", she will also call on social media companies to do much more to stop allowing content that promotes terror, extremism and child abuse. She will say: ""Technology companies still need to go further in stepping up to their responsibilities for dealing with harmful and illegal online activity. ""These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. ""We need to go further, so that ultimately this content is removed automatically. These companies have some of the best brains in the world. They must focus their brightest and best on meeting these fundamental social responsibilities."" Some of the leading figures in the global tech industry have come to Davos for the four-day conference. Among them are Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and the chief strategy officer of Snapchat, Imran Khan. Mrs May will say that responsibility for policing social media content cannot just fall on the biggest and most established players, saying: ""Just as these big companies need to step up, so we also need cross-industry responses because smaller platforms can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists. We have seen that happen with Telegram."" Telegram is a messaging app developed by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, and reportedly used widely by Islamic State. None of its management are in Davos. “We need to see more cooperation from smaller platforms like this,” Mrs May will say. “No one wants to be known as 'the terrorists' platform' or the first-choice app for paedophiles."" The demand for social media companies to clean up their act is not a new one. However, the Prime Minister is expected to add some further weight to her argument by invoking the idea that investors should consider withdrawing their investment if they aren't satisfied that companies are acting in a responsible way. Mrs May will say: ""Investors can play a vital role by considering the social impact of the companies they are investing in. They can use their influence to ensure these issues are taken seriously. ""For example, earlier this month a group of shareholders demanded that Facebook and Twitter disclose more information about sexual harassment, fake news, hate speech and other forms of abuse that take place on the companies’ platforms. ""Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so."""

He suggested the UK would be a ""vassal state"" during the ""implementation"" phase of Brexit, expected to last between 18 and 24 months. And he branded the Brexit Secretary's answers ""weak"" in the showdown at a select committee. Committee member Mr Rees-Mogg asked: ""If on 30 March 2019, the UK is subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ, takes new rules related to the single market and is paying into the European budget, are we not a vassal state?"" Mr Davis replied: ""If that were going to be the case in perpetuity, my answer would probably be yes, but the answer for a short time, no."" But his backbench colleague said it was ""hard to think of any precedent in the world"" for a country to follow judgements imposed by another nation's courts without a judge to represent itself. The North East Somerset MP said it amounted to the UK being ""de factor in the EU for two more years"", asking ""why aren't we just extending Article 50?"" Article 50 is the trigger that the UK invoked in March 2017 to leave the EU within two years. Mr Davis said the ""massive difference"" between Britain's terms as a member and what it will be subject to during the transition was its ability to make international trade deals. ""If we do it this way, they will come into effect very soon after conclusion in 2020/2021,"" he said. ""If we extend our membership we will not be able to."" He eventually conceded: ""You call it what you like."" Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the pair's ""bickering"" was ""the starkest evidence yet"" that a transition deal was ""far from secure"". But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage praised Mr Mogg for ""holding the Government to account on Brexit backsliding"". ""At least someone is,"" he added. Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament, warned later in a speech to MEPs that the UK would be a ""dwarf"" on the world stage outside the EU. ""We are all dwarfs,"" he said. ""Some know it, some for the moment have not the knowledge to know it but they are going to know it fairly fast, I think that's the reality."""
2018-01-24,Plans for a statue of Margaret Thatcher near the Houses of Parliament have been rejected over its design and a lack of approval from her family.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180125012222/https://news.sky.com/story/no-handbag-margaret-thatcher-statue-plans-rejected-by-westminster-council-11220384,"Westminster Council unanimously turned down the design for the 1.5-times lifesize statue - and suggested a handbag should feature in any revised design. The plan was to have Mrs Thatcher in her House of Lords robes, but this was said not to do justice to her historic achievement in becoming the UK's first female prime minister. Planning chair Cllr Richard Beddoe said: ""The lack of family support and the committee's concerns around the design of the proposed statue were the key determining factors in turning down this application. ""As our country's first female prime minister, Baroness Thatcher is a hugely significant figure in British history and in principle the council is in favour of a statue commemorating her in Parliament Square, but it must be the right statue, with an appropriate design and the support of her family. ""The so called 10-year rule was not a reason for refusal in this case. ""We would welcome future proposals for a more appropriate statue of Baroness Thatcher, depicting her as prime minister, rather than the current design that shows her in the House of Lords and one that has clear and public support of her family."" ""I would respectfully suggest a handbag on any future design,"" the councillor added. Mrs Thatcher's daughter, Carol, reportedly opposed the design because no handbag was included. The Conservative leader was famous for her selection of bags. Other famous figures commemorated in Parliament Square include Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The planning committee received some objections because the 10-year-rule had not been met. The guidance states a person must have been dead for a decade before a statue of them is erected. However, the council rejected this and said Mrs Thatcher was a special case. Theresa May last summer called for the statue - by sculptor Douglas Jennings - to go ahead despite worries it could be vandalised. ""There should be no suggestion the threat of vandalism should stop a statue of Margaret Thatcher from being put up,"" said the PM. Mrs Thatcher, who was prime minister between 1979 and 1990, died in 2013 aged 87."

In a leaked email to students in their final three years, seen by Sky News, he wrote: ""Last year I expelled two students for sexual contact, in school. ""Relationships can start at university - not at Ruthin School. ""I STRONGLY disapprove of any boyfriend/girlfriend relationships - and it will ALWAYS affect any university reference I write... I will put together a list of any student with a boyfriend or girlfriend. ""These students - if in lower sixth form or year 11 - can expect to find new schools in September. ""There are plenty of students that wish to attend Ruthin School without the diversion of romance - and these students can replace those students whose focus is on bf/gf relationships."" The co-educational public school, which ranks 12 in The Times 2017 A-level league tables, was founded in 1284 and charges £34,500 a year. Mr Belfield, 45, a Cambridge maths graduate who became head in 2010, has previously criticised ""pathetic"" children for being ill and female pupils for wearing short skirts, it has been reported. The school held a sixth-form casino night on Saturday where pupils dressed up, with girls in ""little black dresses"", according to its website. Mr Belfield was unavailable to talk to Sky News on Wednesday as he was dining with 72 parents in Hong Kong, the school said. Just under two thirds of the pupils at Ruthin are from overseas. In an email to parents regarding relationships, seen by Sky News, he said that all students, staff and parents were aware of his ""strict views on behaviour and this is one reason why parents choose Ruthin School"". He continued: ""Unlike many other schools in the UK, the young people at Ruthin School have exceptionally good behaviour and they are focused on their study and their goal of entering top universities. The students know how proud I am of them. ""I make no apology for running a school that is successful and focused on academic achievement. My methods are not orthodox - and never will be. ""Contrary to the views of some in the UK, I believe that most teenage romances negatively affect academic outcomes - which is why I sent the email in the first place."""
2018-01-24,Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has hit back at reports that she ordered the Union flag not to be flown from government buildings during Royal events.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180125012222/https://news.sky.com/story/nicola-sturgeon-attacks-union-flag-stories-as-fake-news-11220753,"Several newspapers on Wednesday had stories alleging Ms Sturgeon had changed policy at Holyrood so the flag would only be flown on Remembrance Day this year, rather than Royal occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, and the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The story was pounced upon by Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson, prompting Ms Sturgeon to accuse her of ""peddling fake news"". Memo to PM’s new ‘fake news’ unit. The first line of defence against fake news is for your own politicians to stop peddling it. https://t.co/TTaeV50pDE And in a lengthy thread of posts on Twitter, the First Minister attempted to clarify the Scottish Government's stance on which flags fly when. ""Since the truth doesn't seem to matter very much to some, let me set out the facts on this ridiculous story,"" she began. ""There are two essential elements to this story. One, that @scotgov has recently changed its practice on what flags to fly from government buildings on Royal occasions; and two, that I ordered that change. Both are wrong."" She continued: ""Since 2010, the Lion Rampant has flown on Royal occasions - entirely appropriately. Since the Lion Rampant is the Royal Banner, it is not clear to me why anyone would object to that. However, the key point is that there has been no change to this since 2010. ""Yes, the civil service recently decided to update the published guidance, but simply to ensure that it accurately reflected the long standing practice - the underlying policy has not changed. And why would it? ""As for the claim that I ordered the change, I have issued no instructions, orders, authorisations - or even expressed an opinion - about changing flag policy. The update of the guidance was an administrative step - albeit a sensible one - and not done at my request."" Ms Sturgeon's tweets were backed up by an official Scottish Government statement, which said no change to the policy had been made. ""The current Scottish Government policy on the flying of flags, including the flying of flags on Royal occasions, was established in 2010,"" it said. ""In line with this policy, the Scottish Government, by Royal Assent, has flown the Royal Banner (the Lion Rampant) and the Saltire on Royal Occasions since 2010. The current First Minister has made no change to the policy."" Earlier the former First Minister Alex Salmond had waded into the row, insisting it was he who changed the policy at Holyrood in 2010 following a conversation with the Queen at Balmoral the year before. He said reports that Ms Sturgeon had made the policy change, which left the Union flag flying only on Remembrance Sunday and Armed Forces Day, were ""complete piffle"". ""It seemed obvious to me that the appropriate flag to be flown on the occasion of Royal birthdays is the Royal Standard or The Lion Rampant,"" he said in a statement. ""The only people who can order that to be done are the Queen herself and the First Minister as her representative. ""I remember the occasion very well. Her Majesty asked me if The Lion Rampant was a popular flag in Scotland. I was able to assure her that it was and indeed much beloved of Scottish football and rugby fans."" A Royal House spokeswoman said they do not comment on the Queen's private conversations."

On the morning of Ms McLaren's death, Stimpson, 26, arrived at the outlet's PureGym where she was working out and placed his exercise mat near hers, prompting the 23-year-old to text her mother: ""Mum he's turned up at the gym and come next to me."" Her mother told her to go straight home, but shortly after getting into her car she was attacked. Video of Stimpson in a blood-stained top moments after he launched the attack was shown to jurors at Maidstone Crown Court on Tuesday, taken from body camera footage from police officers as they arrived at the scene. Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC argued Stimpson had ""carefully considered the execution of Molly"" and said he was ""following her movements, waiting for the moment that he has chosen to kill her"". On Tuesday the court heard how Ms McLaren had told friends she felt like she was constantly having to look over her shoulder because of Stimpson's behaviour. ""Feel like I'm f****** looking over my shoulder all the time,"" she said in a nervous WhatsApp message just before Stimpson attacked her with a kitchen knife he had bought from a local Asda two days before. Jurors have been told how the pair had been in a seven-month relationship after meeting on Tinder, but Ms McLaren ended it during a night out in Maidstone on 17 June after they began to have problems. Stimpson was said to be ""angry"" with the break-up, having been told by Ms McLaren in texts that his behaviour had become ""childish"" and ""pathetic"". After they split up, Stimpson posted derogatory comments and photographs about Ms McLaren on Facebook, including claims she was taking drugs. She told friends he had become ""really nasty"", adding: ""He's literally lost the plot. I was worried he was going to turn up at my house. ""I'm actually scared of what he might do to me. He knows my parents are going away for two weeks."" Stimpson was reported to the police and warned about his conduct. The trial continues."

The Fall were forced to cancel a string of shows last year because of Smith's health. Born in Salford in March 1957, Smith wrote music in his lunch breaks while working on the Manchester docks as a shipping clerk. After attending a Sex Pistols gig in 1976, he quit the docks for The Fall. He decided to pursue music because ""whatever I did would have to be better than most of the so-called punk s***e I was hearing at the time"". Smith launched the band with friends Martin Bramah, Tony Friel and Una Baines, who missed their first gig because she could not afford a keyboard. Their first two albums - Live At The Witch Trials and Dragnet - were released in 1979. Over four decades Smith is said to have hired and fired dozens of musicians. He once reportedly sacked a sound technician for ordering a salad. Inspired more by writers than musicians, those he found influential included Thomas Hardy, Philip K Dick, Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft. Smith was married three times, to Brix Smith, Safron Pryor and Elena Poulou. In an online tribute, Brix Smith said: ""I'm taking the news in right now. I will put a statement out tomorrow. ""I hope you will all understand. Thank you for your lovely messages, they mean a lot."""

Coroner Andrew Bradley recorded a verdict of misadventure following the incident with the African rock python. Mr Brandon, a keen snake handler, had owned Tiny since she was small enough to fit in his hand. ""The most likely scenario is that Tiny was engaged with Dan - I have no doubt about that,"" the coroner said. ""She was coiling around him, at which point I have no idea. There was a point at which either she takes hold of him unexpectedly or trips him up or some other mechanism."" Mr Bradley said Tiny then hid as she was probably shocked by her 31-year-old owner falling to the ground. He said Mr Brandon was asphyxiated ""as a result with contact with Tiny"" and insisted he could not see any other reason for the death. The man's mother Babs told the coroner the snake loved her son and that Tiny was his ""baby"". She said her son was never intimidated by the snake's strength. The pathologist who examined Mr Brandon came to the diagnosis of asphyxiation by exclusion after he found a haemorrhage behind one eye, burst blood vessels and congested lungs. But Dr Adman al Badri said there were ""no specific signs on his neck"" after examining the neck muscles. There were also no bite marks or puncture wounds on Mr Brandon's body, the court heard as the coroner ruled there was no aggression from the animal. Reptile expert Professor John Cooper told the inquest the pet owner was ""obviously experienced"" at looking after the animals and that he ""would have known how to unwrap a python"". After examining the skin Tiny shed later in November, the professor said there would have been visible scratches on the skin caused by Mr Brandon trying to get her off if she had coiled around him. He said he did not find any scratches. He said African rock pythons were ""rather more temperamental"" but ""got to know their handlers"". Following the inquest, the family said the snake owner was ""one of the funniest people you could wish to meet"". In a statement written by Mrs Brandon, she said: ""I cry every day and night and relive that evening all the time. ""All the family wanted was answers to our questions, and I have no idea yet whether we have that or will."""
2018-01-24,Scientists have discovered a deadly toxin in centipede venom which it uses to take down much larger prey by forcing their hearts to stop.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180125012222/https://news.sky.com/story/giant-centipede-can-kill-animals-15-times-bigger-and-scientists-have-just-discovered-how-11220533,"The Chinese red-headed centipede is common across East Asia and Hawaii, and can grow to roughly eight inches in length. It has an agonising bite and unusual venom which contains a number of powerful toxins. Scientists investigating what allows these toxins to subdue creatures 15 times larger than the centipede believe they have isolated it. They named it the Ssm Spooky Toxin, the Ssm coming from the centipede's scientific name Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans. It was discovered through the exhausting process of testing the chemicals in the centipede's venom one by one. The researchers, from several institutions across China, have reported in their study that the toxin works by blocking potassium from moving in and out of cells. This blocking prevents the brain from sending signals to the heart to beat, and the animal dies very quickly. Potassium movement is also important for maintaining many animals' breathing systems, which means the victim of a bite often starts having problems with their airways. While the venom is rarely fatal for humans, it is agonising. The researchers noted that the bites actually accounted for 10% of all emergency room visits due to natural causes in Hawaii between 2004 and 2008. A potential antidote exists in a drug called Retigabine, which reestablishes potassium channels when they are blocked."

The letter sent to Home Secretary Amber Rudd and seen by Sky News states: ""We believe that this appointment will further damage relations between the Government and Muslim communities. ""We have no confidence in this appointment and are concerned that Muslim communities will refuse to liaise with Ms Khan, thereby defeating the purpose of her appointment to the role. ""We call upon the Government to reverse this decision with immediate effect."" The commission for countering extremism, which Ms Khan will head, was set up in the wake of the Manchester Arena attack last year. Its aim is to develop a new community-led strategy for countering all forms of extremism. Sara Khan was picked as its new commissioner for her work with the group Inspire, which she founded. It challenges gender inequality and Islamic extremism. She told Sky News she wants to ""extend a hand and reach out to communities"" and is asking to be given a chance. But she has been accused of being too associated with government and previous controversial policies. Ms Khan was a vocal supporter of the Government's Prevent strategy, set up to ""divert"" people deemed to be at risk of radicalisation. The scheme has proved controversial, with claims it demonises Muslim communities and spies on them. The letter to Ms Rudd signed by dozens of Imams said Ms Khan ""has no grassroots credibility within the Muslim community and no academic background or serious practical experience upon which to take up the role"". A spokesperson for the Commission said Ms Khan had been vouched for by numerous people, including former integration tsar Louise Casey, Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani and former terrorism watchdog David Anderson. The counter-extremism organisation Quilliam has also welcomed the appointment. It wished Ms Khan ""all the best in her new role"", adding it hopes her task-force will ""result in significant and positive change"". A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May earlier insisted Ms Khan was ""expertly qualified"" for the position. They added she will ""bring a wealth of experience and knowledge""."

Strict water restrictions are already in force, limiting the maximum use per person to 50 litres per day. The measure has been brought in to delay what has become known as 'Day Zero' - 12 April, the date the water supply will be shut down and taps will run dry. It had been 22 April, but it has been brought forward as water levels at dams in the region continue to drop week after week, with the overall amount of usable water now falling to 17.2%. When levels drop to 13.5%, the city of four million people will be forced to queue for daily rations of 25 litres from 200 water collection points - not even enough for a two-minute shower. The police and army are on standby to be deployed to prevent any unrest in the queues. The city's mayor, Patricia de Lille, said warnings to use water sparingly have fallen on deaf ears. ""We have reached a point of no return,"" she said. ""Despite our urging for months, 60% of Capetonians are callously using more than 87 litres per day. ""It is quite unbelievable that a majority of people do not seem to care and are sending all of us headlong towards Day Zero."" City councillors are set to vote on the introduction of a punitive tariff, which will charge households using more than 6,000 litres per month higher water rates. Dam levels are at 17,2% useable water. We are currently 108 million litres over our 500 million target. Due to a drop in the dam levels of 1,4%, #DayZero has moved forward to 12 April 2018. To avoid Day Zero we have to work together. #ThinkWaterCT https://t.co/Yj9ZUoCpw3 pic.twitter.com/XlepGjBfDK Trial water collection sites have already been set up, and in a further possible sign of things to come, people have been lining up with jerry cans at AB-Inbev’s Newlands brewery to get up to 25 litres of free water from a mountain stream on its property. Hotels have been limiting showers to two minutes and using water used for cleaning dishes and clothes to water gardens. A typical shower uses 15 litres per minute while a standard toilet consumes up to 15 litres per flush, according to WaterWise, a South African water usage awareness campaign. Around two million tourists flock to Cape Town every year to bathe on its sandy white beaches, explore its natural landmarks like Table Mountain or to drink wine at the dozens of nearby vineyards. Farrel Cohen, manager of the Metropolitan Golf Club in Mouille, said he was ""too afraid to even think about"" what Day Zero would mean for Cape Town. ""Nobody knows what to expect. People are running to supermarkets to buy water."""

Her spokesman also hinted the Government could crack down on gagging orders, after the more than 100 female hosts at the Dorchester Hotel dinner were ordered to sign non-disclosure agreements. Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, the Prime Minister said: ""When I read the report of that event that took place, frankly I was appalled. ""I thought that sort of approach to women, that sort of objectification of women was something that we were leaving behind. We've made progress but it's very clear that there is much more for us to do. ""What I want to see and I will continue to work to a point where women are genuinely accepted and respected as equals. ""I'm not happy with an event of that type taking place. I was appalled by the reports that I read. What worries me is that it's not just about this event. It's about what it says about this wider issue in society about attitudes to women."" Questioned about the newly-promoted children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi attending the event held last Thursday, Mrs May said she understood he ""left early"". Mr Zahawi claims he arrived at the dinner at 8pm and left 90 minutes later as he felt ""uncomfortable"" - but ""did not see any of the horrific events"" originally reported by the Financial Times. A Government official who was also a joint chair of the Presidents Club has been forced to resign and the group has scrapped all further events. Two hospitals, including Great Ormond Street, have announced they will hand back all funds received from its fundraisers. Female staff reported being groped and propositioned at the dinner of around 360 guests that included lunch with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and tea with Bank of England governor Mark Carney as auction items. Both have said they were unaware of being used as prizes. Attendees included celebrities and other leading figures from finance, business and politics. Hosts were reportedly told to wear skimpy black dresses and matching underwear, with one told by a guest she was ""far too sober"". He then declared: ""I want you to down that glass, rip off your knickers and dance on that table."" The event was dubbed a ""lady zoo"" for ""slimeballs"" by furious MPs, with minister Anne Milton admitting: ""Words fail me."" A spokesperson for the Presidents Club said the event raised over £2m for disadvantaged children. But they added: ""The organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters. ""Such behaviour is totally unacceptable. The allegations will be investigated fully and promptly and appropriate action taken."" The Dorchester insisted it had a zero-tolerance policy to harassment of employees and guests. It said: ""We are unaware of any allegations and should we be contacted we will work with the relevant authorities as necessary."""

In a statement, he said: ""It was an astonishing and deeply concerning decision that simply cannot go unchallenged. For victims, and all Londoners, it must be properly scrutinised in the courts. The Chair of the Parole Board has welcomed this scrutiny. ""I will always put the safety of Londoners, and the needs of victims, first - which is why I instructed leading counsel to begin this process last week. ""Londoners need to know that those in authority are doing everything they can to keep them safe, and that means keeping dangerous individuals off our streets."" Lawyers for two of Worboys' victims have since confirmed to Sky News they have also submitted their own applications for judicial review. Their application challenges statutory rules preventing the Parole Board explaining its decision-making process. It follows criticism of the Parole Board's decision to approve 60-year-old Worboys' release later this month, after his minimum eight-year term. The former black cab driver was jailed indefinitely in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting female passengers between 2002 and 2008. He was convicted of 19 offences relating to 12 victims but is suspected of being linked to a total of 102 complaints. Another allegation of historical sexual assault against the man came to light this month and is reported to have taken place in 1997. Police are investigating the claim but no arrests have been made. Mr Khan's intervention comes as Worboys was reportedly transferred from HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire to HMP Belmarsh in southeast London at the weekend. The Government is being urged to ensure he is kept away from the capital - where he preyed on his victims. Justice Secretary David Gauke has since said he has stressed to officials ""the need to ensure that the concerns of victims are at the heart of the process"" with relation to deciding Worboys' licence conditions. He is expected to spend several months in a probation hostel, which is staffed 24 hours a day and imposes a night-time curfew, following his release. Mr Gauke revealed last week that the Government did not intend to seek a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision."
2018-01-25,A packed House of Lords stood and applauded after former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell made one of the most emotional speeches heard in parliament for many years about her battle against brain cancer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180126021432/https://news.sky.com/story/tessa-jowell-receives-standing-ovation-in-lords-after-emotional-cancer-plea-11222524,"Looking frail and weak, wearing a hat to hide the effects of chemotherapy and with her voice occasionaly faltering and croaking, she spoke for 10 minutes appealing for Government backing for new cancer treatment. The Health and Social Care Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, sat on the step in front of the throne in the Lords throughout her speech and joined in the standing ovation and applause. And at the end of a 90-minute debate, junior minister Lord O'Shaughnessy told peers Lady Jowell had offered hope to cancer sufferers and he promised the Government would act on her plea. After the debate, as she left the Lords chamber, Baroness Jowell told Sky News she had been encouraged by the minister's response and was confident that the Government would now take action on brain cancer. In her speech opening the debate, she called on the Government to back a campaign called the Eliminate Cancer Initiative (ECI), led by a professor from Texas, which is linking clinical trials in different countries and attempting to improve research and treatment. And in a powerful finale to her speech, surrounded by many of the Labour politicians she served in government under Tony Blair, she quoted Irish poet Seamus Heaney’s last words: ""Do not be afraid."" With many peers on all sides of the Lords chamber struggling to hold back tears, she added bravely: ""I am not afraid, but I am fearful that this new and important approach may be put into the 'too difficult' box. ""But I also have such great hope. So many cancer patients collaborate and support each other every day. They create that community of love and determination wherever they find each other. ""All we now ask is that doctors and health systems learn to do the same. Learn from each other. In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close."" And speaking slowly, she ended, before the loud applause and standing ovation: ""I hope this debate will give hope to other cancer patients like me. So that we can live well with cancer, not just be dying of it. All of us. For longer."" Lord O'Shaughnessy said Lady Jowell had offered hope to cancer sufferers, raising politicians' sights and demanding they work harder to tackle this ""terrible disease she suffers with such dignity"". He said: ""It is the right challenge and one I'm prepared to accept on behalf of the Government. Our efforts will not waver until the scourge of cancer no longer robs us of the ones we love."" Lady Jowell thanked the minister for his response and said she felt the Lords had made ""real progress forward"" as she was again loudly applauded from the red benches and the public galleries. At the start of the debate, Lady Jowell began her powerful speech by telling her own cancer story, which began on 24 May when she was on her way to talk about Sure Start projects in east London. ""I got into a taxi but couldn't speak,"" she said. ""I had two powerful seizures. I was taken to hospital. Two days later, I was told that I had a brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM. ""A week later the tumour was removed by an outstanding surgeon at the National Hospital in Queen Square. I then had the standard treatment of radio and chemotherapy."" And then she spoke about how brain cancer – known medically as GBM - had been neglected. ""To put it in context, across the country, GBM strikes less than 3,000 people in England every year,"" she said. ""It generally has a very poor prognosis. ""But less than 2% of cancer research funding in the UK is spent on brain tumours. No vital new drugs have been developed in the last 50 years. ""A major factor in survival is successful surgery. ""The gold standard is to use a dye to identify the tumour. But it is only available in about half of the brain surgery centres in England. It must be extended to all of them. ""Cancer is a tough challenge to all health systems, and particularly to our cherished NHS. ""We have the worst cancer survival rate in western Europe. Partly because diagnosis is too slow. Brain tumours grow very quickly. And they are hard to spot. However, there is reason for hope."" She said the ECI campaign aimed to do three things: • First, link patients and doctors across the world through a clinical trials network, • Secondly, speed up the use of adaptive trials • And thirdly, build a global data base to improve research and patient care. She added: ""Usually, drug trials test only one drug at a time, take years, and cost a fortune. New adaptive trials can test many treatments at the same time. They speed up the process and save a lot of money."" ECI would focus initially on brain cancer because it is so tough to beat, said Baroness Jowell. ""So it's all about sharing knowledge at every level between everyone involved,"" she said. ""If we achieve this we will go a long way to crack GBM and other cancers too. ""For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used - wherever in the world it was developed, whoever began it. ""What else do they want? They need to know they have a community around them – supporting and caring. Being practical and kind. ""For while doctors look at the big picture, we can all be a part of the human-sized picture."""
2018-01-25,"Phew! We're friends again. The warm, reassuring words of President Trump at Davos will be music to Theresa May's ears.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180126021432/https://news.sky.com/story/special-us-uk-relationship-it-depends-on-donald-trumps-mood-when-he-wakes-up-11222446,"The President said the US and the UK were ""very much joined at the hip"". He didn't actually use the word ""special"" - Mrs May did that. But he said it was a ""really great relationship"". Since Theresa May rushed to Washington a year ago to pay homage at the court of King Trump, things haven't exactly gone smoothly. Mr Trump has tweeted criticism of British intelligence services over terrorism and re-tweeted posts from the far-right organisation Britain First. He then cancelled a trip to open the new US embassy in London, criticising its cost and ""off"" location. It was all a bit disingenuous. The truth is that Mr Trump's team feared any visit would be mired by protests. But it is also true that America is turning away from the ""special relationship"" and has been for some time. For instance, President Obama was far more concerned with his relationship with Europe than Britain specifically. It has been noted by British diplomats that the first state visit to Washington of a foreign leader will not be Mrs May but rather Emmanuel Macron of France. And although the two leaders in Davos agreed to finalise details of a planned visit to the UK later in the year, don't be surprised if it is not a state visit or even doesn't take place at all. As much as he would love the red carpet treatment and the pomp and ceremony, Mr Trump won't want demonstrations everywhere he goes. In America they'll be running into the crucial mid-term elections and so he will have the perfect excuse to stay away if he wants to. There is also the delicate issue of the Royal Wedding in May. It is very difficult to see Prince Harry inviting Donald Trump to his nuptials It is all pretty awkward for the Prime Minister. A post-Brexit Britain will need America more than ever, just at the time when America is turning away from the special relationship. That's why President Trump's words on trade will be especially reassuring to Mrs May. ""Trade is going to increase many times and we look forward to that"", he said. Talks have begun on a post-Brexit trade deal, but they will not be easy. There are many hurdles to negotiate before Britain gets anything like what it wants or needs. The relationship is being tested in other ways. Mr Trump's decisions to pull out of the Paris climate change deal, to threaten to wreck the Iran nuclear agreement and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have all irked British diplomats . But the obsession about whether the relationship is special or not is a very British thing. I haven't heard many Americans even mention it. I'm not sure they know it even exists. Critics say Mr Trump's tweets suggest he will not be a reliable partner for Britain. He will have only America's interests at heart - or so the theory goes. I am not so sure. He knows there are deep ties and he knows they will outlive his presidency. He also knows Britain remains America's most reliable ally. There is close co-operation on surveillance, security and military matters and both sides recognise the importance of that. But Trump is Trump. Impulsive, unorthodox, difficult and unpredictable. Special relationship? It depends on his mood when he wakes up."

But his brilliant campaign will see him rise from 49 into the top 25 in the world rankings, which will be updated on Monday. Edmund was shouldering British hopes due to Andy Murray's injury and had previously seen off US Open finalist Kevin Anderson and third seed Grigor Dimitrov. He was looking to join Murray and John Lloyd as the only British male singles finalists at Melbourne Park in the Open era. But Cilic, the sixth seed, proved a bridge too far and the Croatian, a former winner of the US Open, succeeded where other opponents had failed in nullifying Edmund's forehand. He will play Roger Federer or young Korean Chung Hyeon in Sunday's final. Cilic, speaking afterwards in his on-court interview, predicted big things for Edmund, saying: ""He's playing great tennis. ""The last couple of years he's improved a lot and started great this year. ""He had an extremely tough run to the semis, a couple of five-setters and a couple of four-setters as well. ""Definitely it left some scars on his body. ""I can feel that too, but definitely he's got a bright future in the game and we're going to be seeing him a lot."" Edmund was expected to overtake Murray as Britain's No 1 ranked player if he had reached the Australian Open final."

The crackdown began after underage sex workers were discovered during a human trafficking raid. In that operation, officers discovered evidence that groundwater was being stolen so brothels could avoid paying utility bills - as well as a ledger listing bribes to officials. Environmental experts say the practice is making Bangkok, already a low-lying city, sink. Suwat Inthasit, deputy commander of Natural Resources and Environment Crime Suppression Division, said: ""Today we will examine the water quality of each room we will go inside."" One of the brothels he suspected of illegally using groundwater was the Embassy Entertain massage parlour, which lies in a notoriously seedy district. Experts warn parts of Bangkok will be underwater by 2030 because of rising sea levels and groundwater draining into the capital's swampy soil. The practice of draining groundwater began when the city went through a period of intense development several decades ago. In recent years, attempts to regulate groundwater usage has dramatically slowed Bangkok's sinking rate. At its peak, the capital was sinking at about 10cm a year in the late 1970s. Prostitution is technically illegal in Thailand, however it is widely tolerated and openly practiced. Brothels are common in many parts of Bangkok - and no attempts are made to cover up their dealings. Bribes and loopholes keep the industry afloat, with police largely turning a blind eye. They do step in if underage women or trafficked sex workers are suspected of working in brothels. It is not uncommon for officials to be implicated in prostitution scandals, but they rarely face prosecution."

Mr Cameron was filmed speaking to Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal at the gathering of elite business people and politicians in the Alpine resort. In footage highlighted by Five News, Mr Cameron said: ""(Brexit) is frustrating. As I keep saying, it's a mistake not a disaster. ""It's turned out less badly than we first thought. But it's still going to be difficult."" Mr Cameron also told Mr Mittal he was ""busy"" writing a book and leading a billion-pound investment initiative agreed between the UK and China. As he fought to convince voters to back continued EU membership in 2016, the ex-Conservative leader claimed a Brexit vote would ""put a bomb"" under the UK economy and would be a ""self-destruct"" option for the country. At one referendum campaign event, Mr Cameron had said: ""Don't throw away your job, don't throw away your children's futures, don't throw away the strength and future of our country."" Along with then chancellor George Osborne, Mr Cameron was accused of conducting ""Project Fear"" after the Treasury forecast a Leave vote would cause ""an immediate and profound economic shock"" pushing the UK into recession and prompting a ""sharp rise"" in unemployment. The UK economy has grown every quarter since the Brexit vote, although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently claimed Britain is ""already losing out"" as a result of the decision to leave the EU. Mr Cameron resigned as prime minister on the morning after the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016, claiming it would not be right for him to ""be the captain that steers our country to its next destination"". Mr Mittal has previously donated money to the Labour Party while, prior to the 2012 London Olympics, the billionaire helped fund the ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture in the Olympic Park."
2018-01-25,Two powerful panels of MPs are piling pressure on the world's biggest audit firms to disclose their links to Carillion as they prepare to quiz the collapsed construction group's former bosses.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180126021432/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-pile-pressure-on-big-four-audit-firms-over-carillion-collapse-11222493,"Sky News has learnt that the big four auditors - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - have received letters from the Business and Work and Pensions select committees ‎demanding that they reveal within a week work they had undertaken for Carillion since 2008. The move comes amid growing concern about the ‎potential conflicts of interest which can arise within accountancy firms during major company restructuring and insolvency processes. PwC, which is acting as 'special manager' in the liquidation, had also been advising the Government and on aspects of Carillion's pension liabilities while it was still a solvent company. A City source said that Rachel Reeves and Frank Field - who chair the two parliamentary committees - were engaging in a ""fact-finding mission"" with the bi‎g four auditors. The insider said the MPs had sent a detailed letter to Bill Michael‎, the UK chairman of KPMG, which had audited Carillion since the company was created in 1999. KPMG signed off the company's accounts last March, four months before it announced a massive profit warning triggered by an £845m writedown of the value of its contracts. The letter to Mr Michael asked him to explain why the audit opinion on those contracts had changed and to clarify whether KPMG should have been more proactive in highlighting the risks arising from changes to accounting standards in Carillion's 2016 annual report, according to one source. The MPs also challenged Mr Michael to explain why KPMG had allowed the construction group to rely on more than £1.57bn of goodwill to strengthen its balance sheet, the source added. Carillion's former finance director, Zafar Khan, is expected to give evidence to the select committees' inquiry next week. Mr Khan, who was ousted in September‎, will be followed in the coming weeks by Richard Howson, the former chief executive, and Philip Green, the company's chairman. Carillion's collapse has threatened thousands of British jobs and cast a huge shadow over the entire outsourcing sector. The company held over 450 Government contracts when it plunged into compulsory liquidation last week, and has raised profound questions for ministers, lenders, shareholders and pension regulators. Sky News revealed last week that Carillion's pension deficit at the time of its collapse stood at £2.6bn, according to a calculation used to assess the cost of insuring its liabilities. That was a far higher sum than the £587m accounting deficit referred to by its former chief executive in a High Court witness statement. The £2.6bn figure is relevant because added to Carillion's other debts, including those owed to its banks, it takes Carillion's total financial obligations when it collapsed to roughly £5bn. The vast scale of the company's total indebtedness further dwarfs its comparatively minuscule market capitalisation of just £61m when the Official Receiver was called in. Although the pension schemes will lodge a claim for £2.6bn with the liquidator, there is no prospect of that money being paid, since Carillion failed with just £29m on its balance sheet. The Pension Protection Fund will now step in to provide compensation to 28,500 pension scheme members, with the total bill facing it likely to be up to £920m. A source said on Thursday that the two select committees had asked KPMG to explain whether it had verified the validity of actuarial assumptions relating to Carillion's pension schemes. The MPs' inquiry is just one of several launched in the wake of the company's collapse, with the Insolvency Service, Financial Reporting Council and Financial Conduct Authority all examining various aspects of one of the UK's most significant corporate insolvencies for decades. Carillion's liquidation has sparked fears for thousands of smaller subcontractors which undertook work for the company, which was a major partner of Network Rail and had wide-ranging involvement in Britain's schools, hospitals and prisons infrastructure."

Scientists made the call amid the growing tensions between the United States and North Korea, which have been engaged in a war of words over Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons programme. The annual reading is intended to represent how close we are to destruction - midnight representing the end of the world as we know it. It follows last year's reading of two and a half minutes to midnight. The hypothetical countdown, which was introduced in 1947 and predicts the likelihood of a man-made global disaster, last reached two minutes to midnight in 1953 - when the US and the Soviet Union were testing hydrogen bombs. The reading in more recent times has reflected the impact of climate change on the planet and the effects of new technology and science in the world.

Gun crime also went up by 20%, with 6,694 offences recorded. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""These figures are truly shocking and should put an end to Government complacency on crime. ""The Tories are failing in a basic duty to protect the public."" Overall, police forces logged 5.3 million crimes. Figures showed a 23% increase in sex offences, including a 29% rise in rapes with a total of 48,773 attacks recorded by forces. Robberies also rose by 29%; the number of people found in possession of a weapon by 26%; and violent crimes against a person went up by 20%. Drug offences were down by 6%. Officials warned police records alone do not give the most accurate picture of the scale of the problem, attributing much of the rise to changes in the way offences are recorded by forces and an increase in victims coming forward. In comparison, the Crime Survey for England recorded 10.6 million incidents - which was a fall of 10%. The survey also showed a 10% drop in fraud, including a 24% fall in offences involving computer misuse against consumers, which experts said suggested cyber criminals were turning their attention to organisations as ""hackers chase greater profits"". Mark Bangs, statistician at the Office for National Statistics, said: ""While overall levels of violent crime were not increasing, there is evidence of rises having occurred in some of the low incidence but more harmful categories such as knife and gun crime."""

The figure was 19% down on the same month a year before and also weaker than the 39,007 level seen in November, UK Finance said. Meanwhile, annual growth in consumer credit slowed, from 0.8% to 0.7%. It comes as households grapple with falling real-terms wages - as pay growth fails to keep pace with a rise in the cost of living - and also digest the impact of November's Bank of England interest rate hike, the first in a decade. Lenders have reported a slowdown in national house price growth in 2017, dragged down by falling prices in London. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest data showed mortgage approvals ""falling off a cliff"". He said: ""The deterioration in consumers' confidence, driven by the squeeze on real incomes and the November interest rate hike, has taken a heavy toll on the mortgage market."" Mr Tombs suggested that the Bank of England had ""seriously misjudged the ability of the housing market to withstand even modest increases in interest rates"". Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said 2018 looked likely to be a ""challenging year for the housing market"". He said activity was ""likely to be lacklustre as the squeeze on consumer purchasing power only gradually eases, confidence remains fragile and caution persists over engaging in major transactions"". The figures come as housing industry data shows the number of new home starts in the UK rose to its highest level in a decade last year. A total of 160,606 homes were registered in 2017, up 6% on the year before and the highest since before the financial crisis in 2007, when the figure stood at 198,929, the National House Building Council (NHBC) said. New home completions were also up, climbing 4% to 147,278, the highest level since 2008. The report also sounded a positive outlook for building this year. Theresa May is targeting an increase in the construction of new homes to 300,000 a year to address Britain's shortage of housing."

""You must not harass, strike, threaten, assault, follow, stalk, molest, destroy or damage property of or disturb the peace of, keep under surveillance or block the entrance of the people listed in the order,"" Riverside County district judge Emma Smith told the Turpins during a court hearing on Wednesday.

Both parents remain in custody. The siblings - aged between two and 29 - emerged from their home so malnourished that prosecutors say their growth was stunted and their muscles deteriorating. They lack a basic knowledge of life, it is alleged, and were allowed to shower only once a year, with prosecutors describing it as a case of ""human depravity"". Several people have come forward with offers to adopt the children, according to Kimberly Trone, from the county's children's services division. ""Many of those include offers to take in all 13 victims,"" she said, adding that there was ""still much to be determined"" and that any final decisions would be made in court. The only thing the siblings, who remain in hospital but have been speaking to investigators, were allowed to do was to write in their journals. Hundreds of these are being reviewed for evidence. ""Victims in these kinds of cases, they tell their story, but they tell it slowly. They tell it at their own pace,"" said Riverside County district attorney Mike Hestrin. ""It will come out when it comes out."" David Turpin is also accused of performing a lewd act on a child, a girl, under the age of 14.

That wouldn't shock me in the same way it wouldn't shock me to hear some similar comments at a football match or rugby club. ""When blokes get together they can be silly sometimes. It absolutely wasn't the overarching mood of the event."" The businessman acknowledged there was an ""an atmosphere in the room"" and the event involved ""lots of pretty girls glamorously dressed"". ""I would be staggered if the girls didn't realise what kind of night it was,"" he added. ""It was no different to a bog standard waiting job than a girl serving drinks in a night club.

A waitress who worked at the event said she was not harassed but one of the guests invited her to his room. She told Sky News: ""The men I interacted with were polite. They were friendly. No one harassed me in that sense. ""The only thing was that someone offered me their room key but as soon as I said no and declined, that was fine. He didn't take it any further.

The Prime Minister's spokesman also hinted the Government could crack down on gagging orders after the more than 100 female hosts at the Dorchester Hotel dinner were ordered to sign non-disclosure agreements. Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, Mrs May said: ""I thought that sort of approach to women, that sort of objectification of women was something that we were leaving behind.

It added that joint military drills with ""outside forces"" were unhelpful when better relations between North and South Korea were being sought. It came as the North's ice hockey team - dressed in DPRK jackets - crossed the militarised border to form Korea's first-ever unified team for next month's Winter Olympics. North and South Korea will march under one flag as the joint team competes in Pyeongchang.

They were met by several dozen protesters who shouted slogans and held a sign demanding the beheading of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. The players will travel to a training centre to meet their 23 South Korean teammates and were expected to start practising together later on Thursday.

Speakers imminent!! pic.twitter.com/gYF5hz34aE Both say they've struggled to address concerns with the university because of working through a middle company, and that conditions have become worse as contracts change hands to difference outsourcing companies. Jason Moyer-Lee, the General Secretary of Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, said outsourcing contracts often hit more vulnerable workers, such as migrants and those in jobs that are often precarious or low-paid, the hardest. But he said he believes attitudes towards outsourcing are changing and that the collapse of outsourcing firm Carillion has meant increased public scrutiny of the practice. ""The public is becoming aware now more than ever of the massive waste, incompetence and unfair treatment of workers inherent in the outsourcing model, and the University of London is no exception,"" he said. A spokesperson for the University of London told Sky News that it had begun a review of the performance of contracted out facilities management services, and that it would be discussing pay, conditions, benefits and development opportunities with the contractors employing outsourced workers. ""In common with many institutions in the sector, the University of London has a number of contracted out services,"" they said. ""We are aware of an ongoing industrial dispute within one of our contracted-out services. It would not appropriate for the University to comment on the employment arrangements of another organisation."""

2018-01-25,The EU referendum was followed by a collapse in the value of the pound against the euro and the US dollar.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180126021432/https://news.sky.com/story/diageo-profits-watered-down-by-stronger-pound-11222122,"Since the 2016 vote, it has become commonplace for British companies deriving a big chunk of their sales in the eurozone and the US to report a boost to their profits when earnings were translated back into sterling. The pound has, though, enjoyed a solid rebound against the dollar in particular and on Thursday passed above $1.43 for the first time since June 2016. And that is likely to lead to the opposite effect. Diageo, the world's biggest spirits company, offered a flavour of that when it warned that adverse exchange rate effects had clipped £134m from sales during the final six months of 2017 and £15m from operating profits. For the full financial year, it expects the hit to sales to be £460m, and to operating profits the hit will be £60m. The company was previously guiding the market that currencies would clip £80m from sales and boost profits by £70m. While a £60m one-off hit to operating profits would represent a major headache for most companies, it is one that the Johnnie Walker scotch whisky, Captain Morgan rum, Smirnoff vodka and Gordon's gin titan can take in its stride, for this is a remarkably resilient business. Half-year sales rose by 1.7% to £6.5bn while operating profits rose by 6.1% to £2.2bn. That was partly due to strong growth in sales of tequila, which rose by a stunning 43%, thanks to the growing popularity of Diageo's Don Julio brand in Mexico and the US. Also contributing was gin, where sales rose by 16%, thanks to good growth everywhere, but especially in Europe, with both the Gordon's and Tanqueray both doing well. Among individual brands, though, the star performer anywhere was a drink with which few people in Britain will be familiar. Shui Jing Fang is a leading brand of baijiu, a Chinese white spirit, likened to fire water. Sales of the brand, which is more than 600 years old and which was acquired by Diageo in 2014, surged by a scarcely-believable 75% in the period. Diageo took a hit in China a few years ago, when a corruption clampdown by President Xi Jinping meant fewer bottles of its premium spirits could be given as gifts to officials, but the country is now growing strongly again. But it was not all plain sailing for the company. Global sales of vodka were down by 3% and, while the mass-market Smirnoff fell by 1%, chief executive Ivan Menezes will be more concerned about a steeper decline in sales of premium vodkas Ketel One and Ciroc, the latter of which is promoted by the rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs. There were also drops in sales for Korean scotch whisky brand Windsor, Aussie rum brand Bundaberg and the Old Parr whisky brand. Mr Menezes will doubtless be relieved, though, to note that, Scotch whisky, the company's most important drink category, continues to motor. Sales were up globally by 3%, only marginally behind American whiskey, which rose by 4%. As a global business, Diageo is a good guide to consumer spending, but - as most of its brands are at the premium end of the market - it is also a decent indicator to how social mobility is progressing around the world. If more people are joining the ranks of the middle classes in emerging markets like India, China and Indonesia, Diageo should in theory get some of the extra money they are spending. With sales up in Nigeria, Mexico, China, India, Brazil and Argentina, that certainly appears to be the case. While this is a global business, with emerging markets offering the promise of stronger sales growth, mature markets like Britain are still important. Sales in this country rose by 7%, thanks partly to the boom in gin, but also due to strong single malt sales and an extension of the Guinness brand into craft beers. And, as Diageo prepares to enjoy the annual sales lift for whisky supplied by Burns Night, Mr Menezes may even be toasting Donald Trump. His recent corporate tax cuts was worth a one-off boost to the company of £360m - rather more than any short-term hit caused by the rally in sterling. There may be one other cause for celebration in the near future. Princess Eugenie's fiancé, Jack Brooksbank, is the UK & Europe brand manager for Casamigos, the tequila brand created by George Clooney, which was bought last year by Diageo. It's a fair bet the company's single malts - and, who knows, maybe a pint or two of Guinness - will be in ready supply at the wedding reception."

Last month, ministers suffered a defeat on key Brexit legislation after a Tory rebellion saw an amendment, calling for a ""meaningful"" vote on any divorce deal, added to the EU Withdrawal Bill. But, asked if he expected the details of the future relationship between the UK and the EU to be laid out clearly and in full by the time Parliament votes on the withdrawal deal, Mr Hammond told Bloomberg TV: ""Probably not the full details. ""But we would expect the high level shape of the future relationship to be emerging by that time."" The Chancellor's comments, made at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, angered Remain-supporting MPs who were among those to back the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill. Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake, a supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""The Government's attitude towards our sovereign Parliament is threatening to turn their stunning defeat over Amendment 7 into a sham. ""How can Parliament have a meaningful say over the terms of withdrawal from the EU if they don't even know the full details about where we are heading before they vote on it? ""That doesn't sound much like 'taking back control'."" Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, speaking on behalf of the anti-Brexit Best of Britain campaign, claimed Mr Hammond ""wants MPs to vote with their eyes closed on the final deal"". She added: ""MPs need to be able to vote with the full facts in front of them, anything else would be utterly unacceptable."" Asked about Mr Hammond's comments, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""We've been clear on this: both houses of Parliament will have a meaningful vote on the final deal after negotiations have concluded."""
2018-01-25,"A spike in norovirus is increasing the pressure on hospitals already facing high levels of demand, according to NHS England.

Norovirus is potentially debilitating for hospitals because beds have to be closed for deep cleaning after being occupied by those infected. The latest NHS England situation reports, for the week-ending Sunday 21 January, show a 19% increase in the number of beds closed - 742 - compared to 621 in the previous week. The closures add to pressure on hospital capacity, with bed occupancy remaining extremely high at 94.8%, though that was marginally down (0.1%) on the previous week. A figure of 85% or below is considered the safe standard, with the anticipated rate going into the winter 92%. There was a significant fall in the number of ambulance handover delays at A&E departments, with 11,019 people waiting more than the target 30 minutes, more than 1,500 fewer than the previous week. The latest official statistics for flu are published later today by Public Health England but a spokesman for NHS England indicated the rate of increase, which had prompted fears of an epidemic, had slowed. ""While levels of flu have stabilised, there has been a spike in the number of norovirus cases which continues to put pressure on busy hospitals and other frontline services,"" he said. ""And while the NHS is generally coping with ongoing winter demands, the public can continue to play their part by using NHS 111 and pharmacists for advice."" The Society for Acute Medicine said the statistics demonstrate that the NHS remains under severe pressure, and criticised the level of preparedness. ""Pressures in the system remain high and it really is offensive and disingenuous to see the Prime Minister only yesterday remain adamant that the NHS was better prepared than ever this winter. ""In our own recent survey, more than three-quarters of clinicians working in acute medicine felt their hospitals were not adequately prepared for winter this year and 28% felt in a worse position than last year. ""The overall mood among healthcare staff is that they remain anxious and depressed and we simply cannot afford a repeat of these dire circumstances again."""
2018-01-25,"The UK's annual consumption of sandwiches has the same environmental impact as around eight million cars, scientists have claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180126021432/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-sandwich-habit-as-bad-for-the-environment-as-eight-million-cars-11221631,"The calculation takes into account the carbon footprint of 40 different sandwiches - homemade and ready-made - and looks at the packaging, how the ingredients are produced, and the food waste that is discarded. University of Manchester researchers worked out the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) for the 11.5 billion sandwiches eaten every year in the UK. That generates on average 9.5 million tonnes of CO2 eq, ""equivalent to the annual use of 8.6 million cars"", said Professor Adisa Azapagic. The all-day breakfast sandwich - with egg, bacon and sausage - had the worst carbon footprint, estimated to generate 1,441 grams of CO2 eq. That is the same as driving a car for 12 miles. Sandwiches containing bacon, ham, sausage, cheese, tomato or prawns were also carbon intensive, according to researchers. Homemade ham and cheese was the most environmentally friendly sandwich. Writing in the journal Sustainable Production and Consumption, the team said: ""The estimated impact from ready-made sandwiches ranges from 739g CO2 eq for egg & cress to 1,441g CO2 eq for the bacon, sausage & egg option. ""The carbon footprint of the most popular homemade sandwich (ham & cheese) varies from 399-843g CO2 eq per sandwich, depending on the recipe."" Agricultural production and processing of ingredients was the biggest influence on a ready-made sandwich's carbon footprint, accounting for about a third to two-thirds. Keeping the sandwiches chilled in the shop was the next biggest factor - said to account for a quarter. Packaging made up 8.5% of the carbon footprint, with transportation 4%. But making a sandwich at home with the same ingredients could significantly cut its environmental impact by 50%, researchers added. They said changes to recipes, packaging and waste disposal could help half the carbon footprint of Britain's sandwich consumption."
2018-01-25,"Fully-qualified foreign doctors are being prevented from taking up NHS jobs because of ""arbitrary"" visa rules which critics say are exacerbating the crisis in the health service.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180126021432/https://news.sky.com/story/doctors-blocked-by-arbitrary-visa-rules-from-taking-up-nhs-jobs-11222690,"Sky News has spoken to clinicians, hospital trusts and recruitment agencies frustrated at rules which they say are preventing the NHS filling some of the estimated 10,000 vacant doctors posts. They say applications are being rejected because demand for Home Office Tier 2 visas exceeds monthly quotas, and the points system used to sort applicants mean doctors need contracts worth in excess of £55,000. More than 20,000 Tier 2 visas are granted using a points-based system to workers from outside the EU every year across all professions, with around one-third going to NHS staff whose jobs are on an approved 'shortage list', such as emergency department doctors. Many other disciplines are not considered in short supply, and Home Office rules means those on standard middle-grade salaries are effectively barred. The Home Office uses a points system to distribute a monthly quota of visas. When demand exceeds supply more points are required - it has risen from 21 points to more than 50 in the last year - with salary a major part of the calculation. Asda Ali, a doctor from Lahore, told Sky News he had been offered a job by South Tees Hospital Trust, but could not take it up because his visa has been rejected. ""It's quite frustrating because I am not working in Pakistan and I have been waiting for my sponsorship letter,"" he said. ""When I heard from the HR department that my sponsorship letter got rejected again, it's totally frustrating when you have passed all the exams, you have to for the [General Medical Council] registration, and then they say it is the visa."" South Tees confirmed they had applications for four Tier 2 visas rejected this month, for doctors who had been appointed to posts in general surgery, diabetes and renal medicine. Both Cambridge and Birmingham university hospital trusts confirmed doctors had been unable to take up positions with them because of what is effectively a salary threshold. BDI Resourcing, a specialist medical recruitment agency in Bristol, said they were deeply frustrated at ""crazy"" rules that prevented them filling vacancies. ""We are speaking to clinical directors and lead consultants, business managers and HR managers and pretty much everyone from top to bottom of the hospital say they need staff,"" said Daniel Platts, a director. ""The Home Office says it is to protect British workers but there are not thousands of British doctors out there who have not got jobs. ""We are hearing every week that departments are going unstaffed and that patients aren't being seen, people are being seen in ambulances and sat on beds in corridors. It’s terrible, but if we had some of those doctors here it would relieve some of that pressure."" The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the rules should be changed. ""This cap is affecting the ability for the UK to provide the medical workforce the population needs, we are seeing and hearing of examples where doctors who could be working providing services to patients being denied that ability due to an arbitrary fixed cap,"" said chairman Chand Naipaul. The Home Office said the question of whether more doctor grades should be on the shortage list was for the Department of Health. In an statement a spokesperson said: ""When demand exceeds the month's allocation of Tier 2 (General) visas, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupations. ""The published shortage lists include a range of medical professionals, including consultants specialising in clinical radiology and emergency medicine, and we estimate that around a third of all Tier 2 places go to the NHS. ""We are committed to ensuring that net migration is reduced to sustainable levels and that the jobs of British workers are protected."""

Experts at Naturhistorisches Museums Basel now believe her to be Anna Catharina Bischoff. Bischoff was born in 1719 into a wealthy Basel family and married a pastor before having seven children, two of whom survived to become adults. She spent most of her life in Strasbourg but returned to Basel for her final five years. She had contracted syphilis, probably from treating sufferers of the disease. At the time, treatment consisted of mercury but this is thought to have been what killed her in 1787. It may also, however, be responsible for the well-preserved state of her body. One of her surviving children, Anna Katharina Gernler (1739 - 1776), married German aristocrat Christian Hubert Baron Pfeffel von Kriegelstein. Five generations later, Marie Luise von Pfeffel married Stanley Fred Williams; and their daughter Yvonne married Osman Wilfred Johnson Kemal. Their son was Stanley Johnson, Boris Johnson's father. Mr Johnson responded to the findings on Twitter, writing: ""Very excited to hear about my late great grand 'mummy' - a pioneer in sexual health care. Very proud."" The mummy had been uncovered once before - in 1843, during building work at the church. After that it was buried and its details were noted. These notes were discovered in 2016, sparking a search for clues. A team under expert Albert Zink took DNA from the mummy in the hope that this would help identify her. But there was one big problem: unlike nuclear DNA, which comes from both parents, mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother. This meant tracing descendants through records was more difficult, as women took their husband's name when they got married and this was the name that was recorded in a marriage register. Researchers and genealogists of the Basel Civic Research Project joined the hunt, reconstructing two independent branches of the family. Saliva samples from living descendants were compared with the mitochondrial DNA of the mummy and researchers found a 99.8% match. The museum has described the mummy as the best preserved and ""most enigmatic"" in Switzerland."

The Internet Research Agency is a Russian online influence agency. Twitter also said: ""If Twitter identifies further relevant information relating to the 2016 EU Referendum we will write to you and update your committee accordingly."" In reply, Mr Collins said that there were still some outstanding questions and wrote: ""The failure to obtain straight answers to these questions, whatever they might be, is simply increasing concerns about these issues, rather than reassuring people.""

Anne Richards, chief executive of M&G Investments and one of the most prominent women in finance, told Sky News the behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"". She said it exposed those ""who still seem to be living in a world that most of us thought we'd left behind decades ago"". The Bank of England was inadvertently been dragged into the affair when it emerged that the chance to have tea with the governor had been on offer at the charity event. Mr Carney said he had never heard of the Presidents Club before the event. Subsequent investigations revealed that the opportunity to meet the governor, offered by the Bank via the Lord Mayor's charity appeal, had apparently been re-auctioned.

But he insisted ""America First does not mean America alone"", as the US President outlined a willingness to sign ""fair"" trade deals and claimed the US is ""open for business"". Sticking to the populist agenda that saw him elected to the White House, Mr Trump told international politicians they had an ""obligation"" to their countries' workers and peoples - although his address was more restrained than his usual tub-thumping rallies. On foreign policy, the ex-property tycoon stuck to hardline messages on North Korea, Iran and Islamic State.

""American prosperity has created countless jobs around the globe and the drive for excellence, creativity and innovation in the US has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and healthier lives."" Mr Trump vowed to ""restore integrity"" to international trade, insisting he would only commit to ""fair and reciprocal"" trade on a bilateral and mutually beneficial basis. ""The US will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair trade practices,"" he said. ""We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others."" But the US President also hinted he could re-enter talks on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement he withdrew America from within his first few days in power, by saying ""perhaps"" the US could resume negotiations. Having traded insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his first 12 months in the White House, Mr Trump vowed to ""unite all civilised nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean peninsula"". He also called on international leaders to join him in confronting ""Iran's support for terrorists"" and blocking the country's ""path to a nuclear weapon"". Mr Trump added an international coalition was ""very successfully"" working to ""destroy"" the so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Repeating some of the messages from his election campaign, Mr Trump said: ""When people are forgotten the world becomes fractured.

The FSA, which has been forced to defend itself amid accusations of a cover up, is advising anyone with meat from Russell Hume, including care homes and schools, to dispose of it, or return it. Tim Martin, Wetherspoon chairman, said: ""Firstly we wish to apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused to them. ""However, our decision to stop serving steak from Tuesday (January 23), despite limited information from the supplier, was the correct one."" Mr Martin said his pubs dish out around 200,000 steaks a week. He added: ""On Wednesday (January 24) the FSA reported that they were thoroughly investigating Russell Hume Ltd, but also stressed that there was no indication that people had become ill from eating meat supplied by them."" After the steak was pulled some customers were less understanding than others. ""I can't believe a multi-million pound organisation like Wetherspoons can't sort this out - it beggars belief,"" Michael Rousell, 62, from Weston Super Mare told The Sun. James Jarvis, 27, in Scarborough, said: ""When they told me they had it but could not sell it to me I just walked out. ""They told me they had an issue with the supplier. I told them I couldn't give a f***. I just want something to eat."""

2018-01-26,NHS England is to lift the suspension of elective surgery imposed to help cope with winter pressure.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-to-lift-suspension-of-elective-surgery-11223541,"The National Emergency Pressure Panel (NEPP) has decided that planned operations, suspended because of pressure on the NHS in January, can resume next month. The move indicates that the NHS is coping better with winter pressure. It comes after hospitals in England were advised to cancel all non-urgent operations and in-patient treatments at the start of the New Year. Hospitals were told to defer non-urgent operations until mid-January - and the measure was extended to free up staff and beds. The NEPP had also lifted a ban on mixed-sex wards to cope with the pressure over the winter period. The board heard that ""pressures on the NHS have eased in January compared to December"" opening the door for hospitals to start planning a ""return to a full elective care programme"" from the start of February. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to the tens of thousands of patients whose operations were cancelled or postponed as a result of the suspension. ""It is absolutely not what I want,"" he told Sky News earlier this month. ""If you are someone whose operation has been delayed I don't belittle that for one moment, and indeed I apologise to everyone who that has happened to."" However, he said postponing treatment to ease pressure on A&E departments was ""better for people"". The comments came after Theresa May denied the health service was in ""crisis"", insisting it was more prepared ""than ever before"". But responding to the decision at the start of the month, John Kell, head of policy at the Patients Association, said patients were ""losing out"". ""NHS England's decision to defer elective surgery throughout January and authorise the use of mixed-sex wards is a sign of how hard winter pressures are hitting the NHS this year,"" he said. ""Combined with regular first-hand reports of worsening conditions in hospitals, including growing numbers of patients being treated on trolleys in corridors, it is clear how badly patients are losing out."""

2018-01-26,"On the face of it, news that the UK economy grew more strongly than expected during the final three months of the year is good news.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/growth-turns-out-stronger-than-expected-but-should-be-better-11222943,"The growth of 0.5% notched up in October, November and December was not only better than the 0.4% achieved during the previous quarter, it was also better than the 0.4% that economists had been expecting. It confirms the UK economy picked up momentum throughout 2017 and made this the best quarter since the final three months of 2016. Accordingly, the pound has been in fine fettle on the foreign exchange markets, putting on more than three-quarters of a percentage point against the floundering US dollar - which has been floored this week by comments from Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury Secretary, interpreted by many as an attempt to talk down the greenback. However, people should not get carried away with this. Quarterly growth of 0.5% confirms the UK economy grew by 1.8% during 2017 as a whole - down from the 1.9% achieved in 2016 and making it the weakest year of growth since 2012. That comparison is significant since 2012 was the year in which the eurozone debt crisis was at its most intense and in which there were, before the glorious London Olympics, fears that the UK was about to suffer a ""double dip"" recession. :: UK economy grew 0.5% in fourth quarter Yes, the out-turn for 2017 is significantly better than was predicted in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU, after which the Bank of England was forecasting growth of just 0.8% and the Office for Budget Responsibility 1.4%. Frankly, though, the economy should have been growing more strongly. It looks very much as if 2017 will have been the best year for the global economy since the financial crisis - with the United States, the eurozone and most of Asia, including previously moribund Japan, enjoying synchronised growth. For a big, open, trading economy like the UK, that should be sparking much stronger growth than just 1.8%. This out-turn will, once other countries begin reporting their numbers, probably be one of the weakest performances in the G20 group of leading world economies. As the Office for National Statistics observes: ""Despite surpassing these [post-referendum] expectations, 2017 growth in the UK economy was still below its five year average growth rate, primarily reflecting a slowdown in services growth, which has gradually declined since 2014. ""The annual growth contribution of the services industry has fallen from 2.7 percentage points in 2014 to 1.3 percentage points in 2017, with the industry growing by only 1.6% in 2017 - its weakest growth rate since 2011."" That is very concerning given that, despite numerous attempts to rebalance the UK economy, the services sector is still the main motor of growth. And, within that, the strongest sub-sector is business services and finance. So much for Britain becoming less dependent on the City. Ironically, with the City - one of the few industries in which the UK remains a world leader - still desperate for a good Brexit deal, a lot of the growth it experienced towards the end of the year was due to Brexit. The ONS speculates business was generated by foreign buyers seeking advice on buying British assets, which have become more attractive due to the fall in the pound, along with EU clients seeking advice on setting up operations in the UK to maintain market access after Britain leaves the EU. Elsewhere in the services sector, there was no contribution to growth from distribution, hotels and restaurants, which experienced its worst growth since the final three months of 2010. This confirms the impression created by recent consumer spending surveys that household finances are under pressure and that it would be unwise to expect any uptick in activity in the near future from Britons splashing out on the high street. The most cheering element in the numbers concerns production. The 0.6% growth it enjoyed during the final three months of the year took the total for 2017 as a whole to 2% - the best showing since 2010. This was predominantly down to strength in manufacturing. Given that the UK motor industry has been under a cloud during recent months, this is very encouraging, underlining that there is much more to UK manufacturing than just car production. Manufacturing output, as the ONS notes, rose in November last year for the seventh consecutive month - making it the best run for two decades. Metal products manufacturing appears to be doing particularly well. The figures for production would have been better still were it not for the closure for emergency repairs of the Forties oil pipeline for several weeks in December. Construction, though, is struggling. Output fell in the sector during the final three months of the year to complete three consecutive quarters of contraction - the worst run since 2012. Housebuilding is doing well, but civil engineering projects and construction of commercial property remains becalmed, which is undoubtedly a reflection of a lack of confidence among big players in the sector. So, while the out-turn for the final three months of 2017 was better than expected, cautious spending by households and businesses means the UK economy is still growing at its slowest pace for five years. At a time when the global economy is motoring, it ought to be doing better."

Sky News spoke to the 77-year-old at his home. He did not come to the door, but spoke over intercom to confirm that he attended the dinner. When asked what he thought when he read the news reports about the event, he replied: ""They should look at maybe ladies' hen parties at airports. ""I never saw anything like that happening and I would think a majority of people would say the same thing."" Since the reports broke, the event has been dubbed a ""lady zoo"" for ""slimeballs"" by furious MPs. Prime Minister Theresa May has also been among the critics. Two hospitals, including Great Ormond Street, have announced they will hand back all funds received from the event. Tarbuck said he had been at the dinner to thank guests for donations to a children's home, money that would enable the home to buy washing machines. He added: ""Would I attend something like that that would give money to something like that? Yes, I would. ""I never saw anything untoward. ""Were there a lot of pretty girls there? Of course there were - over 100 of them all looking very nice, but I never saw, never heard any bad language or insinuations to them, and I left after I'd done my bit. ""Tell (critics) to go to London airport to see hen parties going on if they want to see bad behaviour. ""It has to be both ways. It can't be all men that they're including. ""I hear on good reports that hen parties might be banned on some airlines - they should look into that."" Tarbuck said that, after making a toast and thanking diners for their support, he left the event. When asked if critics had over-reacted to the dinner, he said: ""I can't understand how sick children should suffer from it."" A spokesperson for the Presidents Club has previously said the event, which included auction items such as meals with top politicians and bankers, raised more than £2m for disadvantaged children. But they added: ""The organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters."" Later the group said it would not hold any further fundraising events."

He speculated the attack would come as a missile launch or cyberattack. The comments were published on the same day the Daily Mail revealed he ""almost threw away"" his marriage after kissing a colleague in 2004. Mr Williamson, who is touted as a possible Conservative leadership contender, said Russia was looking to cripple Britain's power stations. Asked why Moscow was researching those areas in particular, he told the Daily Telegraph: ""It is because they are saying, 'These are the ways we can hurt Britain.'"" ""The plan for the Russians won't be for landing craft to appear in the South Bay in Scarborough, and off Brighton Beach. ""They are going to be thinking, 'How can we just cause so much pain to Britain? Damage its economy, rip its infrastructure apart, actually cause thousands and thousands and thousands of deaths, but actually have an element of creating total chaos within the country.'"" Mr Williamson said that after causing ""the chaos"", Russia would then ""step back"", adding he believes it is a ""real threat"". Russia's defence minister responded by saying the comments showed he ""has lost his understanding of what is reasonable"". Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov claimed they were worthy of comedy sketch show Monty Python. He added the remarks merited a medical checkup for Mr Williamson. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on Russia's reaction. It comes after Mr Williamson announced he was launching a review of the military's needs dubbed the Defence Modernisation Programme. He promised it would be ""fiscally neutral"" in a bid to head off Tory MPs threatening a revolt against cuts."
2018-01-26,"Phew! We're friends again. The warm, reassuring words of President Trump at Davos will be music to Theresa May's ears.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/special-us-uk-relationship-it-depends-on-donald-trumps-mood-when-he-wakes-up-11222446,"The President said the US and the UK were ""very much joined at the hip"". He didn't actually use the word ""special"" - Mrs May did that. But he said it was a ""really great relationship"". Since Theresa May rushed to Washington a year ago to pay homage at the court of King Trump, things haven't exactly gone smoothly. Mr Trump has tweeted criticism of British intelligence services over terrorism and re-tweeted posts from the far-right organisation Britain First. He then cancelled a trip to open the new US embassy in London, criticising its cost and ""off"" location. It was all a bit disingenuous. The truth is that Mr Trump's team feared any visit would be mired by protests. But it is also true that America is turning away from the ""special relationship"" and has been for some time. For instance, President Obama was far more concerned with his relationship with Europe than Britain specifically. It has been noted by British diplomats that the first state visit to Washington of a foreign leader will not be Mrs May but rather Emmanuel Macron of France. And although the two leaders in Davos agreed to finalise details of a planned visit to the UK later in the year, don't be surprised if it is not a state visit or even doesn't take place at all. As much as he would love the red carpet treatment and the pomp and ceremony, Mr Trump won't want demonstrations everywhere he goes. In America they'll be running into the crucial mid-term elections and so he will have the perfect excuse to stay away if he wants to. There is also the delicate issue of the Royal Wedding in May. It is very difficult to see Prince Harry inviting Donald Trump to his nuptials It is all pretty awkward for the Prime Minister. A post-Brexit Britain will need America more than ever, just at the time when America is turning away from the special relationship. That's why President Trump's words on trade will be especially reassuring to Mrs May. ""Trade is going to increase many times and we look forward to that"", he said. Talks have begun on a post-Brexit trade deal, but they will not be easy. There are many hurdles to negotiate before Britain gets anything like what it wants or needs. The relationship is being tested in other ways. Mr Trump's decisions to pull out of the Paris climate change deal, to threaten to wreck the Iran nuclear agreement and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have all irked British diplomats . But the obsession about whether the relationship is special or not is a very British thing. I haven't heard many Americans even mention it. I'm not sure they know it even exists. Critics say Mr Trump's tweets suggest he will not be a reliable partner for Britain. He will have only America's interests at heart - or so the theory goes. I am not so sure. He knows there are deep ties and he knows they will outlive his presidency. He also knows Britain remains America's most reliable ally. There is close co-operation on surveillance, security and military matters and both sides recognise the importance of that. But Trump is Trump. Impulsive, unorthodox, difficult and unpredictable. Special relationship? It depends on his mood when he wakes up."

Brothers Ellis Thornton-Kimmitt, 12, and Elliott Thornton-Kimmitt, 14, died in the crash, along with Darnell Harte, 15, Robbie Meerun, 24, and Anthony Armour, 24. The victims had all been travelling in the same car, a black Renault Clio, for more than an hour before it hit the tree at 88mph in a 30mph zone, Leeds Crown Court heard. The passengers were thrown from the vehicle. Police described the crash as '""catastrophic"", saying officers had been confronted by ""a scene of total carnage"" when they arrived at the scene. Speaking after the sentencing, Sky News Correspondent Gerard Tubb said: ""The court heard some harrowing details, including that the boy who was driving had tried to kick his way out of the passenger door but couldn't because there was a body lying outside the door holding it shut. ""He ran off and lied, trying to blame one of the younger boys, claiming that he (the younger boy) was driving. ""But the court heard that once he had a chance to sit and talk with his mum and dad, he came clean, admitted to what he had done."" Speaking outside court, the sisters of Darnell Harte said the teenager's sentence was not long enough. Elise Dhers told Sky News: ""We have to live with the sight of seeing my little brother through a window with his face smashed in. ""Four years is not even a year for each life."" Natasha Dhers added: ""I understand (the driver) has to live with it but we have to live with never seeing (Darnell) again. ""(Once the driver is released) we're going to have to look at him and not have to say anything because he served justice in people's eyes. ""To me, that's not justice because I'm never going to see my little brother again."" The judge told the teenager he would be facing 13-and-a-half years in jail if he was an adult. Tubb said the court was told the youth was ""15 going on 10"". He said: ""He had some significant problems with his health, he had missed a lot of school, he has hearing problems, speech and language problems. ""The judge told him, 'it was your actions, your driving of the car that has caused all this hurt and pain'... and 'I think your life will be affected by this forever'."" The boy will serve half of his sentence in detention and will then be eligible for release before starting a five-year driving ban."
2018-01-26,The release of black cab rapist John Worboys has been put on hold after victims won the first step in a legal challenge.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/black-cab-rapist-john-worboys-release-put-on-hold-amid-legal-challenege-11223709,"Two victims made an ""urgent application"" to the High Court for a stay of his release pending a further permission hearing, lawyer Harriet Wistrich said. ""We have been granted a stay on his release until an oral application between February 6-8,"" she said. The victims' legal challenge follows criticism of the Parole Board's decision to approve the 60-year-old's release later this month, after his minimum eight-year term. Worboys was jailed indefinitely in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting female passengers between 2002 and 2008. He was convicted of 19 offences relating to 12 victims but is suspected of being linked to a total of 102 complaints. Papers were lodged on Thursday ""because of the urgency"" of the situation, Ms Wistrich said. She said a half-day hearing is set to take place between 6 and 8 February, in which Worboys' lawyer can make representations on his behalf. ""Obviously it is a first stage. You can not read too much into it but it is obviously good that we have got through the first hurdle,"" Ms Wistrich said. ""Given that somebody's liberty is at stake I think that the court would have to proceed quickly. We are arguing that he should be in prison after the Parole Board has said that he should be released."" She also said Worboys could ""potentially"" claim for damages if the victims fail in their challenge. The development comes after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan lodged an application for a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision. In a statement on Thursday, he said: ""It was an astonishing and deeply concerning decision that simply cannot go unchallenged. For victims, and all Londoners, it must be properly scrutinised in the courts. The chair of the Parole Board has welcomed this scrutiny. ""I will always put the safety of Londoners, and the needs of victims, first - which is why I instructed leading counsel to begin this process last week. ""Londoners need to know that those in authority are doing everything they can to keep them safe, and that means keeping dangerous individuals off our streets."" Following the criticism, Justice Secretary David Gauke said he stressed to officials ""the need to ensure that the concerns of victims are at the heart of the process"" with relation to deciding Worboys' licence conditions. He also revealed last week that the Government did not intend to seek a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision."
2018-01-26,Downing Street is racing to finalise dozens of corporate deals between British and Chinese companies as Theresa May prepares for her first visit as Prime Minister to the world's second-largest economy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/downing-street-races-to-clinch-deals-ahead-of-mays-china-visit-11222951,"Sky News has exclusively obtained the ‎list of businesses that will be represented on Mrs May's trip to China next week. More than 40 companies, universities and trade associations will travel with the PM as she seeks to demonstrate‎ that Britain will be able to boast burgeoning post-Brexit trade ties with Beijing.Among those joining Mrs May on the trade mission will be blue-chip public companies including BP, HSBC, Inmarsat, Standard Chartered, Sirius Minerals, Standard Life Aberdeen, AstraZeneca and the London Stock Exchange Group, an insider who has seen the list said on Friday.The composition of the delegation also reflects many of the Government's priorities ‎outlined in the industrial strategy it published late last year, with clean technology businesses such as Tevva Motors included on the trip.Tevva is one of a number of automotive sector companies due to accompany Mrs May, with others including Aston Martin, testing group Horiba Mira, Jaguar Land Rover, McLaren‎ and Norton Motorcycles. The education sector will also be a focus, with the itinerary including a stop-off in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province which has become a major Chinese education hub, as well as Beijing and Shanghai.‎ Private companies include Canary Wharf Group, technology group Blippar, manufacturer Far-UK, children's food producer Kiddylicious, healthcare diagnostics provider Medopad, energy and waste management company NPL Group and bioscience firm Stream Bio.A number of quangos and lobbying groups, including the British Educational Suppliers Association, CBI, Institute of Directors, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Scotch Whisky Association, UK Skills Partnership and Universities UK,‎ are also on the list.The other organisations due to attend, according to a source, are the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board; Arup, the engineering consultancy; Busy Bees, a chain of nurseries; China-Britain Business Council; Cambridge Science Park; Connect China‎; the Eden Project; Kendal Nutricare, an infant formula maker; Manchester University; PriestmanGoode, a transport design consultancy; R5FX, a foreign exchange trading business; Rooney Fish; advanced materials producer Versarien; Whittard of Chelsea, the upmarket tea producer; and WorldFirst, a foreign currency specialist.Sources said that Downing Street officials were hopeful of seeing well over 50 partnerships, alliances and other deals signed during the trip, the plans for which were revealed by Sky News last month.One insider said the figure could be as high as 100, although they declined to put a monetary value on next week's potential announcements.Government estimates ‎of the value of previous UK-China deals have been criticised as fanciful, and sources said it was crucial that Mrs May's trip provided a strong foundation for future talks about a bilateral trade deal between the two countries.The PM has spoken frequently of her ambition for a ""global Britain"", but the UK continues to lag European rivals such as France and Germany in terms of the amount of business it does with China. While Mrs May's delegation is much smaller than one which accompanied her predecessor, David Cameron, it is thought to be the largest to join her on any overseas trade mission since she became PM. Mrs May said last January that she would visit China ""relatively soon"", since when she has faced a string of delays - some of which were self-inflicted.An earlier date was removed because of the General Election campaign, while another provisional visit‎ in November was postponed because of its close proximity to a trip by Donald Trump, the US President. Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, will travel with Mrs May, while ‎Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, travelled to China last month as part of the annual Economic and Financial Dialogue between the two governments. A number of deals were announced during his visit, although most were evolutions of previous agreements rather than entirely new projects. ‎Commercial links between the UK and China - now the world's second-largest economy - will take on greater significance after Brexit, partly because of the latter's continued rapid growth, as well as Britain's need to demonstrate its ability to construct mutually beneficial trade deals.There remains the possibility of a ""cliff-edge"" Brexit which could leave the UK reverting to World Trade Organisation rules, while the Cabinet is still riven with infighting over the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. ‎President Xi Jinping gave a landmark speech espousing the benefits of free trade at the World Economic Forum in Davos last January, and Beijing has welcomed the UK's talk of a ""golden era"" in Anglo-Chinese ties. However, Mrs May has been perceived by Chinese officials to be far more cautious towards the country than Mr Cameron, with Nick Timothy, her former aide, decidedly lukewarm about Chinese investment in British technology and nuclear energy projects. ‎Chinese-backed companies have invested billions of pounds in corporate Britain, including through the recent takeover of the chipmaker Imagination Technologies. That deal sparked opposition from MPs including Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former Business Secretary, underlining continuing anxieties about some Chinese investments. A Downing Street spokesman said on Friday that ""a large delegation"" would join Mrs May on the trip, which was ""intended to intensify the golden era of relations"" between the UK and China."

2018-01-26,Four male BBC presenters have agreed to reduce their salaries as the corporation deals with a gender pay gap row.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/four-male-bbc-presenters-agree-salary-cut-amid-gender-pay-row-11222837,"Jeremy Vine, John Humphrys, Huw Edwards and Jon Sopel will take a cut to their six-figure pay packets, the BBC News website reported. The quartet were described to have ""all agreed, either formally or in principle, to reduce their salaries"". It comes after the BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie quit her role in protest at pay inequality for men and women at the licence fee funded corporation. She accused the BBC of ""breaking equality law and resisting pressure for a fair and transparent pay structure"". In July last year, the BBC was forced to publish the salaries of its highest-paid stars for the first time. Radio 2 host Mr Vine was revealed to earn between £700,000-£749,999, while Radio 4 Today presenter Mr Humphrys was said to have a salary of £600,000-£649,000. BBC News presenter Mr Edwards (£550,000-£599,999) and North America editor Mr Sopel (£200,000-£249,000) were also among the top earners. Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen was on the list (£150,000-£199,999) but neither Ms Gracie or her fellow female international editor, Europe editor Katya Adler, were among the BBC's best paid. In total, two-thirds of the BBC's highest-paid stars - those earning more than £150,000 per year - were revealed to be men. Earlier this week, it was reported Mr Humphrys had offered to take a third voluntary pay cut in two years, dropping his salary to £250,000-£300,000. But BBC News reported it is not yet known how much the male stars will reduce their pay packets by. Ms Gracie will now return to the BBC newsroom in London, with an expectation to be ""paid equally"", the website added. The BBC's gender pay row deepened earlier this month when a leaked tape revealed Mr Humphrys and Mr Sopel in a ""jokey exchange"" about about Ms Gracie's resignation. In a recording, Mr Humphrys was heard telling Mr Sopel: ""Dear God. She's actually suggested that you should lose money; you know that, don't you? You've read the thing properly, have you?"" In response to the emergence of the tape, Mr Humphrys said: ""We are in habit, Jon and I, of winding each other up and the purpose of this jokey - I emphasise jokey - exchange was a bit of mutual mickey-taking, and that is all it was."" A BBC spokeswoman described it as an ""ill-advised"" conversation which Mr Humphrys regretted. Couldn’t be more proud of my pal @tracey_crouch https://t.co/Q8IZPLtqvu In the wake of the row, Government minister Tracey Crouch was reported to have refused to be interviewed on Radio 4's Today programme in protest at Mr Humphrys' off-air comments. The new minister for loneliness was subsequently praised by fellow politicians, with Tory MP Caroline Dineage tweeting: ""Couldn't be more proud of my pal @tracey_crouch"". A spokeswoman for the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport admitted Ms Crouch had not managed to fit in the Today programme in a round of media interviews about her new loneliness role. However, she added: ""Tracey Crouch spoke to a number of broadcasters, including the BBC, on her role leading the Government's new loneliness strategy."" On Wednesday, Ms Gracie and top BBC bosses, including director general Lord Hall, will be grilled by a committee of MPs about pay structures at the corporation."
2018-01-26,Members of an organised crime gang who conspired to manufacture and supply fake ID documents for illegal immigrants have been jailed for a total of more than 16 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/criminal-gang-jailed-for-forging-immigration-documents-11222464,"Investigators from the Home Office's immigration enforcement division monitored the gang from late 2015 until June 2017, gathering evidence which ultimately led to the conviction of seven conspirators from Coventry, Nottingham, Redditch and London. Over the course of their investigation, officers unearthed the wide-scale distribution of British passports, British residence permits, degree certificates and Constructions Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) cards, all of them fake. Prices ranged from £200 for the CSCS card and degree certificates, to £900 for a passport . The gang was led by Steven Kanaventi, 39, of Mulliner Street, Coventry, and Alfred Adekoya, 47, of Kingslake Street, London. They were each jailed for three years and four months at Woolwich Crown Court on Friday, having pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture a fake document at an earlier hearing. Speaking after the sentencing, Inspector Ben Thomas said: ""The criminal business that Kanaventi and Adekoya were running was designed to undermine the fundamental immigration rule that if you have no legal status in the UK, you have no right to work. ""Their customers hoped that the fake documents would be enough to convince prospective employers that they were entitled to work, in turn allowing them to build a life for themselves in the UK to which they were simply not entitled. ""By bringing Kanaventi, Adekoya and their associates to justice we have stopped a concerted, systematic and financially motivated assault on the UK's immigration system."" Adekoya was arrested on 20 June last year after making an exchange inside a betting shop in Woolwich with Luke Nkanta, 29. When Adekoya was stopped and searched shortly after the transaction had been made, he was found in possession of three counterfeit British passports. When Nkanta, of Wordsworth House, Woolwich, was stopped, he was found with an envelope containing a counterfeit British passport. Also arrested on 20 June was Abdul Azeeza, 57. When officers raided his home address in Missenden they found a fake residence permit and a fake passport, as well as specially adapted tools for dismantling passports, threads for stitching, paint thinners and laminating equipment - used in the manufacture of fake ID documents. He also had numerous orders for fake documents, some on his phone and some completed on betting slips. Kanaventi was arrested at his home address just over a week later on 28 June. Arrested on the same day, each at their home addresses, were three accomplices: Paul Kanaventi, 37, of Forster Street, Nottingham; Victor Ariyo, 53, of Rye Hill Park, London; and Madalitso Majawa, 33, of Ombersley Close, Redditch. Mr Thomas said Steven Kanaventi was a ""particularly brazen operator"" and used the social media alias 'Chris Namatchanga' - ""a clear play on words of 'name changer'."" ""Kanaventi was involved in every part of the Midlands operation. He set the prices, he placed the orders with his forger Ariyo and he was even caught on CCTV posting the counterfeit documents to his customers."" Like Adekoya and Steven Kanaventi, Ariyo, Azeeza, Paul Kanaventi, Nkanta and Majawa had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing. Ariyo admitted conspiracy to manufacture a fake document and money laundering. Azeeza admitted possessing fake documents and possessing equipment with the intention of making fake documents. Paul Kanaventi admitted money laundering, while Nkanta and Majawa both admitted to possessing fake ID documents with improper intention. Immigration enforcement officials say they will now pursue the confiscation of £135,000 in cash, which was sitting in a bank account belonging to Ariyo. A Home Office spokesman said the conviction of the seven men illustrates the determination of investigators to go after those who facilitate illegal immigration. However, authorities acknowledge the London and Midlands criminal gang is just the tip of the iceberg in an illegal enterprise, in which criminals are making many millions of pounds in the trade in fake documents."

A report by the UK Airprox Board (UKAB) said a three or four-engine white drone came to within just five feet over the first officer's window. It stated: ""The crew considered that the drone passed close enough that it must have collided with the tail."" The aircraft was inspected by engineers after landing but they found ""no tangible evidence of collision"". The incident happened on 25 October 2017 as the jet flew at an altitude of 1,700 feet and the UKAB put it in the highest category of risk. ""Providence had played a major part in the incident and/or a definite risk of collision had existed,"" the report concluded. The UKAB did not disclose the identity of the aircraft involved. A draft drone bill is due to be published by the government later this year which will require drone users to register and complete safety awareness tests. Flying drones near airports or above 400 feet could also be included in the new regulations. Last July a drone almost hit a plane coming in to land at London Gatwick putting 130 lives at risk."

Police said the animals were in a very poor condition and the crocodile was in a tiny pen next to a bed. Dangerous wild animals were among the snakes including a cobra and a Madagascan hognose snake. The RSPCA was called in and specialist handlers removed the animals from the property. Detective Inspector Steve Nelson, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said: ""The reptiles were held in very poor conditions and sadly a number had died. Those that survived are now in the care of the RSPCA. ""We are working together with the charity as part of their investigation into how these wild animals came to be in such conditions. :: Russian police find crocodile in basement during weapons search ""As officers we come across many different finds during our investigations and these are among the more unusual.""

He said they were all united by the determination to see through a Brexit ""that serves the British economy and the British people"". Speaking after Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury from some Eurosceptics for saying the UK and EU economies would diverge ""very modestly"", Mr Davies said that would only apply during the transition period. ""At the beginning, when we're out there will be very, very little difference between the standards that apply to our country and the continent of Europe,"" he announced in a speech at Teesport in Middlesbrough. ""There is no difference between the Chancellor and myself and indeed the Prime Minister in terms of the fact we both want a Brexit that serves the British economy and the British people. ""There will be arguments about the tactics but they will change, the options available to them will change throughout the negotiations as we see what our European interlocutors want."" Pressed again on the reports of a Cabinet split, Mr Davies said: ""I'm in politics. People debate. There's a diversity of views on this subject in all parties. ""That doesn't mean we can't have a coherent or forceful view in the interests of the UK that we will make work when we talk to opposite numbers across the channel."" Mr Davis gave the speech to reveal the UK's stance on an ""implementation period"" - expected to last around 18 to 24 months after the UK officially leaves the EU in March 2019. He suggested the acceptance of a Brussels red line - that free movement must continue until the period ends - saying a ""registration scheme"" for new EU arrivals after 2019 ""will have no bearing on people's right to work or live"". And Mr Davis accepted that the UK will still be subject to new EU laws created before the divorce date. He said it was important that Britain ""has the means"" to voice its disquiet at proposed laws it does not like but will be unable to vote on or officially influence. Responding to some calls to extend Article 50 to delay the official Brexit date if negotiations are not complete by March 2019, Mr Davis added that this ""would not solve"" many of the problems. That would only ""create new uncertainty about when we will leave"", he said. He was hoping to calm Eurosceptic Tory MPs' fears of a ""soft Brexit"". Hours before the speech, backbencher Mark Pritchard tweeted: ""There is a growing frustration that Number 10 is not plugged into the views & opinions of many backbench MPs or even interested. ""The PM is also being criticised for taking her very small group of allies for granted. A big mistake!"""

During an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Trump said that he did not know anything about the organisation when he made the social media postings. He told presenter Piers Morgan: ""If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that."" Mr Trump said he had made the posts because of his opposition to radical Islamic terrorism. :: Trump set to promote 'America First' to global elite in Davos ""I know nothing about them and I know nothing about them today other than I read a little bit,"" he said. ""Perhaps it was a big story in Britain, perhaps it was a big story in the UK, but in the United States it wasn't a big story. ""They had a couple of depictions of radical Islamic terror.

It depends on Donald Trump's mood when he wakes up Mr Trump sparked outrage when he posted the three tweets last November and Prime Minister Theresa May to say he was ""wrong"" to have done so. The President then pulled out of an expected visit to Britain to open the new US embassy building in London, fuelling speculation of a diplomatic rift. But after meeting Mrs May at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he insisted the relationship was strong. ""We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we don't,"" he said in the Morgan interview. Asked about his visit to the UK, Mr Trump said: ""I think a lot of people in your country, they like what I stand for, they respect what I stand for."" When asked about people who are against his visit, Mr Trump said: ""I don't care. I don't say anything because I don't care. The real me is someone who loves Britain, loves the UK. """
2018-01-26,"The UK economy grew by a better than expected 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 but remains ""slower and uneven"", official figures show.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-growth-better-than-expected-in-fourth-quarter-11222856,"Britain's performance in the October-December period was an improvement on the 0.4% rate seen in the previous quarter but still meant that for the year as a whole, growth was at its weakest since 2012. The pound, which in recent days has been trading at its highest levels since the Brexit vote, lifted by a cent to just under $1.43 in the wake of the figures. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.8% in 2017, below the 1.9% pace seen in 2016, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. ONS head of GDP Darren Morgan said: ""Despite a slight uptick in the latest quarter, the underlying picture is of slower and uneven growth across the economy."" He said the boost to the economy at the end of the year came from a range of services such as recruitment agencies, letting agents and office management though consumer-facing businesses saw much slower growth. Manufacturing also grew strongly, though the construction sector fell, the ONS said. The latest quarterly growth figure was an improvement on the figures of 0.3% seen in each of the first two quarters of 2017 and the 0.4% in the third quarter. But annual growth has not been slower since 2012, when the economy recorded an expansion of 1.5%. The pace of UK growth has fallen behind that of other advanced nations in the wake of the Brexit vote. That is partly because of the weakness of the pound making import prices higher and squeezing consumers, and partly because of business uncertainty. The IMF expects UK growth to slow to 1.5% this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the BBC on Friday that Brexit had already knocked tens of billions of pounds off UK growth. But he raised the prospect of a ""conscious recoupling of the UK economy with the global economy"" as the terms of Britain's departure from the EU become clearer. Ben Bretell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Despite today's better-than-expected number, the overall picture is one of muddling through. ""But it's certainly fair to say the economy has performed much better than many feared in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, boosted by the rising tide of a global recovery which has lifted all boats."" Experts were divided on what the better than-expected-figures would mean for interest rates, with some suggesting a hike in May could now be on the cards but others still seeing an increase as unlikely until November."
2018-01-26,Families of victims of the Birmingham pub bombings said “common sense has finally prevailed” after a coroner's decision to restrict the scope of inquests into their deaths was overturned.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/birmingham-pub-bombings-court-overturns-coroners-ruling-11223380,"A judicial review has ordered Sir Peter Thornton to reconsider his ruling that the identity of those responsible for the 1974 atrocity should not form part of his inquiry. The coroner’s decision had prompted many relatives of those killed to consider boycotting the new inquests into the attacks, which left 21 people dead and more than 200 injured. A group of Irishmen known as the Birmingham Six were jailed in 1975 over the bombings at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs but the convictions were quashed on appeal in 1991. Delivering her ruling on the inquests, Mrs Justice Carr said: ""We are minded to quash the coroner's decision which excluded the perpetrator issue and remit the case so as to enable him to reconsider the decision."" Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine died in the bombings, welcomed the ruling and said the inquests - which were adjourned in 1975 and reopened in 2016 after a long-running campaign - would be a ""mockery"" without their scope being widened. She also thanked members of the public who helped pay for the legal challenge, which cost almost £40,000. Ms Hambleton, the spokeswoman for victims' campaign group Justice4the21, told reporters: “Common sense has finally prevailed. ""We would like to thank Lord Justice Simon and Mrs Justice Carr for hearing our appeal and for asking the coroner to go away and ask himself another question, and that question is 'Who murdered our loved ones?' ""Twenty-one people were murdered en masse 43 years ago. People forget that there are murderers out there walking free on our streets, either in the United Kingdom, in Ireland or elsewhere. ""We are here, having to fight the very people who are meant to represent us - to give us truth, justice and accountability. ""We truly hope that the coroner will now reconsider... and realise that without the perpetrators in scope, the inquest will make a mockery of our justice system. ""We would hope and pray that the coroner makes the common sense decision."" A self-confessed former IRA member Michael Hayes claimed last year he defused a third bomb placed outside a Barclays' bank on the night of the Birmingham attacks but refused to comment on whether he planted the other explosives. A spokesman for the inquests said: ""The coroner is committed to ensuring that the inquests start as soon as possible but now wishes to take some time to consider carefully the judgment handed by the High Court and its impact on the future progress of the inquests."""
2018-01-26,Aircraft manufacturer Bombardier has  won its case against plans for huge tariffs on its US imports which had put thousands of jobs at risk in Northern Ireland.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180127025856/https://news.sky.com/story/bombardier-did-not-harm-rival-boeing-court-rules-11223808,"In a surprise decision, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled in favour of Bombardier over American firm Boeing, which claimed its rival received unfair state subsidies from the UK and Canada. The decision blocks US government proposals to slap 292% tariffs on Bombardier C-Series passenger planes, which risked thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland where the jets' wings are made. Bombardier, which employs more than 4,000 people in Belfast and contributes an estimated £400m to the Northern Ireland economy, said the C-Series jets were ""critical"" to its operations there. Sky News' Ireland Correspondent David Blevins said the ruling ""lifts the cloud completely for the 1,000 employees who feared for their jobs"". He added: ""East Belfast - where the jobs were at risk - is a DUP constituency and the Prime Minister had raised this issue with President Trump on several occasions."" The ruling comes after Theresa May met US president Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday. The Prime Minister said: ""I welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry. Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy."" In a statement, Bombardier said the ITC's decision was a ""victory for innovation, competition, and the rule of law"". ""The C-Series is the most innovative and efficient new aircraft in a generation,"" it said. ""Its development and production represent thousands of jobs in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom."" Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland would be ""breathing a huge sigh of relief"" after the ITC had ""seen through Boeing's baseless complaint"". ""There can be no backsliding from the US government on this decision,"" he said. Airbus took a majority stake in Bombardier's C-series passenger jet programme in October last year, which was hoped would help the jet programme overcome the tariff ruling. Airbus boss Tom Enders said the company had offered to assemble some of the planes at its plant in Alabama for orders by American carriers."

He left the club a few weeks ago. Academy manager Marc Wardley said the boy was ""quiet and a really nice lad who got on with things, and who could have gone on to play at a decent level"". The crash victims - two aged 16 and one who was 17 - have been named in tributes left at the scene as George and Josh, along with Harry. The teenagers were close to a bus stop when a black Audi collided with them in Hayes, west London, at around 8.40pm on Friday night. Staff at a football club on Shepiston Lane said they believed the youngsters had been on their way to a 16th birthday party on the premises when they were hit. A member of staff at the GOALS centre said the party had been cancelled following the tragedy. Among the messages left at the scene of the collision was a card that read: ""George Boy, I love you so much, love Kev, Vinnie."" Another said: ""I thought I would never have to write this and I don't know what to write but I will always love and miss you millions."" A third card read: ""To my bro, always together for ever,"" while a fourth said: ""To my darling baby boi my heart is broken, love mum, Vinnie."" The trio were among a larger group of teenagers, the rest of whom avoided injury. It is believed the Audi mounted the pavement just outside the entrance to a nearby Esso petrol station and travelled a few metres down the road before colliding with a lamp post. Detectives said they believed the car was travelling at high speed and stopped a short distance away from the collision. Following the crash, two men reportedly left the vehicle and one of them - a 28-year-old - was detained by members of the public. The suspect was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment and has now been taken into custody after being discharged. At the time of Harry's signing with Farnborough Town, his father Ian said: ""He was thrilled and didn't have any hesitation in signing with them, it's a nice place with a nice people and a semi-pro cub is a good level to start at, he's happy with it."" Farnborough scout, Marc Wardley, added: ""He's done well and will be a good addition to our youth team, we're delighted to sign him."" Reacting to news of Harry's death, Farnborough's chairman Simon Gardener said: ""The club is deeply saddened and our thoughts and condolences are with the family."" The club hopes to have a tribute for Harry at their next home game in February. Local councillor Janet Gardner described the collision as ""incredibly sad"". She said: ""My heart breaks for the parents and families and friends of those killed. I cannot begin to imagine how they are going to cope with the loss of such special young people."" Police have confirmed that the crash is not being treated as terror-related. Staff at the Esso garage on Shepiston Lane said a group of teenagers had been fighting at the entrance to the forecourt shortly before the crash, with one cashier revealing that police inspected the CCTV footage of the brawl. :: Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to call the Serious Collision Investigation Unit directly on 0208 991 9555, quoting reference 7843 of 26 January, or call 101 or tweet @MetCC.

Some 54% said the men's behaviour was typical of men in Britain, while 33% said it was unusual. Breaking the figures down, 61% of women thought it was typical, while 26% thought it was unusual. But men were more evenly divided, with 47% saying it was typical, and 42% unusual. According to the poll, there is little appetite for single-sex social events to be banned outright, however. Three in four (74%) said men or women-only social events should be allowed to continue, while 17% said they should be banned. The vast majority of both men and women oppose such a measure. The Presidents Club has been rocked by claims that female workers were groped, sexually harassed and propositioned at an all-male fundraising dinner held at the Dorchester Hotel in central London last Thursday. Theresa May said she was ""appalled"" to hear of the allegations. Two hospitals, including Great Ormond Street, have announced they will hand back all funds received from the event.

2018-01-27,"Kiosks purporting to be telephone boxes are being used to smuggle advertising onto high streets, councils have warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/trojan-telephone-boxes-smuggling-advertising-onto-the-high-street-say-councils-11223707,"And the increase in applications for installing the kiosks has increased more than 900% in two years. ""Companies are exploiting a loophole in the law to allow what is tantamount to Trojan telephone boxes being used as advertising spaces rather than the original purpose of providing a place for people to use a phone,"" Councillor Martin Tett, planning spokesman for the Local Government Association, said. ""As a result pedestrians are being bombarded with a series of eyesores that blight the public highway."" New generation phone boxes often resemble a touchscreen kiosk rather than familiar red booths. In 2016 BT began a London rollout of new Link kiosks, fitted with large touch screens, free calls and wi-fi, and offering access to maps, directions and local services. Sensors would be fitted to the kiosks to capture real-time data from the local environment, it was reported, and they would be funded by advertising. The LGA says phone companies have been able to establish phone boxes to sell advertising without oversight, thanks to a law that allows them to install them without council permission. Under the current law, companies only need a license from Ofcom to install the boxes - and the increase in the number of applications for the facilities has increased dramatically. Westminster alone received 180 applications for the boxes in 2017, compared to 13 in 2015, While Newcastle saw the number of its applications jump to 95 from 1 and Lambeth saw a jump from one to 71. Representing 370 councils in England and Wales, the LGA says the Government needs to change the law to give councils more control over the ""excessive numbers"" of boards. ""The rise of the smartphone and digital age has seen the telephone box become a largely obsolete relic of a bygone era,"" Cllr Tett said. ""While there is still a limited need for some telephone boxes in our town centres and cities, for example for emergencies, the number of applications councils have seen is simply staggering. ""Councils are currently powerless to act, so we want the Government to overturn the existing out-of-date legislation and give local authorities the ability to take action where this is an issue."""
2018-01-27,"MindGeek, the biggest internet pornography company in the world has told Sky News it will not snoop on the sexual preferences of 25 million people in the UK under new age verification laws.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/porn-watchers-will-have-to-prove-they-are-over-18-under-new-laws-11224093,"However, MindGeek also plans to collect a trove of information on users, including their names, addresses, date of birth, as well as their online activities on other websites.From April, as part of the Digital Economy Act, anyone wishing to view pornography online will have to prove they are over 18 years old.The mechanism for age verification is being left to the private sector. Among the companies developing solutions is MindGeek, which bills itself as a leader in 'Web Design, IT, Web Development and SEO [search engine optimisation]'.MindGeek also runs some of the most viewed pornography sites in the world, including PornHub, YouPorn and RedTube - the so-called 'tube' sites - as well as production studios including Brazzers. MindGeek anticipates signing up 25 million users in the UK to its age verification system, AgeID. The system will require users to sign up with an email address and password, then use a third party mechanism to prove they're over 18. User will then use AgeID to access pornographic sites around the web; AgeID will log which sites are visited.MindGeek will charge other pornography sites to use its solution. But because of its market dominance, campaigners fear it will end up the defacto age verification standard, handing even more power to the biggest porn provider around.A spokesperson for MindGeek told Sky News: ""AgeID has been built from the ground up with data protection, data minimisation and the principles of privacy by design at its core, whilst also complying with the GDPR."" ""This is why we do not store any personal data entered during the age verification process,"" Mindgeek added.""Due to the encrypted nature of AgeID's login credentials, such data cannot be exposed in the unlikely event of a hack.""However, the privacy policy for AgeID details a wealth of information the site may collect. It includes name, postal address, nationality, date and place of birth, email address, mobile phone numbers and demographic information, as well as searches made on AgeID. It notes that this information can be used by AgeID ""to develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Website and other sites"".The policy also says: ""We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services.""MindGeek has suffered high profile hacks in the past, with millions of people's personal information being stolen. A database of pornographic sites visited across the web for 25 million people in the UK would likely be a target for hackers. Independent pornography producers in the UK are concerned about MindGeek's potential dominance.Pandora Blake, a producer of queer pornography, told Sky News: ""MindGeek already have a monopoly on production via having bought out a lot of different production studios and distribution via the tube sites. ""And now the government has handed them a golden cheque and they're going to have a monopoly on age verification, being the gatekeepers of online porn at this point.""The UK will be the first democratic country in the world to require users to prove their age to view pornographic content. The British Board of Film Classification has been designated as the regulator for age verification but has not yet been confirmed by Parliament.This month the Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport laid out its guidance for age verification solutions. It did not suggest requirements for people's identity not to be tracked across the internet, merely suggesting it should be ""good practice"". And the DCMS's own impact assessment report notes that age verification solutions could increase the risk of online fraud, as well as push children ""to illegal and extreme material that they otherwise would never have come into contact with.""The DCMS refused repeated requests from Sky News for an interview. It gave this statement: ""A wide variety of online age verification arrangements currently exist and so we expect that providers of online pornography will be able to choose the appropriate solution to meet their specific needs."""

Firefighters used rescue boats to evacuate seven people from their homes and around 70 were also led to safety. London Fire Brigade station manager Paul Fitzgerald said: ""Fire crews used boats to assist people who needed to leave their homes, although the majority of residents were able to stay in their property. ""Around 270 sandbags were provided to help stop water from entering buildings. ""Crews pumped water away and Thames Water was on the scene investigating.

2018-01-27,"Artefacts dating back more than 6,000 years are emerging from the ice in the mountains of Norway as a result of global warming.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/global-warming-revealing-ancient-history-in-norway-11224282,"For more than a decade an international team of archaeologists has been conducting fieldwork in the Jotunheimen mountains of Oppland County in the south of the country. Some of their discoveries date back to 4,000 BC. Made up of researchers from the local council and Norwegian and British universities, the team has now recovered more than 2,000 rare finds, including clothing from the Iron Age and the Bronze Age and ancient reindeer-hunting equipment. And such is the length of time they had been encompassed in ice, the artefacts are perfectly preserved. The group - working under the name ""Secrets of the Ice"" - describes the ice as having ""acted like a time machine"" or a ""prehistoric deep freezer"". Their analysis of the discoveries reveals that the origins of the artefacts are not spread out equally over time, with gaps of thousands of years suggesting changes in the level of human activity in the area, as well as historic climate change. Writing in a new report in the Royal Society Open Science journal, Dr James Barrett, of the University of Cambridge, said: ""One such pattern which really surprised us was the possible increase in activity in the period known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age (c. 536 to 660 AD). ""This was a time of cooling; harvests may have failed and populations may have dropped. Remarkably, though, the finds from the ice may have continued through this period, perhaps suggesting that the importance of mountain hunting increased to supplement failing agricultural harvests in times of low temperatures. “We then see particularly high numbers of finds dating to the eighth to 10th centuries AD, probably reflecting increased population, mobility and trade – just before and during the Viking Age, when outward expansion was also characteristic of Scandinavia."" Lars Piloe, of Oppland County Council and lead author on the study, said there was a ""high degree of certainty"" that the melting of the ice was a result of global warming caused by human activity. ""What the artefacts from the ice tell us is that at least some of the ice in the high mountains of Oppland has now melted back to levels last seen 4,000 to 6,000 years ago, during the Stone Age,"" he wrote on the Secrets of the Ice website. ""The finds keep getting older, as the ice melts back. Climate science tells us that the melt-back of high mountain ice is mainly caused by anthropogenic global warming. ""Climate scientists tell us that the high mountain ice is going to melt, most of it in this century."""

Without breaking stride he jumps over the counter to his left. Andy Fiddler - shopping for an engagement ring with his fiance - turns round to see what is happening. Calmly assessing the situation, the 52-year-old removes his jacket and, as Jameson-Kennedy jumps back over the display case, grabs hold of him. They both tumble to the floor. Jameson-Kennedy manages to get upright again and tries to reach the door but two other men step in as Mr Fiddler blocks the exit. After four minutes, police arrive and arrest Jameson-Kennedy - his cap now missing and the scarf pulled down off his face. He reportedly caused more than £400 of damage after mounting the counter and ransacking the window display. Co-owner of the shop since 1982, Gary Shaw, said Mr Fiddler's courage was ""fantastic"". Co-owner David Mounsey, 70, concurred, saying Mr Fiddler ""didn't hesitate"". Mr Shaw, 55, added: ""It was impressive the way he took his jacket off and just jumped in there. ""We're only a small company. We've worked damned hard for it over the years, seven days a week, and then somebody like this comes in and thinks they can just help themselves."" Mr Mounsey, who said their staff had been amazed by the CCTV footage, joked: ""We're stars, aren't we. I'm going to have Robert DeNiro play me in the film.""

2018-01-27,Genomics have been used for some years now for farmers to select the best bulls for breeding.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/taste-test-could-genomics-technology-on-cow-give-us-better-milk-11223988,"But now, for the first time in the UK the technology is being used to assess the females in the herd. A hair or tissue sample is taken from the calves at about four weeks old, which is then sent to the Clarifide laboratories in Kalamazoo, Michigan. There they are DNA sequenced and marker genes for health, fertility and productivity are identified. Derbyshire Dairy Farmer Mark Moore, like other farmers, used to rely on experience and instinct to select which of his Jersey calves he would spend £1,500-£1,600 on to raise for breeding and milk production, and which would go to be raised for beef. Now he's signed up to the genomics service, which costs £30 per test, plus a retainer fee for the vets who provide it. He says: ""We want to breed the best animals, the healthiest, strongest animals which will hopefully give us better milk, better components and a better, healthier herd in the future."" Animal rights groups, though, worry that the selection of animals could be dictated by profit, not welfare. Phil Brooke, from Compassion in World Farming, says: ""Selective breeding has been very unkind to the dairy cow. Cows today are unhealthy, they are lame, they are thin, they are infertile, all too often kept indoors - because they have been bred to overwork and to produce more milk than is good for their health. ""The danger with this kind of tool is it is used as a sticking plaster to deal with problems of decades of selective breeding."" But Rose Jackson, from Scarsdale vets disagrees. She says the markers which show the animal's susceptibility to disease are just as, if not more, important than those which suggest a high milk yield. ""Historically with dairy selection, years back we just chose on production because that was measured well, so we could do that,"" she says. ""But going back over the past 10 years there's been more focus on health and fitness. And now with genomic testing we can find that information out much earlier on, which means we can make make far more informed decisions on farm."" The first cows selected by Mr Moore using the genome science are still yet to be old enough to produce milk. But, he says, the animals whose tests showed genetic markers for better disease resistance, have indeed proved, so far, to be healthier."

Some are in a serious condition. Authorities said the motive was not yet known, and were investigating whether it was related to a conflict between drug gangs. Eyewitnesses told local television channel Globo TV that three cars full of armed men arrived at the Forro do Gago club at 12.30am and fired at the front of the building. The shooting lasted for 30 minutes, according to reports. The northeastern Brazilian state of Ceara has one of the country's highest levels of violence and homicides, often blamed on the gangs.

Ms Beckett told the Courier Journal she went to comfort the editor and take over the story. Gabe Parker has been named as the boy who allegedly pulled out a handgun and opened fire before classes were due to begin on Tuesday. His mother, Ms Garrison Minyard, and other members of his family have declined to comment, said the Courier Journal. The motive for the shooting is not known. Friends and others who know Parker, a pupil who played trombone in the school band, described him as a shy, red-headed ""grandma's boy"" who would go fishing with his grandparents. Meanwhile, debates are raging in Kentucky and other states nationwide about how to prevent such shootings. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican and social conservative, has made it clear that he won't sign laws that restrict guns. Mr Bevin has called on Americans to ""wake up,"" recognise that school shootings are a ""cultural problem,"" and to look at the ""root causes"". ""Our culture is crumbling from within,"" he said. Mr Bevin said the desensitisation to death and killing is coming at an ""extraordinary price"". ""We can't celebrate death in video games, celebrate death in TV shows, celebrate death in movies, celebrate death in musical lyrics and remove any sense of morality and sense of higher authority and then expect that things like this are not going to happen,"" he said."

The move is aimed at stopping people filming his performances and posting them online - with anybody caught using them in venues being ejected from the premises. Rock said the use of mobiles for texting, tweeting and recording performances is a ""major intrusion"" on the quality of his performance as a comedian. He has urged fans to ""take one night off from being the paparazzo of your own life"" and just enjoy the concert without feeling the need to film it. Rock said he was fed up with fans putting up clips of his performances on social media instead of enjoying the show. He said: ""There is also the added problem for comedians who spend months polishing their performances to a high state of hilarity only to have their punchlines shared in advance by illegal recordings of their show."" The phones are placed for free in Yondr pouches which are locked as fans enter the arena. Fans keep the fabric pouches with them at all times before they are then unlocked as they leave the venue. Anybody wanting to use their phones during the show can go to a special area where the pouches are opened by staff. Some fans are supportive of the move. Scottish singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald, 30, who saw the comedian in Glasgow, tweeted: ""How refreshing to not see 10,000 phones and people actually talking to each other. It's the future!"" Twitter user TjPeddlico, who has also attended one of his shows, wrote: ""It was beautiful to actually see so many people not using their phones like zombies!"" There has been strict enforcement of the ban. I went to see @chrisrock tonight and it was great. I was sooo impressed by the little phone cases. How refreshing to not see 10,000 phones and people actually talking to each other. It’s the future! ☺️ pic.twitter.com/lDrA5oY5QR At the gig in Glasgow, Chris Penman claimed he was kicked out by security guards for looking at his phone despite being given permission by a steward because he was waiting for an update on his father's medical condition. He told the Evening Times: ""My dad is in the heart transplant ward in the Golden Jubilee in a really bad way. ""I explained the full thing but they still said I had to leave. I couldn't believe it - I'm still baffled today. It's just extraordinarily petty and unreasonable. ""I'm happy that my dad is doing better but I'm angry because my wife paid £140 for the tickets as a gift and we didn't even get to see Chris Rock."" Other stars who have used Yondr pouches at their shows include fellow comedian Dave Chapell and musicians such as Alicia Keys, The Lumineers, and Guns N' Roses. Jack White is also planning to do the same for his upcoming tour, which includes dates in London."
2018-01-27,Sixteen and 17-year-olds in Wales are to be given the right to vote in local council elections. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/sixteen-and-17-year-olds-to-vote-in-wales-local-elections-11225459,"The idea is aimed at boosting participation following concerns that young people are becoming disengaged from the political process. At a youth group in Cardiff there were mixed reactions to the plan, which is due to be formerly announced on Tuesday. Politics student Thomas Greenfield, 17, said: ""Education is something that we are not usually able to impact despite it being, for most young people, the main part of their life. ""To be able to impact it now, even on a local level... it's only a good thing."" But Tom Cove, 16, disagrees. He doesn't think 16-year-olds should be able to vote. He said: ""People are just not mature enough, I don't think. They're in the stage of life where they're still deciding things, personal things. So I don't think they're ready."" Younger voters were widely considered to have influenced the shock result of last year's snap election. On the campaign trail, Jeremy Corbyn did his best to woo youngsters, taking selfies and using social media. He even gave a speech at Glastonbury Festival. Similarly in 2015 so-called ""Milifans"" tried to bolster support for the then Labour Leader, Ed Miliband, on Twitter, by superimposing his head onto all sorts of action heroes, such as James Bond. In Scotland 16-year-olds are already allowed to vote in all elections and with the Welsh government now following suit, many feel the law should be changed across the UK. Shadow voter engagement minister Cat Smith said: ""The Welsh Labour Government is leading the way by giving 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote in local elections in Wales. ""However, we are now in an inconsistent and unsustainable position where a 16-year-old living in Wales and Scotland can vote in local elections, yet they are denied the right to vote in UK general elections. ""The time has now come for the UK Government to extend the franchise to all 16 and 17-year-olds, and ensure equal voting rights across the United Kingdom."" The subject has been debated in the House of Commons in the past, but there are no plans for any changes in the near future. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""The age of 18, not 16, is widely recognised as the age at which one becomes an adult. ""Full citizenship rights - from drinking, to betting, to voting - are gained at adulthood. The Government has no plans to lower the voting age."""

They were among a larger group of teenagers, the rest of whom avoided injury. It is believed the Audi mounted the pavement just outside the entrance to a nearby Esso petrol station and travelled a few metres down the road before colliding with a lamp post. A 28-year-old man who was in the car was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment. Once discharged, he will be taken into custody, police say. The three teenagers, who were pronounced dead at the scene, have not yet been formally identified. Detective Jane Shaw said: ""These are horrific circumstances that have resulted in three young people losing their lives; I need anyone who saw what happened to contact police immediately. ""Did you see this Audi before the collision, or in the moments leading it up to it? I would urge you to speak to us to assist us with our investigation."" Among the tributes left at the scene is a card that read: ""George Boy, I love you so much, love Kev, Vinnie."" Another said: ""I thought I would never have to write this and I don't know what to write but I will always love and miss you millions."" Local councillor Janet Gardner described the collision as ""incredibly sad"". She said: ""My heart breaks for the parents and families and friends of those killed. I cannot begin to imagine how they are going to cope with the loss of such special young people."" Road closures were put in place while officers dealt with the incident and enquiries are ongoing to establish exactly what happened and whether there was anyone else in the car. Police have confirmed that the incident is not being treated as terror-related. Staff at the Esso garage on Shepiston Lane said a group of teenagers had been fighting at the entrance to the forecourt shortly before the crash, with one cashier revealing that police inspected the CCTV footage of the brawl. Meanwhile, employees at a nearby football club said they believed the youngsters had been on their way to a 16th birthday party on the premises when they were hit.

It comes after the collapse of a series of rape and sexual assault cases. :: Student after rape trial thrown out: ""I've spent two years living in fear"" Ms Saunders admitted that some cases would be halted because of disclosure issues. ""Inevitably, bringing forward these case reviews means it is likely that there may be a number of cases which we will be stopping at around the same time,"" she said. In the lead-up to trials, police and prosecutors are required to hand over relevant material that either undermines the prosecution case or assists the defence case. But the regime came under sharp focus after defendants facing rape allegations had the charges against them dropped when critical evidence emerged at the 11th hour. The Crown Prosecution Service, National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and College of Policing have published a disclosure ""improvement plan"". It set out plans to review training on disclosure, develop a cadre of specialist and experienced disclosure experts in every force and provide all multimedia evidence from the CPS to the defence via direct electronic link by July. The document also commits to reviewing whether there ""should be a requirement for officers to hold a Licence to Practise in respect of disclosure"" by January 2019. Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, the NPCC lead for criminal justice, said: ""Disclosure is an essential element of the criminal justice process, but has too often been seen as an administrative task completed at the end of an investigation, exacerbated by the rapid expansion of digital material involved in almost every case. ""We now need to firmly embed disclosure in the investigative mindset from the outset of any investigation. ""Reviews of recent cases have shown a range of issues leading to failures but there has been no intention by officers to conceal information."" He expressed confidence the plan will lead to ""real improvements in quick time"". A flurry of cases have raised serious concerns over arrangements surrounding the disclosure of evidence to defence teams. Last week, a rape case against Oxford University student Oliver Mears was dropped after fresh evidence - including a diary that supported his case - was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. Surrey Police admitted ""there were flaws in the investigation"" after the force failed to examine the accuser's ""digital media"" or follow ""a reasonable line of enquiry""."

The problem came to light when customers out for Wetherspoons' Tuesday Steak Club were instead offered chicken or halloumi and quinoa. Jamie Oliver restaurants, Greene King pubs, Tiger Tiger and Marston's pubs were also affected, as was Butlin's and Haven owner Bourne Leisure. Wetherspoons say they still have not been given an explanation by Russell Hume Ltd and the supplier's website is down. The pub chain, which runs 900 pubs across the country, told customers steak had been pulled from all their pubs due to ""quality issues with our meat supplier"". And they say they have now found alternative suppliers ahead of next week's Steak Club. The Food Standards Authority has said an unannounced visit to Russell Hume Ltd's Birmingham site uncovered instances of ""serious non-compliance"" with food hygiene regulations. The FSA, which has been forced to defend itself amid accusations of a cover up, is advising anyone with meat from Russell Hume, including care homes and schools, to dispose of it, or return it. Tim Martin, Wetherspoon chairman, said: ""Firstly we wish to apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused to them. ""However, our decision to stop serving steak from Tuesday (January 23), despite limited information from the supplier, was the correct one."" Mr Martin said his pubs dish out around 200,000 steaks a week. He added: ""On Wednesday (January 24) the FSA reported that they were thoroughly investigating Russell Hume Ltd, but also stressed that there was no indication that people had become ill from eating meat supplied by them."" After the steak was pulled some customers were less understanding than others. ""I can't believe a multi-million pound organisation like Wetherspoons can't sort this out - it beggars belief,"" Michael Rousell, 62, from Weston Super Mare told The Sun. James Jarvis, 27, in Scarborough, said: ""When they told me they had it but could not sell it to me I just walked out. ""They told me they had an issue with the supplier.

A nationwide search to find the UK's best new inventor has turned up 10 top ideas which could eventually transform the lives of people throughout the UK. The shortlisted entries will each receive £5,000 for more development and also receive mentoring from Barclays Eagle Labs, which is offering access to development facilities and equipment. The winner is going to be announced in September 2018 and will receive £50,000 to help get the winning product to market. The shortlisted inventions are described below: :: ""Ambionics"" by Ben Ryan Ben Ryan created the 3D printable, hydraulically-operated digital prosthetic arm, which is suitable for children under three years, specifically to help those like his two-year old son, Sol, who lost his arm at 10 days old. As a former psychology teacher, Mr Ryan knew that the first two and a half years of a child's life are crucial for brain development and learning. Yet up to 70% of children that age are not using prosthetics. Using 3D printing and special software, the Ambionics project was born in Mr Ryan's spare room in North Wales. He is currently trialling remote 3D scanning with families in Australia, North and South America, Europe and Africa. Ambionics has also partnered with Warwick University School of Engineering and is moving into the Menai Science Park on Anglesey in March. :: ""Canute"" by Ed Rogers and Bristol Braille team, with Stef Sargent Canute is a ""Kindle for blind people"", which Bristol Braille have been working on in collaboration with the blind community, including Steph Sergeant, for five years. The Canute is designed to be affordable at £800, and will be the world's first multiline digital Braille display. Existing braille displays on the market cost thousands and are only capable of showing one line. The Canute can be used for maths, music, textbooks and tables - and will be able to load text files by SD cards and USB connections. :: ""Smart Gum Shield"" by Robert Paterson Robert Paterson has invented a smart gum shield that monitors head impacts of individual athletes, rugby and hockey players which can alert the coach to potential head injuries. It will then prompt the coach to follow the head injury protocol for that particular sport. Mr Paterson himself suffered from a misdiagnosed head injury playing rugby while he was at school. In the 2015/16 season of Premiership Rugby, head trauma accounted for 25% of all injuries - becoming the sport's most reported injury for the fifth season in a row. :: ""Gameball Platform"" by microbusiness Neurofenix The team of young entrepreneurs has invented an easy-to-use hand training device, or ""Gameball"", which connects to tablet application to make stroke rehabilitation affordable and fun. Inspired by relatives of the businesses' co-founders who suffered strokes, Neurofenix aims to improve the life of stroke survivors who may not receive enough support after they leave hospital. The team has co-created the Gameball platform with the help of stroke survivors, their families and physiotherapists from initial conception. It allows users to measure their progress and play games, either solely or against other users, in the comfort of their own homes. :: ""Aergo"" by Hsin-Hua Yu (Sheana) Aergo is a new seating system that provides posture support for young wheelchair users. The device has a network of inflatable pressure-sensitive air cells that promote comfort and prevent skin irritation and damage by adjusting to position changes automatically. The expandable frame also allows the system to grow and adapt to users as their condition evolves. The system is designed for children with a range of conditions, including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. Sheana will be working with John Chilton School in Ealing and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. :: ""The Unity Door Handle"" by Connor Peter Musoke-Jones Inspired by his friend and housemate, who found it difficult to open doors, Mr Musoke-Jones has invented an inclusive door handle that is easier and cheaper to install than fitting specialist doors. Mr Musoke-Jones has developed it in collaboration with people with various hand and arm disabilities, combining ergonomics and anthropometrics to design a product that can be used by people with different abilities. :: ""New Medical Device"" by Dr Tsong Kwong Dr Kwong has invented an alternative approach in the field of medicine to benefit practitioners and healthcare systems. :: ""NuCath"" by Nawar Al-Zebari of UroLogic A new catheter made from smart materials and a simple design uses ""shape memory"" to change shape inside of the bladder, lowering drainage and retaining less urine - reducing the chance of infection. In the UK over 500,000 serious urinary tract infections per year are contracted as a result of indwelling catheters, and these account for up to 40% of all hospital-acquired infections - with an annual mortality rate of over 2,000. The estimated cost to the NHS of treating these infections is around £2bn annually. :: ""Spacelink"" by Mark Singleton Spacelink is a green building material that can be mass-produced as a new way of joining fibreglass boxes and tubes without metals or adhesives, allowing the construction of lightweight structures. Weighing 40% as much as steel, it can reportedly support the same load while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 80%. It doesn't rust or conduct electricity and can be disassembled for easy handling. It previously won the Travis Perkins Innovation Award 2016. :: ""Smart Carbon Monoxide Detector"" by Billy Mitchell The detector uses smartphone technology to self-test for carbon monoxide and sends a report on levels to landlords. Mr Mitchell began his career as an apprentice electrician and now owns his own company. He came up with the idea for an invention when speaking to a gas reader who mentioned he was only able to access 30% of households he visited. In recent trials the Smart Carbon Monoxide Detector has saved two lives. Currently only 20% of UK households have a working Carbon Monoxide detector, and 50 people a year die of Carbon Monoxide poisoning."
2018-01-27,"Phew! We're friends again. The warm, reassuring words of President Trump at Davos will be music to Theresa May's ears.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/special-us-uk-relationship-it-depends-on-donald-trumps-mood-when-he-wakes-up-11222446,"The President said the US and the UK were ""very much joined at the hip"". He didn't actually use the word ""special"" - Mrs May did that. But he said it was a ""really great relationship"". Since Theresa May rushed to Washington a year ago to pay homage at the court of King Trump, things haven't exactly gone smoothly. Mr Trump has tweeted criticism of British intelligence services over terrorism and re-tweeted posts from the far-right organisation Britain First. He then cancelled a trip to open the new US embassy in London, criticising its cost and ""off"" location. It was all a bit disingenuous. The truth is that Mr Trump's team feared any visit would be mired by protests. But it is also true that America is turning away from the ""special relationship"" and has been for some time. For instance, President Obama was far more concerned with his relationship with Europe than Britain specifically. It has been noted by British diplomats that the first state visit to Washington of a foreign leader will not be Mrs May but rather Emmanuel Macron of France. And although the two leaders in Davos agreed to finalise details of a planned visit to the UK later in the year, don't be surprised if it is not a state visit or even doesn't take place at all. As much as he would love the red carpet treatment and the pomp and ceremony, Mr Trump won't want demonstrations everywhere he goes. In America they'll be running into the crucial mid-term elections and so he will have the perfect excuse to stay away if he wants to. There is also the delicate issue of the Royal Wedding in May. It is very difficult to see Prince Harry inviting Donald Trump to his nuptials It is all pretty awkward for the Prime Minister. A post-Brexit Britain will need America more than ever, just at the time when America is turning away from the special relationship. That's why President Trump's words on trade will be especially reassuring to Mrs May. ""Trade is going to increase many times and we look forward to that"", he said. Talks have begun on a post-Brexit trade deal, but they will not be easy. There are many hurdles to negotiate before Britain gets anything like what it wants or needs. The relationship is being tested in other ways. Mr Trump's decisions to pull out of the Paris climate change deal, to threaten to wreck the Iran nuclear agreement and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have all irked British diplomats . But the obsession about whether the relationship is special or not is a very British thing. I haven't heard many Americans even mention it. I'm not sure they know it even exists. Critics say Mr Trump's tweets suggest he will not be a reliable partner for Britain. He will have only America's interests at heart - or so the theory goes. I am not so sure. He knows there are deep ties and he knows they will outlive his presidency. He also knows Britain remains America's most reliable ally. There is close co-operation on surveillance, security and military matters and both sides recognise the importance of that. But Trump is Trump. Impulsive, unorthodox, difficult and unpredictable. Special relationship? It depends on his mood when he wakes up."

Brothers Ellis Thornton-Kimmitt, 12, and Elliott Thornton-Kimmitt, 14, died in the crash, along with Darnell Harte, 15, Robbie Meerun, 24, and Anthony Armour, 24. The victims had all been travelling in the same car, a black Renault Clio, for more than an hour before it hit the tree at 88mph in a 30mph zone, Leeds Crown Court heard. The passengers were thrown from the vehicle. Police described the crash as '""catastrophic"", saying officers had been confronted by ""a scene of total carnage"" when they arrived at the scene. Speaking after the sentencing, Sky News Correspondent Gerard Tubb said: ""The court heard some harrowing details, including that the boy who was driving had tried to kick his way out of the passenger door but couldn't because there was a body lying outside the door holding it shut. ""He ran off and lied, trying to blame one of the younger boys, claiming that he (the younger boy) was driving. ""But the court heard that once he had a chance to sit and talk with his mum and dad, he came clean, admitted to what he had done."" Speaking outside court, the sisters of Darnell Harte said the teenager's sentence was not long enough. Elise Dhers told Sky News: ""We have to live with the sight of seeing my little brother through a window with his face smashed in. ""Four years is not even a year for each life."" Natasha Dhers added: ""I understand (the driver) has to live with it but we have to live with never seeing (Darnell) again. ""(Once the driver is released) we're going to have to look at him and not have to say anything because he served justice in people's eyes. ""To me, that's not justice because I'm never going to see my little brother again."" The judge told the teenager he would be facing 13-and-a-half years in jail if he was an adult. Tubb said the court was told the youth was ""15 going on 10"". He said: ""He had some significant problems with his health, he had missed a lot of school, he has hearing problems, speech and language problems. ""The judge told him, 'it was your actions, your driving of the car that has caused all this hurt and pain'... and 'I think your life will be affected by this forever'."" The boy will serve half of his sentence in detention and will then be eligible for release before starting a five-year driving ban."
2018-01-27,"Jimmy Tarbuck has defended his presence at the controversial Presidents Club dinner, saying critics should look at the behaviour of women at hen parties for ""bad behaviour"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/presidents-club-critics-should-look-at-hen-parties-says-jimmy-tarbuck-11223149,"The veteran comedian's words come after a newspaper 'expose' of the charity event, where female hosts were reportedly groped and propositioned by some of the 360 all-male guests. Sky News spoke to the 77-year-old at his home. He did not come to the door, but spoke over intercom to confirm that he attended the dinner. When asked what he thought when he read the news reports about the event, he replied: ""They should look at maybe ladies' hen parties at airports. ""I never saw anything like that happening and I would think a majority of people would say the same thing."" Since the reports broke, the event has been dubbed a ""lady zoo"" for ""slimeballs"" by furious MPs. Prime Minister Theresa May has also been among the critics. Two hospitals, including Great Ormond Street, have announced they will hand back all funds received from the event. Tarbuck said he had been at the dinner to thank guests for donations to a children's home, money that would enable the home to buy washing machines. He added: ""Would I attend something like that that would give money to something like that? Yes, I would. ""I never saw anything untoward. ""Were there a lot of pretty girls there? Of course there were - over 100 of them all looking very nice, but I never saw, never heard any bad language or insinuations to them, and I left after I'd done my bit. ""Tell (critics) to go to London airport to see hen parties going on if they want to see bad behaviour. ""It has to be both ways. It can't be all men that they're including. ""I hear on good reports that hen parties might be banned on some airlines - they should look into that."" Tarbuck said that, after making a toast and thanking diners for their support, he left the event. When asked if critics had over-reacted to the dinner, he said: ""I can't understand how sick children should suffer from it."" A spokesperson for the Presidents Club has previously said the event, which included auction items such as meals with top politicians and bankers, raised more than £2m for disadvantaged children. But they added: ""The organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters."" Later the group said it would not hold any further fundraising events."

Researchers' work could lead to crops that can withstand droughts and disease and cows that can produce more milk. The Department for International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have invested £122.8m into the projects, which could help farmers around the world. ""If you care about the poor, you should care about agriculture,"" Gates said in an address at the University of Edinburgh. ""And if you care about agriculture, you care about livestock. What that means in this context is helping poor farmers get as much as possible out of their animals."" The Microsoft founder emphasised the importance of healthy livestock as a source of nutrition and money. Mr Gates' foundation will invest £28.2m into projects aimed at developing vaccines for animals which are accessible to poorer, small-scale farmers across the continent of Africa and South Asia through the Edinburgh-based charity Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines. Britain's international development minister Penny Mordaunt hailed the move. She said: ""We think that the result of this investment will help 100 million African farmers, but also give a payback to UK farmers as well, as disease doesn't stop at borders."" According to the International Livestock Research Institute, up to 750 million people in low and middle income countries depend on livestock farming. The UK will also support global research body CGIAR with funding of £90m over three years to deliver new farm technologies. Another £4m will be pumped into the Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics and Health, which is a joint venture based in Edinburgh and Nairobi. It aims to improve the productivity and health of livestock in sub-Saharan Africa by making use of the latest genetic technologies."
2018-01-27,Tesco has become the latest supermarket chain to ban the sale of energy drinks to children.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/tesco-to-stop-selling-energy-drinks-to-children-under-16-11224198,"From March, the supermarket will ask customers to prove they are over the age of 16 if they want to buy the highly caffeinated beverages. The decision follows similar moves from Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Aldi, Asda, Morrisons and Lidl in the past few weeks. Tesco spokesperson Jane Lawrie said: ""With millions of customers across the UK shopping with us every week and 300,000 colleagues working in our stores, centres and offices, implementing new measures on energy drinks is another opportunity to help our customers adopt healthy habits. ""We know that this isn't easy to implement, so in addition, we will create awareness in store and online to highlight that high-energy caffeine drinks are not recommended for children, supporting the #notforchildren campaign."" The decision comes after a study in the BMJ Open journal which prompted experts to call for a nationwide ban on the sale of energy drinks to under 16s. The study found that in 2015 and 2017 the average sugar content of energy drinks was more than the entire recommended daily maximum for an adult in the UK. There have also been concerns raised about the amount of caffeine in the drinks. Energy drinks with more than 150mg per litre of caffeine have to carry a warning that they are not recommended for children or pregnant women. The same study found that some products had the caffeine equivalent of nearly two cups of coffee. Earlier this month, responding to Waitrose's move to introduce a minimum age for buying the drinks, the British Soft Drinks Association said: ""Energy drinks and their ingredients have been deemed safe by regulatory authorities around the world. ""Energy drink manufacturers have taken all possible steps to be clear about the suitability of energy drinks. ""Retailers, schools and parents all have a role to play in educating children about caffeine and sugar consumption from all sources."""
2018-01-27,A coastal community at Argyll in Scotland has appealed for government help in recovering the bodies of two missing fishermen.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/nancy-glen-fundraiser-could-recover-lost-fishermen-duncan-mcdougall-and-przemek-krawczyk-11224512,"Skipper Duncan McDougall and Przemek Krawczyk were on board their fishing boat, the Nancy Glen, when she capsized on Loch Fyne on 18 January. Friends and colleagues believe their bodies are trapped inside the wreck of the boat, which sank close to their home village of Tarbert in Argyll. The Clyde Fishermen's Association is now appealing for financial assistance from the UK and Scottish Governments to bring the men's bodies back ashore. It has organised a crowdfunding campaign which has raised more than £150,000 for their families, but says that using the money to salvage the wreck would mean there was nothing left for them. The chairman of the association Kenny MacNab told Sky News: ""If governments bore the cost of raising the wreck, it would go a long way to easing the families pain. ""If we did it on our own, there would be nothing left for the families. I would urge politicians, at Westminster and Holyrood, to take responsibility for the financial cost of raising the Nancy Glen, as a humanitarian gesture."" ""It's really important [to recover their bodies] because in other scenarios where people have been lost, they have maybe been far out to sea. ""In this case it's a bit different because families can actually look out, more or less from their windows, and see where the boat was lost and know their loved ones are lying out there. ""I've been instructed by then to make sure that these bodies are returned so that the families can get closure."" A third crew member on board the Nancy Glen, John Miller, survived after he managed to jump free as the boat rolled in the water before sinking. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) is conducting an investigation along with Police Scotland but the MAIB has indicated it has no plans to raise the vessel as part of its enquiries. The stricken boat had been trawling for prawns, and enquiries are likely to focus on the pulling of weighted nets along the bottom of Loch Fyne. The practise presents a danger of snagging the nets on the seabed. When the vessel got into trouble, boats from the local fishing fleet had joined HM Coastguard and other agencies in the search and rescue operation. Many of those involved knew the two missing men, both of whom were fathers of young children and well known in Tarbert. Katherine Duffin, of HM Coastguard, told Sky News: ""When we start an operation like this, an extensive search, we have a very high expectation level that we're going to be able to find these people. ""Obviously, as time goes on and nothing is found, then it becomes more emotional for us and more emotional for our volunteers. ""At the end of the day, this is their community, where they live, where they come from. They often know the people who are involved in these situations and, certainly in here on Thursday night, Friday, it was an emotional situation to be in."""
2018-01-27,"Liam Allan was accused of rape. However, the case against him collapsed and was thrown out of court after it emerged that a detective had failed to hand over text messages on the accuser's phone - seriously undermining the case.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/student-accused-of-rape-ive-spent-two-years-living-in-fear-11224156,"The 22-year-old's experience is one of several which has prompted the Crown Prosecution Service to review all rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales. Here, he writes for Sky News about his case, as well as his attempt put the two-year ordeal behind him and rebuild his life. During the case, my overwhelming feeling was frustration - you feel like you're putting your life in someone else's hands. You're in a permanent state of shock and you just can't get out of it because you can't believe it's happened to you. You're forced to try to find a way to deal with it. You try to live normally, but it's not normal. I was arrested in front of my mum at her home and taken into the station. When you know you're innocent, you just think it will be so easy to find the evidence to prove it. But it's different when it's one word against another. And while the police are trying to prove the accuser's word, no one is really out looking for evidence to support what you're saying. It feels like everything you say is just being used to compare. The whole point of court is that you're made to feel intimidated and frightened, and I completely understand that. It has to be intimidating because if not then no one's going to be scared of the police or the criminal justice system itself. But every step you go through the more you feel you are losing a part of yourself. You are sat in a box, away from your family. I had to make the decision whether I wanted people close to me - like my mum - to be my support in the courtroom or a character reference for my case. You can't do both. Sometimes you have to sacrifice having someone who is close to you in court, sometimes you have to sacrifice a character reference - it's just a choice you have to make. It took me four or five hours of torture to decide, but I finally decided I wanted my mum to be a character reference. I knew she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she wasn't a character reference and proactively helping my case. On the second day in court I discovered my accuser was going to be present in the courtroom. Up until that day I had been told she would appear on a video link, and that was what I had prepared myself for. Seeing someone on video is a lot less emotional than having someone in the same room as you. You have to fight every outburst. You just want to say: ""What are you doing? Why don't you stop this going further?"" Instead, you have to sit there and listen to someone slating your character and making you out to be this person that you know you're not. When the case collapsed, I felt extremely lucky. Everyone keeps asking me how it feels now it's over, but it's not - I'm just fighting a different battle now. I feel like I've got to tackle three different battles, on three different fronts. I feel like I need to work to regain my personal life, fight for my relationships with my friends and family and the people I love and also to deal with the threat of the reaction to the case - to any possible retaliation. I really don't wish any harm on anyone involved in the case, it's simply not part of me. I refuse to let this experience make me bitter and vengeful and start wishing harm on people - it's not in my interest. University is supposed to be the best years of your life, but I've spent two years in fear. I worry that if I put one foot out of line, even if it's not my fault, it could land me into all sorts of trouble. It means I'm always thinking about anything that could possibly damn my character more than this situation has. I'm hoping to get back to university and back to work now, and in my ideal world I'd get to get back to my normal life. But I also feel I need to do something to fight cases like this from behind the scenes. I can't stress enough, that it's not individual people or a sole department that needs to be held responsible, I think there's a collective responsibility somewhere. There are lots of things that went wrong and multiple factors that contributed to it. I would love to work with them (the Crown Prosecution Service and police), and to tell them my story properly. To go through the system with them step by step and see how it's supposed to work and I can tell them where it didn't from a personal perspective. Mr Allan is hoping to use his experience to change the system of investigating rape and sexual offences."

Ms Markle has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump and backed his rival Hillary Clinton, saying she would leave the US if he won the 2016 election. When asked if he would like to go to the Royal wedding in May at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel, Mr Trump would only say: ""I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple."" When Morgan said Ms Markle had called him ""divisive"" and a ""misogynist"", Mr Trump responded: ""Well, I still hope they're happy."" :: Donald Trump willing to apologise over Britain First retweets On Brexit, the President said he was unsurprised by the result of the referendum because Britons ""don't want people coming from all over the world into Britain"" and claimed the European Union was ""not cracked up to what it's supposed to be"". He also said he would have negotiated Brexit with a ""different"" and ""tougher"" attitude to Theresa May. ""Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate it the way it's (being) negotiated... I would have had a differentattitude,"" he said. ""I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out."" Mr Trump also claimed Mrs May invited him to the UK twice this year during their meeting at the Swiss ski resort. But Downing Street did not confirm the newspaper's claim that an informal visit in July would be followed by a state visit in October. A Number 10 source said: ""An invitation has been extended and accepted and details will be set out in due course."" The President also suggested that the US could come back in from the cold after opting out of the Paris Accord on climate change. The decision triggered scorn from the international community and ""disappointment"" from Mrs May. ""The Paris Accord, for us, would have been a disaster. I'm completely out of it,"" he said. ""First of all, it was a terrible deal for the United States. If they made a good deal... there's always a chance we'd get back. ""Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel (Macron, French president). I would love to, but it's got to be a good deal for the United States."" :: Special US-UK relationship?

He tweeted: ""I will really miss the girls!! For me they are a part of the darts. Sign their petition so they hopefully can keep their jobs."" The petition, addressed to PDC chairman Barry Hearn, has been backed by more than 7,000 people. ""Walk-on girls in darts has been traditional for years and so many things in this world that was tradition has been scrapped,"" it says. ""Well this is one that should not be scrapped not only would we break tradition but women would be out of work also."" I will really miss the girls !! For me they are a part of the darts. Sign their petition so they hopefully can keep their jobs @Charl0ttewood : https://t.co/FqhlOWY7tG https://t.co/YEpdtrwUqb Women have accompanied players onto the stage for a number of years. Eight-time major winner James Wade even married walk-on girl Sammi Marsh three years ago. Daniella Allfree, who walked on with Phil 'The Power' Taylor in his final appearance at Alexander Palace on New Year's Day, tweeted: ""Had the best 6 years working for @officialPDC. ""Loved every minute of being a walk on girl and will miss the darts family so much."" The inclusion of walk-on girls has been criticised by some who argue it is incompatible with family viewing. Following talks with broadcasters, the PDC said it would drop walk-on girls from this weekend's Masters in Milton Keynes. A PDC spokesperson said: ""We regularly review all aspects of our events and this move has been made following feedback from our host broadcasters."" Last year, world number one Michael van Gerwen predicted the move, saying in an interview with AD Sportwereld: ""The PDC wants more people to see it as a sport.

2018-01-27,The release of black cab rapist John Worboys has been put on hold after victims won the first step in a legal challenge.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180128034758/https://news.sky.com/story/black-cab-rapist-john-worboys-release-put-on-hold-amid-legal-challenege-11223709,"Two victims made an ""urgent application"" to the High Court for a stay of his release pending a further permission hearing, lawyer Harriet Wistrich said. ""We have been granted a stay on his release until an oral application between February 6-8,"" she said. The victims' legal challenge follows criticism of the Parole Board's decision to approve the 60-year-old's release later this month, after his minimum eight-year term. Worboys was jailed indefinitely in 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting female passengers between 2002 and 2008. He was convicted of 19 offences relating to 12 victims but is suspected of being linked to a total of 102 complaints. Papers were lodged on Thursday ""because of the urgency"" of the situation, Ms Wistrich said. She said a half-day hearing is set to take place between 6 and 8 February, in which Worboys' lawyer can make representations on his behalf. ""Obviously it is a first stage. You can not read too much into it but it is obviously good that we have got through the first hurdle,"" Ms Wistrich said. ""Given that somebody's liberty is at stake I think that the court would have to proceed quickly. We are arguing that he should be in prison after the Parole Board has said that he should be released."" She also said Worboys could ""potentially"" claim for damages if the victims fail in their challenge. The development comes after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan lodged an application for a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision. In a statement on Thursday, he said: ""It was an astonishing and deeply concerning decision that simply cannot go unchallenged. For victims, and all Londoners, it must be properly scrutinised in the courts. The chair of the Parole Board has welcomed this scrutiny. ""I will always put the safety of Londoners, and the needs of victims, first - which is why I instructed leading counsel to begin this process last week. ""Londoners need to know that those in authority are doing everything they can to keep them safe, and that means keeping dangerous individuals off our streets."" Following the criticism, Justice Secretary David Gauke said he stressed to officials ""the need to ensure that the concerns of victims are at the heart of the process"" with relation to deciding Worboys' licence conditions. He also revealed last week that the Government did not intend to seek a judicial review of the Parole Board's decision."
2018-01-28,All rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales are being reviewed by the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure evidence has been disclosed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/every-rape-case-to-be-urgently-reviewed-over-evidence-disclosure-11224122,"Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said the steps were being taken to identify any individual cases of concern ""as a matter of urgency"". It comes after the collapse of a series of rape and sexual assault cases. :: Student after rape trial thrown out: ""I've spent two years living in fear"" Ms Saunders admitted that some cases would be halted because of disclosure issues. ""Inevitably, bringing forward these case reviews means it is likely that there may be a number of cases which we will be stopping at around the same time,"" she said. In the lead-up to trials, police and prosecutors are required to hand over relevant material that either undermines the prosecution case or assists the defence case. But the regime came under sharp focus after defendants facing rape allegations had the charges against them dropped when critical evidence emerged at the 11th hour. The Crown Prosecution Service, National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and College of Policing have published a disclosure ""improvement plan"". It set out plans to review training on disclosure, develop a cadre of specialist and experienced disclosure experts in every force and provide all multimedia evidence from the CPS to the defence via direct electronic link by July. The document also commits to reviewing whether there ""should be a requirement for officers to hold a Licence to Practise in respect of disclosure"" by January 2019. Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, the NPCC lead for criminal justice, said: ""Disclosure is an essential element of the criminal justice process, but has too often been seen as an administrative task completed at the end of an investigation, exacerbated by the rapid expansion of digital material involved in almost every case. ""We now need to firmly embed disclosure in the investigative mindset from the outset of any investigation. ""Reviews of recent cases have shown a range of issues leading to failures but there has been no intention by officers to conceal information."" He expressed confidence the plan will lead to ""real improvements in quick time"". A flurry of cases have raised serious concerns over arrangements surrounding the disclosure of evidence to defence teams. Last week, a rape case against Oxford University student Oliver Mears was dropped after fresh evidence - including a diary that supported his case - was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. Surrey Police admitted ""there were flaws in the investigation"" after the force failed to examine the accuser's ""digital media"" or follow ""a reasonable line of enquiry""."

He was arrested at the scene of the crash. Another man, aged 34, was arrested on Sunday after he voluntarily attended a police station in north London. The three teenagers were waiting at a bus stop in Hayes on Friday evening when they were hit by a car that reportedly mounted the pavement close to a nearby petrol station. Despite the efforts of paramedics, all three boys were pronounced dead at the scene. It is understood they had been on their way to a birthday party at a nearby football club with friends when they were killed. Detectives named the victims as 17-year-old Harry Louis Rice, 16-year-old George Toby Wilkinson and 16-year-old Josh Mcgunniess. In a statement on Sunday, Detective Sergeant Michael Rapp, of the Met's serious collision investigation unit, said: ""This is a fast-moving investigation and CCTV enquiries and forensic analysis of the car involved are under way."" He said inquiries were ongoing ""to establish the full circumstances of the collision and the number of occupants in the vehicle involved"". Hillingdon Borough Commander Colin Wingrove said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with family and many friends of three young men who have died in such tragic circumstances. ""Tributes continue to be laid at the scene and officers will be in and around the area providing a presence and also make to themselves available to anyone who does have information and wants to speak with police. ""There is understandably a lot of shock and grief in the local community. These three young men had their whole lives ahead of them.

A nationwide search to find the UK's best new inventor has turned up 10 top ideas which could eventually transform the lives of people throughout the UK. The shortlisted entries will each receive £5,000 for more development and also receive mentoring from Barclays Eagle Labs, which is offering access to development facilities and equipment. The winner is going to be announced in September 2018 and will receive £50,000 to help get the winning product to market. The shortlisted inventions are described below: :: ""Ambionics"" by Ben Ryan Ben Ryan created the 3D printable, hydraulically-operated digital prosthetic arm, which is suitable for children under three years, specifically to help those like his two-year old son, Sol, who lost his arm at 10 days old. As a former psychology teacher, Mr Ryan knew that the first two and a half years of a child's life are crucial for brain development and learning. Yet up to 70% of children that age are not using prosthetics. Using 3D printing and special software, the Ambionics project was born in Mr Ryan's spare room in North Wales. He is currently trialling remote 3D scanning with families in Australia, North and South America, Europe and Africa. Ambionics has also partnered with Warwick University School of Engineering and is moving into the Menai Science Park on Anglesey in March. :: ""Canute"" by Ed Rogers and Bristol Braille team, with Stef Sargent Canute is a ""Kindle for blind people"", which Bristol Braille have been working on in collaboration with the blind community, including Steph Sergeant, for five years. The Canute is designed to be affordable at £800, and will be the world's first multiline digital Braille display. Existing braille displays on the market cost thousands and are only capable of showing one line. The Canute can be used for maths, music, textbooks and tables - and will be able to load text files by SD cards and USB connections. :: ""Smart Gum Shield"" by Robert Paterson Robert Paterson has invented a smart gum shield that monitors head impacts of individual athletes, rugby and hockey players which can alert the coach to potential head injuries. It will then prompt the coach to follow the head injury protocol for that particular sport. Mr Paterson himself suffered from a misdiagnosed head injury playing rugby while he was at school. In the 2015/16 season of Premiership Rugby, head trauma accounted for 25% of all injuries - becoming the sport's most reported injury for the fifth season in a row. :: ""Gameball Platform"" by microbusiness Neurofenix The team of young entrepreneurs has invented an easy-to-use hand training device, or ""Gameball"", which connects to tablet application to make stroke rehabilitation affordable and fun. Inspired by relatives of the businesses' co-founders who suffered strokes, Neurofenix aims to improve the life of stroke survivors who may not receive enough support after they leave hospital. The team has co-created the Gameball platform with the help of stroke survivors, their families and physiotherapists from initial conception. It allows users to measure their progress and play games, either solely or against other users, in the comfort of their own homes. :: ""Aergo"" by Hsin-Hua Yu (Sheana) Aergo is a new seating system that provides posture support for young wheelchair users. The device has a network of inflatable pressure-sensitive air cells that promote comfort and prevent skin irritation and damage by adjusting to position changes automatically. The expandable frame also allows the system to grow and adapt to users as their condition evolves. The system is designed for children with a range of conditions, including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. Sheana will be working with John Chilton School in Ealing and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. :: ""The Unity Door Handle"" by Connor Peter Musoke-Jones Inspired by his friend and housemate, who found it difficult to open doors, Mr Musoke-Jones has invented an inclusive door handle that is easier and cheaper to install than fitting specialist doors. Mr Musoke-Jones has developed it in collaboration with people with various hand and arm disabilities, combining ergonomics and anthropometrics to design a product that can be used by people with different abilities. :: ""New Medical Device"" by Dr Tsong Kwong Dr Kwong has invented an alternative approach in the field of medicine to benefit practitioners and healthcare systems. :: ""NuCath"" by Nawar Al-Zebari of UroLogic A new catheter made from smart materials and a simple design uses ""shape memory"" to change shape inside of the bladder, lowering drainage and retaining less urine - reducing the chance of infection. In the UK over 500,000 serious urinary tract infections per year are contracted as a result of indwelling catheters, and these account for up to 40% of all hospital-acquired infections - with an annual mortality rate of over 2,000. The estimated cost to the NHS of treating these infections is around £2bn annually. :: ""Spacelink"" by Mark Singleton Spacelink is a green building material that can be mass-produced as a new way of joining fibreglass boxes and tubes without metals or adhesives, allowing the construction of lightweight structures. Weighing 40% as much as steel, it can reportedly support the same load while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 80%. It doesn't rust or conduct electricity and can be disassembled for easy handling. It previously won the Travis Perkins Innovation Award 2016. :: ""Smart Carbon Monoxide Detector"" by Billy Mitchell The detector uses smartphone technology to self-test for carbon monoxide and sends a report on levels to landlords. Mr Mitchell began his career as an apprentice electrician and now owns his own company. He came up with the idea for an invention when speaking to a gas reader who mentioned he was only able to access 30% of households he visited. In recent trials the Smart Carbon Monoxide Detector has saved two lives. Currently only 20% of UK households have a working Carbon Monoxide detector, and 50 people a year die of Carbon Monoxide poisoning."

To commemorate the brick's 60th birthday on Sunday, Lego has given a unique makeover to the shop where it was first sold in the UK, Osborne's Sports & Toys in Rushden, Northamptonshire. In 1960 Pam Osborne and her late husband, Jim, were on honeymoon in Brighton. The couple saw a Lego brick at a trade fair showcasing new toys. They immediately placed an order and their shop has sold Lego products ever since. :: Opinion: Lego superfan - 'The thing I love is creativity' To mark the Osbornes' leap of faith in a then unknown product, the shop, which is now managed by the couple's son, Will, has been given a temporary Lego façade. Measuring nearly 14ft tall and 50ft wide, the new Lego shopfront contains 277,500 Lego bricks and took more than 600 hours to build. ""I still can’t really believe that they’ve been here and built it,"" Mrs Osborne told Sky News. ""I think it’s absolutely incredible!"" The Lego brick we know today is little changed from the original, first created by Godtfred Kirk Christiansen in 1958. What began as a simple toy building-block for children and turned into a global empire, with Lego theme-parks, movies and video games. But the brick itself remains a favourite for kids of all ages. ""Lego is so endlessly adaptable,"" Simon Bennet, an adult Lego enthusiast from the Brickish Association told Sky News. ""You can do so many things with it. If you're a child the imagination is your only limit but if you're an adult you can get into some really serious detailed modelling."" Lego fans from across the UK have already been visiting the Osbornes' new-look shop. It’ll retain its Lego facelift until 29 January."

""I'll take it out at 2.30 in the morning on the freeway and I'll blast on the motorway and no police catch me and no cameras because I wrap my number plates with clingfilm,"" he told The Mirror. ""It's a great thing for a chef when they get their own Ferrari, just wrap it with clingfilm. It won't photograph, it reflects. ""So get rolls of clingfilm...and wrap the front so you won't get caught speeding."" Speaking at the opening of his new restaurant in Las Vegas on Friday night, the Hell's Kitchen host said another reason he took the car out at night was that he was too embarrassed to drive it to work. Ramsay is reported to own another eight Ferraris in the UK. He said: ""I get a lot of criticism for being blunt, brutally honest. It's because I have never forgotten to this day where I've come from, how hard I've worked. ""Someone said to me, 'Easy for you, you go to work in a Ferrari'. No, I don't.

It is believed to be the first attack of its kind in the country. The heist took place at the family's property near independent school Cranford House in the Oxfordshire village of Moulsford, where staff and children were locked inside for their own safety as police searched for the suspects. A mother of one of the school's children told The Mail on Sunday: ""I saw four young men in black tracksuits with the hoods pulled up, crossing the road to the property where it took place. ""They were aged 18 to 25, dark-skinned and super-fit. They jumped over the fence on the other side of the road.

His two cousins ran for help, and his mother said she saw him wandering around the back yard with the post sticking out of the back of his head. Firefighters had to be called to cut the post down to two feet, as medics tried to transfer him to hospital. The first air ambulance that arrived was too small, but eventually the 13-year-old made it to John Hopkins Hospital where the post was removed, and then the screw. Neurosurgeon Dr Alan Cohen told ABC 7 that the screw was about 1mm away from killing Darius, and that he may have died if he had tried to remove it himself. Darius told the Daily Times of Salisbury at first he didn't know what was wrong, saying: ""I thought I got something stuck in my hair."" But he said once he got to the hospital, he was in a lot of pain. But Darius walked out of the hospital five days after the incident, on his 13th birthday. His mother Joy Ellingsworth told the paper: ""They threw him a party and decorated the room while he was asleep."" Ms Ellingsworth estimated the board was attached to her son for around seven hours before it was cut off with a pair of bolt cutters and the risky surgery completed.

They have been told they could be jailed for up to a year and could also face six months in detention waiting for the case to go to trial. Cambodian police released images online appearing to show clothed and laughing tourists, some in sexually suggestive positions. But one of the group, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said none of the people in the photos are those arrested and they are confused by the situation. They said: ""Honestly, it was really confusing. Everyone was confused. They raided, rounded us up - there was about 80 to 100 people at this party, some of them were tourists. There were about 30 of them [police officers]."" One of the group vomited in shock as they were taken away.

2018-01-28,"Sheffield schoolteacher Michael LeCount believes he has up to 4,000 Lego sets - totalling what could be 10 million bricks. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/the-thing-i-love-is-creativity-the-feeling-that-i-can-build-whatever-i-want-11223529,"He's been named the UK's biggest Lego fan, and has even moved home to accommodate his collecting passion. Here - on the 60th anniversary of the popular toy - he tells the story behind his love for building:  When I was one or two, my father was in the army and brought home some Lego from the US. It was what's now called Duplo, and I must have been one or two at the time. I suppose my collection over the years has grown from just a few sets to thousands of sets now. It would be difficult to describe which is my favourite set. The Lego brick has been going for 60 years and there are iconic pieces from different eras. But I suppose my greatest interests are the sets I remember from my childhood in the 60s and 70s. In reality, my collection probably takes up about four rooms. I've got a museum room, I've got a building room - although my son uses that as I don't build a great deal any more - and I've got a couple of what I call overflow storage rooms for the ones that aren't on display. My collection starts off with sets from the 50s, and then continues into the 60s, 70s and 80s. While obviously they are bringing out sets now and there's some that I like, as a collector I like the challenge of tracking down sets and it's sometimes too easy with the modern stuff. People certainly didn't collect in the very early days, so to get something that's complete, that's all in the box, is quite unusual. I've collected for 35 years and there's some that it's taken me 30 plus years to track down examples of. Fire stations, a Volkswagen garage, and a church building from the 50s are examples of things that were really hard to find at the time. The thing I love is creativity, the feeling that I can build whatever I want. If I see a building in Sheffield that I quite like, I'll build that. My son's the same - he'll build from his imagination and he loves that challenge. I love Lego for the same reason that Lego survives and is going so well. It adapts with me: I'm able to take what I have, break it all up and change it as my interests change. I can see that my son has completely different interests, but he can create what’s in his imagination with the same bricks. The other wonderful thing is that you can collect the history of the company. A brick from 1958 is still compatible with all the stuff today, it's still usable and can still be used. You can break up sets and put them back together, work on making something really unique. I was always a collector. My father collected, my grandfather collected. So there was this collecting bug that was there. When I was a kid there was certain Lego sets in my childhood that I loved and obviously didn't get because I didn't have the money. When I was 16 or 17 I came across a set in a junk shop that I remembered really wanting when I was a kid. So I bought that, and then the collecting part of me started looking for others. And of course then when you get older and you have your own credit card, the sky's the limit really. When I started collecting there was a part of me that wanted to get everything, which would have been impossible. So I became selective. The great thing about Lego is it lasts. It stands the test of time. Earlier sets have much more of a personal value than a monetary one. But people collect what they remember, and of course the people coming into it now don't remember the 60s and 70s. I honestly don’t know how much I've spent in total. I don't keep records because it's meaningless: what it means to me isn't a monetary thing. It only has a value when you come to sell it and I have no intention to sell it, therefore it has no value. When it comes to the question of how many bricks I've got, it's like asking how long is a piece of string. I'd say anything between two and ten million bricks. My wife appreciates the collection because it does tell a story and it tells the story of Lego and a story over time. She does think it takes up a bit too much space though."
2018-01-28,More than a dozen survivors and family members of those killed in terror attacks have joined forces to form a new anti-terrorism campaign group.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/survivors-form-anti-terror-campaign-group-11226919,"Brendan Cox, the widower of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, and Mike Haines, whose brother David was beheaded on camera after being held captive by Islamic State in Syria, are among the founders. At a launch event at a school, Mr Cox was joined by Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed by the IRA in the Brighton bombing, and Charlotte Dixon-Sutcliffe, whose husband was killed in the Brussels metro bombing. They said one of the aims of their initiative is to reach out to young people to end the cycle of hate around terrorism. The group said: ""Our collective view is that terrorism can be defeated - but only if we pull together as a country to fight it more effectively. We will work to build a voice for survivors."" Also among the founders is Dan Hett and Figen Murray, the brother and mother of Manchester bombing victim Martyn Hett, as well as Paralympian and 7/7 survivor Martine Wiltshire, and Tunisia resort shooting victim Gina Van Dort. The Survivors Against Terror group is also urging others to join as it begins work on Monday. It has highlighted five areas of priority: :: Strong support for the police and security services:: Better integrated and more inclusive communities:: Tackling the hate speech that drives terror (from extremist preachers to neo-Nazis):: Stronger action by social media companies and respectful treatment of survivors by traditional media:: A unified public response. The founders said: ""As a group of survivors and family members we have had mixed experiences of support from the government and other service providers. ""In some cases this has been exemplary, in other cases families and survivors have been left with no support at all. ""We will be reaching out to other survivors and bereaved families to build a better picture of what is and isn't working and will be talking to the government and other service providers about the gaps we identify."" Survivors Against Terror plans to survey a wide group of victims and go into schools to talk about the impact of hatred. Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, welcomed the creation of the new group. She said: ""I have incredible admiration for the courage and dedication of everyone involved. Their ambition to bring positive change as a response to their horrific experiences is truly inspiring. ""We are committed to providing the best support for victims of terrorism, and that is why last year we set up the Victims of Terrorism Unit which will make sure that support, both in the UK and overseas, is comprehensive and made swiftly available to those who need it. Last year was one of the worst for terrorism in the UK. Attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and a mosque in Finsbury Park in London killed 36 people."
2018-01-28,"MindGeek, the biggest internet pornography company in the world has told Sky News it will not snoop on the sexual preferences of 25 million people in the UK under new age verification laws.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/porn-watchers-will-have-to-prove-they-are-over-18-under-new-laws-11224093,"However, MindGeek also plans to collect a trove of information on users, including their names, addresses, date of birth, as well as their online activities on other websites.From April, as part of the Digital Economy Act, anyone wishing to view pornography online will have to prove they are over 18 years old.The mechanism for age verification is being left to the private sector. Among the companies developing solutions is MindGeek, which bills itself as a leader in 'Web Design, IT, Web Development and SEO [search engine optimisation]'.MindGeek also runs some of the most viewed pornography sites in the world, including PornHub, YouPorn and RedTube - the so-called 'tube' sites - as well as production studios including Brazzers. MindGeek anticipates signing up 25 million users in the UK to its age verification system, AgeID. The system will require users to sign up with an email address and password, then use a third party mechanism to prove they're over 18. User will then use AgeID to access pornographic sites around the web; AgeID will log which sites are visited.MindGeek will charge other pornography sites to use its solution. But because of its market dominance, campaigners fear it will end up the defacto age verification standard, handing even more power to the biggest porn provider around.A spokesperson for MindGeek told Sky News: ""AgeID has been built from the ground up with data protection, data minimisation and the principles of privacy by design at its core, whilst also complying with the GDPR."" ""This is why we do not store any personal data entered during the age verification process,"" Mindgeek added.""Due to the encrypted nature of AgeID's login credentials, such data cannot be exposed in the unlikely event of a hack.""However, the privacy policy for AgeID details a wealth of information the site may collect. It includes name, postal address, nationality, date and place of birth, email address, mobile phone numbers and demographic information, as well as searches made on AgeID. It notes that this information can be used by AgeID ""to develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Website and other sites"".The policy also says: ""We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services.""MindGeek has suffered high profile hacks in the past, with millions of people's personal information being stolen. A database of pornographic sites visited across the web for 25 million people in the UK would likely be a target for hackers. Independent pornography producers in the UK are concerned about MindGeek's potential dominance.Pandora Blake, a producer of queer pornography, told Sky News: ""MindGeek already have a monopoly on production via having bought out a lot of different production studios and distribution via the tube sites. ""And now the government has handed them a golden cheque and they're going to have a monopoly on age verification, being the gatekeepers of online porn at this point.""The UK will be the first democratic country in the world to require users to prove their age to view pornographic content. The British Board of Film Classification has been designated as the regulator for age verification but has not yet been confirmed by Parliament.This month the Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport laid out its guidance for age verification solutions. It did not suggest requirements for people's identity not to be tracked across the internet, merely suggesting it should be ""good practice"". And the DCMS's own impact assessment report notes that age verification solutions could increase the risk of online fraud, as well as push children ""to illegal and extreme material that they otherwise would never have come into contact with.""The DCMS refused repeated requests from Sky News for an interview. It gave this statement: ""A wide variety of online age verification arrangements currently exist and so we expect that providers of online pornography will be able to choose the appropriate solution to meet their specific needs."""
2018-01-28,Thousands of people have signed a petition calling on Professional Darts Corporation bosses to reverse their decision to stop using walk-on girls at tournaments.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/darts-star-raymond-van-barneveld-backs-calls-to-reinstate-pdc-walk-on-girls-11224328,"Among those backing the online campaign is former PDC world champion Raymond van Barneveld, who said he wanted the women reinstated. He tweeted: ""I will really miss the girls!! For me they are a part of the darts. Sign their petition so they hopefully can keep their jobs."" The petition, addressed to PDC chairman Barry Hearn, has been backed by more than 7,000 people. ""Walk-on girls in darts has been traditional for years and so many things in this world that was tradition has been scrapped,"" it says. ""Well this is one that should not be scrapped not only would we break tradition but women would be out of work also."" I will really miss the girls !! For me they are a part of the darts. Sign their petition so they hopefully can keep their jobs @Charl0ttewood : https://t.co/FqhlOWY7tG https://t.co/YEpdtrwUqb Women have accompanied players onto the stage for a number of years. Eight-time major winner James Wade even married walk-on girl Sammi Marsh three years ago. Daniella Allfree, who walked on with Phil 'The Power' Taylor in his final appearance at Alexander Palace on New Year's Day, tweeted: ""Had the best 6 years working for @officialPDC. ""Loved every minute of being a walk on girl and will miss the darts family so much."" The inclusion of walk-on girls has been criticised by some who argue it is incompatible with family viewing. Following talks with broadcasters, the PDC said it would drop walk-on girls from this weekend's Masters in Milton Keynes. A PDC spokesperson said: ""We regularly review all aspects of our events and this move has been made following feedback from our host broadcasters."" Last year, world number one Michael van Gerwen predicted the move, saying in an interview with AD Sportwereld: ""The PDC wants more people to see it as a sport. ""It does not interest me (walk-on girls). It is just a sport."" The PDC World Darts Championships are shown live on Sky Sports. The PDC's announcement on walk-on girls will likely increase pressure on other sports, such as boxing and F1, to review their use of ring and grid girls."

He left the club a few weeks ago. Academy manager Marc Wardley said the boy was ""quiet and a really nice lad who got on with things, and who could have gone on to play at a decent level"". The crash victims - two aged 16 and one who was 17 - have been named in tributes left at the scene as George and Josh, along with Harry. The teenagers were close to a bus stop when a black Audi collided with them in Hayes, west London, at around 8.40pm on Friday night. Staff at a football club on Shepiston Lane said they believed the youngsters had been on their way to a 16th birthday party on the premises when they were hit. A member of staff at the GOALS centre said the party had been cancelled following the tragedy. Among the messages left at the scene of the collision was a card that read: ""George Boy, I love you so much, love Kev, Vinnie."" Another said: ""I thought I would never have to write this and I don't know what to write but I will always love and miss you millions."" A third card read: ""To my bro, always together for ever,"" while a fourth said: ""To my darling baby boi my heart is broken, love mum, Vinnie."" The trio were among a larger group of teenagers, the rest of whom avoided injury. It is believed the Audi mounted the pavement just outside the entrance to a nearby Esso petrol station and travelled a few metres down the road before colliding with a lamp post. Detectives said they believed the car was travelling at high speed and stopped a short distance away from the collision. Following the crash, two men reportedly left the vehicle and one of them - a 28-year-old - was detained by members of the public. The suspect was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment and has now been taken into custody after being discharged. At the time of Harry's signing with Farnborough Town, his father Ian said: ""He was thrilled and didn't have any hesitation in signing with them, it's a nice place with a nice people and a semi-pro cub is a good level to start at, he's happy with it."" Farnborough scout, Marc Wardley, added: ""He's done well and will be a good addition to our youth team, we're delighted to sign him."" Reacting to news of Harry's death, Farnborough's chairman Simon Gardener said: ""The club is deeply saddened and our thoughts and condolences are with the family."" The club hopes to have a tribute for Harry at their next home game in February. Local councillor Janet Gardner described the collision as ""incredibly sad"". She said: ""My heart breaks for the parents and families and friends of those killed. I cannot begin to imagine how they are going to cope with the loss of such special young people."" Police have confirmed that the crash is not being treated as terror-related. Staff at the Esso garage on Shepiston Lane said a group of teenagers had been fighting at the entrance to the forecourt shortly before the crash, with one cashier revealing that police inspected the CCTV footage of the brawl. :: Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to call the Serious Collision Investigation Unit directly on 0208 991 9555, quoting reference 7843 of 26 January, or call 101 or tweet @MetCC.

2018-01-28,"A crackdown on ""dodgy"" parking operators will prevent them from fining drivers and potentially push them out of the industry unless they follow stringent rules.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/government-to-back-clampdown-on-dodgy-parking-operators-11225967,"Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has confirmed he will back a bill brought by former minister Sir Greg Hands which seeks to provide ""fair, clear and consistent"" regulation in the parking industry, and allow a clampdown on ""unscrupulous and aggressive"" parking operators. Parking firms falling foul of the new rules will lose access to the driver database allowing them to issue fines, effectively forcing them out of the industry. There are 13 times more tickets being issued compared to a decade ago, and nearly 10,000 people approached Citizens Advice Bureau for guidance on tickets last year. Motorists say problems include substandard signage, inconsistent practices, confusing appeals processes and intimidating payment letters. Mr Javid said: ""For too long, drivers have suffered from unjust fines at the hands of dodgy parking firms. ""We need a fairer, clearer and more consistent system that brings the small minority of unscrupulous operators in line with those who are behaving appropriately. ""That is why Government is putting the brakes on these rogue operators and backing new laws that will put a stop to aggressive behaviour and provide a simpler way for drivers to appeal fines."" The bill is due for its second reading and the backing of the communities secretary will effectively confirm its passage into law. Mr Javid will develop the code of practice with motoring groups and experts. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ""We all hoped the ban on clamping would end the sharp practices that had come to plague private parking, but the fact that companies are issuing millions of penalty tickets annually is clear evidence that something is still going badly awry. ""Drivers don't want a parking free-for-all, but they do want a system that is fair to all parties and that's what a code of practice set by Government - rather than the industry itself - should bring about."" Andrew Pester, chief executive of the British Parking Association, said: ""We welcome Sir Greg's Bill. Our membership already complies with a robust code of practice which we continuously seek to improve through consultation. ""A single, mandatory code of practice across the whole sector is important to ensure that unscrupulous providers don't undermine the parking sector with bad practice."""
2018-01-28,"Unsecured creditors of BHS, the retailer once owned by Sir Philip Green‎, lodged claims worth almost £1bn in the aftermath of its collapse, according to a report compiled by the chain's liquidators.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/bhs-creditors-get-36m-payout-two-years-after-chains-collapse-11226790,"Sky News has obtained a document sent to creditors late last week which discloses that a 3.6pm interim dividend - worth a total of roughly £36m - has been paid out by FRP Advisory, which is overseeing the winding-down of what was once one of Britain's best-known high street brands. BHS collapsed into administration in April 2016, little more than a year after being offloaded for £1 by Sir Philip Green, the high street billionaire. Sir Philip endured months of public and political criticism before agreeing to pay up to £363m into BHS's pension scheme, while as many as 11,000 workers lost their jobs when the chain went under. Most of the interim dividend revealed in the FRP report has been funded by an agreement reached last summer in which Sir Philip's Arcadia Group agreed to release its claim over a £35m floating charge linked to BHS. The ‎progress report discloses that investigations into the circumstances surrounding BHS's failure are continuing, but provides few further details because of their ""sensitive and largely privileged nature"". It does add that work to examine the disposal of properties ""that appear to have advantaged certain parties potentially at the expense of the company""‎ is underway but is at an early stage. FRP also said that it would probe the ""appropriateness of fees paid by the company in respect of advice received from professional advisers"" - thought to include law firm‎s which have already faced heavy criticism from MPs investigating BHS's collapse. Other inquiries into the department store chain‎'s demise, led by the Insolvency Service and the Financial Reporting Council, remain ongoing. Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt to whom Sir Philip sold BHS in 2015, is due to be sentenced next month following his recent conviction for failing to provide information to The Pensions Regulator. The 3.63pm interim dividend compares to an original estimate by BHS's administrators of a total recovery of up to 8p in the pound, suggesting that the eventual sum recouped from the chain's wreckage could exceed that projection. However, that figure will still be modest ‎in the context of the £998m of claims received from unsecured creditors - the largest chunk of which relates to BHS's pension scheme. The itemisation of the liquidators' work details a number of unresolved disputes with UK-based store landlords and international franchisees. The report by FRP, which also reveals a near £600,000 refund from previously overpaid business rates, comes just over a year after SHB Realisations entered into liquidation. Sources said that a number of other BHS-related entities, including Davenbush - which was used under Sir Philip's ownership to guarantee the retailer's pension deficit and reduce its levy obligation to the Pension Protection Fund - were now in the process of moving from administration to liquidation. The progress report said that FRP had exceeded its £2.4m fee estimate for the first year of BHS's liquidation by‎ nearly £272,000, ""due to the cost of the work involved in making the first and interim unsecured dividend to creditors"". A spokesman for FRP declined to comment this weekend."

The editor of the Marshall County Daily Online, Mary Garrison Minyard, had gone to the site following reports of gunshots, according to colleague Ann Beckett. Ms Beckett told the Courier Journal she went to comfort the editor and take over the story. Gabe Parker has been named as the boy who allegedly pulled out a handgun and opened fire before classes were due to begin on Tuesday. His mother, Ms Garrison Minyard, and other members of his family have declined to comment, said the Courier Journal. The motive for the shooting is not known. Friends and others who know Parker, a pupil who played trombone in the school band, described him as a shy, red-headed ""grandma's boy"" who would go fishing with his grandparents. Meanwhile, debates are raging in Kentucky and other states nationwide about how to prevent such shootings. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican and social conservative, has made it clear that he won't sign laws that restrict guns. Mr Bevin has called on Americans to ""wake up,"" recognise that school shootings are a ""cultural problem,"" and to look at the ""root causes"". ""Our culture is crumbling from within,"" he said. Mr Bevin said the desensitisation to death and killing is coming at an ""extraordinary price"". ""We can't celebrate death in video games, celebrate death in TV shows, celebrate death in movies, celebrate death in musical lyrics and remove any sense of morality and sense of higher authority and then expect that things like this are not going to happen,"" he said."
2018-01-28,A coastal community at Argyll in Scotland has appealed for government help in recovering the bodies of two missing fishermen.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/nancy-glen-fundraiser-could-recover-lost-fishermen-duncan-mcdougall-and-przemek-krawczyk-11224512,"Skipper Duncan MacDougall and Przemek Krawczyk were on board their fishing boat, the Nancy Glen, when she capsized on Loch Fyne on 18 January. Friends and colleagues believe their bodies are trapped inside the wreck of the boat, which sank close to their home village of Tarbert in Argyll. The Clyde Fishermen's Association is now appealing for financial assistance from the UK and Scottish Governments to bring the men's bodies back ashore. It has organised a crowdfunding campaign which has raised more than £150,000 for their families, but says that using the money to salvage the wreck would mean there was nothing left for them. The chairman of the association Kenny MacNab told Sky News: ""If governments bore the cost of raising the wreck, it would go a long way to easing the families pain. ""If we did it on our own, there would be nothing left for the families. I would urge politicians, at Westminster and Holyrood, to take responsibility for the financial cost of raising the Nancy Glen, as a humanitarian gesture."" ""It's really important [to recover their bodies] because in other scenarios where people have been lost, they have maybe been far out to sea. ""In this case it's a bit different because families can actually look out, more or less from their windows, and see where the boat was lost and know their loved ones are lying out there. ""I've been instructed by then to make sure that these bodies are returned so that the families can get closure."" A third crew member on board the Nancy Glen, John Miller, survived after he managed to jump free as the boat rolled in the water before sinking. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) is conducting an investigation along with Police Scotland but the MAIB has indicated it has no plans to raise the vessel as part of its enquiries. The stricken boat had been trawling for prawns, and enquiries are likely to focus on the pulling of weighted nets along the bottom of Loch Fyne. The practise presents a danger of snagging the nets on the seabed. When the vessel got into trouble, boats from the local fishing fleet had joined HM Coastguard and other agencies in the search and rescue operation. Many of those involved knew the two missing men, both of whom were fathers of young children and well known in Tarbert. Katherine Duffin, of HM Coastguard, told Sky News: ""When we start an operation like this, an extensive search, we have a very high expectation level that we're going to be able to find these people. ""Obviously, as time goes on and nothing is found, then it becomes more emotional for us and more emotional for our volunteers. ""At the end of the day, this is their community, where they live, where they come from. They often know the people who are involved in these situations and, certainly in here on Thursday night, Friday, it was an emotional situation to be in."""
2018-01-28,"Phew! We're friends again. The warm, reassuring words of President Trump at Davos will be music to Theresa May's ears.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/special-us-uk-relationship-it-depends-on-donald-trumps-mood-when-he-wakes-up-11222446,"The President said the US and the UK were ""very much joined at the hip"". He didn't actually use the word ""special"" - Mrs May did that. But he said it was a ""really great relationship"". Since Theresa May rushed to Washington a year ago to pay homage at the court of King Trump, things haven't exactly gone smoothly. Mr Trump has tweeted criticism of British intelligence services over terrorism and re-tweeted posts from the far-right organisation Britain First. He then cancelled a trip to open the new US embassy in London, criticising its cost and ""off"" location. It was all a bit disingenuous. The truth is that Mr Trump's team feared any visit would be mired by protests. But it is also true that America is turning away from the ""special relationship"" and has been for some time. For instance, President Obama was far more concerned with his relationship with Europe than Britain specifically. It has been noted by British diplomats that the first state visit to Washington of a foreign leader will not be Mrs May but rather Emmanuel Macron of France. And although the two leaders in Davos agreed to finalise details of a planned visit to the UK later in the year, don't be surprised if it is not a state visit or even doesn't take place at all. As much as he would love the red carpet treatment and the pomp and ceremony, Mr Trump won't want demonstrations everywhere he goes. In America they'll be running into the crucial mid-term elections and so he will have the perfect excuse to stay away if he wants to. There is also the delicate issue of the Royal Wedding in May. It is very difficult to see Prince Harry inviting Donald Trump to his nuptials It is all pretty awkward for the Prime Minister. A post-Brexit Britain will need America more than ever, just at the time when America is turning away from the special relationship. That's why President Trump's words on trade will be especially reassuring to Mrs May. ""Trade is going to increase many times and we look forward to that"", he said. Talks have begun on a post-Brexit trade deal, but they will not be easy. There are many hurdles to negotiate before Britain gets anything like what it wants or needs. The relationship is being tested in other ways. Mr Trump's decisions to pull out of the Paris climate change deal, to threaten to wreck the Iran nuclear agreement and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have all irked British diplomats . But the obsession about whether the relationship is special or not is a very British thing. I haven't heard many Americans even mention it. I'm not sure they know it even exists. Critics say Mr Trump's tweets suggest he will not be a reliable partner for Britain. He will have only America's interests at heart - or so the theory goes. I am not so sure. He knows there are deep ties and he knows they will outlive his presidency. He also knows Britain remains America's most reliable ally. There is close co-operation on surveillance, security and military matters and both sides recognise the importance of that. But Trump is Trump. Impulsive, unorthodox, difficult and unpredictable. Special relationship? It depends on his mood when he wakes up."

The police have warned members of the public not to approach Urbonas, but to call them immediately with any information regarding his whereabouts. Anyone who might he harbouring Urbonas could be prosecuted for doing so, police warned. Police say anyone with information should call them on 999. HMP Peterborough is operated by Sodexo, which also operates HMPs Northumberland, Forest Bank, Bronzefield, and Addiewell. An HMP Peterborough spokesperson told Sky News: ""A 51-year-old male prisoner has escaped from HMP Peterborough. We are supporting the police with their ongoing operation. We are investigating this incident."" Police have urged lorry drivers to be wary in case Urbonas attempts to hitch a ride with them. The Cambridge News quoted Detective Chief Inspector Mick Birchall warning that the man may be travelling to a port and attempting to escape to Lithuania. DCI Birchall said: ""It is likely he has left the area, but he could still be in Peterborough. ""I would ask lorry drivers picking up hitch-hikers to be aware that this gentleman is at large and if they see anything suspicious to phone us. ""He is somebody we want to capture very soon so we can put him back behind bars where he needs to be."" The report says that Urbonas escaped on Friday afternoon. The escape follows the publication of an inspectorate report which criticised safety standards at HMP Peterborough as ""not sufficiently good"".

2018-01-28,Jeremy Corbyn has doubled the number of new homes Labour would make available to rough sleepers on his first day as Prime Minister.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/corbyn-doubles-pledge-to-help-homeless-on-first-day-as-prime-minister-11226449,"He announced the pledge of acquiring 8,000 homes as part of a promise to end rough sleeping within at least five years. Labour committed to 4,000 in its manifesto at the 2017 general election but said it was doubling the figure because of soaring numbers of homeless people. Rough sleeping has more than doubled since the Conservatives first came to power in 2010, the latest statics from the Government show. The new policy would see deals struck with housing associations to make homes available as soon as they become vacant - rather than wait for new ones to be built. Announcing the plan, Mr Corbyn said the ""social priorities"" of housing deserved more attention. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""When you have in the middle of an area where there is a lot of housing stress, many people rough sleeping. ""You get some luxury, glistening block built, sold off-plan to long-distance overseas investors who may buy and sell it before it's even been built. ""Well let's hang on - let's look at the social priorities here."" Shadow housing secretary John Healey added that homelessness ""shames us all but should shame Conservative ministers most"". ""It is a direct consequence of decisions made by the Tories on housing and on funding for charities and councils,"" he said. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington responded that there were many reasons the number of rough sleepers had risen so sharply since 2010. He said: ""We have pledged to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminate it by 2027. ""We have backed new legislation which is enabling us, with local authorities, to address the reasons why people become homeless and sleep rough, so that we prevent it, rather than try to deal with the problem when it occurs."""
2018-01-28,"The second president of the United States John Adams once said: ""In politics, the middle way is no way at all"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-may-lose-lifeline-with-middle-way-brexit-11226406,"Mr Adams knew a thing or two about revolutions and knew that, in their midst, you have to pick a side. With Brexit, we've had our own revolt and it is the middle way which is leading Theresa May inexorably to the most perilous moment of her premiership. I was initially sceptical that such a threat existed. I still think the most likely outcome is that Mrs May survives and limps on. But, having talked to several Conservative MPs on both wings of the party today, I believe that there is an increasing possibility she will face a challenge. Part of the reason for that are Mrs May's own missteps. She has never - could never recover her authority after the catastrophe of the general election result. Her botched and limited reshuffle adverted to (rather than distracted from) her systemic weakness and resulted in her spending the limited capital she had accrued from December's successful EU negotiations. Worse, when Brexit is not discussed (as was largely the case in the first half of this week), Tory MPs become restless and darkly whisper that the PM has little in the way of domestic agenda and even less in the way of dynamism. They worry she is shrinking, not growing, into the job. One MP told me: ""Both I and the vast majority of Conservative MPs and ministers think she is hopeless."" But her biggest danger comes not from something she has done but instead because of something she has yet to do. With little more than a year to go until B-day and negotiations on the transition and final settlement looming, Mrs May must finally make a series of choices, many of which she has put off for so long. She must decide what sort of customs arrangement she wants. She must decide how closely Britain will remain aligned to the EU's regulatory regime. She must decide how long she wants the transition to be. A wrong step in any of these, much less all three, could provoke mutiny. But several Remainer MPs have told me that they are certain no new no-confidence letters have been signed by anyone on their side. That's not to say Remainer MPs are content with her. They're despairing. But they cling onto her for fear of getting something worse. One MP told me: ""It would be deeply irresponsible to have a three-month leadership contest at such a critical point in the Brexit negotiations- we run the risk of getting some ghastly Brexiteer like Jacob Rees-Mogg."" Given just how Eurosceptic the remaining Tory grassroots are, that isn't an unreasonable assumption. Naturally, the Brexiteers have no such fear. Rather, they're worried that Mrs May is reneging on the Brexit she promised them. For example, Theresa Villiers in the Sunday Telegraph warns that Britain risks staying in the EU ""in all but name"". These developments are crucial. Hitherto the arch-Brexiteers have been May's lifeline. In the wake of the election shambles they made the assessment that, however damaged as she might have been, she remained ""the best vehicle for delivering Brexit"", as one senior former Brexiteer cabinet minister told me a few weeks ago. If, through the detail of the negotiations, Mrs May appears likely to deliver a softer Brexit than they would like, that calculus would change and they would strike. Brexiteers have waited a long time to reach the promised land. If they fear the road there is running out they will not hesitate to try and remove a Prime Minister they don't much care for anyway. As one MP told me, the leadership plots are being orchestrated by ""hard Brexiteers who see their mad Brexit vision slipping away"". Mrs May was chosen to be Tory leader because she was offensive to neither side of the Brexit schism. Accordingly she is now about to try and chart a middle course. But as John Adams could have told her: ""This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it"". Brexit is not normal politics. It is almost religious. It is a matter of emotion, faith and belief (on both sides). The problem with religions is that their adherents are prone to visions, something the Prime Minister most certainly is not. Her middle way might seem sensible to outsiders but to Brexit's strongest adherents it will be heretical. And if the rumours are right, it doesn't need many more true believers to trigger the removal of this Pope. Worse for the Conservatives, there is a possible scenario which would leave them all worse off. Everyone talks as if a vote of no confidence would be the end of Mrs May. As John Adams never said: ""It ain't necessarily so"". Forty-eight MPs are needed to trigger a contest but Mrs May does not have to resign. She could fight on. If Remainers and the few loyalists she has band together, she might survive. She would stagger on, but weaker than before. So would everyone else. It would be Jeremy Corbyn who would emerge all the stronger and, as we know, he has a few revolutionary ideas of his own."
2018-01-28,Sixteen and 17-year-olds in Wales are to be given the right to vote in local council elections. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180129044420/https://news.sky.com/story/sixteen-and-17-year-olds-to-vote-in-wales-local-elections-11225459,"The idea is aimed at boosting participation following concerns that young people are becoming disengaged from the political process. At a youth group in Cardiff there were mixed reactions to the plan, which is due to be formerly announced on Tuesday. Politics student Thomas Greenfield, 17, said: ""Education is something that we are not usually able to impact despite it being, for most young people, the main part of their life. ""To be able to impact it now, even on a local level... it's only a good thing."" But Tom Cove, 16, disagrees. He doesn't think 16-year-olds should be able to vote. He said: ""People are just not mature enough, I don't think. They're in the stage of life where they're still deciding things, personal things. So I don't think they're ready."" Younger voters were widely considered to have influenced the shock result of last year's snap election. On the campaign trail, Jeremy Corbyn did his best to woo youngsters, taking selfies and using social media. He even gave a speech at Glastonbury Festival. Similarly in 2015 so-called ""Milifans"" tried to bolster support for the then Labour Leader, Ed Miliband, on Twitter, by superimposing his head onto all sorts of action heroes, such as James Bond. In Scotland 16-year-olds are already allowed to vote in all elections and with the Welsh government now following suit, many feel the law should be changed across the UK. Shadow voter engagement minister Cat Smith said: ""The Welsh Labour Government is leading the way by giving 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote in local elections in Wales. ""However, we are now in an inconsistent and unsustainable position where a 16-year-old living in Wales and Scotland can vote in local elections, yet they are denied the right to vote in UK general elections. ""The time has now come for the UK Government to extend the franchise to all 16 and 17-year-olds, and ensure equal voting rights across the United Kingdom."" The subject has been debated in the House of Commons in the past, but there are no plans for any changes in the near future. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""The age of 18, not 16, is widely recognised as the age at which one becomes an adult. ""Full citizenship rights - from drinking, to betting, to voting - are gained at adulthood. The Government has no plans to lower the voting age."""

The fines and sanctions come as the government implements the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive, which would cover events such as the WannaCry attack which crippled the NHS last year. Making organisations pay up for failing to meet cybersecurity standards would only be a ""last resort"" according to the Government, which wants to see a voluntary uptake of the new rules before they come into effect on 10 May. Margot James, the minister for digital, said: ""Today we are setting out new and robust cybersecurity measures to help ensure the UK is the safest place in the world to live and be online. ""We want our essential services and infrastructure to be primed and ready to tackle cyberattacks and be resilient against major disruption to services."" The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has also published detailed guidance on the security measures which will help organisations comply. NCSC's chief executive, Ciaran Martin, said: ""Network and information systems give critical support to everyday activities, so it is absolutely vital that they are as secure as possible."" Jens Monrad, the principal threat analyst at cybersecurity firm FireEye, told Sky News: ""With so many nations, including the UK, relying on digitalisation, a foreign nation would likely attempt to cause disruption by targeting critical national infrastructure. ""This could be systems, which the UK government and citizens rely on, like healthcare systems, water supply and electricity.""We have seen examples of these disruption attacks carried out in Ukraine in December 2015 and 2016. ""These attacks caused a power outage for many Ukrainian citizens and created confusion and disruption within the customer service teams of energy providers, who were 'bombarded' with phone calls from upset customers."" ""The UK and US governments recently attributed the 'WannaCry' malware incident to North Korea, which caused a degree of disruption to the NHS,"" added Mr Monrad. ""This serves as an example of how malicious code can disrupt national dependent systems. A more targeted attack against such infrastructure might have had a more severe outcome."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has warned recently that Russia could launch a cyberattack targeting the UK's critical energy infrastructure."

If their hotel is part of the scheme, holidaymakers will be sent a map and a pool plan six days ahead of their stay - listing available sunbeds and their prices. The plan shows when each spot enjoys sun and shade throughout the day, and lists which areas are quieter or child friendly.  With the morning dash to grab a spot by the pool becoming a much-mocked holiday stereotype, Thomas Cook hopes the scheme will allow families to spend more quality time together while they are away.  Three out of four working parents told the package company they ""lack quality time with their children"" during a normal week. The company's poll of 1,500 working parents also found that half of all those surveyed are prioritising holiday spending above everything else this year. Not all sunbeds will be bookable under the scheme, which will still leave a proportion of loungers up for grabs on a first-come-first-served basis. Choose Your Favourite Sunbed scheme is being trialled in three hotels from the end of next month, and will be available in 30 hotels this summer."

Her family say the Spanish investigating authorities have discarded a potentially critical piece of evidence. Kirsty's husband Adam said: ""It's very sad and shocking for us as a family - this is another thing that we've been let down by. ""For them to treat Kirsty's death in this way... we cannot accept it."" He went on: ""We're really upset and disappointed that they've not respected Kirsty - first and foremost - us as a family, and have not carried out this investigation as we would all expect."" Kirsty had been on a hen party with friends when she left her room in the Apartamentos Payma early on 29 April, 2017. Her family believe she was looking for her friends on the floor above but was disorientated and ended up in a room occupied by five men from Nottingham. They believe that events inside the room led Kirsty to try to escape and, in the course of doing so, fall to her death. Her family say efforts by the Spanish authorities to piece together Kirsty's final moments have been ""negligent and reckless"" and they have enlisted the help of former detective David Swindle. Now an independent case reviewer, Mr Swindle told a news conference: ""The clothing worn by Kirsty was not tested for DNA and was destroyed by the Spanish forensic pathology department. ""That, in itself, indicates serious shortcomings in the investigation into Kirsty's death."" He added: ""We have to ask, how many more processes were not done to examine what happened to Kirsty? ""It's shocking that there has been irretrievable loss of evidence, and also, the lack in empathy towards Kirsty's family. ""From my experience as a senior investigating officer... this is the most important part of an investigation - starting with the victim and what the victim was wearing. ""There could have been DNA on that clothing. They didn't even test that clothing for DNA."" The five British men were placed under formal investigation by the Spanish authorities, although all have been allowed to return to the UK."
2018-01-29,A diplomatic row has broken out between Britain and the EU over the rule of law and when the final Brexit deal needs to be reached.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180130050347/https://news.sky.com/story/eu-takes-two-minutes-to-adopt-negotiating-guidelines-for-transition-11227785,"In a clear message to Theresa May and the UK's Brexit negotiators, it took just two minutes for European ministers to agree their negotiating stance. They insisted that Britain should be able to stay in the single market and enjoy the economic benefits of EU membership during the transition period. But the pay-off is that Britain must obey all EU laws, including any new ones, during this time - even after the UK has been removed from decision-making bodies. ""The single market cannot be a la carte,"" said EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. :: MPs circle May, increasing speculation of a leadership challenge And the stance would mean Britain sticking to EU laws for at least 20 months after the expected official Brexit date. On the first official day of transition talks in 2018, Mr Barnier went on to say that negotiations should conclude by October to allow time for EU27 countries and the European Parliament to vote on decisions. But during a grilling from the House of Lords, the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to hold out for longer to ensure demands on the future relationship are met. Mr Davis said he expected Britain's stance on a final deal would ""push it a bit later"". ""We won't want to sign the withdrawal agreement until we've got the substance of the future relationship ironed out as well,"" he said. ""The last quarter of the year is about where we're aiming at."" Mr Barnier appeared to come back with a rebuke for the Brexit Secretary's suggestion that it was only an ""aim"" to conclude talks by the end of this year. Speaking in Brussels, the EU official said: ""This is a major historic agreement and will take time in the British Parliament. We are working towards the end of October."" Their statement offered the UK a ""status quo transition without institutional representation"" from March 2019 until the end of 2020. The Government has already indicated it is willing to comply with most of the EU's demands to move talks on to the future relationship between London and Brussels. Mr Davis conceded in his questioning from the Lords EU committee that ""it's not exactly the same as membership, but it's very, very similar"". But the comments prompted near-civil war in the Conservative party to break out into Parliament. MP Anna Soubry called on the Government to ""stand up against the hard Brexiteers, who mainly inhabit these benches"" and ""see them off"" - claiming there are ""only 35 of them"". There are 48 Tory MPs needed to call a leadership contest to replace Theresa May. Meanwhile, some Leave figures in her own party claimed it will be ""Brexit in name only"" that is delivered. :: Minister sacked by May calls on critics to back Prime Minister Downing Street waded in to try and avert a crisis, highlighting the ""differences"" between the UK and the EU on the transition period. The Prime Minister's spokesman said on Monday: ""I think there is broad agreement on the principle of an implementation period being in the interests of both sides, but on the specific detail you would expect there to be some differences. ""That is obviously what will be negotiated."" As Mrs May met her Brexit ""inner circle"" in London, Downing Street refused to comment on claims that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had told reporters that whenever she asks Mrs May what she is seeking, the Prime Minister answers: ""Make me an offer."""

A Charity Commission investigation has found a series of failings, including a failure to account for ""at least £92,110"" of the organisation's total expenditure. Ms Booth, the daughter of late actor Tony Booth and half-sister of Cherie Blair, says the report is ""incorrect"" and that ""completed accounting was provided"". The report states that about £40,000 of charity funds had been withdrawn at cash machines and by cashing cheques, with no paperwork provided to back up its use. Charity money had also been spent on valet parking, first-class travel and accommodation in both the UK and abroad, it said. One expenditure listed was £1,219 to furnish an ""office bedroom"", but the image provided to the commission was of a bedroom in the Hilton Hotel in Istanbul, the investigation found. Ms Booth, 50, has been removed from her position as trustee due to ""misconduct and/or mismanagement"", and banned from acting as a trustee to any other charity unless she obtains a waiver from the commission or the courts. Chief executive Sohale Ahmed, 53 - Ms Booth's husband - has been disqualified from his position, and will be barred from acting as a trustee of a charity or holding a senior management charity position for four-and-a-half years. Financial records showed he had received self-authorised salary payments totalling £46,500, the report said. Ms Booth told Sky News she resigned as a trustee from Peacetrail in 2014, after which she says she had no further involvement. However, in its report, the commission said the charity had not accepted her resignation and she was still a trustee at the time of their investigation. Ms Booth said this was a ""technicality"". During her time as a trustee, Ms Booth said she supported ""numerous projects for the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip"". She said the work provided ""over £100,000 in donations"" which was put towards ""support in health, housing and education for some of the most needy families in the region"". Ms Booth said bank statements, photos and film footage were provided by the charity to account for its expenditure, and that she was ""disappointed"" with the Charity Commission's findings. One further trustee - Nadeem Ahmed - has also been removed from his position by the commission. Charity Commission director Michelle Russell said the trustees - whose job it is to ""to steward and safeguard"" charitable funds - had ""clearly failed to discharge their legal duties which is why we exercised our powers to remove them"". Peacetrail was removed from the charity register on 31 October 2017, and subsequently dissolved."

Amazon's announcement came as a report by the Centre for Cities warned the North and the Midlands were most at risk of losing jobs to automation and globalisation. The think tank calculated that one in five jobs in British cities was likely to be displaced by 2030 as technology evolved. Earlier this month, Ocado showed off the ""C-3PO"" robots being introduced across its own warehouses as it seeks to reduce its reliance on human workers. Amazon currently operates a network of 16 UK fulfilment centres - sprawling warehouses that handle orders on behalf of customers and within its marketplace. They have attracted criticism in the past amid allegations of tough working conditions, including exhausting performance targets for those arranging items for delivery. Amazon, which has rejected any suggestion of poor practice, said the work on offer in Rugby was attractive. Its director of UK customer fulfilment, Stefano Perego, said: ""We are delighted to expand our operations in the Midlands where we already have a dedicated workforce of more than 2,500 people at fulfilment centres in Rugeley, Coalville and Daventry. ""We are thrilled to begin recruitment for 400 new permanent roles in Rugby with competitive wages and comprehensive benefits starting on day one."" Amazon said of its pay package: ""The pay rate for permanent Amazon employees increases over their first two years of employment, when all employees earn £8.35 an hour and above. ""All permanent Amazon fulfilment centre employees are given stock grants, which over the last five years were on average equal to £1,000 or more per year per person. ""Employees are offered a comprehensive benefits package, including private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection, subsidised meals and an employee discount, which combined are worth more than £700 annually, as well as a company pension plan."" Amazon is already exploring ways that minimise human labour. For example, its Amazon Go store concept - recently opened in Seattle - involves no checkouts with all goods bought via an app. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) responded to the Centre for Cities report by saying its own data showed the tide was turning against retail jobs in the UK. Its chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: ""This new report points to the growing impact of automation on the retail industry. ""The BRC's latest employment data, which reported a net reduction in jobs, echoes this trend and reflects the pressures felt from the diverging costs of labour versus technology and the subsequent boost of investment in the latter. ""The report also rightly acknowledges the disproportionate impact on economically deprived and vulnerable communities, which is compounded by the burden of property taxation also hitting these areas hardest. ""The cost of this can be seen in more empty shops on the high street."""

Detectives are appealing for help in catching the suspect they say has traumatised victims during a string of burglaries at luxury homes across southeast England. They believe he might be a former soldier or policeman and could seriously injure or kill his next victim. Mrs Morris said: ""I just heard this very loud voice behind me shout ‘I want the jewellery. Show me the safe,’ and he came towards me with a shotgun."" She was terrified as the powerfully-built man, wearing a balaclava and gloves, grabbed her arm and forced her upstairs. ""He was gripping me hard all the time, everywhere including my breasts. We got to the dressing room and I opened the safe. ""I gave him the jewellery, but he said he wanted more. He was angry and hitting me all over the place, just hard enough to hurt a lot without knocking me out."" Mrs Morris suffered a broken jaw and lost a tooth during the attack which left her heavily bruised. ""He got me to touch the shotgun to show me it was real and not plastic. Then he told me to lie down and that’s when I thought he was going to rape me. ""He dragged me across the floor by my hair and then things got even worse. He pointed the shotgun at my head and I really thought ‘This is it. He’s going to kill me’."" Her husband Stephen, a businessman, arrived back shortly after the gunman fled their home in Kingswood, Surrey. The suspect is thought to have stolen more than a million pounds worth of jewellery, watches and cash from wealthy victims since 2014. Among his victims were the Earl and Countess of March, attacked, robbed and tied up at their historic Goodwood Home in the Sussex Downs. Their stolen heirlooms included a £400,000 tiara and an emerald ring that King Charles II gave to his mistress. Detectives believe the burglar stakes out his target homes for days before seizing an opportunity to get in through an unlocked door. His planning, calmness, use of violence and ability to escape leaving few clues, suggests he could be a former serviceman or police officer. Detective Inspector Dee Fielding, of Surrey Police, said: ""There must be a member of the public out there who will know somebody who could fit this profile - someone who is confident enough, who has special skills, potentially ex-military or law enforcement, someone able to use violence on their own to tie up a number of people while committing offences. ""We are worried the violence could escalate and a victim could get really badly hurt or worse."" The man is described as white, six-feet tall, stocky and muscular and he speaks with a Southern English accent. He is suspected of two burglaries in Kingswood, and others in Maidenhead, Chichester, Sevenoaks, Maidstone and Virginia Water, the last in October last year. Anyone with information is urged to call 101 and ask for Surrey Police, Operation Prometheus, or email OpPrometheus@surrey.pnn.police.uk.

It finds that the country will be worse off under every scenario modelled, with the much-hailed benefits of new trade deals predicted to add just 0.3% to GDP in the long-term. And The Times is reporting that some senior Tory party donors want her to quit. While Liam Fox has told hardline Tory Leavers they will have to ""live with disappointment"" and accept a softer Brexit. The International Trade Secretary hit out at those badmouthing the Prime Minister, saying they would have to ""live with disappointment"" of a Brexit by consent of MPs because of the ""parliamentary arithmetic"". The pressure mounts as Theresa May prepares to fly to China - taking her away from the political pressures at home but also stifling her ability to control them. Despite the growing anger at her leadership, The Times quoted a senior Conservative MP as saying: ""There is no one defending her but no plot to oust her. It's the worst of all worlds."" :: MPs circle May, increasing speculation of a leadership challenge The impact assessments obtained by BuzzFeed News - titled EU Exit Analysis - Cross Whitehall Briefing - claimed UK growth would be 8% less over 15 years if it leaves the bloc without a deal. Even the softest Brexit option - remaining in the single market - would see growth decline by 2% over the same period, it found. And the recouped gains of new trade deals struck with the US, and other major economies such as China, India, Gulf countries and those in southeast Asia would make up just 10% of the losses in growth. Sky News understands it is a legitimate document, but still a draft. A Government spokesman refused to be drawn on the contents of the leaked file. They said: ""We have already set out that the Government is undertaking a wide range of ongoing analysis in support of our EU exit negotiations and preparations. ""We have been clear that we are not prepared to provide a running commentary on any aspect of this ongoing internal work and that ministers have a duty not to publish anything that could risk exposing our negotiation position."" Ministers were understood to be receiving information from the newly-drawn up assessment this week. Some claimed that ardent Brexiteers were out in force to discredit Chancellor Philip Hammond - who campaigned for Remain and said Brexit would only mean a ""very modest"" change in EU-UK relations - so that the analysis would be viewed with similar disdain. But ministers have been notoriously careful about releasing assessments on the economic impacts of Brexit. A long-running row over publishing documents believed to exist on 58 sectors blew up when Brexit Secretary David Davis revealed they were only ""sectoral analyses"". It came after the EU took just two minutes to adopt its negotiating position on the Brexit transition period. Meanwhile in Westminster, Conservative MPs aimed barbs at each other in a fight over the Government's perceived progress. Former business minister Anna Soubry said ministers should ""stand up against the hard Brexiteers, who mainly inhabit these benches"" and ""see them off"". But she was rebuked by other backbenchers who claimed the Government was delivering BINO - ""Brexit in name only""."

A controversial tweet from his account in 2011 read: ""Relax I'm back chilled - just battered the wife!!! Feel better now!"" Neville told Sky News: ""It was that wording that disappointed me more than any of them because it obviously relates to domestic violence. ""That tweet wasn't sent out as a joke to domestic violence. It was in a period when I was on holiday with my wife. ""It relates to something I was doing with my wife in terms of a sporting, competitive nature. ""But it's not right, the wording of the tweet was not right and I'm disappointed I used that terminology."" In 2012 he wrote: ""Morning men couple of hours cricket be4 work sets me up nicely for the day."" Another from December 2012 read: ""U women of [sic] always wanted equality until it comes to paying the bills #hypocrites."" The 41-year-old sportsman deleted the posts last week and took down his Twitter account as criticism grew. On Monday, Neville said the words he used in 2011-2012 were ""not good"" back then and ""are not right now"". He added: ""People who know me know it is not a true reflection of my character. ""I had to apologise, I didn't like the words used. I'm not a sexist. I've lived my life right."" Shortly before the furore began Neville had told his 1.6 million followers he was ""extremely proud and honoured"" to be joining the Lionesses. But there has also been criticism that he got the job without any experience in the women's game or as a head coach. It is his first managerial role, having previously worked as a coach at Manchester United and Valencia and with the England men's Under-21 setup. The job advert had called for ""an outstanding football coach with a track record of consistent and successful management"". Some have suggested his appointment has denied women an opportunity. Neville insisted he has coached extensively at a high level. He said: ""I'm qualified for the job, I have a (coaching) Pro Licence. It's to work in all aspects of football. I've worked abroad. I'm best qualified for this job."""

In his written ruling, Mr Justice MacDonald said: ""Examining Isaiah's best interests from a broad perspective... I am satisfied that it is not in his best interests for life-sustaining medical treatment to be continued. ""That, with profound sadness, is my judgment."" The judge's decision comes after the baby's parents, mother Takesha Thomas and father Lanre Haastrup, went to court to fight for their son's treatment to continue. Following the ruling, Mr Haastrup said: ""We will be speaking to the lawyers to see what they say. Of course, one is disappointed."" Mr Justice MacDonald announced his decision on Monday in Birmingham after analysing evidence at a trial in the Family Division of the High Court in London earlier this month. Barrister Fiona Paterson, who has represented King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, told the judge during the trial how Isaiah was born severely disabled. Doctors told the judge that he had suffered ""catastrophic"" brain damage due to being deprived of oxygen at birth. Ms Paterson said nobody could understand the pain and suffering Isaiah's parents had endured, but she said overwhelming medical evidence showed stopping treatment was in Isaiah's best interests. Isaiah is in a low level of consciousness, cannot move or breathe independently and is connected to a ventilator. Doctors also say Isaiah does not respond to stimulation. But his mother told the judge: ""When I speak to him he will respond, slowly, by opening one eye. ""I see a child who is injured. He needs love. He needs care. I have it. I can give it. To say it is so poor, it is not worth living, that is not right. It is not their decision to make."" The baby's father fought back tears at the trial as he outlined a series of complaints about the hospital to the judge. Mr Haastrup said the trust had ""harmed"" Isaiah at birth, told the judge that a ""negligence case"" was under way and complained about the way he had been treated. ""There have been failings,"" he said. ""But for them Isaiah would be at home having a lovely meal with me, with his lovely mum, playing around. He said everything was ""about full control"" for hospital bosses and accused doctors of not taking account of his views or those of Ms Thomas. Ms Thomas told the trial that when she picks her son up for cuddles and sings to him, he falls asleep in her arms. She described how she had seen him move his head, his thumb and open his eyes. ""One of the things I live by is that if you give a child love it will thrive,"" she said. In his statement, the judge said: ""The court cannot imagine the emotional pain that the conclusion of the court will cause to the parents. ""It is my hope that, in due course, the parents will be able to derive some small measure of comfort from the knowledge that they have done all they can for their much-loved and cherished son."" A spokeswoman for King's College said: ""This has been an extremely difficult time for Isaiah's parents and all those involved in his care. ""The court's decision to transfer Isaiah to palliative care is in his best interests and based on overwhelming expert evidence. ""Our priority now is to provide Isaiah with the medical care he needs, working closely with and supporting his parents."""

And adults one the same way will see the cost jump from £72.50 to £85 - a 17% increase. But passports requested online will only rise by £3 - the rate of inflation. That will see children's passports climb to £49 and £75.50 for adults. The measures were suggested by Government ministers to encourage people to apply online instead. They will have to be approved in a vote by MPs in Parliament before coming into force. Home Office minister Caroline Nokes said the crackdown was to heap the cost of processing more-expensive postal requests onto applicants, rather than taxpayers. :: Opinion: A passport is about national identity She announced: ""Our priority is to ensure that UK travellers have a secure, effective, and efficient service from the point of application to the time they pass through the UK border and it is only right that we should look at this whole process when setting our fees. ""These proposals will ensure that those people who don't travel abroad are not footing the bill for those who do."" The Home Office said the proposals are not related to the reintroduction of blue passports after Brexit, which will not bear a further cost."

""The good news is nobody goes home empty-handed because all night we'll be handing out consolation puppies. ""So if you didn’t get a Grammy, you get a puppy."" Jerry Seinfeld, Sarah Silverman and Jim Gaffigan were then handed the dogs after losing out to Dave Chappelle for the award. :: Hillary Clinton's Fire And Fury skit at Grammys The stunt prompted criticism from the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and charities Peta and the Animal Welfare Foundation, which said it promoted the ""wrong message"". John Fishwick, president of the BVA, told Sky News: ""We live in a click-and-collect culture that encourages impulse buying and even if the puppies were handed back, the Grammys' stunt perpetuates this notion. ""Puppies are living beings, not trophies or toys. ""Dog ownership is a life-changing commitment, not something that should simply be done on a whim."" PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) founder Ingrid Newkirk told Sky News: ""It's beyond belief that Grammy organisers are so out of touch with the issues of the day that they failed to grasp what is now commonly understood; that dogs are intelligent, complex animals - not toys, props, or prizes. ""While the stress of being passed around under bright lights by strangers may have been upsetting for these young pups, using them as prizes for runners-up sent a dangerous message to viewers that dogs aren't the family members for life that they should be."" The Animal Welfare Foundation said: ""Shame on the #GRAMMYS and @JKCorden for handing out puppies as if they were nothing more than inanimate objects."" A spokeswoman for the Animal Welfare Foundation told Sky News: ""We've been working with the British Veterinary Association to try to educate people about how to buy pets responsibly. ""When you take on a pet, you need to be aware it’s a big responsibility. This gives out completely the wrong message. ""It’s also not the right environment for animals.""

The ""substantial"" evidence given by the 46-year-old is to be used in the prosecution of one other individual. However, most of those named in his police interviews will not face prosecution due to concerns over a lack of supporting evidence. The judge at Belfast Crown Court said the case was of ""exceptional gravity"" and said Haggarty's willingness to cooperate was motivated by self-interest - despite the threat of torture and execution if caught. Justice Adrian Colton said: ""The fact he was involved directly in multiple terrorist murders must be an aggravating factor. ""He has been involved in a terrorist campaign over a 16-year period, that campaign has resulted in deaths for which he was directly responsible. ""The organisation he supported and assisted has resulted in untold damage to individual lives and society as a whole."" His 35-year sentence was reduced by 75% because he assisted prosecutors and by a further 25% for his guilty plea. He is also entitled to credit for the time already spent on remand - 1,186 days - awaiting to be sentenced. Among those the defendant admitted murdering was Sean McParland, who was shot dead so Haggarty could protect his position as an informer. Catholic workmen Gary Convie and Eamon Fox were shot dead as they ate lunch in their van. Haggarty obtained weapons for the killings and accompanied a gunman to the scene. Mr Fox's son Kieran said: ""You hear 35 years for this murder and 20 for this, you are thinking there is a possibility this guy could do some time. ""If you break it on down, he is a free man, he walks free, unreal."" Builder Sean McDermott was abducted by a UVF gang and killed. Haggarty, who was involved with the group between 1991 and 2007, admitted providing the weapon in the shooting. He also admitted to the murder of John Harbinson, who was beaten to death with a hammer. As well as the murders, he admitted to five attempted murders, including against police officers, 23 counts of conspiracy to murder, directing terrorism and membership of a proscribed organisation."
2018-01-29,MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate are becoming increasingly vocal in their criticism of Theresa May - boosting speculation she will be subject to a leadership challenge.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180130050347/https://news.sky.com/story/window-is-closing-for-may-to-improve-tories-fortunes-backbencher-says-11227743,"Leading backbencher Johnny Mercer said the ""window is closing"" for the Prime Minister to reinvigorate the Conservatives' fortunes. At the weekend, the MP for Plymouth Moor View said Jeremy Corbyn could become Prime Minister unless the Tories ""get our s*** together"". Another prominent Tory, Mrs May's former joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, has warned that a lack of ""purpose and direction"" is responsible for the current malaise infecting the party. Speaking at a Resolution Foundation event about the future of the Tories alongside Mr Mercer, Mr Timothy called for a shift in fiscal policy - telling an audience that the NHS needs a cash injection. Charles Walker, vice chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee, was forced to play down talk of a leadership challenge amid the row over Mrs May's approach to Brexit. And Sir Nicholas Soames - who last week warned that Mrs May's agenda was ""dull, dull, dull"" - issued a more nuanced message on Monday morning when he called on the Tories to ""recover self-confidence"" and ""restore sense of direction"". When asked about his comments at the Resolution Foundation event, Mr Mercer said: ""How long has the Prime Minister got? I am of the view that any sort of change of leadership is not helpful at the moment and I don't support that. ""But, I do think the window is closing, because politics can be quite a brutal game. ""At the moment I do feel we are slightly struggling with a message and with a vision."" He added: ""Yes, we are in danger of Jeremy Corbyn becoming Prime Minister."" Mr Timothy, who resigned in the wake of Mrs May's election gamble backfiring, said: ""It feels increasingly clear that the country is tired of austerity, and that public services are starting to feel the strain a little bit. ""It's clear that while the NHS needs reform it also needs more money."" Mr Timothy also said the Tories need to have a wider internal debate about the party's future purpose. He said: ""I think the party needs to set up processes that will enable it to debate its future purpose and policies because if that is left until 2020/21, that is going to feel too late in the electoral cycle."" When asked when he had last had contact with the PM, Mr Timothy said he had not ""seen"" Mrs May since he quit. The PM's official spokesman declined to tell journalists whether Mrs May had met or been in phone or email contact with Mr Timothy since June's election."

The latest three bodies were found dismembered at the bottom of large planters in gardens that McArthur, a 66-year-old landscape gardener, had worked on. Further remains were found but police are waiting on DNA tests to see if they are from the five men or from yet more victims.

Preliminary reports suggest he died from inhaling liquid oxygen. It is thought the cylinder was damaged after hitting the machine. Mr Maru, who had been visiting a relative on Saturday night, was asked to carry the cylinder by a junior member of staff who assured him the scanner was switched off, his uncle claimed. ""We are shocked and devastated,"" Jitendra Maru said. ""The ward boy who was supposed to prevent such incidents told my family members to go inside when the machine was turned on."" Metallic objects must not be carried into rooms containing MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners because they use a powerful magnetic field to produce images of the body's organs. Mumbai police spokesman Deepak Deoraj said a doctor and a junior member of staff had been arrested ""under section 304 of the Indian penal code for causing death due to negligence"". Dean of the hospital, Ramesh Bharmal, said an investigation to determine exact cause of death was underway, adding that CCTV footage had been handed to police. Mr Maru's family will receive 500,000 rupees (£5,580) in compensation from the state government of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital. It is not the first time that MRI scanners have caused death and injury. Two hospital workers were injured after getting pinned between an MRI machine and a metal oxygen tank for four hours at a hospital in New Delhi in 2014. And in 2001, a six-year-old boy who was having an MRI scan in New York was killed when a metal oxygen tank flew towards the machine and crushed his skull."
2018-01-29,"The second president of the United States John Adams once said: ""In politics, the middle way is no way at all"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180130050347/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-may-lose-lifeline-with-middle-way-brexit-11226406,"Mr Adams knew a thing or two about revolutions and knew that, in their midst, you have to pick a side. With Brexit, we've had our own revolt and it is the middle way which is leading Theresa May inexorably to the most perilous moment of her premiership. I was initially sceptical that such a threat existed. I still think the most likely outcome is that Mrs May survives and limps on. But, having talked to several Conservative MPs on both wings of the party today, I believe that there is an increasing possibility she will face a challenge. Part of the reason for that are Mrs May's own missteps. She has never - could never recover her authority after the catastrophe of the general election result. Her botched and limited reshuffle adverted to (rather than distracted from) her systemic weakness and resulted in her spending the limited capital she had accrued from December's successful EU negotiations. Worse, when Brexit is not discussed (as was largely the case in the first half of this week), Tory MPs become restless and darkly whisper that the PM has little in the way of domestic agenda and even less in the way of dynamism. They worry she is shrinking, not growing, into the job. One MP told me: ""Both I and the vast majority of Conservative MPs and ministers think she is hopeless."" But her biggest danger comes not from something she has done but instead because of something she has yet to do. With little more than a year to go until B-day and negotiations on the transition and final settlement looming, Mrs May must finally make a series of choices, many of which she has put off for so long. She must decide what sort of customs arrangement she wants. She must decide how closely Britain will remain aligned to the EU's regulatory regime. She must decide how long she wants the transition to be. A wrong step in any of these, much less all three, could provoke mutiny. But several Remainer MPs have told me that they are certain no new no-confidence letters have been signed by anyone on their side. That's not to say Remainer MPs are content with her. They're despairing. But they cling onto her for fear of getting something worse. One MP told me: ""It would be deeply irresponsible to have a three-month leadership contest at such a critical point in the Brexit negotiations- we run the risk of getting some ghastly Brexiteer like Jacob Rees-Mogg."" Given just how Eurosceptic the remaining Tory grassroots are, that isn't an unreasonable assumption. Naturally, the Brexiteers have no such fear. Rather, they're worried that Mrs May is reneging on the Brexit she promised them. For example, Theresa Villiers in the Sunday Telegraph warns that Britain risks staying in the EU ""in all but name"". These developments are crucial. Hitherto the arch-Brexiteers have been May's lifeline. In the wake of the election shambles they made the assessment that, however damaged as she might have been, she remained ""the best vehicle for delivering Brexit"", as one senior former Brexiteer cabinet minister told me a few weeks ago. If, through the detail of the negotiations, Mrs May appears likely to deliver a softer Brexit than they would like, that calculus would change and they would strike. Brexiteers have waited a long time to reach the promised land. If they fear the road there is running out they will not hesitate to try and remove a Prime Minister they don't much care for anyway. As one MP told me, the leadership plots are being orchestrated by ""hard Brexiteers who see their mad Brexit vision slipping away"". Mrs May was chosen to be Tory leader because she was offensive to neither side of the Brexit schism. Accordingly she is now about to try and chart a middle course. But as John Adams could have told her: ""This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it"". Brexit is not normal politics. It is almost religious. It is a matter of emotion, faith and belief (on both sides). The problem with religions is that their adherents are prone to visions, something the Prime Minister most certainly is not. Her middle way might seem sensible to outsiders but to Brexit's strongest adherents it will be heretical. And if the rumours are right, it doesn't need many more true believers to trigger the removal of this Pope. Worse for the Conservatives, there is a possible scenario which would leave them all worse off. Everyone talks as if a vote of no confidence would be the end of Mrs May. As John Adams never said: ""It ain't necessarily so"". Forty-eight MPs are needed to trigger a contest but Mrs May does not have to resign. She could fight on. If Remainers and the few loyalists she has band together, she might survive. She would stagger on, but weaker than before. So would everyone else. It would be Jeremy Corbyn who would emerge all the stronger and, as we know, he has a few revolutionary ideas of his own."
2018-01-29,"Some BBC managers have issued ""veiled threats"" against women at the BBC who have raised the subject of equal pay.

It says: ""While individual BBC managers have been supportive there is still a bunker mentality in some quarters and women have experienced veiled threats made against them when they raised the subject of equal pay. ""It is interesting to note that following the transparency in the pay of managers earning above £150,000 the incoming female head of news is being paid the same salary as her male predecessor. ""This transparency is now needed across the board."" The report comes as the BBC proposes a cap on pay for news presenters. The top rate of £320,000 would mean substantial cuts for some of the best-known talent. The cap has yet to be fully agreed and would only apply to full time on-air staff. The issue of pay equality came to light last year following the publication of the pay of people earning more than £150,000. The DCMS committee has said the corporation has a ""deeper cultural problem"" with gender pay than the list revealed. Damian Collins, chairman of the Committee, said: ""The Equality Act 2010 states that men and women must be paid the same for doing the same work, like work and work of equal value. ""Yet the evidence we are publishing today highlights many cases where the BBC has failed to meet these requirements."" One case cited by the DMCS committee is that of Scotland health correspondent Eleanor Bradford. She claimed she left the BBC after nearly 15 years because she was being paid around £10,000 less than male colleagues in similar roles. The National Union of Journalists has begun grievance procedures with the broadcaster relating to 120 cases. The BBC women report says matters could be put right by "" admitting the problem, apologising and setting in place an equal, fair and transparent pay structure. ""The BBC should avoid wasting licence fee money on an unwinnable court fight against their female workers over equal pay and immediately agree to independent arbitration to settle individual cases, including back pay and pension adjustments."" The DCMS committee is due to question the BBC's director-general Lord Hall on Wednesday. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We look forward to an informed debate at the select committee based on all the facts. ""The BBC is committed to equal pay and we don't accept the assertion we have not been complying with the Equality Act, nor do we offer inferior contracts based on someone's gender or race."""

This comes after a series of meetings with an all-party parliamentary group set up by Owen Smith MP which looked into the safety of mesh devices. NHS England estimates that more than 100,000 women have had vaginal mesh surgery to treat urinary incontinence, most often caused by childbirth. The official complication rate for vaginal mesh surgery is between 1-3% but recent studies have shown it to be anything between 10-15%. The announcement of an audit comes a few months after Australia and New Zealand banned the use of its mesh products for some pelvic surgery. Chair of the APPG on Surgical Mesh Implants, Owen Smith MP, said: ""Over the last two years I've been urging ministers to conduct an investigation to fully determine problems related to mesh surgery. ""I'm delighted that the Government has listened to my concerns and has now agreed to undertake this audit to get a better understanding of complications related to mesh surgery. I hope the audit will provide crucial answers about the proportion of women adversely affected."" :: I was a wreck after vaginal mesh implant Dr Sohier Elneil is a specialist in mesh removal and sat on the board of the UK health watchdog NICE for 10 years, advising on its use. She described the audit as a major step forward. She said: ""I'm absolutely over the moon about it because this is the one thing we were looking for - this was not about us pursuing anybody or pursuing any agency, it was about us getting to the truth and knowing what the problem was and how much of a problem it was. :: Vaginal mesh campaigner Chrissy Brajcic dies from sepsis ""I think the complication rate is a minimum of 10%, I suspect it is much closer to 20-25% of all implants that have had a negative effect on women's lives. ""After the results of the audit we also need to make plans, on how to rectify the situation and how to start helping women. Not just on a one-on-one scale but on a global scale and that may impact, and should impact, on what actual product is available and when it could or should be used. ""So we need to revise the whole issue of insertions of tapes, meshes or prosthetic materials - it depends on what everybody calls them. But it's still the polypropylene product."" Julie Gilsenan, a paramedic from Liverpool, had vaginal mesh surgery last year to treat her mild incontinence brought on after childbirth. She decided to have her mesh removed after it caused her chronic pain and she was barely able to walk. It is a highly dangerous procedure because mesh is designed to be permanent. She said: ""It absolutely ruined my life. I'm in a worse position now - I had mild stress incontinence and that's why I had the TVT operation performed in February. And I'm now more incontinent than I was before I had the surgery. So I'm facing the prospect of further surgery to try and correct that. ""That's just hideous to think that I've spent 12 months, being in pain and agony for 12 months, I had to take all kinds of painkillers, couldn't do my job. And I've had two operations and I'm now in a worse position than I was before I had that initial surgery. ""Would you take that risk if someone said that to you? There's absolutely no way. It's playing with people's lives and I just cannot believe that they still do this."" The results of the audit are expected to be announced in April after data is collected and analysed on patients' conditions and the type of surgery and subsequent hospital admissions. The latest guidelines from the UK health regulator, the MHRA, is that vaginal mesh is an effective treatment for the majority of women and there is no evidence to suggest the device is inherently unsafe. The news comes ahead of the latest APPG meeting on Tuesday in Parliament, where MPs from all political parties will meet with clinicians to discuss mesh."

Since Theresa May rushed to Washington a year ago to pay homage at the court of King Trump, things haven't exactly gone smoothly. Mr Trump has tweeted criticism of British intelligence services over terrorism and re-tweeted posts from the far-right organisation Britain First. He then cancelled a trip to open the new US embassy in London, criticising its cost and ""off"" location. It was all a bit disingenuous. The truth is that Mr Trump's team feared any visit would be mired by protests. But it is also true that America is turning away from the ""special relationship"" and has been for some time. For instance, President Obama was far more concerned with his relationship with Europe than Britain specifically. It has been noted by British diplomats that the first state visit to Washington of a foreign leader will not be Mrs May but rather Emmanuel Macron of France. And although the two leaders in Davos agreed to finalise details of a planned visit to the UK later in the year, don't be surprised if it is not a state visit or even doesn't take place at all. As much as he would love the red carpet treatment and the pomp and ceremony, Mr Trump won't want demonstrations everywhere he goes. In America they'll be running into the crucial mid-term elections and so he will have the perfect excuse to stay away if he wants to. There is also the delicate issue of the Royal Wedding in May. It is very difficult to see Prince Harry inviting Donald Trump to his nuptials It is all pretty awkward for the Prime Minister. A post-Brexit Britain will need America more than ever, just at the time when America is turning away from the special relationship. That's why President Trump's words on trade will be especially reassuring to Mrs May. ""Trade is going to increase many times and we look forward to that"", he said. Talks have begun on a post-Brexit trade deal, but they will not be easy. There are many hurdles to negotiate before Britain gets anything like what it wants or needs. The relationship is being tested in other ways. Mr Trump's decisions to pull out of the Paris climate change deal, to threaten to wreck the Iran nuclear agreement and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have all irked British diplomats . But the obsession about whether the relationship is special or not is a very British thing. I haven't heard many Americans even mention it. I'm not sure they know it even exists. Critics say Mr Trump's tweets suggest he will not be a reliable partner for Britain. He will have only America's interests at heart - or so the theory goes. I am not so sure. He knows there are deep ties and he knows they will outlive his presidency. He also knows Britain remains America's most reliable ally. There is close co-operation on surveillance, security and military matters and both sides recognise the importance of that. But Trump is Trump. Impulsive, unorthodox, difficult and unpredictable. Special relationship? It depends on his mood when he wakes up."

Jaynesh Chudasama, of Hayes, is accused of three counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The 28-year-old defendant appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court and was remanded until the next hearing at the Old Bailey due on 26 February. The three youths were believed to have been on their way to a birthday party at a nearby football club when they were struck by a black Audi. They were with a group of friends walking towards the Goals five-a-side football club at around 8.40pm on Friday when they were hit on Shepiston Lane. A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after handing himself in at a north London police station at around 7pm on Sunday. Flowers, cards and other tributes have been left at the scene of the crash for the three victims. Harry was a promising footballer who had signed with semi-pro side Farnborough Town FC following a successful trial. He left the club a few weeks ago. Academy manager Marc Wardley said the boy was ""quiet and a really nice lad who got on with things, and who could have gone on to play at a decent level""."

Ms Justice Russell was told FGM was ""widespread"" in Guinea and she said the order would stay in force until the girl turned 17. She said she had barred the man from taking the youngster out of the UK because there were no direct flights to Guinea and all travel there took place via a third country. The couple at the centre of the legal case are separated. The girl lives with her British mother, who is in her 40s, in south-east England. Her father, who is in his 30s, was born in Conakry, Guinea. He had a ""black African Muslim heritage"" and had travelled to the UK more than a decade ago to study. He met the girl's mother, who had a ""white English Christian heritage"", through an ""online introduction site"". They had married in Conakry in 2007. FGM is a procedure where the female genitals are deliberately cut, injured or changed, but where there is no medical reason for this to be done. It is also known as ""female circumcision"" or ""cutting"". FGM is usually carried out on young girls between infancy and the age of 15, most commonly before puberty starts. It is illegal in the UK and is classed as child abuse. The NHS says: ""It's very painful and can seriously harm the health of women and girls. It can also cause long-term problems with sex, childbirth and mental health."" Legislation backing FGM protection orders came into force more than two years ago. In 2015 lawyer Zimran Samuel, who represents the child's mother, said the orders wound ""make a very real difference"". They aim to protect potential victims rather than punish offenders, could put barriers in front of people who posed a threat and give comfort and support to vulnerable females."
2018-01-29,"The new boss of easyJet has volunteered to have his salary cut to the same level of his female predecessor to show his ""personal commitment"" to equal pay.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180130050347/https://news.sky.com/story/easyjet-boss-takes-salary-cut-to-show-personal-commitment-to-equal-pay-11227786,"Johan Lundgren’s annual starting salary of £740,000 is being reduced to match the £706,000 that was being earned by Dame Carolyn McCall before she left the airline. Easyjet revealed in November that its female staff earn on average about half the rate paid to men. This is blamed on the fact that its pilots are predominantly male, with salaries several times higher than those of majority-female cabin crew. Mr Lundgren took over at the airline last month as Dame Carolyn departed for a new role as chief executive of broadcaster ITV. Easyjet said that his remuneration package - including annual bonus and long-term incentive plan - would now be ""identical"" to that of his predecessor. Mr Lundgren said: ""At easyJet we are absolutely committed to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men. ""I want that to apply to everybody at easyJet and to show my personal commitment I have asked the board to reduce my pay to match that of Carolyn’s when she was at easyJet. ""I also want to affirm my own commitment to address the gender imbalance in our pilot community which drives our overall gender pay gap. ""EasyJet has already gone further than other airlines in trying to attract more women into a career as a pilot. ""I want us not just to hit our target that 20% of our new pilots should be female by 2020 but to go further than this in the future."" Easyjet in November revealed a 45.5% average pay gap - comparing the midpoint, or median, in the salary range of women with that of men. Using a different type of average - the mean, which takes in all pay across the workforce - the gap was 51.7%. New laws require all companies with 250 or more employees to disclose details on their gender pay gaps."
2018-01-29,Government assurances about the safety of combustible cladding on high-rise buildings have been called into question.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180130050347/https://news.sky.com/story/plastics-industry-influenced-fire-safety-tests-in-wake-of-grenfell-tower-fire-11227957,"It comes after a claim that the plastics industry ""influenced"" official fire tests carried out in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Rockwool, which makes non-combustible building insulation, claims a firm owned by plastic insulation manufacturer Kingspan was given control of key elements of the tests including some that ""can have a direct bearing on the pass/fail outcome"". The Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people in June 2017, spread up combustible plastic insulation and plastic-filled ACM cladding panels which had been wrapped around the Kensington tower block in west London to meet energy-saving targets. Emergency tests on combustible cladding materials, known as British Standard 8414, were announced by communities minister Sajid Javid three weeks after the disaster and carried out at the headquarters of government fire safety advisers BRE. Mr Javid's Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) gave the test contract to cladding firm Booth Muirie, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingspan - the UK's biggest plastic insulation firm. Writing in the online trade magazine Building, Rockwool senior vice president Gilles Maria said: ""The tests curiously placed all-important horizontal fire barriers directly below thermocouples (basically high-tech thermometers) measuring the heat generated by the fire."" He went on to claim: ""Placing the fire barrier below the thermocouple naturally protects it from the flames and heat, an interesting way of influencing the test result."" Landlords have been told by the Government that it is safe to use cladding systems which passed the tests, including one using the same type of combustible plastic insulation fitted to Grenfell Tower but with cladding panels on the outside that do not burn. Kingspan told Sky News in a statement that the positions of the fire barriers and thermocouples by Booth Muirie were copied from a previous test at BRE. ""(This) was designed to ensure test integrity and comparability of test outcomes and data, a methodology that was fully agreed with DCLG. Booth Muirie had no role in the October 2016 test,"" the statement said. The firm went on to say that the rapid failure of the two tests involving plastic-filled cladding panels ""provide a very clear indication that it is the fire performance characteristics of ACM cladding panels that are the key factor in the safety of any cladding system and not the insulation boards"". The tests were commissioned on the advice of the Government's independent expert panel on building safety which was established after the Grenfell Tower fire. The panel is chaired by Sir Ken Knight, a director of BRE, and includes the BRE chief executive Peter Bonfield. BRE told Sky News it was not responsible for giving the contract to Booth Muirie and that BRE did not ""design, select or install"" the cladding systems tested. It said the tests were carried out ""using the test methodology required"" with 32 thermocouples used for each test. ""If the temperature shown by any one of the thermocouples (at the top of the test rig) exceeds the temperature criterion allowed, the cladding system fails the test,"" BRE added. Announcing the tests last year, the independent advisory panel said they ""will help landlords make decisions on any further measures that may need to be put in place to make their buildings safe"". Mr Maria is not the only critic of the BS 8414 cladding fire test, which was designed by BRE in response to a plastic cladding fire which killed a man at Garnock Court flats in Ayrshire in 1999 and are believed to cost more than £20,000 each. The Fire Protection Association, the insurance industry trade group, has called for a more realistic test for cladding, while the Metal Cladding and Roofing Manufacturers Association issued guidance in November 2017 that it had ""too many concerns regarding the BS 8414 test to confidently use it"" for guaranteeing a cladding system is safe. In a statement the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government, formerly DCLG, said that Booth Muirie ""was one of a number of contractors involved"" in the tests. ""Their designs were independently scrutinised... to ensure they reflected common practice,"" it said."

A year ago, they were at nearly 38%. It had been expected that 12 April would be the date when taps would be turned off, leaving residents to pick up their water from one of around 200 collection points. Commercial areas, hospitals and informal settlements would be exempt from the restrictions. Cape Town's city council has announced plans to tighten water restrictions. From February, residents must use less than 50 litres per person, per day in a further effort to avoid a tap turn-off. Currently, just 55% of residents are using fewer than 87 litres a day, officials have claimed. Meanwhile, aquifer drilling is accelerating and authorities hope to reduce water pressure in the municipal system in the coming weeks. On Saturday, hundreds of the city's Muslims gathered for a special service where they prayed for rain. The city's leaders have also said they are getting tougher on people who are stockpiling water and unlicensed stores selling potable water. On Tuesday, local media reported that several schools have turned off their taps and asked students to bring water from home. Some schools, such as Pinelands High School, are switching to a bucket system to save the water used when flushing a toilet. Others have asked children to come to school in their sports gear so parents do not need to wash two outfits. Some nursery workers are being laid off, as water-saving efforts leave gardens dry and undeveloped. Once the restrictions begin, the city's leaders expect them to last up to three months. Climate change and massive growth in population have been blamed for the water crisis."

The 48-year-old is alleged to have crashed into Muslims outside the mosques in Finsbury Park, north London, with a van just after 12.15am on 19 June last year. Makram Ali, 51, died in the attack and several others were injured. Osborne told the court he met with two people called Terry Jones and Dave, with whom he planned to target the Al Quds march in support of Palestine, which they thought would be attended by Mr Corbyn. He said the three of them had initially planned to attack Rochdale Labour councillor Aftab Hussain, who he claimed backed a member of a grooming gang. But Osborne said they soon changed their minds. He told jurors: ""We just wanted more casualties."" Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting, asked the defendant if he wanted ""more people dead if possible"" as he cross-examined the man - to which Osborne replied: ""Oh yeah."" The terror suspect denied being the driver of the vehicle involved in the collision and said he met Terry and Dave in Grosvenor Square the day before the alleged attack, where the Al Quds march was due to finish. When asked by Mr Rees if he was hoping to target Mr Corbyn, Osborne replied: ""Oh yeah... it would be one less terrorist off our streets."" He told the court road blocks had ""thwarted their plans"" to attack, leading them to meet in Finsbury Park later in the day looking for a mosque. Osborne admitted driving the van earlier but claimed he was in the footwell of the passenger seat removing his trousers before the collision near the mosques. When asked by defence barrister Lisa Wilding QC if he knew who was driving the van, the defendant replied: ""A guy called Dave."" He said he remembered peering out of the van before the impact and said it ""sort of reminded me of Hungry Hippos"". He was also asked if he had been in contact with Terry and Dave following the attack, to which he replied: ""We were planning to form a group, like the Welsh far-right group. ""We were going to call ourselves the 'Taffia'."" He claimed Dave had been driving and that he had ""no idea"" what he was going to do. But Mr Rees argued Dave and Terry were ""totally fabricated"" in order to deflect responsibility for the attack. Osborne denies charges of murder and attempted murder. The trial continues."

Oleg Deripaska, an aluminium magnate being investigated over his ties to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, is also featured on the list published as part of a sanctions law against Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Some 114 politicians are also listed, including Mr Putin's entire administration, cabinet and top officials at the Russian secret service. Mr Putin has described the list as a ""hostile step"" that would ""complicate the difficult situation Russian-American relations are already in."" He added: ""We were waiting for this list, and I will not hide it, were ready to take retaliatory steps, serious ones, which would have reduced our relations to zero. ""For now, we will refrain from these steps. But we will carefully watch how the situation develops."" The US Congress ordered the list be published after passing sanctions last summer under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, designed to name those believed to be benefiting from the Putin presidency. :: Trump willing to be interviewed under oath over Russia claims Despite signing the sanctions into law, Donald Trump had expressed reservations and opposed the list's publication. The law was made to require the White House to slap sanctions on anyone doing ""significant"" business with people linked to Moscow's defence and intelligence agencies, but the administration has decided it does not need to penalise anyone. State Department officials said the threat of sanctions had been enough of a deterrent, and that ""sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed"". :: Attorney general Jeff Sessions questioned in Trump-Russia probe Spokeswoman Heather Nauert added: ""We estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defence acquisitions."" Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the US Foreign Affairs Committee, accused Mr Trump's administration of having ""let Russia off the hook yet again"". ""How do you deter an attack that happened two years ago, and another that's already underway,"" he questioned, in reference to fears that Russia will attempt to intervene in the upcoming mid-term elections."

The 33-year-old previously admitted stealing a purse and a mobile phone from two victims of the Manchester Arena bombing on 22 May last year. At the time of the atrocity, which killed 22 and left more than 500 injured, Parker initially claimed on TV how he had been tending to the injured. Parker even spoke of how one woman died in his arms, after attacker Salman Abedi exploded a shrapnel-laden homemade bomb in the foyer of the concert venue as fans left an Ariana Grande gig. His purported actions prompted members of the public to raise more than £50,000 for the rough sleeper. But he will no longer receive the money, to be returned to the donors of an online GoFundMe appeal, after the truth emerged when police viewed CCTV footage. Instead, Parker will serve four years and three months in jail for two counts of theft and one count of fraud. He has also been banned from central Manchester for 10 years. Sentencing Parker for his ""repugnant"" behaviour, Judge David Hernandez told him: ""The true spirit of Manchester was displayed by the actions of ordinary citizens of Manchester as well as the emergency services who went to the assistance of those injured that night. ""You were not the hero you pretended to be, you were just a common thief. ""It is hard to contemplate a more reprehensible set of circumstances."" A statement from the mother of a 14-year-old girl who was seriously injured and had her phone taken by Parker was read to the court. It said: ""I was just astounded as I thought that I had seen the worst thing that a person could do to others and this was yet another blow as to how despicable people could be."" The prosecution revealed the phone rang a number of times as people were trying to contact the girl. Parker terminated one call with an automatic return text message, which read: ""Sorry I can't talk right now."" At a hearing earlier this month, Parker admitted taking the purse of Pauline Healey as her granddaughter, Sorrell Leczkowski, 14, lay dying yards away. He also admitted another count of theft, for taking the mobile phone of a teenager, and one count of fraud, after using Mrs Healey's bank cards in McDonald's on the night of the attack. Prosecutors said Parker had provided ""some comfort and assistance"" to victims, but also took the opportunity to steal from those hurt. Ben Southam, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""His actions added to the immense distress the victims and their families have suffered and our thoughts remain with them."" Mrs Healey had travelled to Manchester Arena with her daughter and granddaughter to meet someone, but they had not attended the concert themselves. The grandmother was injured in the explosion, requiring 15 hours of surgery after the blast."

Pressed on why some of her MPs appeared to be undermining her, she told reporters: ""I am doing what I believe is important for the sake of the country"". But responding to a question from Sky News about whether her dissenting MPs risked a Corbyn Government, the PM said: ""We are in Government. The next General Election is not until 2022. What we're doing now is doing the job that the British people asked the Government to do which is to deliver on Brexit. ""They want us to do that. But In doing that they did not vote for nothing to change when we come out of the EU, but we also want to deliver for them on things that matter on a day to day basis"". The PM's vow that things will change as a result of Brexit was a subtle reflection on the claim from her Chancellor in Davos last week that the UK-EU trading relationship would see only ""very modest"" change. It will be seen as an olive branch to those Brexiter MPs currently asserting themselves in Parliament demanding that the PM does not row back from the red lines she herself set at the Lancaster House speech a year ago. In another clear message to her concerned backbenchers, the PM played down the leaked impact assessments showing a hit to the economy in all broad end state scenarios with the EU from extra impediments to trade with our main partner. She said: ""It would be wrong to describe this as 'the Brexit impact assessment'. ""There is analysis being done. This is very preliminary. What has been seen so far is a selective interpretation of a very preliminary analysis, which ministers have not signed off, have not approved, and which doesn't actually even look at the sort of deal that we want to deliver in terms of the future relationship with the European Union."" She also refused to immediately publish the leaked analysis saying it would be wrong to publish it ""before it was completed"". Ms May said: ""When the time comes for Parliament to vote on the final deal, we will ensure that Parliament has the appropriate analysis on which to be fully informed, on which to base their judgement"". The PM was also asked about whether she would contest a no confidence vote if one, as some MPs suggest, is very close, and if 48 letters to the 1922 Committee chair were received.. She said: ""You always like talking about hypothetical situations. Let's talk about where we are now and what we are doing now. ""Here I am, taking a trade delegation to China. Here I am going to China to enhance the British economy and enhance global Britain"". Asked further if she felt people putting in letters were ""cowards"" and the system ""unfair"" on a sitting PM, she replied: ""Look, the Conservative party leadership rules have been written and it's a matter for the Conservative party, it's always been written by the [backbench] 1922 [Committee]. They went through a long process in terms of writing those leadership rules."" The Prime Minister began her trip in the university city of Wuhan, announcing a raft of new educational exchanges, praising the ""significant contribution"" of 150,000 Chinese students in the UK. She continues on to Beijing later today for a meeting at the Great Hall of the People with Premier Li Keqiang."

Alun Davies AM, the Welsh Government's cabinet secretary for local government and public services, said that while ""many people like"" paper ballots, that method of voting was ""increasingly at odds with people's everyday lives, especially young people"". The chief executive of youth-led think-tank WebRoots Democracy, Areeq Chowdhury, told Sky News he was ""delighted"" at the announcement. He added: ""Online voting has huge potential to engage a new generation of young voters in Wales, as well as enable voters with vision impairments and disabilities to independently cast ballots. ""Now that both the Welsh and Scottish Governments have committed to pilots, it is time for the UK Government to follow suit. ""Online voting is the future of elections and it can't indefinitely be kicked into the long grass."" Laws allowing e-voting are intended to be included in a Local Government Bill which Mr Davies said he intended to bring to the Welsh Assembly later this year. Mr Davies added: ""The Electoral Commission would need to evaluate any pilot before we moved to make anything permanent and widespread but time is overdue for making the voting process more modern and more flexible, observing, of course, the need to keep any system secure."" The security of ballot counting systems has never been a problem in the UK, where ballots are counted by hand. However, in countries such as the US and Germany, security researchers have warned that machines used to count votes could be hacked to manipulate the results - although there is no evidence of this having taken place. Russian hackers are accused of targeting election-related systems in 21 US states during the 2016 presidential election. In Germany, cybersecurity researchers warned in the days before their parliamentary elections that security flaws in counting machines' software were ""trivial"" to exploit and manipulate the result. Mr Chowdhury said that WebRoots Democracy's research has shown online voting could be far more secure than postal voting if ""designed carefully"". However, Matthew Rice, the Scotland director of digital rights organisation Open Rights Group, told Sky News: ""When computer science experts tell us pen and paper is the best voting system, we should listen. ""Electronic voting risks undermining elections. How is any reasonable person supposed to know what's going in inside the computers? ""How can we trust that the result the computer says is the correct result? We can't tip all the ballots out onto the table and run it again. ""Every week we hear about the threat of Russia or some other foreign power undermining democracies or trying to hack into government systems. ""Put voting online, and we'll be heading towards another massive problem."""
2018-01-30,"The second president of the United States John Adams once said: ""In politics, the middle way is no way at all"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180131055229/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-may-lose-lifeline-with-middle-way-brexit-11226406,"Mr Adams knew a thing or two about revolutions and knew that, in their midst, you have to pick a side. With Brexit, we've had our own revolt and it is the middle way which is leading Theresa May inexorably to the most perilous moment of her premiership. I was initially sceptical that such a threat existed. I still think the most likely outcome is that Mrs May survives and limps on. But, having talked to several Conservative MPs on both wings of the party today, I believe that there is an increasing possibility she will face a challenge. Part of the reason for that are Mrs May's own missteps. She has never - could never recover her authority after the catastrophe of the general election result. Her botched and limited reshuffle adverted to (rather than distracted from) her systemic weakness and resulted in her spending the limited capital she had accrued from December's successful EU negotiations. Worse, when Brexit is not discussed (as was largely the case in the first half of this week), Tory MPs become restless and darkly whisper that the PM has little in the way of domestic agenda and even less in the way of dynamism. They worry she is shrinking, not growing, into the job. One MP told me: ""Both I and the vast majority of Conservative MPs and ministers think she is hopeless."" But her biggest danger comes not from something she has done but instead because of something she has yet to do. With little more than a year to go until B-day and negotiations on the transition and final settlement looming, Mrs May must finally make a series of choices, many of which she has put off for so long. She must decide what sort of customs arrangement she wants. She must decide how closely Britain will remain aligned to the EU's regulatory regime. She must decide how long she wants the transition to be. A wrong step in any of these, much less all three, could provoke mutiny. But several Remainer MPs have told me that they are certain no new no-confidence letters have been signed by anyone on their side. That's not to say Remainer MPs are content with her. They're despairing. But they cling onto her for fear of getting something worse. One MP told me: ""It would be deeply irresponsible to have a three-month leadership contest at such a critical point in the Brexit negotiations- we run the risk of getting some ghastly Brexiteer like Jacob Rees-Mogg."" Given just how Eurosceptic the remaining Tory grassroots are, that isn't an unreasonable assumption. Naturally, the Brexiteers have no such fear. Rather, they're worried that Mrs May is reneging on the Brexit she promised them. For example, Theresa Villiers in the Sunday Telegraph warns that Britain risks staying in the EU ""in all but name"". These developments are crucial. Hitherto the arch-Brexiteers have been May's lifeline. In the wake of the election shambles they made the assessment that, however damaged as she might have been, she remained ""the best vehicle for delivering Brexit"", as one senior former Brexiteer cabinet minister told me a few weeks ago. If, through the detail of the negotiations, Mrs May appears likely to deliver a softer Brexit than they would like, that calculus would change and they would strike. Brexiteers have waited a long time to reach the promised land. If they fear the road there is running out they will not hesitate to try and remove a Prime Minister they don't much care for anyway. As one MP told me, the leadership plots are being orchestrated by ""hard Brexiteers who see their mad Brexit vision slipping away"". Mrs May was chosen to be Tory leader because she was offensive to neither side of the Brexit schism. Accordingly she is now about to try and chart a middle course. But as John Adams could have told her: ""This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it"". Brexit is not normal politics. It is almost religious. It is a matter of emotion, faith and belief (on both sides). The problem with religions is that their adherents are prone to visions, something the Prime Minister most certainly is not. Her middle way might seem sensible to outsiders but to Brexit's strongest adherents it will be heretical. And if the rumours are right, it doesn't need many more true believers to trigger the removal of this Pope. Worse for the Conservatives, there is a possible scenario which would leave them all worse off. Everyone talks as if a vote of no confidence would be the end of Mrs May. As John Adams never said: ""It ain't necessarily so"". Forty-eight MPs are needed to trigger a contest but Mrs May does not have to resign. She could fight on. If Remainers and the few loyalists she has band together, she might survive. She would stagger on, but weaker than before. So would everyone else. It would be Jeremy Corbyn who would emerge all the stronger and, as we know, he has a few revolutionary ideas of his own."

The group told MPs they faced ""veiled threats"" while trying to raise the subject of equal pay at the BBC. In a statement released on Tuesday, the BBC said that, while there was no evidence of gender bias, they had identified ""a number of issues in relation to pay"" which ""resulted in anomalies that need addressing"". The corporation said it would make ""substantial pay cuts for some men"" on air. ""The BBC believes in equality,"" said director-general Tony Hall. ""No one should be paid differently because of their gender. The BBC has a special role representing Britain. That is why we need to be, and want to be, an exemplar on gender pay, and equal pay."" Members of the BBC Women group have already said they have ""no confidence"" in the review and that they have been ""excluded from the process"". The BBC has been embroiled in controversy over its gender pay gap since a list of its biggest earners, topped by Radio 2's Chris Evans on more than £2m, revealed a gap in the pay of its top male and female stars. Earlier this month, China editor Carrie Gracie resigned from her role in protest at inequalities. A group of MPs at the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee (DCMS), which will question the BBC on Wednesday, have found evidence that the broadcaster has a ""deeper cultural problem"" than the gap revealed in last year's earnings list. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has entered into grievance procedures with the BBC, relating to more than 120 separate cases ranging from pay disparities on the grounds of race and gender to discrimination against women returning after maternity leave. Chair of DCMS Damian Collins said: ""It is clear that the BBC still has a big problem in terms of gender pay."" The BBC has proposed a £320,000 cap on its news presenters' salaries after an outcry over gender pay inequality."

Two Britons, two Spaniards and an Italian are being held on suspicion of importing Class A drugs, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Computers and phones have also been seized after three properties were searched in Bournemouth as part of the investigation. The crew of the plane have been released without charge. ""This is a major seizure of cocaine, one of the largest flown into the UK by plane in many years, and this seizure by Border Force represents a major blow to organised crime,"" said NCA operations manager Siobhan Micklethwaite. ""We estimate that once cut and sold on the streets in the UK it would have had a potential value in excess of £50m. ""Our investigations into this attempted importation are continuing."" The cocaine was hidden in 15 suitcases that were found on board, the Border Force said. Every case contained between 34 and 37 tape-wrapped packages that weighed about a kilo each. ""One of these was pierced and a white powder exposed which tested positive for cocaine,"" Border Force deputy chief operating officer Mike Stepney said."

The neo-Gothic exterior was created by Charles Barry to mirror Westminster Abbey, with its extravagant interior designed by Augustus Pugin. The steam-heated building - with its basements a tumble of wires, pipes and cables - was the scene of seven fires in 2017, while there were two hundred reported ""toilet failures"". But many have said action needs to be taken to fix it, with the outgoing senior parliamentary official Black Rod warning it could become ""another Grenfell"". The famous Big Ben bell has already been silenced while urgent work is carried out on the Elizabeth Tower, but consultants say there are serious structural issues throughout the estate. MPs could decide to pursue one of three options: :: 'Full decant': relocating both MPs and peers while the entire building is renovated.Estimated cost: £3.5bn over six years :: 'Partial decant': first MPs would move out while the House of Commons is renovated. After they return, work would start on the Lords.Estimated cost: £4.4bn over 11 years :: 'Refurbish on site': a rolling programme of upgrades while MPs and peers remain in the Palace.Estimated cost: £5.7bn over 35 years. The joint committee supported the most radical, full decant option, in order to ensure the UNESCO World Heritage Site remained intact for future generations of politicians and visitors. Chris Bryant MP served on the committee and says it is the obvious choice. He told Sky News: ""So everybody knows that this is the most iconic building in the world loved by millions: tourists love to come here and have their selfies taken in front of it. ""It's also got major problems, in particular down in the basement and in the roof; it's a potential fire hazard, and there's a real danger of a catastrophic failure of the building. ""We've got to look after this major piece of our national heritage."" But there is substantial opposition to the plan, mainly from Conservative MPs who fear spending such a vast figure over a short time frame would be unpalatable to voters - with overspends inevitable. Nigel Evans MP told Sky News: ""There are ways and means of doing it over a much longer period of time, but I think the alarm bells have begun to ring while they've silenced Big Ben. ""We've heard the facts and it does seems to be running out of control, and I don't think that the British taxpayer would really thank us if we all pulled out and the final bill came in at something like £8bn - it's totally unacceptable."" Wednesday afternoon's free vote has been subject to various amendments, including one from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, which proposes delaying any final decision until after a 'shadow Delivery Group' has assessed the cost implications. If the 'full decant' is supported by both houses, the Commons could move - in 2025 - to the Department of Health on Whitehall, with the Lords relocating to the Queen Elizabeth II Centre opposite the Abbey. Like Brexit, these plans arouse strong passions in Westminster with mutterings of a constitutional crisis if the Lords were to favour a different solution from the Commons. The stage is set for another parliamentary rumble, pitching Decanters against the Stayers."
2018-01-30,"Campaigner and journalist Kath Sansom says having a mesh implant left her in intense pain, describing surgery as like 'Russian roulette'. Here she recounts her story for Sky News:",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180131055229/https://news.sky.com/story/journalist-kath-sansom-was-wreck-after-vaginal-mesh-implant-11086123,"I set up the support page Sling the Mesh on Facebook three years ago, in June 2015, just 10 weeks after I had a mesh implant to treat incontinence from childbirth. The pain in my legs and feet was so intense, along with burning pains in my vagina - like being cut with a cheese wire - that I knew something was terribly wrong. When I told my surgeon of the pain I was suffering I was ignored. He told me I must have a slipped disc. I had walked into the operating theatre as one of the fittest mothers in her 40s you could wish to meet - a keen high board diver, mountain biker and boxer - and emerged a physical wreck. When I searched online I discovered women worldwide suffering similar problems. All were being ignored, not only by their surgeons but also by the media. It probably needed a journalist to be mesh injured to provide the final media push needed for the issue to get to Westminster. That journalist just happened to be me - a mum-of-two living in a small Fenland town more used to writing stories about animal rescues or council planning agendas than being suddenly caught up in what some medical professionals describe as the biggest health scandal of our time. :: Mesh implant problem 'bigger than Thalidomide' The mesh fight began in Britain in 2007 with TVT Mum, Meshies United, TVT Info, Welsh Mesh Survivors and Scottish Mesh Survivors - the latter achieving so much with a suspension of the plastic pelvic implants in Scottish Parliament in 2014 and a subsequent independent inquiry into its safety. Many other groups globally have fought for years too, all with one common goal - to stop others suffering as we have done. Over and again we have told our stories. That is what we were prepared to do, as it was the only way to make people sit up and take notice, to realise the scale of personal tragedy that mesh can cause when it goes wrong. Harry Evans, editor of the Sunday Times when the Thalidomide scandal broke in the 60s and 70s, said you must tell a story over and over until people get it. He ran Thalidomide articles every week for months until finally everybody realised what a huge scandal it was. And so it is with mesh. Globally, men and women injured by both pelvic and hernia mesh implants have told their stories. And finally people get it. In October the women and men in Sling the Mesh helped trigger a debate in Parliament and we are calling for mesh procedures to be stopped immediately. When undergoing this surgery it is Russian roulette as to whether it will be successful or not. We hope that the British government will agree this is a risk not worth taking with a woman's health."

Its ""Humble Address"" motion tabled for Wednesday is the same method that bound the Government to publish its earlier ""impact assessments"" on Brexit. They ultimately turned out not to exist. But a new report dated January 2018 that says Britain will be economically worse off under every divorce model analysed was obtained and published by BuzzFeed News on Monday night. Sky sources said the document was legitimate but only a draft. MPs are now demanding it be released to a senior committee for proper scrutiny. Labour believes it can force the Government's hand by invoking the centuries-old and infrequently used procedure that asks the Queen to request documents from ministers. If successful, the document would be handed over to the Brexit select committee, which will then decide what to do with it. But the crucial debate will come while Theresa May is on a trip to China. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington will stand in at Prime Minister's Questions in her absence. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer claimed Labour had ""once again"" been ""forced"" to ""make ministers do the right thing"". He said: ""People voted to leave the European Union in part to give Parliament control about its own future. ""That means giving MPs the information they need to scrutinise the Government's approach to Brexit. ""Ministers cannot keep sidelining Parliament to hide the deep divisions within their own party."" When Labour successfully passed a similar motion in November, the Government was forced to respond. Commons Speaker John Bercow said at the time: ""Motions of this kind have in the past been seen as effective or binding."" A small number of rebel Tory MPs are likely to join forces with Labour to force the publication of the study, which is understood to be called EU Exit Analysis - Cross Whitehall Briefing. Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Antoinette Sandbach were among at least 50 MPs to sign a cross-party letter from the APPG on EU Relations co-ordinated by pro-EU campaign Open Britain on Tuesday backing the move."

His use of cable ties, high level of organisation and ability to escape leaving few clues all point towards a forces background, and police now fear he could seriously injure or kill his next victim. :: 'Night Watcher' victim: He put a shotgun to my chest Detective Inspector Dee Fielding, from Surrey Police, said: ""Each of these burglaries have been extremely distressing for the victims involved. ""We do not believe this to be the work of an opportunist burglar, but someone who has specialist knowledge and skills - possibly ex forces or from a similar background due to the way he has behaved and the circumstances of each incident."" The string of burglaries at luxury homes across the South East has left victims traumatised, with one resident left fearing she was going to be raped and killed. Susan Morris, 61, was alone in her home when she was confronted by a masked man pointing a sawn-off shotgun at her. Mrs Morris said: ""I just heard this very loud voice behind me shout: 'I want the jewellery. Show me the safe.' He came towards me with a shotgun."" She was terrified as the powerfully built man, wearing a balaclava and gloves, grabbed her arm and forced her upstairs. ""He was gripping me hard all the time, everywhere including my breasts. We got to the dressing room and I opened the safe. ""I gave him the jewellery, but he said he wanted more. He was angry and hitting me all over the place, just hard enough to hurt a lot without knocking me out."" Mrs Morris suffered a broken jaw and lost a tooth during the attack which left her heavily bruised. ""He got me to touch the shotgun to show me it was real and not plastic. Then he told me to lie down and that's when I thought he was going to rape me. ""He dragged me across the floor by my hair and then things got even worse. He pointed the shotgun at my head and I really thought: 'This is it. He's going to kill me.'"" Her husband Stephen, a businessman, arrived back shortly after the gunman fled their home in Kingswood, Surrey. The suspect is thought to have stolen more than a million pounds' worth of jewellery, watches and cash from wealthy victims since 2014. Among his victims were the Earl and Countess of March, attacked, robbed and tied up at their historic Goodwood Home in the Sussex Downs. Their stolen heirlooms included a £400,000 tiara and an emerald ring that King Charles II gave to his mistress. Detectives believe the burglar stakes out his target homes for days before seizing an opportunity to get in through an unlocked door. Appealing for help from the public, DI Fielding said: ""There must be a member of the public out there who will know somebody who could fit this profile - someone who is confident enough, who has special skills, potentially ex-military or law enforcement, someone able to use violence on their own to tie up a number of people while committing offences. ""We are worried the violence could escalate and a victim could get really badly hurt or worse."" He is believed to carry out raids about once every six months, possibly each time he needs more money. The man is described as white, 6ft, stocky and muscular and he speaks with a southern accent. Police say DNA evidence was found at the scene of one of the raids, but has not been traced to any other offences. He is suspected of two burglaries in Kingswood, and others in Maidenhead, Chichester, Sevenoaks, Maidstone and Virginia Water, the last in October last year. Anyone with information is urged to call 101 and ask for Surrey Police, Operation Prometheus, or email OpPrometheus@surrey.pnn.police.uk.

The bi-directional power flow will allow owners to charge their vehicles during times of low demand, and feed power back to the grid at times of high demand. It could enable car owners to make money from their vehicles by selling services back to the energy network. This is the first large-scale vehicle-to-grid technology trial to take place anywhere in the world. The £9.8m project is led by Nissan, and involves experts from Newcastle University and Imperial College London. The project also involves electricity network operators Northern Powergrid, UK Power Networks and National Grid and V2G aggregator Nuvve. Newcastle University's project lead Myriam Neaimeh said the trial would be ""a real game changer as we move towards decarbonising the grid"". There are currently around 130,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars on UK roads, but if the UK is to meet its commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 2030, it would need to have two million operational electric vehicles. The Government wants nearly all cars to be zero emission by 2050. It is hoped that the project, which is part of a £30m investment from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, working with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles and Innovate UK, will aid the growth of electric vehicles and lead the way for a low-carbon revolution. Meanwhile, oil giant BP will be rolling out mobile electric charging points at selected petrol stations in the UK and Europe throughout the year. The company has invested £3.6m in mobile and networked energy storage company FreeWire Technologies, in a move they hope will tap into the growing demand for electric-powered cars."

""It's time for the Government to match my ambition so all Londoners can breathe easy,"" he wrote on Twitter. In October, it was reported that 44 out of 51 British towns and cities failed pollution tests. A report by the World Health Organisation said Glasgow and Scunthorpe had the highest number of disease-causing sooty particles (known as PM2.5s). Eastbourne, Leeds, London, Salford and Southampton were the next worst. At the time, Dr Toby Hillman, one of the report's authors from the Royal College of Physicians, said: ""There isn't a safe limit for the amount of pollution that's been defined as yet and we know the effects of poor air quality run from cradle to grave; it's a lifetime threat to human health. ""This is a really direct and tangible impact on UK health from the drivers of climate change, and taking action on air quality should be a priority."" Meanwhile, UK ministers are among those who were called to Brussels to talk about the continuing failure of EU countries to meet targets to cut air pollution this week. After the meeting, EU Commissioner Karmenu Vella said that, despite ""some positive suggestions"", these limits could be exceeded ""even well beyond 2020"". He said: ""Every year, an astonishing number of citizens' lives are cut short because of air pollution. ""We have known this for decades, and the air quality limit values have been in place for almost as long. ""And yet, still today, in 2018, 400,000 people (across Europe) are still dying prematurely every year because of a massive, widespread failure to address the problem."" The UK and other countries could face legal action from the EU if they do not do enough to tackle air pollution."

As a contestant on Celebrity Mastermind a few years ago, this is one BBC decision of which I heartily approve. I don't think knowledge of popular culture - especially limited episode shows like Father Ted - really tests masterminds. When I was on the show I chose ""The life and works of Anthony Burgess"". My opponents went for Father Ted, Queen (the band), and Reeves And Mortimer. I was coming last after the specialist round. I caught up to second place in the general knowledge, thank goodness.

At Woolwich Crown Court today, Judge Christopher Kinch said the men jointly benefited from an estimated £13.69m worth of cash, gold and gems stolen from the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. He ruled they must pay £27.5m based on their available assets. If they fail to pay their share of the total sum, they will have seven years added to their jail sentences. It means some of the gang members, who are unwell, could die behind bars. Speaking at the confiscation hearing, the judge said: ""A number of these defendants are not only of a certain age, but have in some cases serious health problems.

Doyle had around £27,000 in his bank account which was unaccounted for, which the judge said was from the proceeds of general criminal conduct. Although the exact value of the stolen goods has fluctuated throughout the trial, police have only recovered around £4m worth. Some of that was recovered in a graveyard in Edmonton, after Sky News alerted police. The Hatton Garden raid story was turned into a film starring Larry Lamb and Phil Daniels, which was released over Easter last year."

Mr McEwan replied: ""In 2014, absolutely, when you look at the stats that have come through… it is not true."" He was referring to figures from a subsequent report into GRG that was commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog. RBS, which remains more than 70% owned by the taxpayer after its bail-out during the financial crisis, has been dogged by persistent questions and criticism over the affair. The FCA in 2016 effectively cleared the bank of many of the allegations by customers. RBS, which has set aside £400m to handle complaints by firms over their treatment by GRG, has admitted failings but stopped short of saying companies were deliberately pushed into administration. Mr McEwan reiterated the position in his evidence before MPs, admitting: ""We did not do a good job with these customers and the report shows that. ""Our communication with our customers was very poor, the movement of them into GRG was very, very confusing for them - it created stress at a time when they were under enough stress as it was. ""Certainly the fees and the structuring and complexity of fees for SMEs [small and medium enterprises] was just too confusing and far too complex and very, very poorly communicated."""
2018-01-30,Lovers of all things astronomical can look forward to a rare celestial event on Wednesday when three lunar phenomena collide.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180131055229/https://news.sky.com/story/super-blue-blood-moon-three-lunar-events-for-the-price-of-one-11228977,"A super blue blood moon will be taking place - a spectacle that hasn't been seen in the US since 1866. UK based stargazers will be able to appreciate two of the trio of events - a supermoon and a blue moon. But a lunar eclipse, which causes a 'blood moon' as it turns a reddish colour, will not take place in the UK. The full spectacle - in which all three phenomena are visible at the same time - will arrive in Australia first, and will later be seen by much of Asia and America. It will be most impressive in North America, Alaska and the Hawaiian islands just before dawn. The super blue blood moon features three different astronomical events. Firstly, a blue moon is the name given to the second full moon in a calendar month. Secondly, a supermoon is when the moon appears larger and brighter because it is closer to the earth than normal. And thirdly, a blood moon occurs when the moon passes through the Earth's shadow, causing a total lunar eclipse. This casts a shadow across the moon, giving it a red glow. NASA will be livestreaming the event from three vantage points in California, Los Angeles and Arizona from 5.30am EST (10.30am UK time). In the Middle East, Asia, eastern Russia, Australia and New Zealand, it will be seen during moonrise in the evening. Dr Gregory Brown, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, warned that the full spectacle will ""definitely not be visible from the UK, not even a partial eclipse"". But he said the best time to view the UK's double whammy of a super blue moon is at around 12.40am, when the moon is at its highest. Dr Brown said anyone keen to see a lunar eclipse in the British Isles should wait until 27 July, when there will be ""a more spectacular view"" of an eclipse than is visible elsewhere on Tuesday night. The next super blue blood moon anywhere won't be until New Year's Eve on December 2028, according to NASA."
2018-01-30,The Libertines have revealed details of their new hotel and studio in the seaside town of Margate.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180131055229/https://news.sky.com/story/the-albion-rooms-the-libertines-unveil-hotel-plan-for-seaside-town-of-margate-11229316,"Located on the Kent town's Eastern Esplanade, The Albion Rooms will be situated in a renovated five-storey, ten-room Victorian townhouse previously known as the Palm Court Hotel. It was bought by the rock group in September last year at a reported cost of £450,000 and planning permission was subsequently granted for a rear extension by Thanet District Council. The recording studio is due to be finished in February and a new bar and individually designed guest rooms will follow soon after. But while guests cannot book a getaway just yet, the musicians themselves have already moved in and are hard at work writing their fourth album, ahead of its expected release this summer. Explaining their decision to move in, The Libertines said on their website: ""Margate is a classic seaside resort, particularly popular with Londoners, for those looking for sandy beaches and a good knees up. ""But, Margate also has rich artistic roots and a free spirit that thrives today, embodied by its old town and the Turner Contemporary gallery. This mix of traditional English charm and modern cool gives it plenty of libertine appeal."" The bandmates - Pete Doherty, Carl Barat, John Hassall and Gary Powell - were said to have been inspired by ""the celluloid co-habitation antics of The Beatles and The Monkees"". No doubt they will be hoping the hotel is better received when it reopens than its former incarnation, the Palm Court Hotel, which generated an average score of 2/5 on TripAdvisor. One visitor said it had been ""sadly neglected"" and another described it as ""a truly ghastly place to stay"". Regardless, Margate is becoming something of a destination for creative talents, with the artist Tracey Emin announcing her plans to move back to her home town from London last year. She has also submitted a planning application of her own to the council to convert part of a building into a studio and one bedroom flat. And last year, actor Tom Hardy visited the town's Dreamland theme park to film an iPhone advert for Sky Mobile."
2018-01-30,"A council leader is quitting over ""sexist and bullying"" behaviour she experienced in a battle with Labour's ruling body.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180131055229/https://news.sky.com/story/haringey-council-leader-quits-over-sexist-bullying-behaviour-as-labour-nec-row-grows-11229763,"Claire Kober said she had been ""disappointed and disillusioned"" by the row over a £2bn housing project in Haringey, north London. The senior local government official declared she would not stand for re-election when council seats are re-fought in the capital in May. Her proposed ""Haringey Development Vehicle"" captured national headlines when Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) made a major intervention to halt the scheme. It came days after a clean-sweep for pro-Jeremy Corbyn candidates on elections to the NEC, with figures including Momentum founder Jon Lansman propelled to the top jobs. Mr Corbyn had also personally criticised the HDV project, which involves a partnership with the private sector. Ms Kober told the Evening Standard: ""The sexism, bullying, undemocratic behaviour and outright personal attacks on me as the most senior woman in Labour local government have left me disappointed and disillusioned."" And on Twitter she took a thinly-veiled swipe at Momentum, whose members have been active in selection battles for the forthcoming council elections. Praising council colleagues, Ms Kober said: ""I am only sorry that many have been denied the opportunity to stand once again."" Former interim Labour leader Harriet Harman said she ""just cannot speak too highly"" of Ms Kober. The Peckham MP told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: ""All that she says about the difficulty about being a woman in leadership I'm sure is absolutely true and is a challenge to all of us in the party."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan also praised the councillor, who has served since 2006 and received an OBE in 2016. He said she deserved ""massive credit"" for turning around local children's services after the Baby P scandal. Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis said: ""From Labour headquarters to Haringey Council, Jeremy Corbyn's hard-left supporters continue their takeover of the Labour Party."" Labour's shadow local government secretary Andrew Gwynne, who has been asked to mediate in the development row, said he was ""sorry"" to see Ms Kober go and hailed her for leading Haringey during ""a very difficult time"". He said: ""The housing crisis is a national scandal caused in 10 Downing Street. ""However, there are issues specific to Haringey that have caused concern for many residents and local politicians, which is why I have been asked to mediate."" Critics of the HDV have described the scheme as ""social cleansing"". But Ms Kober hit back by attacking ""ideological dogmas"". The £2bn scheme would see the transfer of council assets and land into a 50-50 partnership with a private developer."
2018-01-30,Police and prosecutors have apologised after a student's rape trial collapsed because an officer had failed to disclose key evidence.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180131055229/https://news.sky.com/story/liam-allan-police-apologise-for-students-rape-trial-collapse-11228722,"The case against Liam Allan, 22, was thrown out of court after it emerged a detective had not handed over text messages from the accuser's phone. Messages between the complainant in the case and others were only passed to the defence days before the trial collapsed at Croydon Crown Court. After a review, the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the mistake was ""human error"" and no officers or prosecutors have been disciplined over the case. ""The disclosure problems in this case were caused by a combination of error, lack of challenge, and lack of knowledge,"" a joint statement said. Mr Allan had said his ""overwhelming feeling was frustration"" after spending two years on bail during the case. After the review, he told Sky News: ""I hope somewhere down the line there are consequences and lessons are learnt. ""I don't want one person being a scapegoat. There are other cases that have been dropped."" Mr Allan said he had suffered ""stress and anxiety"" during his ordeal and wanted to return to a ""normal life"". He had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault before his trial was dropped in December. The case was thrown out after evidence on computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed Mr Allan's accuser had pestered him for ""casual sex"". Metropolitan Police Commander Richard Smith said he had met with Mr Allan to offer a ""personal apology"". He added: ""I was really pleased to have that opportunity to meet with him face to face, allow him to read the report and apologise for the errors that were made."" Claire Lindley, chief crown prosecutor for London South, said the case ""highlighted some systemic and deep-rooted issues"". She explained: ""The prosecutors involved in this case did not sufficiently challenge the police about digital material,"" she said. ""That meant that it took longer than was necessary to drop Mr Allan's case. For that, the CPS has offered an unreserved apology to him which I delivered to him in person yesterday."" All rape and serious sexual assault cases in England and Wales - including 600 in London - are being reviewed by the CPS to ensure evidence has been disclosed after a series of collapsed cases in recent weeks. A rape case against Oxford University student Oliver Mears was dropped after fresh evidence - including a diary that supported his case - was passed to the CPS. Surrey Police admitted ""there were flaws in the investigation"" after the force failed to examine the accuser's ""digital media"" or follow ""a reasonable line of enquiry"". Earlier this month, the trial of Samson Makele - who was accused of raping a woman he met after Notting Hill Carnival in 2016 - collapsed after more than a dozen pictures emerged of the pair apparently cuddling in bed."

He responded by sending the alert without having it signed off by his manager. The name of the worker has not been released by the agency. He still works there but has been reassigned to a job without access to the warning system. Meanwhile, the agency's top two civilian officials have resigned. All mobile phones, TV and radio stations in the US state were sent the alert, which read: ""Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill."" A high-pitched sound alerted TV viewers, with screens displaying the warning. It took 38 minutes for officials to send another alert stating the alert was a ""false alarm"". While the state emergency management agency struggled to retract the alert, Hawaiians scrambled to find shelter in frenzied scenes. On the H-3, a major highway north of Honolulu, vehicles were left abandoned after drivers ran to a nearby tunnel, local media reported. Professional golfer Colt Knost, staying at Waikiki Beach during a PGA Tour event, said ""everyone was panicking"" in the lobby of his hotel. ""Everyone was running around like, 'What do we do?'"" he said. One father even made his daughter climb down a manhole in order to seek refuge. At the time, David Ige, the governor of Hawaii, said the accidental alert was ""unfortunate"" and ""regrettable"" as he apologised to Hawaiians. ""It was a mistake made during a standard procedure at the change over of a shift, and an employee pushed the wrong button during a shift change,"" he explained. The Emergency Management Agency provided the FCC with information following a written statement from the employee."

Since retirement the group have pursued a number of investments in Manchester, including the purchase of non-league side Salford City and the construction of a hotel next to United's home ground. The university proposal is included in Trafford Council's £170m ""Refreshed Stretford Masterplan"", which aims to transform the town centre and wider area into a ""prosperous and vibrant place with attractive communities and a wide range of facilities"". :: Former Class of 92 teammate Beckham to launch MLS team It will offer sport, media and business courses for up to 6,500 students as part of Lancaster University, to run in partnership with the Conservative council and Trafford College, with the main campus on the site of a former Kellogg's building expected to open in September 2019. The academy's official website describes it as ""a game-changing Higher Education initiative to establish a new model of university"" to help students ""exceed their potential and and realise their dreams"". Gary Neville said: ""Our aim is that university students will of course leave with an academic qualification, but also a range of skills such as how to deal with pressure, an understanding of finance, leadership, presentational skills and also how to maintain a healthy body and mind. ""In other words the complete package to succeed in the workplace."" Council planners gave the proposal the go ahead on Monday after it was revised following a public consultation, with locals having criticised the accompanying student village as an ""intrusive"" and ""ugly"" tower block. The accommodation will now be spread across ""lower rise"" buildings. Alongside the academy will be a rejuvenated Stretford Mall and a new and enlarged Stretford Leisure Centre, featuring two 3G sports pitches and three new training pitches for Salford United. But there has been some disappointment for the footballers-turned-developers this week, with another plan for two skyscrapers in the Jackson's Row area of the city set to be scrapped. Giggs and Gary Neville said they would ""help with the regeneration of Manchester"", but Historic England snubbed the proposal last summer and did so again on Monday. The project had an estimated cost of £200m - more than the combined cost of their former club's two most expensive signings, Paul Pogba (£89m) and Romelu Lukaku (£75m)."

The so-called Night Watcher is thought to have stolen more than a million pounds' worth of jewellery, watches and cash after staking out homes and then threatening residents with a sawn-off shotgun. Detectives are desperate to identify and catch the suspect, whom they believe could be a former soldier, as they fear he could kill someone. Initially, the suspect was thought to have raided seven homes across southeast England in the past three years. They include a burglary at historic Goodwood House on the Sussex Downs, in which the Earl and Countess of March were attacked and tied up. Their stolen heirlooms included a £400,000 tiara and an emerald ring that King Charles II gave to his mistress. Susan Morris, 61, whose home in Kingswood, Surrey, was raided in October, described her ordeal. She said: ""One point when he was hitting me with the gun pointing at me, at that moment I did actually think, 'this is it, it's all over'."" The woman suffered a broken jaw and lost a tooth during the attack, which left her heavily bruised. The burglar, who got his name due to his meticulous research ahead of each raid, has been described as a ""well-spoken, intelligent thief"" and a ""highly professional soldier"" by police. In one raid, the suspect was so confident of the victims not being able to raise the alarm that he spent more than an hour with them gathering items he wished to steal. Surrey Police's Detective Inspector Dee Fielding said the level of planning, the use of cable ties and the man's confidence in carrying out the burglaries suggested he had a forces background. ""Each of these burglaries have been extremely distressing for the victims involved,"" she said. ""We do not believe this to be the work of an opportunist burglar, but someone who has specialist knowledge and skills - possibly ex-forces or from a similar background due to the way he has behaved and the circumstances of each incident.""

Affleck had previously said he believed the claims that Weinstein had raped McGowan at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997 - an alleged event which she details in her new autobiography Brave. In the emails cited by Weinstein's lawyer and sent a few months before the Weinstein claims were made, Affleck allegedly says he had no information regarding any sexual assault. ""She never told me nor did I ever infer that she was attacked by anyone,"" the cited emails from Affleck says. ""Any accounts to the contrary are false. I have no knowledge about anything Rose did or claimed to have done."" :: Weinstein: The women behind the claims Another email used by Weinstein's lawyer as a defence was sent by McGowan's former manager who, after the alleged 1997 incident, said she had spoken to McGowan. ""When we met up the following day, she hesitantly told me of her own accord that during the meeting that night before she had gotten into a hot tub with Mr Weinstein,"" Messick's email reads. ""She was very clear about the fact that getting into that hot tub was something that she did consensually and that in hindsight it was also something that she regretted having done."" Weinstein's lawyer said: ""As a general matter, Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys have refrained from publicly criticising any of the women who have made allegations of sexual assault against Mr Weinstein despite a wealth of evidence that would demonstrate the patent falsity of these claims. ""Watching the 'performance' by Rose McGowan as she looks to promote her new book however, has made it impossible to remain quiet as she tries to smear Mr Weinstein with a bold lie that is denied not only by Mr Weinstein himself, but by at least two witnesses."" McGowan has already responded to Weinstein's lawyer on Twitter, writing: ""F*** you you f****** douche bag loser from hell. You will burn. You will be an empty suit coffin. You go fall off the planet you f***."" McGowan reportedly reached a $100,000 settlement with Weinstein but later spoke out, saying she had been ""silenced for 20 years"" and had been ""harassed"" and ""maligned"".

He admitted to BBC Radio 5 Live it ""looks as though I'm claiming two qualifications"", but said he only chose the degree entry because LinkedIn had no NVQ Level 6 option. It is a similar blunder to the one that befell his predecessor, Paul Nuttall, who was forced to remove a claim he held a PhD. Playing down the gaffe, Mr Bolton compared the scale of the mistake to someone claiming they had come sixth in the Kent egg and spoon race instead of seventh. The UKIP leader faces a vote on his future at a special meeting of party members in February. He faced losing the job he has only held for four months after then-girlfriend Jo Marney sent racist messages about Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle. Despite a string of calls to resign and at least 10 people quitting the party to try to force him out, Mr Bolton has remained defiant. ""I shall not be resigning as party leader,"" he announced last week outside the Folkestone hotel where he is living."
2018-01-31,"The second president of the United States John Adams once said: ""In politics, the middle way is no way at all"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180201060040/https://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-may-lose-lifeline-with-middle-way-brexit-11226406,"Mr Adams knew a thing or two about revolutions and knew that, in their midst, you have to pick a side. With Brexit, we've had our own revolt and it is the middle way which is leading Theresa May inexorably to the most perilous moment of her premiership. I was initially sceptical that such a threat existed. I still think the most likely outcome is that Mrs May survives and limps on. But, having talked to several Conservative MPs on both wings of the party today, I believe that there is an increasing possibility she will face a challenge. Part of the reason for that are Mrs May's own missteps. She has never - could never recover her authority after the catastrophe of the general election result. Her botched and limited reshuffle adverted to (rather than distracted from) her systemic weakness and resulted in her spending the limited capital she had accrued from December's successful EU negotiations. Worse, when Brexit is not discussed (as was largely the case in the first half of this week), Tory MPs become restless and darkly whisper that the PM has little in the way of domestic agenda and even less in the way of dynamism. They worry she is shrinking, not growing, into the job. One MP told me: ""Both I and the vast majority of Conservative MPs and ministers think she is hopeless."" But her biggest danger comes not from something she has done but instead because of something she has yet to do. With little more than a year to go until B-day and negotiations on the transition and final settlement looming, Mrs May must finally make a series of choices, many of which she has put off for so long. She must decide what sort of customs arrangement she wants. She must decide how closely Britain will remain aligned to the EU's regulatory regime. She must decide how long she wants the transition to be. A wrong step in any of these, much less all three, could provoke mutiny. But several Remainer MPs have told me that they are certain no new no-confidence letters have been signed by anyone on their side. That's not to say Remainer MPs are content with her. They're despairing. But they cling onto her for fear of getting something worse. One MP told me: ""It would be deeply irresponsible to have a three-month leadership contest at such a critical point in the Brexit negotiations- we run the risk of getting some ghastly Brexiteer like Jacob Rees-Mogg."" Given just how Eurosceptic the remaining Tory grassroots are, that isn't an unreasonable assumption. Naturally, the Brexiteers have no such fear. Rather, they're worried that Mrs May is reneging on the Brexit she promised them. For example, Theresa Villiers in the Sunday Telegraph warns that Britain risks staying in the EU ""in all but name"". These developments are crucial. Hitherto the arch-Brexiteers have been May's lifeline. In the wake of the election shambles they made the assessment that, however damaged as she might have been, she remained ""the best vehicle for delivering Brexit"", as one senior former Brexiteer cabinet minister told me a few weeks ago. If, through the detail of the negotiations, Mrs May appears likely to deliver a softer Brexit than they would like, that calculus would change and they would strike. Brexiteers have waited a long time to reach the promised land. If they fear the road there is running out they will not hesitate to try and remove a Prime Minister they don't much care for anyway. As one MP told me, the leadership plots are being orchestrated by ""hard Brexiteers who see their mad Brexit vision slipping away"". Mrs May was chosen to be Tory leader because she was offensive to neither side of the Brexit schism. Accordingly she is now about to try and chart a middle course. But as John Adams could have told her: ""This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it"". Brexit is not normal politics. It is almost religious. It is a matter of emotion, faith and belief (on both sides). The problem with religions is that their adherents are prone to visions, something the Prime Minister most certainly is not. Her middle way might seem sensible to outsiders but to Brexit's strongest adherents it will be heretical. And if the rumours are right, it doesn't need many more true believers to trigger the removal of this Pope. Worse for the Conservatives, there is a possible scenario which would leave them all worse off. Everyone talks as if a vote of no confidence would be the end of Mrs May. As John Adams never said: ""It ain't necessarily so"". Forty-eight MPs are needed to trigger a contest but Mrs May does not have to resign. She could fight on. If Remainers and the few loyalists she has band together, she might survive. She would stagger on, but weaker than before. So would everyone else. It would be Jeremy Corbyn who would emerge all the stronger and, as we know, he has a few revolutionary ideas of his own."

Following the collision, Oregon congressman Greg Walden tweeted: ""We're fine, but our train hit a garbage truck. Members with medical training are assisting the drivers of the truck."" One party adviser said the train partially derailed. Politicians said the fatality appeared to be someone travelling in the lorry.

Other politicians tweeted they were ""praying for those who were in the truck"". Mr Cole said he felt ""a tremendous jolt"" at the point of impact at about 11.15am local time, almost two hours after the train left Washington. He said the train stopped quickly after the collision before congressmen - who were doctors - got off the train to assist.

Brexit minister Steve Baker said he was doing so on the ""exceptional basis"" of ""poor reporting"" on the document. But he warned: ""It does not set any precedent for future action."" Commons speaker John Bercow ruled the motion is binding and said he expected ministers to hand the report to the Brexit select committee ""as a matter of urgency"". Downing Street also confirmed the document would not be edited before publication, like the ""sectoral analyses"" fought over in November were. The Prime Minister's spokesman said on Wednesday: ""Whatever is published will be the partial unfinished document that was leaked. ""When the full analysis is complete that will be published ahead of a meaningful vote."" Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a ""victory for transparency and accountability"". He expects ministers to publish the ""EU Exit Analysis - Cross Whitehall Briefing"" paper by the end of the week. ""I look forward to studying the documents in full and helping to ensure that in future Brexit policy is driven by evidence, not ideology,"" Sir Keir said. ""It's time the Prime Minister reflected on her reckless red lines that are clearly not in the national interest."" It comes less than 24 hours after Theresa May personally intervened to say she would refuse to publish the study leaked to BuzzFeed News ""before it was completed"". She told reporters on a trip to China: ""When the time comes for Parliament to vote on the final deal, we will ensure that Parliament has the appropriate analysis on which to be fully informed, on which to base their judgement."" The PM is already facing near-unprecedented levels of public criticism from Tory MPs since the start of her premiership. Former business minister Anna Soubry said her ""hard Brexiteer"" colleagues would end up ""destroying"" the party as she called on the Government to ""get a grip"" and laid into its ""inability to grasp Brexit"". Meanwhile, justice minister Dr Phillip Lee was reprimanded by Number 10 for warning: ""We must act for our country's best interests, not ideology and populism, or history will judge us harshly."""

Davie McLachlan has been suspended as leader of the party's group on South Lanarkshire Council pending an investigation into the allegation, which he vehemently denies. Mr Sarwar, Labour's health spokesman at Holyrood, said it was up to the party to take ""appropriate action"" following his complaint and he wanted to focus on the wider issue of ""religious hatred"" in Britain. He told Sky News: ""I think we have an everyday racism, an everyday Islamophobia, across our society. ""I think we've seen, particularly in Scotland, a reduction in the number of race-related attacks but a significant increase in the number of religious-based attacks. ""I think, perhaps, we're seeing a transfer of some that racial hatred onto religious hatred."" Mr Sarwar claimed another Labour member had said they could not vote for him because his wife wore a headscarf and his father Mohammad, Britain’s first Muslim MP, had experienced similar abuse at the time of his election in 1997. ""I thought we as a country had come a long way in that 20 years but sadly it seems people still hold those views,"" he added. Mr Sarwar lost out to Richard Leonard in last autumn's Scottish Labour leadership contest, which was sparked by the resignation of Kezia Dugdale. He says he does not believe he lost due to his ethnic background, but added that he had spoken out to raise awareness about racism and Islamophobia. Describing the alleged remarks aimed at him, he told the Daily Record: ""A leader of a Labour council group told me very clearly the reason that he couldn't support me in the leadership election was that, in his words, Scotland wasn't ready for a 'brown, Muslim P***'. ""When I challenged him on that, saying it was a racist, Islamophobic comment, he said that wasn't his opinion, it was his fear about what his constituents believe."" Mr McLachlan said: ""I categorically deny these deeply hurtful allegations. ""I'm stunned and dismayed at the claims that I would say such things, and I will defend myself robustly in the party's investigation and in any actions that follow. ""Early in the campaign I pledged my support to Anas but later decided to support Mr Leonard. Anas will know this and would understandably be disappointed."""

Flores said he drove into the zone to change a damaged tyre, according to local media reports. Surveillance at the UN World Heritage site will be strengthened to prevent further damage. The Nazca Lines are carved on the surface of the coastal desert and depict creatures and plants. It is thought they are between 1,500 and 2,000 years old."
2018-01-31,"After an historic Commons vote, MPs and peers are to move out of the Houses of Parliament while the crumbling building is repaired and restored at a cost of around £4bn.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180201060040/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-vote-to-leave-parliament-during-six-year-refurbishment-11231458,"At the end of a three-hour debate, MPs voted by 236 to 220, a majority of just 16, to go ahead with controversial plans for a ""full and timely decant"" of the Palace of Westminster. But in a move urged by Theresa May to keep costs down, MPs voted by 234-185 for a motion proposing only essential work between now and the next election and a review of the cost of further work. The move out of Parliament for MPs and peers will not happen before 2025, the Government insisted, and MPs are likely to move to a temporary Commons chamber in Whitehall. And because of security concerns, part of Whitehall will be included in a new security zone, which could mean two of Westminster's most famous pubs - the St. Stephen's Tavern and the Red Lion - closing. It will be the first time MPs have moved out of the Palace of Westminster since the Second World War, when the Commons chamber was badly damaged by bombing. The House of Lords is due to vote on the proposals next week, but MPs who back the move out of the Palace of Westminster are confident that peers will back the decisions taken by the Commons. The so-called ""decant"" was bitterly opposed by a large group of mainly veteran MPs - mostly Tories - who proposed an amendment aiming to keep the Commons inside the Houses of Parliament. Their amendment, which was not voted on after the ""full and timely decant"" was backed, proposed: ""During the progress of work, the debating chamber of the House of Comons will remain in the Palace of Westminster or Portcullis House."" Younger MPs have told Sky News the older MPs are motivated by self-interest because they don't want to end their days in the House of Commons in temporary accommodation. But in response to opponents of the move out, who were led by the veteran Eurosceptic Sir Edward Leigh, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom promised a legal guarantee that MPs and peers will return to Parliament after restoration. Opening the debate, she said she had listened ""very closely to very real concerns"" that MPs and peers may be ""forced out, never to return"" by moves to secure the long-term future of the Palace of Westminster. Experts claim parts of the Houses of Parliament are crumbling and there have been warnings that a catastrophic fire could occur unless ageing electrical systems are replaced. Mrs Leadsom told MPs there could be ""no blank cheque"" for this work, but warned of ""critical risks"" in the Palace of Westminster - revealing there have been 60 incidents over the last 10 years which had the potential to cause a serious fire. ""The Palace of Westminster in all cases will remain the home of our Parliament,"" she said. ""That has always been the plan. To make absolutely clear, full or partial decant will not take place until 2025 at the earliest."" Answering MPs who feared they would not return, she said: ""I am happy to confirm today that were the House to agree that we must take action now, this commitment to return to the Palace will be enshrined in the legislation the Government will subsequently introduce to set up the sponsor body and delivery authority. ""It will be on the face of the Bill, putting the matter beyond doubt."" One of the leading supporters of a move out, Labour MP Chris Bryant, told MPs: ""In the end, this place is here to make decisions on behalf of the nation. ""It's time we got a grip and made a decision. I don't mind what the decision is in the end, but make a decision we must surely to God."" In his first speech since quitting as the Prime Minister's former deputy, Damian Green said Parliament was not safe in its current condition and it was not a ""wild exaggeration"" to say it was a ""death trap"". Referring to the Grenfell Tower fire, Mr Green added: ""Having seen the appalling effects of a fire in a building that had inadequate protection, it would be the height of irresponsibility not to take action to make safe a building which we know is now barely safe and which is getting more dangerous every year."" But in his speech opposing the move, Sir Edward said: ""Do not believe it will only be for five years. ""I predict that we will be out of this building for 10 or even 12 years because actually the Canadian parliament, they are moving out for 12 years. ""And we have to say to our constituents, do we really believe at this time of unparalleled austerity we should now take the decision to spend upfront, this evening, £5bn on our own working place? ""I think that's a very difficult decision, a very difficult argument to make to our constituents."""

The international development minister then promptly walked out of the chamber to cries of ""no"" from fellow peers. Labour said a simple apology would have sufficed and the Prime Minister later rejected his resignation. Lord Bates, the former MP for Langbaurgh, was due in the Lords chamber for oral questions on a strategy for reducing inequality. But another frontbench colleague, Lord Taylor, appeared to be caught off-guard when he was forced to answer instead. Lord Bates arrived toward the end of the half-an-hour slot, just before former foreign secretary William Hague gave a speech on the Brexit bill. Lord Bates stood to offer ""sincere apologies"" for the ""discourtesy"" of not arriving on time to answer the question. Baroness Lister appeared to nod her head in acknowledgement, but Lord Bates continued on. He said: ""During the five years of which it's been my privilege to answer questions from this despatch box on behalf of the Government, I've always believed that we should rise to the highest possible standards of courtesy and respect in responding on behalf of the Government to the legitimate questions of the legislature. ""I'm thoroughly ashamed at not being in my place and therefore I will be offering my resignation to the Prime Minister with immediate effect. I do apologise."" He walked out of the chamber past Lords leader Baroness Evans, who looked shocked. Her Labour shadow dismissed it as a ""minor discourtesy of which any of us can be guilty of on occasion""."
2018-01-31,"Up to 30,000 free-to-use cash machines - 45% of the UK total - are on course to disappear over the next five years amid cuts in fees received by operators, it is being claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180201060040/https://news.sky.com/story/atm-body-warns-30000-free-cash-machines-to-go-11230358,"According to the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA), changes to the so-called interchange fees - charges paid to operators by banks per withdrawal - being imposed by the LINK network will cut access to cash at a time when banks are shutting more branches. LINK has previously argued that the cost of running its network is unsustainable at a time when more people are banking online and using contactless card payments. It announced on Tuesday that it was bringing forward a series of measures that it said would safeguard access to free cash. It said a new fee structure would ""shift incentives from deploying ATMs in city centres to rural and less-affluent communities"" to secure free-to-use machines for the whole of the country. According to LINK, the changes would mean free ATMs that are more than 1,000m from the next free machine are exempt from cuts to fees - and those in rural communities would get an enhanced subsidy to incentivise continued provision. The majority of machines - mostly in major towns and cities - would see a phased reduction in the interchange fee. John Howells, LINK's chief executive, said: ""LINK is committed to protecting free access to cash. ""The UK has a near record number of ATMs, yet the recent growth has led to the majority of these being placed in busy areas where there simply is no need for a new ATM."" He said the country was on course for a rebalancing of the network to ""protect and install new ATMs in locations that really need them."" But LINK was accused of ignoring criticism of fee cuts in its consultation. The ATMIA's executive director for Europe, Ron Delnevo, told Sky News it was ""rubbish"" to suggest the country had too many cash points amid industry predictions of a cash-less society. He said: ""There are forecast to be a further 3,000 bank branch closures in the next four years. ""Each branch has on average two ATMs, so those branch closures will see ATM numbers fall by 6,000 anyway. ""Why does LINK interchange have to be reduced to cause more ATMs to be removed? ""LINK's proposed reduction will render 25,000 to 30,000 free-to-use ATMs away from bank branches uneconomic over the next 4 to 5 years. ""Many will have to be removed or switch to pay-to-use."" MPs warned they would oppose any reduction in access to free cash. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: ""This will be the first major test for the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR). ""They must ensure that customers do not lose out as a result of LINK's proposals. ""LINK's monthly reports to the PSR on the impact of these changes should be put in the public domain. If concerns remain, the regulator should not hesitate to intervene."" Cardtronics, the country's largest independent operator with 20,000 ATMs, said it wanted more clarity on the potential impact of LINK's changes and demanded the PSR intervene. A spokesperson said: ""We need an ATM network that is able to respond to the changes in today's banking landscape, where we're already seeing record numbers of bank branch closures up and down the country. ""But the arbitrary cuts that LINK has announced, are not a viable solution."""

Announcing the inquiry, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee Neil Parish said: ""Sky News has really highlighted the problem of real fur being passed off as fake fur, and it is essential that government and retailers do more to stamp this out. ""We are delighted to say we will be holding an inquiry into the problem in March to put pressure on retailers and the government to act."" He added retailers ""need to be much more careful, checking it out, and if there's any doubt it should be tested before putting it on shelves"". Sky News revealed real animal fur items being sold by TK Maxx, Boohoo, Amazon, Missguided, Groupon, House of Fraser and Miss Bardo - despite all being advertised as ""faux"" fur. A fibres expert found the products were in fact were made from rabbit, mink, raccoon, dog, fox and cat fur. Humane Society International has been campaigning for a fur imports ban - a proposal that is gaining political support. Claire Bass, the charity's executive director, told Sky News: ""We are delighted that EFRA is going to put a spotlight on this issue, and urge action by government and retailers. ""This is a scandal for both animal protection and consumer protection because the vast majority of Brits want no part in the cruel and unnecessary fur trade. We need to turn back the tide of the cheap mislabelled 'fake faux fur' that's been sneaking in through the back door. ""We banned fur farming in the UK back in 2000, because it was deemed unethical. Why are we now paying countries like China and Poland to keep animals in those exact same conditions?"" When Sky News brought the fur issue to the attention of the retailers, Groupon said it would investigate, while TK Maxx offered customers a refund if they wished to return a product. Boohoo said it took the items down from its site and launched an investigation. Amazon explained Marketplace sellers had to follow guidelines and those who did not face account removal. It also said the items had been removed from sale. Miss Bardo told Sky News it feels ""appalled that we have been misled by an overseas manufacturer into buying a hat that is not faux fur"" and will not be using them again."

A police spokesman said officers were called to the facility at 3.19pm on Wednesday and that the prisoner had died at the scene. He said the prisoner's family had been told and formal identification would soon take place. ""A post-mortem examination will be held in due course. ""No arrests have been made.

The report, published last November, said that, despite ""serious efforts"", the prison remained a ""dangerous place"", with 40-50 violent incidents in a typical month. At the time the report was written, the prison was ""consistently"" short of staff, it added. It also said that Carillion, the organisation contracted for maintenance services to the prison, was ""not able to adequately maintain the fabric of the prison"". The report added: ""Managers and officers are expected to work - and prisoners are expected to live - in unacceptable conditions, which are not only indecent but also represent a threat to the security of the prison.""

Speaking to the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Gracie described how - after she submitted a grievance over her pay last year - the BBC told her she had been ""inadvertently underpaid"" since 2014. That was the same year Jon Sopel was appointed the BBC's North America editor, who earns between £200,000 and £249,000, compared to Gracie's salary of less than £150,000. Gracie revealed she believed she had ""won a commitment to pay parity"" when accepting the China role in December 2013. She explained this was why she got ""such a shock"" when the BBC was forced to reveal Sopel's pay and the salaries of other top-earning stars last year. Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen was listed with a salary of between £150,000 and £199,999, but neither Gracie or fellow international editor Katya Adler were among the BBC's best paid. Gracie told MPs the BBC have said her pay discrepancy ""was not pay discrimination"", adding: ""They haven't called it pay discrimination either. ""I'm not an employment lawyer but it sounds to me like a tacit admission that it is pay discrimination in that they want to pay me now nearly £100,000 in back pay. ""The thing that is very unacceptable to me is they have basically said in the previous years - 2014, 2015, 2016 - I was in development. ""It is an insult to add to the original injury. It is unacceptable to talk to your senior women like that."" Gracie said she doesn't want the back pay and accused the BBC of ""trying to throw money at me to resolve the problem"". Admitting at one point she was ""getting emotional"" as she delivered her evidence, Gracie spoke of her admiration for her male colleagues at the BBC. ""I've been proud to stand alongside them as an international editor for four years,"" she said. ""What I want to talk about more is the sense in which my case is just an example of a bigger problem. ""I was a senior person who they really wanted to keep in position... if the BBC can't sort it out for me, then how can it sort it out for more vulnerable people who don't have a public profile."" Attacking the BBC's ""corporate machine"" for their handling of the row, Gracie said: ""We're not in the business of producing toothpaste or tyres at the BBC. Our business is truth. We can't operate without the truth. ""If we're not prepared to look at ourselves honestly, how can we be trusted to look at anything else in reporting honestly?"" She also spoke of a ""very strange day"" last Friday when the BBC reported four and then, later, six male presenters - including Mr Sopel - had agreed to have their salaries cut. Gracie won support for her testimony from senior politicians on Twitter, with former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman praising her ""heartfelt, compelling words"". Also appearing before the committee was BBC director-general Tony Hall, who denied there is an ""old boys' network"" at the corporation. Lord Hall said: ""The idea of some old boys' club, I abhor. ""That is not the way I believe the BBC should be or is."" He had earlier said the BBC had not discriminated against Gracie but that there were ""differences in the work"" between her post and that of the North Africa and Middle East roles filled by men. ""We will not discriminate on gender between anybody but there are differences in the work, the nature of the work and the amount of work between say North America and China,"" he said. ""The range between those two has been too big and I'm sorry about that but there is a difference in the scope and the scale of the two jobs."" It came as the UK's equality watchdog announced it will be meeting with a group, made up of more than 170 female BBC presenters and producers, after they dismissed an audit that found ""no evidence of bias in pay decision-making"". The Equality and Human Rights Commission, which has previously written to the BBC over Gracie's resignation, said in a statement: ""We received a response from the BBC yesterday and are now in the process of analysing it before we take any further action. ""We are also looking seriously at the concerns of BBC Women and will soon be meeting the group to discuss them in more detail."""
2018-01-31,Disadvantaged schoolchildren in the North are found to be on average one GCSE grade behind their peers in other parts of the country.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180201060040/https://news.sky.com/story/children-in-the-north-of-england-are-falling-behind-11231653,"The Northern Powerhouse Partnership says the disparity is leading to a serious skill shortage for employers. The report examines a child's development from nursery to the workplace and found primary schools in the North to perform only slightly worse than those in London. It is at secondary school that the gap widens. A major factor is disadvantage. This is said to be drastically impairing a child's performance and leaving them behind the rest of the UK when they leave school. :: PM's 'wobble' over Northern Powerhouse The Northern Powerhouse Partnership is calling for major government investment for worse-off families and for companies to partner with schools. Collette Roche who lead the review said: ""This report should act as a wake-up call to everyone involved in education and skills in realising how far the North is behind the rest of the UK and where we need to get to. ""The devastating consequences of disadvantage in the North is fully set out, as is just how far our children from all backgrounds fall behind by the age of 16. These critical issues lead to employers not having a highly-skilled workforce, which is vital for increasing productivity and growth across the North."" You don't need to look very far in certain areas of the North to see the impact disadvantage has on the lives of young people. At a youth project in Birkenhead we met Jared. ""I sat around on my backside for about three years,"" he said. ""I didn't have no idea what I wanted to do in life until it started to hit me at 21 when I had no future. I didn't even have a beginning of a future."" Jared has recently started his first job as a cleaner. He beams as he tells me he doesn't care that his shifts begin at 4am because it feels so good to be earning his own money. The crisis here is twofold. Young people like Jared are leaving school feeling they have no prospects. And employers are struggling to find skilled school leavers to fill their workforce which is harmful to the economy. The report is challenging companies to work with the same number of young people as they have employees to train, inspire and recruit. University Technical Colleges are already doing this. They are schools for 14-18 year olds which are partnered with employers, teaching mainstream subjects as well as technical skills. We joined an engineering class at UTC Warrington and met one young student who said her GCSEs were pathing the way for her dream job as a civil structural engineer. The Department for Education says its standards are rising, ""We want all pupils to benefit from a world class education that inspires them to make the most of their lives, no matter where they live or their background,"" it said. ""That's why we launched our Social Mobility Action Plan which sets out a range of actions including targeting the areas that need the most support through the £72m Opportunity Areas programme and our recent investment in literacy to help every child arrive at school with the vocabulary levels they need to learn."""

The research has prompted criticism from campaigners who argue the whales should not be ""imprisoned"". Claire Bass, UK director of the Humane Society International, said Wikie's ability to imitate human speech ""is as tragic as she is fascinating"". ""She is certainly further proof that these are highly intelligent mammals whose captivity in marine parks in the 21st century should come to an end,"" Ms Bass told Sky News. ""She is also a painful reminder that in the wild where these awesome animals swim free, they communicate with each other using complex language and even group-specific dialects, natural communication that is utterly denied them in captivity."" People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said orcas belong in the wild where each family has its own ""culture and a unique group dialect"". The charity's director Elisa Allen told Sky News: ""How deeply ironic that this research, which speaks volumes of the emotional intelligence of orcas, was conducted in a marine park's cement cell, where they're imprisoned and denied everything that's natural and important to them in order to make money from tourists. ""If we had the intelligence to understand her own sophisticated language, we would hear her calling to be free."" The experiments were carried out at Marineland Aquarium in southern France, which faced criticism in 2015 after one its killer whales died during flooding. Last year the company vowed to fight a ban on breeding killer whales and dolphins in captivity, claiming it would harm its animals. SeaWorld stopped breeding killer whales after facing heavy criticism of their treatment in the wake of documentary Blackfish. Wikie is believed to be the first member of her species to mimic human speech. The orca was taught to copy novel sounds and words from both another killer whale - her own three-year-old calf, Moana - and by humans. She ""spoke"" while partially immersed in water with her blowhole exposed to the air. The human words and phrases she attempted to copy included ""ah ah"", ""hello"", ""bye bye"", ""Amy"", ""one two"" and ""one two three"". The scientist who led the study said it was conceivable that basic ""conversations"" with her may one day be possible. Dr Jose Abramson, from Complutense de Madrid University in Spain, said: ""We will gain more if we try to understand the natural way each species communicates in its own environment than if we try to teach a human language."""

Most concretely, the PM rejected Mr Barnier's position that full EU freedom of movement should apply to anyone coming to the UK until the end of the transition period in December 2020. ""I'm clear there's a difference between those people who came prior to us leaving and those who will come when they know the UK is no longer a member of the EU,"" she told reporters. It was a matter within the implementation phase that was ""for negotiation"" she said. To the suggestion that the EU had ""torn up"" its agreement from phase one of the talks in December, the PM said: ""When we agreed the citizens' rights deal in December, we did so on the basis that people who had come to the UK when we were a member of the EU had set up certain expectations. ""They made a life choice and set up certain expectations and it was right that we have made an agreement that ensured they could continue their life in the way they had wanted to. ""Now for those who come after March 2019, that will be different - because they will be coming to a UK that they know will be outside the EU"". It is one of potentially three areas that the Government will try to negotiate with on the terms of what it calls the implementation period. The Government also has reservations over the manner in which the UK will retain influence over new EU law applied during this phase. There may also be some attempt to regain some powers outside the Common Fisheries Policy before the end of 2020. Mrs May rejected the idea that officials were privately agreeing a longer transition period than ""around two years"". She said: ""On the length of the implementation period, people were saying, 'oh we're secretly negotiating for three years'. No - we're not."" When asked if this was ""an absolute guarantee"" that transition would not last beyond the next election, the PM replied: ""We're very clear. I said in the Florence speech that we expected it to be around two years because that is what seems to be the right period of time, practically. ""But I'm also very clear we are not talking about something that is going to go on and on. We're leaving the European Union. There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made."" Amid fears from Tory Brexiteers of backsliding on her Lancaster House speech red lines, the PM was also asked if ""hand on heart you believe in Brexit"". ""Yes,"" she replied. ""At the time of the referendum I voted Remain but I also said the sky wasn't going to fall in if we left the EU - and as people will see from the economic figures, we have seen actually that has indeed proved to be the case"". And in a message for those such as Chancellor Philip Hammond, who last week suggested that the UK-EU economic relationship would change only ""very modestly"", the PM said of the referendum: ""They did not vote for nothing to change."""
2018-01-31,A drug which means incurable breast cancer patients can live a normal life will now be used across the NHS in England.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180201060040/https://news.sky.com/story/perjeta-drug-which-prolongs-lives-of-incurable-breast-cancer-patients-approved-11231015,"Perjeta has been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for routine use after five years of assessment. Previously, it had only been available through the Cancer Drugs Fund since 2013, meaning many sufferers were not even given the option. Used in combination with trastuzumab and a chemotherapy drug called docetaxel, Perjeta - or Pertuzumab - can give men and women with secondary breast cancer a relatively normal life. Last year Scotland refused to make Perjeta available on the NHS as it could not justify the ""cost in relation to its health benefits"", the Scottish Medicines Consortium decided. Sarah Hepworth, 42, of Oxford, was diagnosed with primary and secondary breast cancer, which spread to her bones, in 2015 aged 39. She was put on Perjeta in December 2015 thanks to the Cancer Drugs Fund, but was always concerned if she had to come off it due to illness she would not be allowed it again. She told Sky News: ""I'm so happy Perjeta is now available on the NHS, the worry of being taken off it has vanished and now thousands of others with secondary breast cancer can use it. ""I was initially on chemotherapy which was horrific, I had terrible side effects and I wasn't living, just surviving. ""When I was put on Perjeta, with two other drugs, it gave me a new lease of life and I really don't have the side effects. ""I now live a normal life, a new normal where I live by my last scan, but normal nonetheless. ""I can work, I'm back at my previous job as a solutions manager for Royal Mail, and people on the street wouldn't even know I have cancer. ""It's so important when you have cancer, and you're brain is still fine, to feel like you can contribute to society. ""Yes, I have to go to the hospital every three weeks and be hooked up to an IV drip so I can take the drugs, but otherwise my life is normal. ""I describe the drugs as like the game Whac-a-Mole, they whack the cancer cells down when they try to emerge. ""It's my armoury against the cancer cells."" Mrs Hepworth is part of a group of breast cancer sufferers organised through the charity, Breast Cancer Care. ""A few of the other women I know from the group are on Perjeta and they have had the same experience, so I'm so pleased more women can now have access to it,"" she added. ""These drugs make a huge difference to us."" Samia al Qadhi, chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said: ""This is a watershed moment. After over five years of unbearable uncertainty, access to a pioneering combination of treatments for people living with incurable secondary breast cancer has finally been guaranteed on the NHS. ""This innovative treatment offers women and men with incurable breast cancer the precious chance of around an extra year to live their lives with loved ones and be there for the moments that matter. ""So it is frustrating that women in Scotland are now at an unfair disadvantage since the drug was rejected seven months ago. ""Anxious waits for vital drugs, like Perjeta, must be consigned to history. And it is also crucial the fundamentals of cancer treatment do not suffer in a struggling NHS. Delivering the best care possible for people living with incurable breast cancer cannot be neglected."""

He was taken to hospital as a precaution after teachers washed his face with cold water. Durham Police subsequently arrested a 14-year-old girl on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and she was released pending further investigation. Nick Lindsey, the school's headteacher, said the incident occurred after an argument during a chemistry lesson on 23 January. He added that the chemical solution is used as part of the Key Stage 4 curriculum. He said: ""Staff reacted quickly and appropriately and we have received an email from the boy's mother, thanking us for the 'professional, thorough and caring' way it was dealt with."" The girl will be disciplined by the school. The three chemicals are not highly acidic on their own, but can be harmful in certain solutions. They do not react with one another."

We're friends again. The warm, reassuring words of President Trump at Davos will be music to Theresa May's ears.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20180201060040/https://news.sky.com/story/special-us-uk-relationship-it-depends-on-donald-trumps-mood-when-he-wakes-up-11222446,"The President said the US and the UK were ""very much joined at the hip"". He didn't actually use the word ""special"" - Mrs May did that. But he said it was a ""really great relationship"". Since Theresa May rushed to Washington a year ago to pay homage at the court of King Trump, things haven't exactly gone smoothly. Mr Trump has tweeted criticism of British intelligence services over terrorism and re-tweeted posts from the far-right organisation Britain First. He then cancelled a trip to open the new US embassy in London, criticising its cost and ""off"" location. It was all a bit disingenuous. The truth is that Mr Trump's team feared any visit would be mired by protests. But it is also true that America is turning away from the ""special relationship"" and has been for some time. For instance, President Obama was far more concerned with his relationship with Europe than Britain specifically. It has been noted by British diplomats that the first state visit to Washington of a foreign leader will not be Mrs May but rather Emmanuel Macron of France. And although the two leaders in Davos agreed to finalise details of a planned visit to the UK later in the year, don't be surprised if it is not a state visit or even doesn't take place at all. As much as he would love the red carpet treatment and the pomp and ceremony, Mr Trump won't want demonstrations everywhere he goes. In America they'll be running into the crucial mid-term elections and so he will have the perfect excuse to stay away if he wants to. There is also the delicate issue of the Royal Wedding in May. It is very difficult to see Prince Harry inviting Donald Trump to his nuptials It is all pretty awkward for the Prime Minister. A post-Brexit Britain will need America more than ever, just at the time when America is turning away from the special relationship. That's why President Trump's words on trade will be especially reassuring to Mrs May. ""Trade is going to increase many times and we look forward to that"", he said. Talks have begun on a post-Brexit trade deal, but they will not be easy. There are many hurdles to negotiate before Britain gets anything like what it wants or needs. The relationship is being tested in other ways. Mr Trump's decisions to pull out of the Paris climate change deal, to threaten to wreck the Iran nuclear agreement and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem have all irked British diplomats . But the obsession about whether the relationship is special or not is a very British thing. I haven't heard many Americans even mention it. I'm not sure they know it even exists. Critics say Mr Trump's tweets suggest he will not be a reliable partner for Britain. He will have only America's interests at heart - or so the theory goes. I am not so sure. He knows there are deep ties and he knows they will outlive his presidency. He also knows Britain remains America's most reliable ally. There is close co-operation on surveillance, security and military matters and both sides recognise the importance of that. But Trump is Trump. Impulsive, unorthodox, difficult and unpredictable. Special relationship? It depends on his mood when he wakes up."

He was touching me the whole time - he was literally gripping me. I was covered in bruises - and not just my arms. He bruised my body and my breasts. :: 'Night Watcher' burglar may be highly trained soldier I immediately said to him, ""I'll get you the jewellery out of the safe, you can have it, and then just get out."" He went upstairs with me to the dressing room, and I quickly opened the safe. He specifically asked me, ""Are you alone?"" I told him it was just me and the dog. She's a domestic dog, not a guard dog, and she was cowering on the bed. I thought, ""Why did you tell him that? He's going to shoot your dog."" He told me to get on the floor - that was the moment when I thought he was going to rape me. I was very frightened - absolutely petrified - it's just a horrible feeling. All that time I did not tell him that my husband was coming back. I absolutely did not want him to know, because I feared for Stephen's life. I knew what would happen if Stephen came through the door in the middle of all of this. He was gripping me, and he was unbelievably strong, really big and holding a shotgun. He made me touch the shotgun to show me it was real and not plastic. It started to get even more frightening, because he pointed the shotgun at my chest and I literally thought, ""This is it, it's all over. He's going to kill me."" He got more and more angry, and started hitting me. He hit me three times in face and head. It really hurt. Afterwards I thought, ""This man knows how hard to hit me to frighten me but to not knock me out."" So I had the shotgun at my chest. I still said I couldn't open the second safe because I didn't have the code. All I could see were his eyes, because he had a balaclava on, and he had gloves too. He started getting things from his pocket. I was having trouble getting my bracelet and ring off - I was afraid he was going to cut me or cut off my finger. Then I realised he was getting out cable ties, and was going to tie me up. I finally told him my husband was coming home. He said, ""I'll shoot him."" He was very angry. He told me to get on the floor again, and then dragged me by my hair across the floor. It really hurts when someone drags you by your hair. I was covered in bruises, all along my side and on my foot. He started to go towards the door, and I told him, ""You've got loads of jewellery, now get out of my house."" He seemed to have decided to leave, and he pulled me down the stairs to the front door, and I unlocked it. I was still terrified he was going to wait in the garden for Stephen. It was a wonderful moment when I finally slammed that front door behind him, but I'm now afraid to stay in the house on my own, I'm very jumpy and nervous of loud noises. I'm taking medication for anxiety. It's had a massive effect. I love my home, but I don't feel comfortable there anymore.

The women, commonly called grid girls, are often seen carrying the drivers' standards which indicate their race numbers and their location on the starting line. They also often line the route that the top three drivers take as they head to the podium at the end of a race. Sean Bratches, managing director of commercial operations at F1, said: ""Over the last year we have looked at a number of areas which we felt needed updating so as to be more in tune with our vision for this great sport. ""While the practice of employing grid girls has been a staple of Formula 1 grands prix for decades, we feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values and clearly is at odds with modern day societal norms. ""We don't believe the practice is appropriate or relevant to Formula 1 and its fans, old and new, across the world."" Liberty Media, the sport's organiser, said the changes would apply to other motorsports it organises during grand prix weekends. The sport said it still considers the time drivers and team members spend on the grid before a race should be one of ""celebration, where guests and various performers can add to the glamour"" but added that the aim now was that ""promoters and partners"" should ""showcase their countries and products"". The organisers of some of darts' biggest tournaments, the Professional Darts Corporation, also recently decided to stop using walk-on girls. Oh no!!!!!!!! That was going to be my next venture 😉😉😂 On a serious note.... really?!?!? Is that not part of motorsport? Also, job loss for the girls who take part. The grid girls I know enjoy their job. https://t.co/VkhfWnsS4v Tens of thousands of people, including former PDC world champion Raymond van Barneveld, signed a petition calling on the group to change its mind. Other sports still regularly employ women to preform various functions before and during events. Boxing and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) both feature ""ring girls"", who tell the crowd which round is coming up by holding up numbered cards, generally while wearing revealing outfits. If the lack of grid girls really impacts how you view motorsport, I think you need to take a long hard look at yourself. Cheerleaders are also used widely in American sports, with teams and franchises having their own professional squads. Cycling is another sport which traditionally uses ""podium girls"" to appear with race winners. Reaction on Twitter was, unsurprisingly, split."

Piercing is banned on 10 specific intimate body areas, including genitalia, nipples and tongues. Wales is the first country in the UK to introduce the nationwide ban. It comes under the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 which makes it an offence to arrange or perform intimate piercings on children and young people. Wales' chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton, said the law was to protect ""health and well-being"". ""It's concerning that a third of young people with intimate piercings have reported complications following a procedure,"" Dr Atherton said. ""The child protection issues that could also arise from this scenario highlight even further the importance of implementing such a law. ""I hope this piece of legislation will help to reduce these issues, and that practitioners understand the importance of obtaining proof of age beforehand."" The Welsh Government said a study in England found about a third of all people aged 16-24 who had body piercings experienced complications. Tongue piercings caused the most problems, followed by genital and nipple piercings, it said. ""As young people continue to grow during their teenage years, an intimate piercing performed at a young age could result in further complications arising as their bodies develop,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Young people may also be less likely to have the experience or knowledge of how to clean or maintain an intimate piercing, leading to an increased risk of infection."" Many dentists and patients welcome the ban, Wales' chief dental officer Dr Colette Bridgman said. ""Tongue piercing can lead to lasting damage to teeth and gums, and can cause serious swelling in the mouth that can affect breathing,"" she added. ""Many dentists in Wales have seen patients who have permanent harm following piercing and dental teams in Wales really welcome this new law."" Piercing artists have been told by the Welsh Government to have a ""rigid system"" in place to ensure they confirm proof of age and gain consent for each procedure."
