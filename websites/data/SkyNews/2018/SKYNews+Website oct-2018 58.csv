2018-10-01,One of President Donald Trump's senior advisers has referred to her own experience of being a victim of a sexual assault while defending the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/senior-trump-adviser-kellyanne-conway-reveals-she-was-a-victim-of-sexual-assault-11514041,"Kellyanne Conway said she had been a victim of sexual assault during an interview with CNN while discussing the FBI's investigation into Mr Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault and sexual misconduct by three women. ""I feel very empathetic, frankly, towards victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape,"" Ms Conway said. Continuing after a brief pause, she added: ""I'm a victim of sexual assault."" The 51-year-old has previously hinted that she was molested by a congressman in the past but has given no further details. She said that women who survive such experiences should be heard, but that it was unfair to condemn Mr Kavanaugh for an alleged action 36 years ago that could not be confirmed. Ms Conway denied accusations that the White House is ""micromanaging"" the investigation into Mr Kavanaugh's background. She insisted it will be ""limited in scope"" and ""will not be a fishing expedition"". ""The FBI is not tasked to do that,"" she added. The story has transfixed the US and could have wide-reaching implications for the country for years to come Mr Trump ordered the new FBI investigation on Friday, as the Senate delayed a final vote on Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation as the key ninth member of the Supreme Court. The delay followed a dramatic televised Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which university professor Christine Blasey Ford accused the federal appeals court judge of assaulting her in the 1980s. Mr Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations made against him."
2018-10-01,A man who had acid thrown at his face while he sat in his car on a busy street has made a direct plea for information from his hospital bed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/acid-attack-victim-posts-online-appeal-from-hospital-bed-11514026,"Mike Glover-Johnson posted a picture of himself on Facebook wrapped in a facial bandage following the incident on Bloxwich High Street, near Walsall, West Midlands, at around 6.50pm on Sunday. He was sitting in his parked car at the time when he was approached and had a corrosive substance hurled in his face. He was rushed to hospital after suffering facial injuries. In his online post, he wrote: ""Any witnesses to me being randomly attacked with acid on Bloxwich high street thus (sic) evening please contact police on 101. ""Thankfully people helped and their quick reactions may have stopped permanent scarring. Thank you Lee Glover-Johnson for being by my side."" A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ""The investigation is at an early stage, the motive is unknown and police are keeping an open mind. ""A number of enquiries are under way, including a CCTV trawl, officers are also trying to identify what the substance was. ""At this stage, officers believe this to be an isolated incident."" :: Police are appealing to anyone who saw anything, or who may have information to contact West Midlands Police on 101, quoting log number 2177 30/9."
2018-10-01,Boris Johnson will storm into the Tory conference to a rapturous welcome from activists and launch a blistering attack on Theresa May and her policy on Brexit.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-to-use-conference-speech-to-show-his-pm-credentials-11514795,"He will spend just a few hours in Birmingham, but will deliver a barnstorming speech his supporters hope will pave the way for a Tory leadership bid within weeks. The former foreign secretary will call on the prime minister and the Cabinet to ""chuck Chequers"", after controversially describing the plan as ""deranged"" at the weekend. And in his lunchtime speech at a ConservativeHome fringe event, he will say the Tories need to ""believe in Conservative values"" if they are to beat Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Setting himself directly at odds with the prime minister and Chancellor Philip Hammond, Mr Johnson will put tax cuts at the top of his personal policy agenda. Sky News is calling for an independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates Mr Johnson will receive a rock star welcome from adoring pro-Brexit Tory activists, in a provocative stunt that will dismay and incense the PM's supporters. On the opening day of the conference, the former trade minister Digby Jones denounced Mr Johnson as ""irrelevant and offensive"" for attacking business. But Mr Johnson will reinforce the view of many Tory MPs that he is poised to strike against Mrs May by using his speech to spell out his leadership credentials as well as attacking the Chequers plan. He will urge the Conservative Party not to ""ape Corbyn"", but instead take ""basic Conservative ideas and fit them to the problems of today"". Attacking Mr Corbyn's Labour conference speech, Mr Johnson will say: ""It was astonishing that he had absolutely nothing to say about the wealth-creating sector of the economy. ""The people who get up at the crack of dawn to prepare their shops: the grafters and the grifters, the innovators, the entrepreneurs. He didn't mention any successes. ""We Conservatives know that it is only a strong private sector economy that can pay for superb public services and that is the central symmetry of our one nation Toryism."" Setting out his leadership manifesto in a wide-ranging speech, Mr Johnson will urge the party to focus on law and order, tax cuts and building more homes in its bid to beat Labour at the next election. He will say: ""We must on no account follow Corbyn and start to treat capitalism as a kind of boo word. ""We can't lose our faith in competition and choice and markets. But we should re-state the truth that there is simply no other system that is so miraculously successful in satisfying human wants and needs. Economics editor Ed Conway cuts through the text and highlights the key points from the government's post-Brexit hopes ""We should set our taxes to stimulate investment and growth. We should be constantly aiming not to increase but to cut taxes. ""It is the Conservative approach that gets things done. So let's follow our Conservative instincts."" Ahead of Mr Johnson's whirlwind visit to Birmingham, he was attacked by the Chancellor, who told Sky News: ""Of course Boris is a big personality. Nobody's denying that. ""What I'm saying is that the business of government is a process of attention to detail, follow-through and lots of hard work. ""It isn't just about making flamboyant statements and big announcements - it's about getting things done."""
2018-10-01,A man has been found guilty of murdering his young daughter and making a threat to kill his ex-partner.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/father-guilty-of-murdering-8-year-old-mylee-billingham-11514521,"Unemployed factory worker William Billingham stabbed eight-year-old Mylee through the chest with a kitchen knife in an act of revenge against his ex-partner, a trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard. Moments before killing his daughter, Billingham, 55, had held the knife to the neck of Mylee's mother Tracey Taundry, 34. Billingham claimed he could not remember stabbing Mylee and he did not give evidence during the nine-day trial. He had said he was guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter, due to depression. Prosecutors disagreed, saying that he had killed Mylee to punish Miss Taundry for beginning a relationship with another woman. Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC described the killing as ""swift, deliberate, clinical, brutal...not some manic unfocused assault"". He added: ""This was no accident and it was not a slight injury - it was a deep, violent thrust of a lethal weapon into the most vulnerable part of his young daughter's body."" Jurors were told that Miss Taundry had been outside Billingham's house in Brownhills, near Walsall, as her daughter was murdered. She had called 999, telling operators to hurry, as she could hear Mylee pleading with her father to stop. Detective Inspector Jim Colclough, of the West Midlands Police homicide unit, said officers sent to the house were ""confronted by extremely upsetting scenes"". Mylee was lying injured under her father and ""everybody worked together tirelessly to try and save her"", he said. ""Right from when officers first attended and were desperately trying to administer crucial first aid on his daughter, he refused to cooperate or even tell them her name. ""In fact all he could manage to utter was the words 'COPD' which relate to a lung condition he suffers from - it demonstrates how selfish he is; his daughter was fighting for her life and all he was concerned with was himself. ""A young girl, who had her whole life ahead of her, has been cruelly taken by someone who she loved and trusted. ""This is a despicable act on a defenceless child."" A psychiatrist said Billingham was aggressive, controlling and prone to violence towards women, especially at the end of relationships. One of his previous partners told police she was headbutted by him during their relationship and harassed by him for two years after they broke up. The father of six was convicted in 1990 of causing actual bodily harm in an attack on his girlfriend at the time and he was cautioned twice in 2007 and 2012 after allegations of violence towards Miss Taundry. Billingham had suffered ""some sort of breakdown"" during the trial, according to his lawyer David Mason QC. In comments made in the jury's absence - which were not able to be reported until the conclusion of the trial - Mr Mason said: ""From speaking to him, he found the events at court - particularly watching evidence by way of CCTV footage of his daughter - highly distressing."" Billingham missed three days of the trial while in hospital following the apparent suicide attempt. The jury deliberated for around 80 minutes before convicting Billingham. He will be sentenced on Tuesday. An NSPCC spokesman said: ""We all have a duty to look out for a child's welfare and reporting concerns as soon as possible is hugely important. The NSPCC's helpline is available 24/7, 365 days a year, on 0808 800 5000."""
2018-10-01,"Philip Hammond has compared Theresa May's Brexit plan to the light bulb, as he called on colleagues to unite behind the prime minister to get the ""best possible outcome"" in the negotiations.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/philip-hammond-compares-theresa-mays-brexit-plan-to-the-light-bulb-11514350,"In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, the chancellor said he shared Mrs May's ""determination"" to get her Chequers blueprint for Britain's EU exit agreed. The plan has provoked fierce opposition from many within the party, who claim it would leave Britain too closely aligned to EU rules and fail to deliver on the result of the 2016 referendum. While Mr Hammond said he was maintaining ""enough fiscal firepower"" to support the economy in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, he predicted a ""deal dividend"" once the PM agrees an exit deal. Sky News is calling for an independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates He described Chequers as ""a plan which delivers on the decision of the British people; avoids a hard border in Ireland; preserves our precious Union and safeguards British jobs and British businesses"". And referring to opposition to elements of the plan from Brussels, Mr Hammond told delegates: ""Mr Tusk says it won't work, but that's what people said about the light bulb in 1878. ""Our job is to prove him wrong."" Brexit has dominated the first two days of the conference, with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launching yet another attack on the PM's handling of Brexit. Mr Johnson said Chequers was ""deranged"" and ""preposterous"" - but Mrs May used an interview on Sunday to say her plan ""isn't dead"". The chancellor hit out at his former Cabinet colleague ahead of his speech, dismissing Mr Johnson's Brexit strategy as a ""fantasy world"" and saying he does not expect him to become prime minister. The main thrust of Mr Hammond's speech was a bid to launch a Tory fightback on business and the economy, with pledges to boost apprenticeships and provide more help to small businesses. Four weeks before his next budget on 29 October, the chancellor pledged to work with business to tackle low wages, job insecurity and rising house prices. In one of the more eye-catching sections of his speech, Mr Hammond threatened internet giants with a new digital services tax to ensure they pay their fair share of the cost of public services. The prime minister kicks off Conservative party conference with a rebuttal to backbench critics, insisting Chequers 'isn't dead' With international talks on the measure stalling, the chancellor said Britain was prepared to forge ahead on its own with a levy on tech companies. The measure was part of what Mr Hammond referred to as a programme to ""regenerate capitalism"" to ensure it tackles the challenges of the modern world and appeal to a new generation. The chancellor acknowledged that many voters felt they had been ""left behind"" by changes in the economy and fear they would fall further behind with the rise of new technologies like artificial intelligence and driverless cars. Mr Hammond said the party needs to ""dare to change"" and ""renew the mandate for the market economy in the 21st century and with it the mandate of the modern Conservative Party to govern"". Part of the reasons voters backed Brexit was because ""a gap has opened up ... between the theory of how a market economy delivers and distributes rising prosperity and the reality experienced by ordinary people"". Mr Hammond said the Tories had to persuade ordinary people that the market system could work for them, or else they would fall for the ""seductive simplicities"" put forward by Jeremy Corbyn and Labour. He said the opposition was ""totally unfit to govern"", offering the ""failed and faded ideologies of socialism"". ""They value political ideology above real world solutions for real people,"" he said. ""All they do, is look it up in the Socialist manual: Railways? Nationalise them. Wealth? Confiscate it. Run out of money? Just borrow more. ""Answers from a discredited ideology that will never solve real-world problems."" But in what will be seen as an admission that many of Labour's policies have gained traction with the electorate, he said: ""While Labour's answers will solve nothing, their questions deserve a response. ""And we must answer their challenges with our own, Conservative solutions."" Labour's John McDonnell said Mr Hammond's speech showed the Tories were ""increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day to day life most people experience"". ""The Tories are bereft of any fresh ideas, forced to resort to a half-hearted filching of policies from others and desperately trying to revive long outdated slogans,"" the shadow chancellor said. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said Mr Hammond was ""simply wrong"" to talk of a dividend, claiming he was ""one of the few"" ministers who understand the ""grim realities of Brexit"". ""The Chancellor must not change his tune now just to appease Conservative conference,"" he said. The Confederation of British Industry said ""pride and confidence"" in business had ""made a comeback"" in the chancellor's speech, with director-general Carolyn Fairbairn warning: ""Ultimately actions speak louder than words."""
2018-10-01,Transport for London was unprepared for terror attacks using vehicles before Khalid Masood drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge last year. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/transport-for-london-was-unprepared-for-vehicle-attacks-before-westminster-11514671,"Five people were killed in the March 2017 attack, four of them having been hit by Masood's rented SUV. But an inquest into their deaths heard that there were no security barriers in place on the bridge at the time, nor were there barriers on London bridge when a similar attack took place there in June last year. As the highway authority, TfL would have been responsible for installing the barriers. Siwan Hayward, TfL's head of transport policing, said that the risk of a vehicle being used as a weapon on bridge's had not been appreciated at the time. The lack of awareness was despite the fact that earlier atrocities in Nice and Berlin has involved vehicles. She said the authority was constantly assessing pedestrian safety regarding risks such as slips or road crossings, but there was no expectation of a car terror attack. She said TfL has now “significantly raised our game” and was working ""proactively"" to consider ""protective security"". But there are still a number of crowded London streets that remain vulnerable. ""Clearly the nature of the threat we are now facing is... that the incitement from religious leaders and propagandists is 'any vehicle, any weapon, any place or anywhere',"" Ms Hayward said. The inquest, which began on 10 September, is entering its final week. The court has heard that Masood's history was chequered with violence and criminal convictions. Safety measures in place at the time of the attack have also been examined. Tributes to the victims - Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes, Aysha Frade, Andreea Cristea, and police officer Keith Palmer - were read on the first day. Monday's session heard that an AA Road Atlas had been found inside Masood's car. It included a list, written in its flyleaf, that ended with the cryptic remark ""hatred motivation"". Most of the items on the list were innocuous, but a police officer giving evidence said he was ""unable to explain"" the final remarks. The car's windscreen would have been smashed after hitting the first two victims, seriously impeding the attacker's vision. It was abandoned on the bridge during the attack. Detective Peter Holcroft, who investigated the possibility of further suspects, said there was no evidence that Masood had conspired with other people. The blood-stained body armour of PC Palmer, who was killed in the attack, was also examined by an expert, who said there was no body armour in the UK that would have protected PC Palmer from the strike that killed him. The inquest continues."
2018-10-01,A female football coach who admitted killing a teenager 14 years after the murder has been jailed for life. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/female-football-coach-jailed-after-admitting-unsolved-murder-of-teenager-from-2004-11514491,"Karen Tunmore, now 36, smashed 19-year-old Scott Pritchard over the head with a baseball bat outside his home in Sunderland in 2004, following a dispute over money. The murder remained unsolved until July this year when Tunmore walked into a police station to confess, saying she could no longer live with the guilt. In the years before the confession, Mr Pritchard's father, Robert Stacey, had been accused of murdering his own son, spending 16 weeks on remand before the case against him was dropped. In a statement read at Newcastle Crown Court, Mr Stacey said he received abuse over the accusation for more than a decade and became afraid to walk around Sunderland city centre ""for fear of being accused of a crime I did not commit"". He lost his home due to threats accusing him of murder, had a boulder thrown through his window and had been rejected by his family, he said. He also claimed that he was in a cell for 23 hours a day during his time on remand. Believing he had killed their son, Mr Stacey's ex-partner Kathleen Pritchard said she had come to hate him and she had become an alcoholic, suffering from paranoia. The investigation into Mr Pritchard's murder involved 300 police officers taking 1,600 statements and 4,000 documents. Police said that Tunmore appeared contrite when talking to police and provided details that made her confession credible, including describing how she had dumped the murder weapon in the sea and sold her bloodstained car. She had been owed £120 by a man named ""Ste"", who was in turn owed £120 by Mr Pritchard, Tunmore said. Drunk on vodka and alcopops, she asked ""Ste"" to drive her to Mr Pritchard, who was walking on crutches outside his home. She threatened to use her baseball bat to break his other leg when he did not provide her the cash, and smashed him over the head when he laughed at her. As he slumped on the wall injured, Tunmore continued to beat him on the top of the head, causing catastrophic brain injuries. She told police that she confessed to authorities with the support of a friend, following an attempt to kill herself and an admission that she had been haunted by voices urging her to murder again. She had a history of convictions including drunk and disorderly, public order offences, affray and carrying a blade. She was jailed with a minimum term of 17 and a half years. Mr Stacey was seriously ill at the time of the trial and did not attend court."
2018-10-01,"Tesco Bank has been fined £16.4m by the City watchdog over a ""largely avoidable"" cyber attack on the lender,  in the first penalty of its kind.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/tesco-bank-fined-164m-over-cyber-attack-11514150,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said deficiencies at the bank had left account holders vulnerable to an incident that netted cyber criminals £2.26m. The bank had received a specific warning that was not properly addressed until the attack had started and the response was ""too little, too late"", the watchdog concluded. It is the first time the FCA has issued a fine for a cyber-related incident. Tesco Bank said that since the incident in November 2016 it had ""significantly enhanced"" security measures, and apologised to customers. The FCA investigation concluded that the lender failed to exercise due skill, care and diligence in protecting its personal current account holders against a cyber attack. It said cyber criminals exploited weaknesses in the bank's design of its debit card, its financial crime controls and in its financial crime operations team to carry out the attack over a 48-hour period. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said the fine ""reflects the fact that the FCA has no tolerance for banks that fail to protect customers from foreseeable risks"". He added: ""In this case, the attack was the subject of a very specific warning that Tesco Bank did not properly address until after the attack started. ""This was too little, too late. ""Customers should not have been exposed to the risk at all."" He said banks must ensure resilience against such crime ""reducing the risk of a cyber attack occurring in the first place, not only reacting to an attack"". The FCA said that Tesco Bank would have been fined £33.6m - in line with a level of potential penalty first reported by Sky News - but for its cooperation with the investigation, a compensation programme for customers, and the fact that it had stopped ""a significant percentage"" of unauthorised transactions. Tesco Bank said the cyber attack did not involve the theft or loss of any customers' data but led to 34 transactions where funds were debited from customers' accounts, and other customers having normal service disrupted. The bank's chief executive Gerry Mallon said: ""We are very sorry for the impact that this fraud attack had on our customers."" Tesco Bank has a total of six million customers across products such as current and savings accounts, credit cards and loans. It made more than £200m in profit for its parent - currently the UK's largest retailer - during the last financial year, and has set out plans to expand its presence during the coming years. Benny Higgins, Tesco Bank's high-profile chief executive at the time of the 2016 incident, has since retired from the role, and been replaced by Mr Mallon, who joined from Ulster Bank. At the time of the cyberattack, Andrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, said it looked ""unprecedented in the UK"" and required urgent attention, although the sophistication and intensity of such incidents has evolved at a rapid pace in the nearly-two years since then."
2018-10-01,Every police force in England and Wales is no longer dealing with lost property so officers have more time to fight crime.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/43-police-forces-in-england-and-wales-to-stop-dealing-with-lost-property-11513918,"From 1 October, anyone who contacts the police about something they have lost will be redirected to private websites. Although some of these services are free, others carry a charge of £4.95 for every item reported. Services such as ReportMyLoss.com store lost property reports on a database which can be accessed by police forces - ""increasing the chances of lost items being identified and returned whilst decreasing the chances of associated criminality"". South Yorkshire Police says it receives 11,000 reports of lost property per year - 4,000 over the phone - even though such incidents are not a police matter. ""By not taking these reports anymore, we will save over 300 hours of staff time each year, which can be used to deal with reports of crime and antisocial behaviour,"" the force added. The decision to stop dealing with lost property was made by the National Police Chiefs' Council and follows a national government review and consultation with forces across the country, 29 of which took part. From 1 October, all 43 forces in England and Wales will only accept certain items such as mobile phones and tablets which may hold personal data. Forces will still accept items that may be linked to a crime - as well as firearms, weapons and ammunition, passports, drugs, pornography and items where the owner is identifiable. Gareth Morgan, the chief constable of Staffordshire Police, said: ""Over the years, police forces have traditionally accepted the responsibility of recording lost property and the public have come to expect this as a service. ""The number of lost property reports the force receives has declined year-on-year and the way in which the service is utilised has also changed; often the requirement being to validate lost property for insurance purposes. ""Change can always be viewed as contentious, however we will continue to take an active role in reuniting members of the public with their property should their items be found or later retrieved as stolen goods."" The new system does not affect stolen property, which can still be reported to police."

2018-10-01,It’s a sign of the times that a Tory Chancellor felt the need to use his headline conference speech to say the Conservatives remained the party of business.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-is-turning-traditional-tory-certainties-on-their-head-11514475,"But the internal Brexit divisions have tested what was once taken as a given. A core part of the government's Chequers proposals is to maintain a common rule book for goods and agricultural products with the EU. In addition to preserving an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister insist, is also the only way to protect the complex supply chains with the European market on which so many firms rely. Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates But for the many critics of the Chequers plan within the party, the concerns of business on this front have been overstated, or at least over-prioritised by the Government. The recording that emerged of Boris Johnson saying ""f*** business"" was the most eye-catching expression of that perspective, but plenty of Tory MPs believe that some additional trade friction at borders is not only manageable, but a price worth paying for a Brexit that does not tie the UK to EU rules indefinitely. The fact that this disagreement boils down to a question of political priorities is one reason it has become so intractable within the party. It forces an uncomfortable choice: to follow traditional instincts and listen to the lobbying of firms like Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota and Airbus, or place the importance of full sovereignty and free trade opportunities above those corporate concerns. So it was interesting that the Chancellor tried to change the calculation a little, and dangle a different carrot in his conference speech. Rather than just restating the importance of frictionless trade, he put forward the idea of a ""deal dividend"" - the idea that if the Chequers plan can be agreed with the EU, it will boost the economy and allow room for tax cuts. When it comes to Tory priorities, it would be reasonable to say that tax cuts play pretty high. Philip Hammond claimed he has enough ""fiscal firepower"" in his ""locker"" to see the economy through a no-deal Brexit, but the implicit message was that such an outcome would all but wipe out any chance of tax cuts in the foreseeable future. If the government stands by its insistence that a Canada-style deal is unacceptable, because it would require Northern Ireland to remain in the customs union and single market, the choice Philip Hammond is presenting is between a no-deal that would see the treasury use every spare penny to mitigate its impact, or a Chequers-based deal that could lead to tax cuts. Theoretically that should be a persuasive argument for Tory MPs, but the strength of feeling and the depth of division within the Conservative party on Brexit means theory has gone out of the window."

According to the government, while some businesses have changed their practices, Belgo, Bella Italia, Cafe Rouge, Giraffe, Prezzo and Strada all deduct 10%, and Ask and Zizzi 8%. Announcing the move, the prime minister said: ""The unemployment rate under this government is now the lowest since the 1970s - but we want to ensure that everyone is treated fairly in the workplace. ""That's why we will introduce tough new legislation to ensure that workers get to keep all of their tips - banning employers from making any deductions. It's another way we are building an economy that works for everyone."" The promise comes in the government's response to a consultation and will benefit many of the 1.8 million people who work in the hospitality industry in the UK. The government says the change will be fairer for both workers, who get to keep the tips left for them by customers, and customers, who leave tips specifically for the service they receive. The consultation showed that restaurant customers are overwhelmingly in favour of the tips they pay going to the people that serve them. The government also says it is another example of how it is cracking down on exploitative practices in the workplace. Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates ""We want to ensure both that workers' rights are always upheld, and that they're rewarded for their hard work, as part of our modern industrial strategy to create better paid and higher quality jobs across the country,"" said a government source. ""The change is part of the government's drive to back businesses to create good jobs while making sure the system works for ordinary people. ""It is in addition to the introduction of the National Living Wage, which when it was introduced increased the wages for roughly a quarter of the workers in the hospitality industry."" Responding to the PM's announcement, Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: ""This is now the fourth policy the Tories have copied from us at their conference, as they desperately try to catch up with Labour. ""It's beginning to feel like Groundhog Day. It's a shame that Unite have had to fight so hard to extract this concession from the Tories. ""And if only this pledge went as far as Labour's promises to precarious and freelance workers. ""Under Labour, gig economy workers and the self-employed will get sick pay and parental leave, just like everyone else."""
2018-10-01,She was the gifted little girl who used her intellectual abilities and telekinetic skills to rid her school of cruel head teacher Agatha Trunchbull.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/matilda-takes-on-new-nemesis-donald-trump-in-statues-for-30th-anniversary-of-roald-dahl-classic-11514216,"Now, 30 years after Roald Dahl's much-loved story was released, Matilda Wormwood has a new nemesis - in the shape of Donald Trump. A statue of the defiant little girl facing up to the US president has been unveiled near the author's former home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, to mark the anniversary of the book's publication. The idea came from a public survey by The Roald Dahl Story Company as part of a search to find out what fans think the grown-up Matilda would be doing today. Some 42% agreed Mr Trump would be her modern-day Trunchbull, with Prime Minister Theresa May coming second with 21% and Piers Morgan third with 16%. Bernie Hall, from The Roald Dahl Story Company, said: ""Matilda demonstrates that it's possible for anyone, no matter how small and powerless they feel, to defeat the Trunchbulls in their own lives - a message that feels more relevant today than it did 30 years ago."" :: Darkness was Dahl's golden ticket, says his daughter Matilda fan and Countdown lexicographer Susie Dent said: ""It's not surprising to hear that Donald Trump has been voted the figure she would be most likely to stand up to in 2018 - many clearly see in him some similar traits to the fictional headmistress Miss Trunchbull."" Created by a team of artists including Drew Roper, a Birmingham-based animation entrepreneur, the statues can be viewed at the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre for a few weeks. Figures shed a light on the preferences of library users across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland As part of the 30th celebrations, original illustrator Sir Quentin Blake has created several new drawings depicting Matilda in her thirties, which will be published in a special anniversary edition of the book. Here's what the artist thinks she might be up to now... But people voting in the poll thought the grown-up Matilda would most likely be working as a school teacher, with 24% agreeing she would have followed in the footsteps of her own favourite teacher and adoptive parent, Jennifer Honey."
2018-10-01,"Harold Wilson once asked the question: ""Where have all the Tories gone?""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/conservative-party-conference-where-have-all-the-tories-gone-11514720,"His answer then, back in 1974, was: ""Off to the City, every one."" The same question could be asked here at this Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham. Where have they gone? Not the City this time. I have been coming to Tory conferences since the mid-1980s, when Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp, and I have never seen the main hall so empty. It was full at the start on day one, for the speeches of party chairman Brandon Lewis and the ebullient Digby Jones, who gave a rumbustious after dinner-style speech, including his ""irrelevance and seriously offensive"" attack on Boris Johnson. Theresa May and her husband Philip were in the hall then, sitting a few rows back among the activists, in the way that David Cameron used to when he was leader. But when the PM and Philip left the hall after Digby Jones' speech, so did many of the audience, leaving it barely half full for the speeches of Liam Fox and Penny Mordaunt. Day two was much worse. And the empty seats reached a nadir for the late-afternoon speech of the new Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright. Now admittedly it was the graveyard slot at the end of the day, but there were fewer than 200 in the 2,262-seat Symphony Hall in Birmingham's International Convention Centre. Earlier, during Philip Hammond's big speech on the economy just before lunch, there were also big gaps of empty seats in the hall. Labour's deputy leader, the Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson, tweeted mischievously: ""I got a bigger audience for my conference speech than Jeremy Wright - and I didn't even do a conference speech."" Mr Watson can feel entitled to mock. At Labour's conference in Liverpool last week the vast hall was packed throughout and at times delegates were being turned away because it was full. The contrast doesn't end there. At Labour's conference there were passionate debates - on re-selection of MPs and Brexit, for example - and there were fiery speeches from the floor. That was a deliberate policy: more speeches by activists from the floor and fewer by MPs and shadow ministers from the platform.   There was also a Momentum conference, The World Transformed, going on at the same time elsewhere in Liverpool, with speeches by leading figures such as John McDonnell and senior union leaders. That event was packed and passionate too. There's no passion in the hall in Birmingham. There are hardly any speeches from the floor, either. It's just a procession of speeches from ministers and other senior party figures from the platform. No wonder they're staying away. But where have all the Tories gone? The answer is they're all at fringe meetings. And mostly fringe meetings about Brexit. On day one, a Leave Means Leave fringe at which Jacob Rees-Mogg was the main speaker was packed, as was a rally where Nigel Farage was the star turn. On the other side of the Brexit argument, a Conservatives For A People's Vote meeting, with Anna Soubry, Phillip Lee and Justine Greening, was packed, with standing room only, and activists were spilling out into the corridor. Are the Tories worried? Clearly. Minister after minister during this conference has spoken about the threat posed to the Tories by Jeremy Corbyn and Labour after their conference last week. Birmingham was supposed to be the Tory conference attended by more young activists than ever before. And it may well be. The ICC and the Hyatt Regency Hotel next door are certainly full of young - nearly all male - activists. A Sky News colleague described them as ""teenage boys in their dads' suits"". Harsh, but fair. But these young activists are clearly not interested in sitting in the hall listening to scripted speeches by ministers reading from an autocue. What they are interested in is the raw politics of fringe meetings in sweaty, overcrowded rooms. So the Tories have a problem. They need to sex up their conference. Holding a proper debate on Brexit in the main hall would be a start. The next big event here in Birmingham is the dramatic arrival of Boris Johnson, darling of the grassroots and scourge of the prime minister, on day three of this conference. After quitting the Cabinet in July, he's banished to the fringe. Pity the poor Cabinet minister who's speaking in a near-empty conference hall while Boris is raising the roof at his packed fringe meeting."
2018-10-01,"The DUP is ""pushing back hard"" against an attempt to win its approval for a potential Irish border backstop compromise already signalled by Theresa May, Sky News sources say.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-dup-pushing-back-hard-on-new-northern-ireland-backstop-proposal-11514825,"Sky News has established that informal sounding out with the DUP to accept some increased forms of checks ""in the Irish Sea"" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is occurring - including at the margins of Conservative Conference. A DUP delegation including leader Arlene Foster arrived in Birmingham on Monday. A DUP source said: ""The PM understands our red line. No new border in the Irish Sea. Respect the economic and constitutional integrity of the UK."" A separate source said ""a number of different hybrid models"" are being floated, all of which provide for UK-wide alignment with relevant EU customs union rules. It will also provide for Northern Ireland's specific regulatory alignment with the Single Market and technological checks, as well as extra physical checks on food and agriculture on UK trade going into ports in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The proposals are designed to both create some freedom for the UK to start external trade negotiations, but also maintain the trading conditions for an open border in Ireland. :: Philip Hammond compares Theresa May's Brexit plan to the light bulb The government is trying to meet a deadline imposed at the Salzburg summit of coming up with a detailed proposed backstop by the time of the October EU Summit. This is in order to confirm with the EU27 the date of a special November summit to sign a wider withdrawal deal. Sky News is calling for an independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates At Salzburg the PM had privately suggested to the Irish leader Leo Varadkar that this compromise plan could not be ready this month, but this date was insisted upon by the EU27 led by French President Emmanuel Macron. The PM signalled at her post-Salzburg Downing Street statement that new east-west Irish Sea regulatory checks of some sort could occur as part of the backstop, if they were approved by the currently-suspended Stormont assembly. A number of Cabinet ministers have reiterated publicly and privately that any backstop that carved Northern Ireland into a separate customs territory from the rest of the United Kingdom would be unacceptable to their party, as it would to the DUP. But regulatory checks across the Irish Sea, particularly in regard to food and agriculture are being contemplated, and do, to a small extent, already occur, for example, on cattle. Economics editor Ed Conway cuts through the text and highlights the key points from the government's post-Brexit hopes One option is one-way checks to only check produce going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, enabling the DUP to say that the access of its produce to UK markets would remain free and unimpeded. Michel Barnier's team have already indicated that many checks on customs, VAT and product standards could take place technologically, but that food and agriculture trade would need physical checks. Steve Baker, the ex-Brexit minister who resigned over the Chequers deal, told Sky News: ""I’d be really astonished if the UK is signing up to that. ""I can't imagine the DUP would stand for it before you even begin to think what Tory Eurosceptics would think. ""So a border in the Irish Sea is the one thing I think the DUP would bring down the government."""
2018-10-01,"A generation of young people in care in Nottinghamshire were ""betrayed"" by a dysfunctional system that allowed the sexual abuse of vulnerable children to flourish, an inquiry has heard.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/nottingham-care-home-inquiry-reveals-343-cases-of-child-sexual-abuse-11514478,"The extent of the scandal was outlined at the opening of the Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) hearings in Nottingham that revealed that 343 individuals have come forward to say they were sexually abused as children. Despite three previous police investigations and numerous reviews, the scale of the scandal in Nottinghamshire has never been fully understood or investigated. The inquiry heard there had been a historical ""rift"" between the police and social services that led to a ""crisis"" in child protection in the county. One unidentified complainant said in a statement: ""The approach that the councils of Nottingham have taken to the abuse is just an extension of the abuse. ""It just drags it on."" Patrick Sadd, counsel to the Inquiry, said: ""As at 2015, when this investigation was selected to form part of the national inquiry, recent police investigations had only led to one conviction for child sexual abuse in a children's home."" Since 2015 there have been a series of further criminal prosecutions in Nottinghamshire. One of the most notorious children's homes in Nottingham, known as Beechwood, has been singled out by the inquiry for special investigation. There were 136 allegations of sexual abuse from children there between the 1960s and the 1990s. Yet just two instances of disciplinary action resulted from the allegations of sexual abuse. In another case a care worker who was engaging in sexual activity with an underage girl in his care was not sacked because he may not have been aware it was wrong. Mr Sadd told the inquiry that the following justification was given to a subsequent investigation: ""He was not dismissed because in 1983 there was a lack of clear guidance given to him as the role of a house parent."" John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, who is representing around 30 survivors, told Sky News: ""It is a total betrayal, the system didn't work for them, the institutions didn't even co-operate and hardly talked to each other. ""It is quite astonishing how they were let down... This is institutional failure but we need to learn for the present and the future."" The Inquiry is also examining the failure of the council to address abuse allegations from children who had been placed into foster care in Nottinghamshire. In one case Mr Sadd said the child was just ignored: ""The police viewed the incident as a foster child 'plying her trade... rather than being harmed.'"" In January 2018 the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council councillor Kay Cutts made a full apology to those who suffered abuse in care. She described the scandal as a ""dreadful stain on the history of this council that we must neither refute nor excuse"". Today, approximately 1,400 children are in care in the county. The IICSA will continue to examine the failures in Nottinghamshire for the next three weeks."
2018-10-01,Michael Gove has unveiled a food waste reduction scheme aimed at providing 250 million extra meals per year for those most in need.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/michael-gove-unveils-scheme-to-provide-250m-meals-in-food-waste-crackdown-11514664,"The environment secretary announced the pilot scheme, to be backed by the £15m of extra funding allocated to tackle food waste, at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. It is planned to reduce the 100,000 tonnes of food per year in the retail and food manufacturing sectors that is edible and readily available but goes uneaten. Currently around 43,000 tonnes of surplus food is redistributed from retailers and food manufacturers every year, but Mr Gove wants to go further. Sky News is calling for an independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates Speaking on Monday, Mr Gove said: ""Conservative ministers will act to ensure that we lead the world in safe, affordable, healthy food. ""And the first step in that strategy will be reducing food waste. Every year, millions of tonnes of good, nutritious, edible food is thrown away. ""This is an environmental, economic and moral folly, and we will address it. ""I can announce action this day to invest £15m so that food which would otherwise be wasted is redistributed to those most in need. ""Working with industry and charities, we should be able to get up to 250 million extra meals a year onto the tables and plates of the most deserving in our society. ""This is determined green action from a Conservative government. Action that helps the planet, helps the poorest and remains true to our Conservative values."" The scheme will launch in 2019/20 and was immediately hailed by hunger and food waste charity FareShare. Chief executive Lindsay Boswell said: ""We congratulate Michael Gove for responding to our call to use surplus food for social good. ""£15m can create almost 250 million meals worth of food for those in need, preventing in date food from being wasted. ""That amount of food could provide every single person in Britain with three square meals for one day. ""Instead this food will go to frontline charities such as breakfast clubs for children, hospices, domestic violence refuges and homeless hostels."" Food waste in the UK totals 10.2 million tonnes per year, of which 1.8 million tonnes comes from food manufacture, one million from the hospitality sector, and 260,000 from retail, with the remainder from households. Responding to Mr Gove's conference speech, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: ""Michael Gove talks a good game on the environment - but his focus is forever on tidying up, rather than tackling the cause of the mess. ""Today's only real announcement was a plan to redirect food waste from shops to dinner tables - but without strong measures to change supermarkets' strict cosmetic standards, farmers will keep having to plough perfectly good produce back into the ground."""

""Doing the bare minimum is not enough and the excuse to hide behind the law is shocking beyond belief - I would call that complete dereliction of duty."" The parents of Natasha, 15, who died in 2016 after suffering an allergic reaction to sesame which was not declared on the label of an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette, are calling for changes in food labelling laws. Tanya Ednan-Laperouse told Sky News of the harrowing moment she had to say goodbye to her dying daughter hundreds of miles away on the phone. ""To get a call to say your child is dying and another call to say your child is about to die and you have to say goodbye right now, putting the phone by her head - no one knows how they can even get through something like that,"" she said. ""As a parent you just don't."" Mr Ednan-Laperouse added: ""To see her life just drain away in a very short moment of time is something that was so, so easily avoidable."" The father says law around food labelling is 'not fit for purpose' He called it a ""completely and thoroughly needless death of a beautiful child"". Natasha ""was cheeky, she had a naughty sense of humour, and she was always just a delight to be around,"" Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said. Last week, a coroner said Pret A Manger had failed to address the seriousness of food allergies, in spite of the scale of the business. Natasha's mother said there was an ""obvious lack of understanding"" when it came to recognising ""the magnitude of what it does mean for somebody to have an allergy"". ""For us the justice if any justice can come from this, it's to change things,"" she said. Natasha's father called on politicians to ""take heed and really do something about it"". ""Every hour that goes past when there are not food labels with the allergens on the sandwich, someone else is at risk of dying or even having life-changing injuries as the result of a terrible anaphylactic reaction. ""It's unthinkable that right now all sandwich shops haven't shut momentarily to get on and do something and do right by the public."" Concluding at an inquest, Dr Sean Cummings found Pret relied on stickers, which urged customers to ask staff or check the Pret website, to provide information on allergens in their products. Natasha checked the packet before eating the baguette, but Pret had not declared the fact it contained sesame seeds on the packet. Natasha, from Fulham, southwest London, died of anaphylaxis after eating the baguette. The girl's father said Natasha was ""always aware of her allergies"" which she had ""grown up with"". ""She was spotlessly aware of looking at ingredients,"" Mr Ednan-Laperouse added. In a statement following the coroner's conclusion, the chief executive of Pret A Manger, Clive Schlee, said the company was ""deeply sorry"". ""We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt and the grief they will continue to feel,"" he said. ""We've listened to everything the coroner and Natasha's family have said and we will learn from it."""

Results from more than 97% of polling stations showed 91.3% of voters favoured the name change compared to 5.7% opposed, according to the electoral commission. But only a third of the 1.8 million-strong electorate voted, a far cry from the massive support the government had hoped for. Opponents to the name change had called for a boycott of the vote and celebrated in the streets outside parliament in Skopje when the turnout figures were announced. However, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev declared the vote a success and said he would seek to secure the required two-thirds majority of the 120-seat parliament by next week for the constitutional changes. If he fails, he said, the only alternative would be to call early elections. ""The people made a great choice and said 'yes' to our future. It is time for lawmakers to follow the voice of the people and to provide support,"" he said. ""There will be no better agreement with Greece, nor an alternative for NATO and the EU."" :: Can you name these eight countries that changed names In Athens, the Greek foreign ministry noted the ""contradictory"" result of the vote and said careful moves were needed to ""preserve the positive potential of the deal"". In Washington, US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement: ""The United States strongly supports the agreement's full implementation, which will allow Macedonia to take its rightful place in NATO and the EU, contributing to regional stability, security, and prosperity."" She urged Macedonian politicians ""to rise above partisan politics and seize this historic opportunity to secure a brighter future for the country as a full participant in Western institutions"". The June agreement aims to resolve a dispute dating from Macedonia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Greece, arguing its new northern neighbour's name implied territorial ambitions on its own province of the same name, has blocked Macedonia's efforts to join NATO since then. Under the deal, the former Yugoslav republic would amend its name to North Macedonia and Greece would drop its objections to the country joining the bloc."

Fans who grew up with Rainbow have been paying tribute on social media, with many sharing their fond memories of the show. This is so sad, another face from our childhood, Rainbow presenter Geoffrey Hayes has passed away. Thanks for giving this 80s kid some great memories 😪 pic.twitter.com/eqnYwV3eJ9 Up above the streets and houses, rainbow climbing high,Everyone can see it smiling over the sky.Paint the whole world with a rainbow.  🌈RIP Geoffrey Bye bye Geoffrey Hayes. We all loved you in Rainbow with Bungle, George & Zippy, Rod, Jane & Freddy. Sad news. Rest well Sir. *doffs bowler hat* Speaking about Rainbow's enduring popularity in 2002, Hayes said the secret was that it was full of ""magic, innocence and imagination"". He said: ""Practically all the time people come up to me and it really breaks me up because they thank me for being part of their childhood. It makes me want to cry sometimes."" Hayes also played Detective Constable Scatliff in drama series Z Cars in the early 1970s."

Lamarr, born Mark Jones, was a regular on TV screens in the 1990s when he presented The Word and The Big Breakfast. The 51-year-old was also a team captain on the comedy panel show Shooting Stars."
2018-10-01,Jeremy Hunt has been told to brush up on his European history after comparing the EU to the Soviet Union.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181001212918/https://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-told-to-open-a-history-book-after-comparing-eu-to-soviet-union-11514270,"The foreign secretary has provoked a backlash after accusing Brussels of wanting to ""punish"" Britain for Brexit, comparing the bloc to the USSR trying to stop its citizens leaving. When asked about the comment, a European Commission spokesman said: ""I would say, respectfully, that we would all benefit, and in particular foreign affairs ministers, from opening a history book from time to time."" Sir Simon Fraser, the Foreign Office's permanent secretary, said Mr Hunt was guilty of a ""shocking failure of judgement"", while his predecessor Lord Ricketts said the remark was ""unworthy of a British foreign secretary"". Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates Meanwhile, Germany's Europe minister Michael Roth told the foreign secretary: ""Sorry, Jeremy Hunt, the EU is no prison!"" And diplomats from countries that were once part of the Soviet Union also hit out. Latvia's ambassador to the UK said the EU had brought her country ""prosperity, equality, growth, respect"" after decades of Soviet rule that had ruined lives. Baiba Braze said: ""Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned 100 thousands of Latvia's inhabitants after the illegal occupation in 1940, and ruined lives of 3 generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect."" Dear @faisalislam , just FYI - Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned 100 thousands of Latvia's inhabitants after the illegal occupation in 1940, and ruined lives of 3 generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect. #StrongerTogether https://t.co/BNUvmsgXnR While Tina Intelmann, Estonia's representative in London, said the description was ""insulting"". The Czech Republic's deputy foreign minister, Tomas Petricek, said the country had ""its experience of the Soviet sphere of influence"" and the comparison was an ""unfortunate"" one to make. Mr Hunt made the remark in his speech at the Conservative Party conference on Sunday. In his address to the party's annual gathering in Birmingham, the foreign secretary recalled a visit to Latvia, during which he said he saw how the Baltic state had developed into ""a modern democracy, part of both NATO and the EU"" in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. EU and USSR not comparable. Soviet regime was brutal, I lived under it, comparison is insulting. @Conservatives @foreignoffice @Jeremy_Hunt @estembassyuk And he asked: ""What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? ""The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving. ""The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won't diminish, it will grow, and we won't be the only prisoner that will want to escape."" There was yet more tough talking on Europe on Monday, with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab calling on the EU to ""get serious"" if they want an agreement on the terms of Britain's EU exit. He said Britain's willingness to compromise was ""not without limits"" and warned the EU that if the only offer on the table was one that threatened the integrity of the UK ""then we will be left with no choice but to leave with no deal""."

He also used his address on Sunday to call for unity within the Tory party, with Mr Hunt cautioning continued Tory division could risk the ""wrong Brexit, a Corbyn Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all"". Despite backing Remain at the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Hunt has since stated he would now vote Leave due to the ""arrogance"" of the EU during divorce negotiations. Sky News is calling for an Independent Leaders' Debate Commission to oversee and organise election debates Increasingly viewed as among the favourites to replace Mrs May as Tory leader, Mr Hunt delivered a crowd-pleasing speech in which he included both his attack on Brussels and references to former Conservative prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. Delivering the stern message to the EU, the UK's top diplomat said: ""At the moment you seem to think the way to keep the club together is to punish a member who leaves. ""Not just with economic disruption. But even by breaking up the United Kingdom with a border down the Irish Sea. ""What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving. ""The lesson from history is clear: if you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won't diminish it will grow - and we won't be the only prisoner that will want to escape. ""If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister, you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom and more opportunities than ever in history."" Also delivering a fierce rejection of the EU's plan for Northern Ireland to effectively remain in the bloc's customs union to prevent a hard border in Ireland, Mr Hunt channelled Mrs Thatcher to add: ""If the only way to deal with the UK leaving is to try to force its break up, as someone much more distinguished than me once said, the answer is 'no, no, no'."" The start of the Tories' annual gathering has prompted a fresh round of infighting over Brexit. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson's latest attack on the prime minister's ""deranged"" Chequers plan on Sunday generated a strong counter-punch from Theresa May loyalists. But Mr Hunt offered a plea for peace within Tory ranks, telling delegates: ""If we are to unite the country, we must deliver not just a true Brexit for the 52% - but also a generous Brexit for the 48%. They are patriots too.  ""So however fierce the debate, however high the passions, never forget that disunity and division won't give us a better Brexit but the wrong Brexit, a Corbyn Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all. ""So let's argue our corners this week in Birmingham. But let's not carry on the fight after the moment we needed to come together."" Mr Hunt's comparison of the EU to the Soviet Union was branded ""wild and crass"" and ""downright offensive"" by former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who supports the Best for Britain campaign for a fresh Brexit referendum. He said: ""The third-rate Thatcher tribute act might go down well in the hall but outside people will look at him as a fifth-rate Boris impersonator."" Earlier on Sunday, businessman Digby Jones used his speech - watched in person by Mrs May - to describe Mr Johnson as ""irrelevant and offensive"". The House of Lords crossbencher, who was a minister in Gordon Brown's Labour government, saw his attack on the former foreign secretary widely applauded by Tory party members in the hall. When asked in a Sky Data poll whether they'd be more likely to vote for a Conservative Party led by Theresa May or Boris Johnson, 40% of all respondents opted for Mrs May, compared to 24% who backed Mr Johnson. When Conservative voters were asked the same question, 49% said they would prefer a party led by Mrs May, compared to 33% who said they would support Mr Johnson."

At a rally in Topeka, Kansas, moments after Judge Kavanaugh took up his new role, Mr Trump praised him as a ""loving husband, devoted father, and faithful public servant"", thanking Republicans for not backing down to the ""radical Democrats"".   He said: ""I stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation."" He added that what the Kavanaugh family had ""endured"" was ""unthinkable"", and called it a ""shameless campaign of political and personal destruction"". While Judge Kavanaugh was sworn in, in a private ceremony, protests continued outside, with some even rushing to the doors and banging on them in fury. A public swearing-in ceremony will take place on Monday in the White House's East Room.   Senators debated the decision before casting their vote, watched on by many in the public gallery. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said: ""The court guards our right and the Senate guards the court. Members of this body are duty bound to make sure men and women of the highest distinction are appointed to the Supreme Court - fortunately that is the case with the one that stands before us today. ""For 12 years he has excelled on the bench. Yet, we have studied the result of seven FBI inquiries - which have found no evidence of misconduct. He will make the Senate and the country proud. He unquestionably deserves confirmation."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: ""Republicans knew he was very flawed, but once he was nominated, it became a steam roller. They were intent on shrouding the truth because they knew that if the truth came to light, he would be exposed as a flawed individual."" Mr Trump's choice of Judge Kavanaugh to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court was controversial from the beginning, but initial concerns were based around his conservative views. Protests began in earnest when Dr Christine Blasey Ford came forward, alleging he had assaulted her at a party in the 1980s. Her hearing sparked a supplemental FBI probe into his background, which created a week long delay of the vote. He emphatically denied the allegations. But the report from the FBI was met with mixed response, with survivors and Democrats saying it was ""insufficient"", but Mr Trump and Republicans calling it ""thorough"" and ""professional"". Judge Kavanaugh will be able to start work quickly, with his attention first turned to arguments at the court on Tuesday on two cases involving prison sentences for repeat offenders."

The southbound road has since been reopened but the northbound carriageway is likely to remain closed until lunchtime - causing major disruption as the working week begins.

2018-10-08,Conor McGregor's UFC lightweight title fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov in Las Vegas was marred by a post-match brawl which resulted in arrests.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/conor-mcgregor-ufc-contest-ends-in-post-fight-brawl-11520076,"After tensions at Friday's ceremonial weigh-in threatened to boil over, Nurmagomedov's successful defence of his belt on Saturday night reached boiling point after the bout. After his victory in the fourth round, the Russian champion leapt over the Octagon fence into the crowd and got into a fight with Dillon Danis, a Bellator welterweight who trains with McGregor. A red-shirted fan then got involved and leapt into the cage and threw several punches at McGregor, before security intervened and escorted the Irishman and Nurmagomedov out of the arena. UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) boss Dana White later told Fox Sports that three members of Nurmagomedov's team were arrested. He told ESPN it was ""a very bad night"" for the UFC, adding that Nurmagomedov could face a suspension for his actions. ""Khabib diving over [the cage] was ridiculous,"" he said. ""You know, you just won a great fight, you fought brilliantly, you're about to get the belt on and people are going to respect the fact that you fought well and you won the fight, and instead you dive over the cage and start this huge melee with Conor's corner."" At a news conference afterwards, Nurmagomedov said: ""First of all I want to say sorry to Nevada Athletic Commission and second to Vegas. I know this is not my best side. I'm a human being. ""But I don't understand how people can talk about how I jump on the cage. He talked about my religion, he talked about my country, he talked about my father. ""He came to Brooklyn and he broke bus, he almost killed a couple of people. What about this s***?"" Conor McGregor later tweeted: ""Good knock. Looking forward to the rematch."" Mr White has refused to give Nurmagomedov his belt and told ESPN that his winnings were also withheld - but the Nevada State Athletic Commission had paid McGregor after reviewing footage of the brawl. It is not the first time the Irishman, or his opponent and their supporters have come to blows. The 30-year-old Irish mixed martial arts star and others stormed a UFC event at the Barclays Center in New York in April. Video footage showed people attempting to restrain McGregor as he appeared to throw a railing at a bus carrying long-time rival Nurmagomedov and a number of other UFC fighters. Lightweight American mixed martial artist Michael Chiesa, who was among them and was reportedly injured in the brawl, is suing McGregor for causing ""severe emotional distress, mental trauma and/or bodily harm"". McGregor was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and misdemeanour assault but pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to community service."
2018-10-08,Britain and its allies today turned words into a weapon against Russia.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-must-go-further-if-it-wants-to-deter-gru-11517442,"The calling out of president Vladimir Putin's military intelligence agency for acts of cyber warfare is designed to embarrass and deter. It is also meant to send a message to the GRU that British spies, along with their European and US counterparts, have the ability to disrupt their activities and expose them. The hope is that this changes Russian behaviour by making it too costly for the Kremlin to risk audacious missions such as the Salisbury poisoning or the attempted hack of the world's chemical weapons watchdog. What is not known is how Mr Putin will respond in what has become a hybrid conflict between Moscow and the West. The revelation - in unprecedented detail - by the UK and the Netherlands of what they described as a thwarted GRU attempt to hack into the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has exposed the identities and tactics of four suspected Russian military intelligence officers. A humiliating blow for an organisation that only works in the shadows. The men's diplomatic passports - released to the world as part of what was a co-ordinated information operation also involving the US - appear to have saved them from arrest, despite been caught red handed with laptops and hacking gear. Instead they were allowed to return to Russia but this unwanted publicity will deal a blow to future foreign espionage plans. The Dutch-UK announcement came hours after Britain accused the GRU of a spate of cyber operations that included the hacking of the US elections and the world anti-doping agency. In a three-pronged assault, the US then stepped forward to charge seven GRU officers in connection with the OPCW hacking and other cyber crimes. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the act of speaking out directly against Russia - something that Britain has often previously balked at - was part of the fightback. ""The first thing we are doing is to expose it… The words matter because there are countries all over the world that are hearing both sides of the story - they're hearing what the Russians say as well,"" he said. ""This is the evidence that what we are getting from Russia is fake news, and here is the hard evidence of Russian military activity."" Kremlin experts are less sure. Russia's military intelligence service has been blamed for several global cyber attacks They say the UK could do much more to make life difficult for Mr Putin, starting with targeting far more aggressively the billions of pounds of Russian money pumping through London. The Russian president is someone who notices strength not pulled punches. Today's action is a good start, coming on the back of the mass expulsion of Russian intelligence officials in the immediate aftermath of the Salisbury attack. But the UK and its allies will need to go further it they are serious about changing the GRU's behaviour."

One in eight of those were aged 12 or younger when they experienced this for the first time. The poll by Plan International UK also found that one in seven had been followed and 8% said they had been filmed or photographed by a stranger without their permission or had someone take a photo up their school skirt. More than a third of the girls said they had been sexually harassed while travelling to or from school. Jess from Glasgow said she was about 15 when a man on a train tried to put his hand on her leg. Now 16, she said: ""I was like, 'What am I supposed to do?' I ended up getting off the train at the next stop and just being completely lost."" She added: ""It was such a horrible experience. I was going to see my biology tutor and I arrived at the library in tears, I was really upset about it. ""I think the worst part was feeling guilty because I was wearing a skirt, which is stupid because it shouldn't matter what I was wearing, but in the moment it did."" Plan International UK called on the government to recognise harassment in public as a form of gender-based violence. Tanya Barron, chief executive at Plan International UK, said, ""It is shocking and deeply concerning that girls, many of whom are clearly of school age because they are in uniform, are being targeted and sexually harassed by perpetrators in the street. ""It's simply not acceptable that girls as young as 12 are being wolf-whistled at in public, touched against their will, stared at or even followed. ""This disgraceful behaviour needs to be called out and stopped."""

Depicting a girl reaching towards a bright red heart-shaped balloon, the spray paint and acrylic on canvas is one of Banksy's best-known images. The auction house said the painting was signed and dedicated and that the vendor had acquired it from the artist in 2006. The winning bid of £860,000 (£1,042,000 including buyer's premium) was given by phone at around 9pm, well over the pre-auction estimate of between £200-300,000. But just after the hammer went down, the painting was shredded, thought to be by a remotely activated mechanism within the frame. The prized work then came out the bottom in strips. Alex Branczik, Sotheby's senior director and head of contemporary art, Europe London, said: ""It appears we just got Banksy-ed.  Going, going, gone... A post shared by  Banksy (@banksy) on Oct 5, 2018 at 6:45pm PDT ""The unexpected incident became instant art world folklore and certainly marks the first time in auction history that a work of art automatically shredded itself after coming under the hammer,"" the auctioneers added in the statement. If a work is damaged while in the care of an auction house, a buyer would not normally be expected to go through with the purchase. But perhaps, now known as the subject of one of the greatest pranks in the art world, Girl With Red Balloon will be worth even more in its shredded state. Sotheby's told the Financial Times: ""We have talked with the successful purchaser who was surprised by the story. ""We are in discussion about next steps."""
2018-10-08,The art world has been stunned by the latest prank by elusive artist Banksy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/who-is-mystery-man-who-films-at-banksy-auction-11519745,"Just as the gavel went down on the £1.04m sale of one of the artist's most famous works, it was shredded by a hidden mechanism inside the picture frame. The auction house Sotheby's denied any knowledge of the fate of the artwork and said it had ""been Banksy'd"". Later, the artist posted a video to his Instagram showing how he had secretly built a shredder inside the frame without the dealer or buyer knowing. A post with the video said: ""A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting... in case it was ever put up for auction."" The artist's identity is a closely guarded secret but footage from inside the auction house has got reporters talking about the role played by a mystery man in the crowd. As far as we know, there is only one piece of video footage of the moment of shredding, which was the footage in the ""official"" stunt video. By comparing this ""official"" video with other pictures and videos from inside the room, it appears that the person who filmed for Banksy is clear to see. We have also seen still images - spotted by Robert Casterline of the US gallery Casterline Goodman - that further point to the mystery man's camera footage being the same footage that appears on Banksy's Instagram. The other mysterious thing about the man in question is that he appears to be wearing tinted yellow spectacles with a built-in camera. You can buy very similar glasses advertised as ""spy glasses"" with ""full HD camera"" for just £29.99 online. All of this is of course speculation but when it comes to Banksy, let's face it, everything is."

Before they visit the first venue on their list, Detective Sergeant Robert Richards from the Met's Child Sexual Exploitation team tells the young cadet: ""If they ask you any questions directly, just look down at the floor and let me answer for you."" After being buzzed through the hotel's front door, the pair are made to wait in a side room by the young receptionist: ""Could you please wait in the lounge while I give a call to one of my colleagues?"". Within a couple of minutes the test is over, as Detective Richards explains outside: ""While we were sat in the lounge we heard her ring 999 and ask for police under operation MakeSafe."" Operation MakeSafe is about teaching hotel workers, bar staff and taxi drivers to recognise and react if they spot signs of anything suspicious. According to the National Crime Agency, around 400 people are arrested in the UK every month for child sexual abuse and exploitation offences and more than 500 children are being safeguarded each month. Similar programmes are being rolled out across the country, including in Telford - a town that has learned the true horrors of what can happen when grooming is not picked up on. Sky News recently spoke to one woman who told us that, as a teenager, she was abused by more than 100 men. An inquiry is still looking into claims that up to a thousand children may have been groomed in the town since the 1980s, including stories of girls being drugged, beaten and raped at the hands of the violent gangs. Chief Superintendent Helen Millichap, the Met Police's lead officer for child sexual exploitation, believes it is important that people feel confident enough to get in touch with the police if they are unsure about whether a child might be in danger. ""For some hotels it might be quite rare that they see activity like this but we do unfortunately know from past cases that perpetrators of child sexual exploitation try and use hotels to commit their crimes. ""We want to make sure that if some of the people that work in hotels can spot some of the signs of this sort of thing that they know and have the confidence to contact police so that we can investigate. ""I think it's all about being extra vigilant. ""Even ordinary members of the public might see a situation that they think might be risky for a child. ""This is not just about hotels this is about anybody that might see something that's a little bit suspicious. ""I'd far rather they called us and we were wrong about that than miss an opportunity to safeguard a child."""

The gunman was believed to have been riding a bicycle and dressed all in black with a high-vis orange jacket.

She said: ""We are keen to speak to anyone who may have information which could help us establish the full circumstances and find those responsible. ""You may have seen or heard suspicious behaviour in Cornwood Close or nearby in Belle Vale and any information, no matter how small you think it may be, could prove crucial as we seek to establish what happened and bring those responsible to justice. ""We share the community's shock that this could happen in a residential street in broad daylight late on a Sunday morning. Officers believe the man, thought to be in his late 20s and of medium build, made off from the scene in the direction of Loxwood Close after the attack. Detective Perischine reassured the public that gun crime ""will not be tolerated"" on the streets of Merseyside. ""We will thoroughly investigate any information given to us so we can put anyone who carries guns on our streets behind bars,"" she added. Anyone with information should call Merseyside Police on 101 quoting reference 420 of 7/10/18 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111."

2018-10-08,It is impossible to understate the significance of Unilever's decision to drop its controversial plans to scrap its dual-listed structure and move its headquarters to the Netherlands.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/unilever-shareholders-bared-their-teeth-and-won-11518006,"City investors have been regularly criticised for appearing too supine when up against a determined company board: nodding through takeovers that often turn out to destroy shareholder value; protesting against executive pay policies with votes that are not binding and ignored by boards; and, worse still, not even voting their shares on occasion. In this instance, they have bared their teeth, and how: the third biggest company in the FTSE-100 has received the bloodiest of noses. It is one of the biggest and most resounding victories for shareholder democracy that the City has seen in many, many years. Every other chairman or chief executive will be watching Unilever's spectacular climb-down today and concluding that, in future, it might be advisable not to take their shareholders - their owners - for granted. On the face of it, what Unilever was proposing was perfectly sensible. Instead of having two holding companies, each with their own stock listings - Unilever plc on the London Stock Exchange and Unilever NV on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange - Unilever proposed to have a single holding company, incorporated in the Netherlands. There would be one class of shares, Unilever NV, listed in Amsterdam, New York and London. Unilever argued this was a logical simplification of its shareholder structure and corporate governance that would give it greater flexibility to buy and sell assets in future. The problem was that the move would have resulted in Unilever being ejected from the FTSE-100 index. Investors who run funds tracking the performance of the Footsie would have been obliged to sell the shares. This, shareholders argued, would not only result in a drop in Unilever's share price with so many forced sellers being ushered to the exit at the same time. It also represented, they said, an effective takeover of Unilever with no premium. Unilever investors were not happy with the company's plan. In September, Ian King explained why not. There were other criticisms, too. Unilever got the fright of its life when, in February last year, US food giant Kraft Heinz approached it about a $143bn takeover. This restructuring was seen as a way for the company, which has a Dutch chairman and chief executive, to avoid such incidents in future because the Netherlands has tougher takeover laws than the City. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and a former Unilever employee, did his bit to smooth the way by promising to abolish a tax on dividends that made holding the shares in the UK more attractive than in the Netherlands. One by one, the big battalions of City fund managers, many of whom prefer to speak on an anonymous basis to the financial press, broke cover to say what a dreadful idea this was: Colombia Threadneedle, Lindsell Train, Schroders, Aviva Investors, M&G and Royal London all publicly stated their opposition. With Unilever needing the backing of 75% of UK investors to go ahead with the reorganisation, it was starting to look like a close-run thing. Yet that was not the only difficulty that emerged for the consumer goods giant. The influential Financial Times columnist Neil Collins, the most vocal critic of the move from the start, spotted in the small print of the particulars sent to investors that Unilever also required a simple majority of shareholders taking part in the vote for the motion to be passed. In other words, a small shareholder with only a handful of shares would carry as much weight as a big City institution with millions of them. This represented a threat to Unilever's plans as most of the financial press, including The Times, The Guardian, the FT and the Daily Mail, had all attacked the proposals. There was also a risk to Unilever in this being presented as a vote of no confidence in post-Brexit Britain - although the company, whose products are found in almost every kitchen and bathroom in the land, was always careful not to say that publicly. Unilever responded by taking out adverts in newspapers. Graeme Pitkethly, the company's popular Scottish chief financial officer and seen as a candidate to succeed Paul Polman as chief executive, was wheeled out to defend the move. City investors continued to voice their opposition. Legal & General added its voice to that of the critics. It left only the two biggest investors, BlackRock and the Leverhulme Trust (the trust that holds the shares originally owned by William Hesketh Lever, the founder of Lever Brothers, which merged with Dutch firm Margarine Unie in 1930 to form Unilever), left to declare. However, with shareholders owning at least 12% of Unilever's shares already having declared their opposition, it was looking increasingly likely that Unilever was facing defeat. There was a feeling of inevitability about today's announcement. Unilever now has a problem: it has alienated a lot of its shareholders. Mr Polman, who is expected to retire next year after a decade's distinguished leadership, risks leaving under a cloud. Moreover, the credibility of Marijn Dekkers, the chairman, looks shot to ribbons. He and the Unilever board cocked a deaf ear to the concerns of the company's owners. The irony is that this row could have been avoided. Unilever could have sounded out its investors more carefully before announcing this move. It could have offered its UK shareholders a special dividend or some form of takeover premium to persuade them to back the move. Or it could have sought to persuade the London Stock Exchange to change the rules to allow Unilever to remain in the Footsie. Or, if the planned restructuring was solely about giving it a cleaner acquisition currency in future, Unilever could have decided to move its domicile and primary stock listing to London - just as another big Anglo-Dutch company, the business information provider Relx, recently did. This is unlikely to be the end of the matter. Unilever will now need to engage with its shareholders and mend some bridges. Having argued so strongly for this restructuring and its merits, the company needs to come up with another way of achieving it, perhaps by replicating the arrangements at Royal Dutch Shell, another giant Anglo-Dutch business and the biggest company in the Footsie. And there may be further repercussions. Most of Unilever's 36,000 small shareholders hold their shares in 'nominee' accounts administered by popular investment platforms run by companies like Hargreaves Lansdown, AJ Bell and Barclays Smart Investor. Under the Companies Act, a nominee counts as just one shareholder, which would have taken away the ability of small shareholders to block the measure - obliging investors to hold their shares via old-fashioned certificates. The UK government may well find itself under pressure to amend the Companies Act so that it genuinely is a case of 'one shareholder, one vote' in future."
2018-10-08,"The family of a second person believed to have died after suffering an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger sandwich say they want ""answers"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/pret-a-manger-allergy-death-second-victim-named-as-celia-marsh-11521171,"Mother-of-five Celia Marsh died in December last year after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"" containing a yoghurt that was supposed to be dairy-free, but was found to be contaminated with dairy. Now the family of the 42-year-old dental nurse say want ""answers to why she died after eating lunch with her family"". In a statement, they said: ""We have kept a dignified silence since the death of Celia in December last year as the family has come to terms with her sudden and unexpected death. We are also awaiting the outcome of the investigations into how she died. ""She was a much-loved mother, daughter, sister and wife. We miss her greatly and we just want the answers to why she died after eating lunch with her family."" Mrs Marsh, who had five daughters, died at the Royal United Hospital in Bath on 27 December, 2017. Avon Coroner's Court says inquiries into her death are continuing and no date has yet been fixed for a full inquest hearing. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) investigated supplier CoYo, which then issued an allergy alert and recalled its coconut yoghurts. But CoYo has denied that recall was linked to Mrs Marsh's death and accused Pret of hampering its own probe by failing to provide vital information. ""The claims made by Pret are unfounded,"" a spokeswoman for CoYo said on Sunday. The circumstances around Mrs Marsh's death emerged as Pret faced scrutiny over 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who was allergic to sesame and died after eating one of its baguettes. Mrs Marsh collapsed and died after buying the sandwich in a store in Stall Street, Bath. Pret said it had been ""mis-sold"" a guaranteed dairy-free yoghurt by CoYo that was discovered to contain dairy protein. Vegan brand CoYo, a coconut milk brand that has been endorsed by TV cook Nigella Lawson, recalled the yoghurts in February. But CoYo has denied this was related to Mrs Marsh's death, saying the contaminated raw materials had been supplied to it in January - after she died. ""The dairy-free product we provided to Pret in December 2017, at the time of this tragedy, is not linked to the product we recalled in February 2018,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Pret's inability to provide us with a batch code, despite several requests, has severely limited our ability to investigate this further."" Michelle Victor from law firm Leigh Day who are working with Mrs Marsh's family, said: ""We await the full inquest into Celia's death and will be working with the family for the answers they so dearly need."" Pret announced last week it will include full ingredient labelling on all of its products and the government is considering a law change after the death of Natasha, from Fulham, southwest London. She collapsed on board a flight in July 2016 after eating an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette she had bought at Heathrow Airport."

Other features of the Giants On The Quayside development are also shown, including The Geordie Giant - a 12m (39ft) steel structure - and a food and beverage experienced called The Giant's Quay. Those behind the project say it will see about £100m invested in Newcastle and up to 550 jobs created. A family entertainment centre with trampolines, climbing walls and a skywalk will also feature. The Whey Eye - a phonetic rendition of the Geordie phrase ""why aye"" - would involve a 30-minute ""flight"" and is expected to bring in 800,000 visitors in the first year. Phil Lynagh, chief executive officer of World Wheel Company's Newcastle operation, said: ""It gives us great pleasure to reveal these images and further details of the development to give people a deeper understanding of our vision for the Whey Aye and the Giants On The Quayside development. ""We are proposing a £100m regeneration and inward investment project that will create local jobs and ongoing revenue for the regional economy."" The Giant Sport Deck will comprise a multipurpose play and sports complex, with covered five-a-side pitches and tennis courts available for public hire, as well as a virtual golf club. At the base of the big wheel will be a 11,960 sq m LED digital screen in the centre, used for displaying information about local culture and events. It will be located at the east end of the Quayside, on the site of the former Spillers' Flour Mill. A detailed planning application is due to be submitted to Newcastle City Council later this year. The Quayside already has the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, known as the ""Winking Eye"" or ""Blinking Eye"" bridge because of the way it swings open to allow shipping through. When opened to the public in 2000, the London Eye was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. It now falls in fourth place, with the 167.6 metre (550ft) tall High Roller in Las Vegas taking first place."
2018-10-08,"About 40% of young adults would not be able to buy one of the cheapest homes in their area - even if they managed to save a 10% deposit, research suggests.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/cheapest-homes-unaffordable-for-40-of-young-adults-ifs-11521062,"Back in 1996, a property would have been in reach for 90% of 25 to 34-year-olds as long as they had a 10% deposit and borrowed four-and-a-half times their salary. Fast forward to 2016, just 60% in this age range can do the same - leaving many thousands locked out of the market. Researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies found the situation is worse for aspiring homeowners in London, where just one in three young adults could borrow enough to buy one of the cheapest homes in their area with a 10% deposit. Average house prices in England have surged by 173% over the past two decades, compared with a meagre 19% rise in the real incomes of young adults over the same period, the report claimed. In 2016, about 50% of young adults would have needed to save more than six months of their post-tax income to raise a 10% deposit for a cheap home in their area. The IFS estimates just 10% would have had to do the same 20 years ago. :: Line 18: Does your area have housing crisis? Polly Simpson, a research economist at the IFS who co-authored the report, said: ""Big increases in house prices compared to incomes over the last two decades mean that it is increasingly difficult for young adults to get on the housing ladder, even if they do manage to save a 10% deposit. ""Many young adults cannot borrow enough to buy a cheap home in their area, let alone an average-priced one. These trends have increased inequality between older and younger generations, and within the younger generation too."" The IFS says that easing planning restrictions would help to increase levels of home ownership while reducing property prices and rents - giving relief to some Britons who will never own a property. Its senior research economist Jonathan Cribb said: ""The most economically productive and wealthiest parts of England - London and the South East - are those with the most restrictive planning constraints. ""It is unsurprising that these areas have also experienced the biggest house price increases. Increasing the responsiveness of construction to house prices is a necessary part of the solution, particularly in these areas."" A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, responded: ""This government is committed to helping more people get on the housing ladder and last year saw the highest number of first time buyers for over a decade. ""Through our Help to Buy scheme and the cut in stamp duty for first time buyers we are helping restore the dream of home ownership for a new generation. ""Over 1.1 million properties have been built since 2010 and our targeted investment and planning reform will deliver more of the homes communities need."""

2018-10-08,Turkish authorities have claimed a prominent Saudi journalist who has not been seen since he entered Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul five days ago was killed inside the building.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/saudi-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-was-killed-inside-saudi-consulate-11519926,"An official, speaking to Reuters news agency, said Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated murder and his body removed from the consulate. They said: ""The initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul. ""We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate."" A senior police source told online news website Middle East Eye the journalist had been ""brutally murdered, killed and cut into pieces"". ""Everything was videotaped to prove the mission had been accomplished and the tape was taken out of the country,"" they said. Jamal Khashoggi has interviewed Osama bin Laden and likened the Saudi Crown Prince to Vladimir Putin A friend of Mr Khashoggi, Galip Dalay, told Sky News that he ""personally got the news that he was killed two days ago"". Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan described Mr Khashoggi as a ""journalist I knew for a long time"" and a ""friend"". ""God willing we will not be faced with the situation we do not desire,"" Mr Erdogan said. ""I still am hopeful."" The Saudi consulate and Istanbul's airports are being closely monitored, he added. Saudi authorities rejected the allegations as ""baseless"" and said a team of investigators had been sent to the Turkish city to help look into the case. A fierce critic of Saudi policies, the royal family and its power, Mr Khashoggi had been living in self-imposed exile in Washington for the last year, fearing retribution for his views. But Mr Dalay said Mr Khashoggi was not a political dissident. ""He's a journalist - simple,"" he said. ""A journalist and intellectual. ""He disagreed with some of the policies of Mohammed bin Salman, but he was not a political dissident, he's not leading any organised network, he was a journalist - he wanted to write and to speak freely, and that was the reason he left Saudi Arabia."" The 59-year-old former government adviser visited the consulate on Tuesday to obtain paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, who was reportedly waiting outside the building for him - but he never emerged. Mr Khashoggi reportedly left his phone with her - plus instructions to call a member of Turkey's governing party if he failed to return. He has not been seen or heard from since. His fiancee wrote on Twitter she ""did not believe he has been killed"". Turkish and Saudi officials have offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there was no evidence he had left the consulate, but Riyadh claiming he exited the premises the same day. ""If the reports of Jamal's murder are true, it is a monstrous and unfathomable act,"" said Fred Hiatt, director of The Washington Post's editorial page, for which Mr Khashoggi was a contributor. ""Jamal was - or, as we hope, is - a committed, courageous journalist. ""He writes out of a sense of love for his country and deep faith in human dignity and freedom. ""He is respected in his country, in the Middle East and throughout the world. ""We have been enormously proud to publish his writings."" In its report of the journalist's disappearance, the paper quoted an anonymous official who said investigators believed a 15-strong team ""came from Saudi Arabia"" to carry out ""a pre-planned murder"". Press freedom campaigners also condemned the journalist's disappearance. ""If Khashoggi was indeed murdered inside a diplomatic facility, it is an act of terror that echoes Russian and Chinese tactics of extraterritorial, extrajudicial attacks on dissidents, intended to intimidate any who would speak out against the Saudi government, no matter where they may be, and giving the lie to official narratives of 'reform' in Saudi Arabia,"" said Summer Lopez, of PEN America. ""If Saudi authorities wish to counter these claims, they must produce Khashoggi immediately. If the killing is confirmed, those responsible for this heinous crime must be held accountable,"" she added."

Windsor says that taking part would ""support ground-breaking research to find a cure for a condition that affects so many people, like me. With your help we can and will end dementia with research"". In May, her husband Scott Mitchell, 55, announced that Windsor had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in April 2014. The former EastEnders star's husband reveals her condition He has now said he will run the 2019 Virgin Money London Marathon for his wife and the millions of people around the world who suffer from dementia.

It comes just five months after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex wed in Windsor - it is estimated the cost of policing their big day was between £2 and £4m. In a statement, Thames Valley Police's deputy police and crime commissioner Matthew Barber told Sky News: ""The policing of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding was a complicated operation involving a number of organisations and the cost incurred by Thames Valley and other forces has not yet been finalised. ""Once finalised, Thames Valley Police will release the information and we will submit a formal special grant request to the Home Office in due course."" Thames Valley Police said they were unable to give an estimate of how much this week's wedding may cost the force. They are used to regularly dealing with large royal events in Windsor; however, the decision to invite members of the public into the castle grounds and have a carriage procession for the bride and groom along Windsor High Street will increase the police resources needed. Many senior members of the Royal Family will also attend the wedding at St George's Chapel. Buckingham Palace confirmed the Royal Family will be personally paying for the wedding, including the reception, but said security is a matter for the police, so will not be paying policing costs. Almost 40,000 people have signed a petition launched by Republic, the anti-monarchy campaign group, saying no public money should be spent on the wedding for the ninth in line to the throne. Princess Eugenie of York, the ninth-in-line to the throne, is getting married Locals like Carole Da Costa, from the West Windsor Residents Association, say it's been difficult to find out who exactly is picking up the bill for policing it all, but knows ultimately it's down to the taxpayer. She said: ""I think we'd have to have a lot of tourism to recoup that kind of money, so I think that is something that needs to be debated in the future and we need to look at how those kind of costs would be covered."" Dani Beckett, from Republic, told Sky News that the secrecy has to stop: ""The £2m that the public are being asked to spend on Eugenie's wedding costs is the tip of the iceberg - we know that we spend around £100m on royal security every single year. So if they go and visit a local town, the council there has to pay for the policing and security, and road closures... it's all coming out of the public purse. ""What I want the general public to be asking now is that the Royal Family finally come clean about what those costs are."" Large crowds are expected to gather outside Windsor Castle on Friday, with around 1,000 people inside the castle grounds. Thames Valley Police say they will have a significant security operation in place and people will see an increased number of armed and unarmed police officers on patrol. Meanwhile, the Home Office said it is working with Thames Valley Police to support the policing operation. ""The Thames Valley police and crime commissioner has not applied for special grant funding at this point, but any such application will be considered carefully,"" a spokesperson said."
2018-10-08,"A decade on from the financial crisis, the UK economy is now comparatively smaller than the United States was 10 years on from the Great Depression.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181008100614/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-recovery-is-slower-than-us-after-great-depression-11521000,"Analysis by Sky News of the paths of different recessions throughout UK and US history has found that the UK's recovery is now comparatively weaker than the American recovery after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The UK economy is now 10.8% bigger than it was at the start of the crisis, 42 quarters or 10 and a half years ago. But while Britain's recent recession was nowhere near as deep as the Great Depression, where gross domestic product contracted at one stage by 26% (the UK's slump never exceeded 6%) America's recovery in the late 1930s means its path has now overtaken Britain's. At this stage in its recovery, the US economy was around 12.6% bigger than it was in 1929. The stark comparison underlines how slow the UK recovery has been in the years following 2008. While in most previous recessions the UK bounced back to previous rates of growth, following the financial crisis, trend growth rates have remained weak. The statistic is the latest evidence of the unprecedented historical nature of the past decade, and stands alongside others showing the longest period of falling real wages and productivity in two centuries. It comes amid growing consternation about the length of time it has taken for the UK to regain economic momentum. While some blame austerity and government cuts, others think the collapse of the financial system is partly responsible. There are others, too, who think the explanation is weak productivity, which has contributed to low wages and slow gross domestic product expansion. Either way, there are many, even among the establishment, who wonder whether the economic system is working as it should. In his party conference speech last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond acknowledged that ""too many people have experienced years of slow wage growth… And as they look around them, they feel a growing concern that they are falling behind, and that when they voice those concerns the political system doesn't seem to hear them."" Speaking to Sky News, the former head of the CBI and the Financial Services Authority, Lord Adair Turner, said: ""The capitalist system is not delivering for ordinary people in the way it seemed to be doing before 2007. ""And that's the crisis which I think is still unresolved. I think people are legitimately angry about it. ""Something has gone deeply wrong with capitalism. ""From 1948 to 2008 even though there were some ups and downs, some tricky periods back in the 1970s, you would find that in every one of those decades real GDP and real wages increased materially. So almost everybody participated in a growth of the economy. ""That deal has broken down. We have a whole load of people who in 2018 have real wages which are below where they were in 2007."""

He was the club's most successful captain. The centre-back played 78 times for England and featured at four major tournaments, but failed to progress beyond the quarter-final stages. He left Chelsea in 2017 to join Aston Villa, and has not played for anyone else since his contract expired with the Championship club at the end of last season. He rejected a move to Spartak Moscow in the summer. Terry, 37, shared an emotional farewell post on Instagram on Sunday in which he gave a special mention to his family and friends for their ""great support"". His statement read: ""After 23 incredible years as a footballer, I have decided now is the right time to retire from playing. ""As a 14-year-old, I made the biggest and best decision: to sign for Chelsea. Words will never be enough to show how much everyone at the club means to me, in particular the fans. ""To me, you are the best fans in the world. I hope I have done you all proud wearing the shirt and the armband. ""I want to thank my amazing team-mates, coaches, managers and backroom staff, who I was honoured to work with and learn from. ""They all guided me on my way to playing 717 games for the club I love, and it was a privilege to serve them as captain. ""I look forward to the next chapter in my life and the challenges in my head."" Terry is reportedly being lined up as a possible assistant manager or first-team coach by Aston Villa, with Thierry Henry the favourite to succeed Steve Bruce as manager."

Her dress, with a flowing skirt and angular neckline, was designed by Zac Posen. The newlyweds have released four official photographs from their wedding day - including a full family portrait The US designer said he was inspired by the beauty of Windsor and its surrounding countryside, and picked the colour of the dress to reflect the blush of an English rose. Eugenie's outfit, like her wedding gown, was adorned with details to reflect the history of the Royal Family. The white rose of York was embroidered on both the shoulder of the dress and the fabric on the back that held together the cape, and the gown's silk came from the British Biddle Sawyer silk mill. The princess also wore - as a hair slide - a wheat-ear brooch, first commissioned in 1830 for William IV, and passed down to Queen Victoria and eventually the Queen. Mr Posen was pictured arriving at the ceremony itself, in a group that included actress Demi Moore. The designer also stocks a black and white Eugenie sweater dress, priced at $525 (£400). The pictures were released after it was revealed that Robbie Williams hopped on stage to entertain guests with a surprise performance. The Angels, Let Me Entertain You and She's The One singer is reported to have sung some of his greatest hits at the evening party that followed a star-studded ceremony at Windsor Castle. Williams had earlier been pictured arriving at the wedding with his actress and TV presenter wife Ayda Field. Eugenie was reportedly introduced to the former Take That singer by her mother the Duchess of York on a Caribbean holiday in 2011. Familiar faces including Kate Moss, Demi Moore, Naomi Campbell and Stephen Fry were among the 850 guests who attended the wedding.   Eugenie, who is ninth in line to the throne, married at St George's Chapel just five months after the church hosted Harry and Meghan's wedding.

She told the Guardian she had taken a high number of samples from locations up to almost a mile away from the tower. A mother says her daughter is struggling to understand what happened 16 months on ""As a result of this work, I already have datasets that indicate a number of toxins that have not yet been measured by Public Health England (PHE), who have already looked into air quality,"" she told the paper.

Last month, Professor Stec was instructed by the public inquiry into the blaze as an expert witness. She will provide a report to determine the fire-derived toxicants and related deposits present in the tower and their origin. A spokesman for PHE said the agency had not yet been briefed by the professor or seen her data. The agency has been monitoring the air quality around the tower and has consistently said it has found nothing of concern. :: Grenfell survivor: 'I didn't want my little girl to die in pain' A PHE spokesman said: ""Local authorities are responsible for assessing and legally determining contaminated land within their communities.

Winds of 110mph were recorded as the hurricane, which weakened slightly into a post-tropical cyclone, swept into northern and central Portugal overnight, with officials warning people not to venture outdoors. At least 300,000 homes were reported to be without power, while several flights to and from Lisbon were cancelled. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries as yet. From melting glaciers to snow in the Sahara, Sky News brings you the rundown of the most dangerous weather across the globe in 2018 Portugal's weather service issued red warnings - its highest level - for high winds or dangerous coastal conditions for 13 of its 18 mainland districts, including the capital Lisbon. :: 18 dead after Hurricane Michael batters Florida Luis Belo Costa, of Portugal's national protection agency, told residents to ""avoid at all costs walking on the street"".

After performing their Charleston on Saturday, they were given 28 points from the judges, one of the highest scores of the night, putting them in fourth place overall. Those points will be combined with votes from the public to determine which two couples will end up in the bottom two and face the dance-off, where one pair will then leave the show. Following the cheating revelations, Walsh was publicly dumped by his long-term girlfriend. Rebecca Humphries released a statement accusing the comedian of ""controlling"" and ""aggressive"" behaviour in the run-up to the kiss, which occurred on her birthday. Both Walsh and his dance partner apologised for their actions, which prompted speculation they might leave Strictly Come Dancing. However, they stayed in the competition and 11.9 million viewers tuned in to watch them dance to Bills by Lunchmoney Lewis. Earlier in the week, judge Craig Revel Horwood labelled it their ""Dance of Shame"". No overt reference to the scandal was made during the Saturday night show and the couple received cheers from the audience as they attempted tricky lifts, including one where Jones stood on Walsh's shoulders. The judges were largely impressed, with head judge Shirley Ballas saying the ""whole routine was totally entertaining, you got one tiny kick wrong in the middle, but I loved it"".

Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi regime, has been missing since he entered the country's consulate in Turkey on 2 October. Turkish officials say he was killed and dismembered inside the building by a 15-member Saudi ""assassination squad"" and say they have evidence to support their claims. They have not made any of the information they are basing their claims on public, although pro-government Turkish press reported that audio of the killing was recorded on Mr Khashoggi's Apple watch. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and their German counterpart Heiko Maas have said: ""Defending freedom of expression and a free press and ensuring the protection of journalists are key priorities for Germany, the United Kingdom and France."" The statement continued: ""There needs to be a credible investigation to establish the truth about what happened, and - if relevant - to identify those bearing responsibility for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, and ensure that they are held to account. ""We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi government to provide a complete and detailed response."" The statement has also been delivered directly to the Saudi authorities. Mr Hunt later added that the UK would react if Saudi Arabia was behind the disappearance. He said: ""I don't want to get drawn into hypotheticals because we don't know the facts yet, but we have been very, very clear that if these stories are true, that would be totally appalling and we would have to think about the appropriate way to react in that situation."" Earlier on Sunday, Saudi Arabia says it rejects any ""threats"" of sanctions or political pressure from the United States over the disappearance of a journalist. The Saudi statement issued via the state-run press agency on Sunday warned the kingdom would respond to any steps taken against it. ""The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats or attempts to undermine it whether through threats to impose economic sanctions or the use of political pressure,"" an official source said, quoted by SPA. He said Riyadh would ""respond to any action with a bigger one"", pointing out that the oil superpower ""plays an effective and vital role in the world economy"". It did not directly acknowledge Mr Khashoggi's disappearance and came shortly after the Saudi stock market plunged by nearly 7% on Sunday. President Donald Trump has warned the US would inflict ""severe punishment"" if Saudi Arabia was behind his disappearance. He told CBS: ""We're going to get to the bottom of it."" However, Mr Trump added the US would be ""punishing itself"" if it cancelled military sales to Riyadh over the disappearance of the Saudi journalist. Turkey's Sabah newspaper, which claims Turkish officials now have the audio of the alleged killing, reports the recording was uploaded to a phone he had left with his fiancee and his iCloud, a storage facility. The alleged assassin team was pictured landing in Istanbul on day journalist disappeared It also reported that Saudi intelligence agents realised after he died that the watch was recording and tried to delete the file, first by incorrectly guessing Mr Khashoggi's pin number on the watch, then later using the journalist's finger. However unlike iPhones, Apple watches do not have a fingerprint ID unlock function. The newspaper's account also did not elaborate on how the Apple Watch synced the information to both the phone and iCloud account. Saudi officials call all the allegations ""baseless"", but have offered no evidence Mr Khashoggi left the consulate. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom, is pushing for Saudi Arabia to become a destination for foreign investment. Mr Khashoggi's disappearance, and suspicions he may have been targeted over his criticism of the royal, have led several business leaders and media outlets to back out of an upcoming high-profile investment conference in Riyadh."

His description of the concentration camp he and his one-year-old sister were taken to, the appalling conditions they were forced to live in and the terror they felt. ""The main mode of death was being taken off in a cattle truck, in a train of about 1,000 people to places like Auschwitz and the fear was primarily the fear that ones name would appear on the next list,"" he recalls. Martin and his sister escaped. Their father was killed by Nazis. He now spends his time reliving the horrific memories so children can learn first-hand about the Holocaust. ""The objective of it is that they should understand that things like this happen, human beings behave like that and we hope that they will enquire to understand more about it,"" he says. But he is aware of his advancing years and knows there will come a time when there are no longer any survivors remaining to give younger generations their first-hand account. That is why he and nine other Holocaust survivors have worked for the last three years on an ambitious project with the National Holocaust Centre and Museum in Newark, supported by Genesis Philanthropy Group. Determined that their voices will still be heard they have recorded their experiences and views for the Forever Project. Crucially, the cutting-edge technology means people will be able to interact with them for decades to come. ""Each of the survivors answered between 850 and 1,400 questions,"" explains Sarah Coward, from the National Holocaust Centre and Museum. ""They were filmed over five days and that created over 20 hours of film for each survivor. It created a really rich archive and a rich legacy for each person who was speaking. ""What we've done is integrated that ultra-definition film footage with voice recognition technology and natural languaging technologies to enable children now and in the future to be able to ask a survivor questions and hear them answer."" Steven Frank, who was held in a concentration camp for two years as a child, is also a participant. His interactive recordings are the first to be used by school children who visit the centre.

2018-10-11,The man who hurled acid on television presenter Katie Piper has been released from prison.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181014220159/https://news.sky.com/story/katie-piper-acid-attacker-stefan-sylvestre-released-from-prison-after-nine-years-11524849,"Stefan Sylvestre, 30, was given a life sentence with a minimum term of six years in 2009 for the attack on the current Strictly Come Dancing contestant. It is understood he was released from a jail in Suffolk on Wednesday. Piper, 35, suffered horrific injuries and was left partially blind after her ex-boyfriend Daniel Lynch arranged for Sylvestre to throw sulphuric acid at her face in north London in March 2008. It was revealed in August that the Parole Board had directed Sylvestre's release after the case was considered at an oral hearing. At the time, Piper issued a statement saying she was going through ""a really difficult time"". ""I am trying to come to terms with the decision and this is something I need to deal with,"" she tweeted. ""Over the past two weeks Strictly has already given me such a welcome and positive distraction from my past. Whilst there is never a good time to hear this news, I am glad I have this new journey to concentrate on."" pic.twitter.com/A5KiG7SFs5 A source told The Sun newspaper that Sylvestre's licence conditions include an exclusion zone barring him from an area around Piper's address, but he has been allowed to return to London. She has also reportedly been given extra security by Strictly bosses during her work on the BBC1 show. In the summary of its decision to release Sylvestre, the Parole Board said he had ""displayed empathy"" for Piper and ""expressed remorse and shame for his actions"". ""During his time in custody, Mr Sylvestre has actively avoided anti-social behaviour within the prison and has avoided violence, despite being under threat,"" it said. ""He has behaved well to distance himself from such influences. ""He has not been involved in drugs in prison and has completed relevant offence-focused work to challenge and change his attitude and thinking."" Sylvestre became eligible to be considered for release in April 2014 and had a previous review by the Parole Board in 2015. Lynch was jailed for life with a minimum of 16 years for raping Piper and telling Sylvestre to throw acid over her. The pair had dated briefly before steroid-fuelled martial arts fan Lynch, who had a previous conviction for pouring boiling water over a man, became obsessively jealous. In court, Lynch and Sylvestre were told by Judge Nicholas Browne QC they were ""the face of pure evil"". Piper, who waived her right to anonymity, shared her story about surviving the attack in the documentary Katie: My Beautiful Face. She is due to perform the jive on Strictly with her dance partner Gorka Marquez on Saturday night's show."
2018-10-11,Football fans have accused the police of using tactics more suitable for dealing with organised crime or terrorism at stadiums in Scotland.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181014220159/https://news.sky.com/story/football-fans-accuse-police-of-tapping-into-mobile-phones-11525215,"Since 2011, Police Scotland has had a special unit to provide a consistent approach to policing football matches. It was set-up after a bad-tempered Celtic v Rangers match and now has 15 full-time dedicated officers and an annual budget of £780,909. The Football Coordination Unit for Scotland says it takes an ""intelligence-led"" approach to policing at football. Supporters groups believe their methods have gone much further than filming fans at matches with small cameras. Jeanette Findlay, from Fans Against Criminalisation, said: ""During the campaign against the Offensive Behaviour Act we had reason to believe on more than one occasion that our communications were being intercepted. ""In addition, we have had a number of young men approached to become informants for the police."" Sky News submitted a freedom of information request to Police Scotland asking how many applications they had made for a warrant to intercept the content of communications in each of the last five years and whether any related to policing of football matches. Official figures show that across the whole of the UK 3,007 interception warrants were issued in 2016. Nearly all related to serious crimes such as drug dealing and armed robbery or to national security. Police Scotland refused to disclose how many of those applications came from Scotland, saying: ""Detailed information regarding existing and future applications would ultimately reveal specific operational activity."" They added that it would specifically compromise the tactical advantage of Police Scotland in relation to criminality associated with national security. Sky News also asked how many communications data application forms had been completed by officers working with the Football Co-ordination Unit in each of the last five years. This is the form police must submit to check the text messages on someone's phone or see which websites they have visited. Police Scotland also refused this request, saying: ""It simply cannot be in the public interest for Police Scotland or any agency to confirm the existence of information relating to specific police tactics."" National security was again used to justify the decision: ""The threat of terrorism cannot be ignored. It should be recognised that the international security landscape is increasingly complex and unpredictable. ""The UK faces a sustained threat from violent terrorists and extremists."" Ms Findlay says the public should be very concerned. ""People should remember that we are not talking about organised crime or terrorism - we are taking about football fans - and yet tactics more suited to such serious criminal activity are being used against us and exemptions to freedom of information requests relevant to national security are used to block legitimate journalistic enquiry into the policing of football,"" she said. The UK's most senior police officer with responsibility for football is currently leading a review of policing at matches in Scotland. It was ordered after a crush at Celtic Park on 2 September, in which five supporters were injured. Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts will look into intelligence gathering as well as operational planning for games. Labour MSP James Kelly, who led the campaign in the Scottish parliament for the repeal of the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act, wants to see a change in the culture of policing. ""The review being conducted into policing at football in Scotland needs to produce a step change in police attitudes,"" he said. ""Treating football supporters with respect should be a central aim of this review."""
2018-10-11,Iain Duncan Smith has called on Theresa May to back £2bn extra funding for welfare in the upcoming budget.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181014220159/https://news.sky.com/story/universal-credit-theresa-may-should-back-2bn-extra-funding-for-welfare-says-iain-duncan-smith-11525768,"The prime minister and Chancellor Philip Hammond have been coming under pressure to increase funding for universal credit after it was revealed that some people would be worse off under the troubled scheme. Mr Duncan Smith, who was the architect of the system, told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that topping up funding was the best way of reaching the ""just about managing"" Mrs May promised she would help. Sky News is calling for the creation of an Independent Leaders' Debates Commission to oversee television debates He said: ""Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street and said I want to look after those who are just about managing. ""Universal credit is the single best system to get to those who are just about managing. ""It's better than the tax system, it's better than charitable giveaways - it gets the money to that bottom four deciles in a way no other system does."" Mr Duncan Smith quit his role as work and pensions secretary in 2016 over billions being cut from the benefits scheme. The former Tory leader said Mr Hammond - who will reveal details of the government's budget on 29 October - needed to prioritise welfare payments over tax cuts if he wanted to help the poorest. ""The key thing is the structure works but we need to put the money in,"" Mr Duncan Smith said. Sky News obtained data revealing a stark increase in universal credit claimants struggling to pay for housing and food ""I think this government is listening, I think the chancellor is listening and I'm asking him to do that. ""If we do that and get the money back to where it should be the reality is nobody should lose at all."" Mr Duncan Smith also defended the controversial decision to pay universal credits one month in arrears, saying it would identify those who could not cope. :: Sky Views: Could universal credit become PM's poll tax?:: MPs fear benefits reform will become 'burning injustice' He said: ""If you are not capable of coping with that then you're going to go into a job and crash out quite quickly. ""Universal credit will identify that minority of people who will not be able to move into work with those problems and then try and resolve them."" Universal credit was launched in 2013 as a single-monthly benefit for people in or out of work. The number of people on universal credit is set to double this year, with more than seven million people, expected to be registered by 2022 It merged into one payment six other benefits; income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey reportedly told colleagues last week that families could be £2,400 a year - £200 a month - worse off on universal credit. Shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti told Sophy Ridge that universal credit was now a ""toxic brand"" and it would be ""very hard to rebuild trust in it"". ""The theoretical idea that you can have one simple benefit rather than people having to apply for lots of benefits always appealed to me in theory,"" she said. ""The problem with universal credit now is, under this government, it is being used to cut people's benefits - to penalise people for having too many children, to penalise the disabled and other vulnerable people. ""The notion of a simpler benefits system - great idea, but not if you are adding austerity to it."""
2018-10-11,Police have issued an image of a cyclist wanted after the murder of a man who was gunned down in front of his girlfriend in Liverpool.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181014220159/https://news.sky.com/story/liverpool-shooting-cctv-image-shows-cyclist-wanted-over-murder-of-carl-russell-11525898,"Carl Russell, 27, was shot dead a week ago in the Belle Vale area of the city as he and his partner got out of a car. It was later revealed Mr Russell was a prisoner on day release from HMP Thorn Cross, a category D open jail in Warrington. Merseyside Police said the CCTV image showed a cyclist who they believe has ""vital information"" about the murder. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Baker said: ""If you recognise the jacket he is wearing or the bike he is riding, have seen these in recent days, or heard any discussion locally about these items, please let us know."" Police previously said the gunman made off on a pedal bike and was believed to have been dressed in black with a high-vis orange jacket. Mr Baker urged anyone with information to come forward to help identify who was responsible for the ""shocking murder"". ""You may have information which you think is minor, or insignificant, and don't think it is worth letting us know,"" he added. ""Let us make that decision, because what you know may be the key to solving this crime, removing dangerous people and weapons from the streets, and getting justice for Carl's family."" A 33-year-old man and a 29-year-old man who were arrested in connection with the murder have been released pending further inquiries. Mr Russell, who survived a previous attempt on his life in 2010, was described by his family as a ""loveable rogue"". In a statement following his death, they said: "" Carl was an amazing son, brother, uncle, nephew and boyfriend who idolised his true love Lakyn. ""Carl was a mummy's boy who loved his pops. He would do anything for anyone and had a heart of gold. ""His family and Lakyn were his world. Carl was no angel - he was our lovable rogue."" It has not been confirmed what offence Mr Russell had committed which resulted in his jail sentence."
2018-10-11,Researchers are calling for change after they found black people in England and Wales are almost nine times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched for drugs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181014220159/https://news.sky.com/story/stop-and-search-racial-injustice-getting-worse-report-11525637,"They said the situation had ""got worse not better"" four years after Theresa May - then home secretary - declared stop and search was ""unfair, especially to young black men"". The joint study by the London School of Economics and Political Science, the Stopwatch coalition and drug law experts Release showed that although police use of stop and search had fallen significantly, there had been a rise in racial disparities in the policing and prosecution of drug offences. Black people were stopped and searched at 8.7 times the amount of white people for drugs by 2016/17, according to the report. For other offences, it was 7.9 times the rate of white people. Officers carried out 303,845 stops and searches in the year to March 2017, which is the lowest number since records started in 2001/02. The practice has been condemned by critics who say it unfairly targets people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. :: Senior officer calls for stop and search increase to combat violent crime In 2014, Mrs May introduced reforms to ensure powers were used in a more targeted way but Tottenham MP David Lammy said the new figures represented a ""profound racial injustice"". Recounting the first time he was ""frisked, groped and harassed"" by police as a 12-year-old, he told The Observer: ""Grounded in the fictitious narrative that drug use is especially prevalent among black and minority ethnic groups, the current practice of stop and search entertains a racist fantasy. ""As we speak, there will be young, white middle-class men smoking a joint at a campus university or having cocaine delivered to their dinner parties, but the police will be nowhere in sight."" According to the report, entitled The Colour of Injustice: Race, Drugs and Law Enforcement in England and Wales, drug searches made up 60% of all stop and searches - the majority for possession. Black people are treated more harshly when they are found in possession of drugs, the researchers also found. The analysis found the detection rate from stop and search is similar for all ethnic groups but black people were arrested at a higher rate than white people and handed out of court disposals at a lower rate. For white people, arrests for drugs as a result of a search fell by 52% between 2010/11 and 2016/17 while the figure for black people did not fall at all, the report said. Co-author of the study Dr Rebekah Delsol said: ""More than four years after the home secretary declared that stop and search is unfair to young black men, it is shocking that the situation has got worse not better. ""The police are clearly unable or unwilling to deal with the problem and a solution needs to come from elsewhere."" She added: ""Forces that cannot use stop and search fairly and effectively should have the powers taken away."""

In a video message, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her MPs would back a people's vote - ""which includes the option to remain in the EU"" - if the issue came before the House of Commons. ""The Tory government's handling of these negotiations has been chaotic, incompetent and shambolic,"" she said. ""Having spent two years telling us that no deal was better than a bad deal, the prime minister is now preparing to pile pressure on MPs to vote for a bad or blindfold deal on the grounds that 'no-deal' would be catastrophic. ""She is trying to scare the UK into the frying pan out of fear of the fire. It is a scandal and it should not be accepted."" Among the famous faces at the rally was Lord Of The Rings star Andy Serkis, who called it ""one of the most, if not the most important march of a generation"".

Speaking to Sky News, Ms Soubry was delighted with the turn out at the event but admitted it did not equate to the 17 million people who voted Leave. She said: ""The thing that's really striking though is that when we started this, it was truthfully at our opening event back in April with two or 300 people. ""Then we marched in June and it was 100,000 people, and today it looks like it's at least 700,000 and I think that shows the movement, the fact we are winning the argument and most importantly it's among people who had voted Leave.

They are not happy at all, this is not what people voted for - the chaos, the mess, the uncertainty."" One of those Leavers is 43-year-old Jason Gillot, from London, who changed his mind five days after the referendum. ""I'm politically agnostic but I was just sick of the lies that have come out of both sides,"" he said, adding that he chose to vote Leave because of ""economic evidence partly supplied by the Tax Payers' Alliance"" which he said ""made sense at the time"". While the People's Vote march got under way, a pro-Brexit rally got took place at the same time in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Supporters of leaving the EU were addressed by Nigel Farage, and MPs Kate Hoey and Nigel Owen Paterson in a rally that pledged to ""rescue Brexit"" and express ""support for the Brexit Britain voted for"". The event, run by Leave Means Leave and thought to be attended by around 1,200 people, branded the campaign for a second referendum a ""losers' vote""."

Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? In a statement, the palace said: ""After a busy programme, the duke and duchess have decided to cut back the duchess's schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week-and-a-half of the tour. ""The duke will attend the cycling as scheduled this morning, and the duchess will join him for this afternoon's engagements. The duke will continue with the engagements on Fraser Island as planned."" Meghan pulled out of an arranged meeting with Invictus Games competitors to rest after Saturday's ceremony overran by nearly two hours, leaving the duke to present the medals alone on Sunday morning. But in the afternoon, Meghan did make it to an Invictus reception hosted by Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the city's central parkland, The Domain. A royal source said the duchess was ""not sick, just tired"", and was keen to take part in everything. The source added: ""We have to try to pace her. We have to make sure she is well-paced and not overdoing it. ""She had a very late night last night. She wants to do everything, but Prince Harry is encouraging her to pace herself. ""We want to make sure she gets enough rest at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day. If it has been a very late night due to unforeseen circumstances, we have to adjust for that."" The baby news was announced on the eve of the duke and duchess's first official visit outside the UK and Ireland. Meghan will fly to Fraser Island for the next stop on their tour, but Harry will carry out the planned programme of events on his own. It's also anticipated that she will still fly on to Fiji and Tonga, but there may be further changes to her programme. This is the first major overseas royal tour for the couple since they got married in May. Over 16 days they are travelling to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand, with a packed programme of over 70 engagements. At Sunday's Invictus event, Harry shared a laugh with one Australian athlete who appeared to ask him to sign a pair of swimming trunks - known to Australians as ""budgie smugglers"". Later, Harry actually did put on a pair of trunks - but over his jeans. They were presented to him by disabled sports presenter Dylan Alcott and two members of the Australian Invictus team at Admiralty House. Mr Alcott, who is a triple Paralympic gold medallist in wheelchair tennis and wheelchair basketball, said: ""[Harry] said: 'Shall I put them on?'. We said: 'One hundred per cent'. So he put them on. Good on him!"""
2018-10-21,Ryanair has been criticised after footage emerged of a passenger racially abusing an elderly black woman sat next to him.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/ryanair-criticised-over-footage-of-passenger-racially-abusing-woman-11531675,"The budget airline has reported the matter to Essex Police after a video of the row was shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook. Social media users have expressed outrage at the clip, which shows Ryanair staff failing to reprimand the customer or remove him from the plane. The row took place on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted before take-off on Friday afternoon. At the beginning of the footage, the 77-year-old woman's daughter can be heard telling the man her mother is disabled. He replies: ""I don't care whether she's f****** disabled or not - if I tell her to get out she gets out."" The man then calls her ""an ugly f****** c***"" and tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: ""If you don't go to another seat I'll push you to another seat."" The passenger, who has not been named, then shouts ""don't talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow"" before calling her an ""ugly black b******"". Staff on the flight seem to do little to silence the man during the footage, leaving a passenger sitting behind to try and deal with the situation. A member of the cabin crew comes over at one point and says: ""Don't be so rude okay, you have to calm down."" David Lawrence, 55, filmed the footage and can be heard calling for the passenger to be thrown off the flight. He told Sky News: ""I'm so disappointed in Ryanair. ""They've done nothing. ""They've reported it to the police only after the media explosion, it's been two days."" The elderly woman, named only as Mrs Gayle in the Huffington Post, can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash. Her daughter told the news site that if a black person had behaved in the same way they would have been thrown off the flight immediately. She said that the man turned on her mother because she had arthritis, meaning it took her some time to move out of the way so he could reach his seat. The daughter said she had taken her mother, a Windrush generation migrant who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s, on holiday to mark one year since the death of her father. She said that when she had complained to cabin crew they denied hearing any racial slurs and they told her to ring customer services on Monday. The Twitter account @StanceGrounded posted the video on Sunday and had 28,000 retweets by 2pm. Karl Turner, Labour MP for East Hull and shadow attorney general, tweeted: ""He should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police. ""We assume the aircraft was in the UK. If it was he definitely committed criminal offences. I fully expect @Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight."" MSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: ""This is really appalling @Ryanair. You will know the identity of the man and the level of training given to your staff.""

Defence minister Tobias Ellwood announced the study amid an investigation by The Sunday Times, which has found that 42 current soldiers are believed to have killed themselves this year. Mr Ellwood said: ""Our armed forces do a magnificent job, and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to each man and woman who has laid their life on the line to keep our country safe. ""Most transition successfully into civilian life once they have put away their uniforms, but we cannot afford to be complacent. Mental health problems can affect us all, and the wellbeing of our people remains a top priority."" There have been growing concerns about mental health problems experienced by current troops and veterans, which have surged over the last decade. In July, the House of Commons defence committee published its latest report on the scale of the issue, warning that the number of armed forces personnel seeking help had nearly doubled since 2008. Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? Official MoD figures showed that 3.1% of those serving had been diagnosed with mental health conditions, which was twice as many as in 2008/9. But the number of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression could be three times higher because many do not seek help due to the stigma surrounding mental health, the report added. Many of those in need of treatment had been deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq, with the report noting that being involved in combat there ""clearly increased the likelihood of mental health conditions"". But it also said that most servicemen and women left the military with no such problems, and that it would be ""harmful"" to suggest that they did. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK."

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency later said in a tweet: ""HM Coastguard can confirm that nobody is in the water or missing in Cowes Harbour.

2018-10-21,The former independent slavery commissioner has criticised the Home Office for failing to implement proposals he says they agreed to a year ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/modern-slavery-victims-let-down-by-government-says-former-commissioner-11528350,"In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Kevin Hyland expressed frustration that slavery victims were being ""held on a piece of string"", waiting for overdue decisions on their status. The government says it is leading the world in tackling slavery, but Mr Hyland is among critics who say the victims are not being properly looked after once they have escaped or been rescued. Home Office guidelines say potential victims will be assessed and processed within 45 days of coming to the attention of authorities. But Sky News has learned that the majority of cases go well over that time period, with many people waiting more than a year. Speaking on national anti-slavery day Mr Hyland told Sky News: ""One of the things I highlighted to the government was the fact that it was taking so long to make a decision. ""In many ways it is not the funding that is the problem it is the decision making. ""If those decisions were made in a much shorter time then that funding could be used to give the victims other opportunities such as education, work, whatever else that may be."" The former commissioner says that none of his recommendations have been properly seen through. He added: ""We know there are problems. They've been identified, the solutions have been put forward and a year later we are still waiting for those to be implemented. ""I think we have to accept that's just not good enough. We need to see things implemented quicker."" Earlier this year the prime minister described modern slavery as ""the great human rights issue of our time"". On a trip to Africa she announced measures to tackle the problem of trafficking. But charities also say victims are not being properly supported and some even fall back into slavery after being rescued due to delays in getting help. The charity HESTIA, which helps find safe houses for hundreds of victims every year, says the average wait for a decision is 303 days. During this time victims are not allowed to work and are unable to get on with their lives. Ella Read, area manager for HESTIA, said: ""There is a constant background anxiety of them knowing that any day a decision could come through the post. ""It could be a decision in their favour, or it could not be a decision in their favour, and that can really hamper someone's ability to meaningfully recover in that time."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? In 2014 a Home Office study estimated there were between 10,000 and 13,000 modern slaves in the UK. But the Walk Free Foundation recently suggested there could be as many as 136,000. More than 5,000 victims of slavery and trafficking were referred to the police in the last year alone. That is a 35% increase on the year before. Sky News interviewed one 48 year-old victim who escaped from sex slavery and has waited 18 months for a decision on her status. ""Susie"" was brought to the UK from Ghana by a man she thought she was going to marry. Instead, the man confiscated her passport, she was kept in servitude and forced to have sex. Sexual exploitation is the most common form of modern slavery reported in the UK, followed by labour exploitation, forced criminal exploitation and domestic servitude. A Home Office spokesman said: ""Modern slavery is a barbaric crime that destroys the lives of its victims, which is why we introduced the world-leading Modern Slavery Act in 2015 and have put in place the Modern Slavery Strategy. ""The package of reforms we've announced to the National Referral Mechanism will markedly improve our system for identifying and supporting victims and lead to quicker, more certain decisions on cases. ""We aim to make a decision as quickly as possible, but we need to ensure we have all the information available, which can take time in complex cases. ""Potential victims receive a comprehensive package of support while a decision on their case is being made."""
2018-10-21,"We could be creating a food allergy epidemic because we are not weaning babies on to allergens sooner, according to a leading paediatric allergy specialist.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/wean-babies-on-to-allergens-sooner-to-prevent-epidemic-says-expert-11531288,"Public Health England's advice urges the introduction of peanuts and other allergens from around six months but Gideon Lack, professor of paediatric allergy at King's College London, says that could be two months too late. ""Food allergy is a growing issue, it has become a big issue, I would say to use the word 'epidemic' would not be inappropriate."" Each year, 64,000 new cases emerge of children with food allergies. From peanuts to cheese, the issue is growing. Two per cent of babies born in the UK will have a serious peanut allergy by the age of three, and nearly one in 10 will be vulnerable to an anaphylactic food allergy. Professor Lack is advocating for a strategy he believes reduces these figures. In a 2015 study, he urged health policies to consider weaning babies on to allergen foods from four months. ""Six months is certainly too late for egg allergy - the majority of which develops between four and six months of age,"" he said. ""If we are to prevent an egg allergy and a substantial proportion of peanut allergy, we need to intervene earlier."" New national health guidelines in North America advocate peanut be considered as early as four months in high risk children with severe eczema. Australia and some European countries have also adopted the strategy. Callum Newman, seven, suffers from 28 food allergies - eight of them anaphylactic. His mother Nathalie said she is so vigilant over which foods are safe for her son that her investigative skills would put the FBI to shame. She said: ""All labels need to be checked, in case manufacturing methods change. ""And when eating out, making sure the right questions are asked to ensure food is safe and cross contamination isn't a problem."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? The recent case of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, who died from an allergic reaction after eating a Pret a Manger sandwich on a flight, highlighted the terrible consequences of eating the wrong thing. ""Some food allergies are there to stay for life and any of them can cause life-threatening reactions, or even very unfortunately in some cases fatalities due to anaphylaxis,"" said Prof Lack. ""This is a very big burden of disease and a serious burden on the population."""
2018-10-21,One of the victims of a grooming gang jailed for abusing 15 girls believes there are more young people yet to speak out.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/huddersfield-grooming-gang-victim-says-there-are-more-girls-being-abused-11531192,"Speaking anonymously to Sky News, the woman - who was abused between the ages of 13 and 18 - shared her story and urged others to ""get justice for themselves"". The call comes after sixteen men were jailed for a total of 221 years as part of the grooming gang who abused 15 girls in and around Huddersfield between 2004 and 2011. Four more men were found guilty and are waiting to be sentenced for offences such as rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation. The victim said she became ""friends"" with the men at first before the abuse started. ""They used to buy you gifts, give you cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis,"" she said. ""And then I was in a relationship with one of them, and then it's like you start getting passed around to their friends and stuff. ""Some days you're waking up and you don't even know how you've ended up in certain places. ""You can't remember what happened to you. It was just a circle."" She said she was taking drugs, getting her drinks spiked and was ""constantly getting beaten up"". She said it was ""all a bit of a haze"". It was years before she spoke out about her ordeal. She said she thought there were ""loads of victims out there that need to come forward and get justice for themselves"". The woman said she believed abuse was still going on in Huddersfield. ""The men, they range from various ages. I think the oldest was 54 and the youngest was in his 20s,"" she said. ""And it's like the older ones pass it down to the younger generation. ""History will just keep on repeating itself."" She added: ""I hope that the results that we've got gives them to courage to come forward and speak up and get the justice they deserve."" The woman's mother told Sky News she wanted to see better awareness of grooming and how it can manifest. ""As a parent, with a 13-year-old, if you notice a change in their behaviour, any change - don't be afraid, don't be afraid to ask them why,"" she said. ""Don't be afraid to say to them 'look - are you being groomed?' ""Explain what it is because that is the only way we're going to stop this - we have to make them aware."" She said the victims had been ""failed by all the authorities in question"". ""They do need more safeguarding training, they need more awareness around it,"" she said. ""[They need to know] not to be afraid, for them to speak out and not to be afraid of arresting somebody and saying 'look, we think this is going on'."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? The convictions have spurred new debate around grooming gangs with all of the men being of south Asian heritage and predominantly Pakistani backgrounds. Commenting on the case, Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: ""These sick Asian paedophiles are finally facing justice. I want to commend the bravery of the victims. For too long, they were ignored. Not on my watch. There will be no no-go areas."" Labour MP David Lammy denounced Mr Javid's remarks and replied: ""Shame on you @sajidjavid. Words have consequences and your pandering to the far right increases the risk of violence against British Asians."" Local mosque leaders have since spoken out to strongly condemn the ""monstrous"" crimes. The Kirklees Imams and Mosques Advisory Board said: ""We are working in partnership with the police, the local authority and other bodies and groups at various levels with the twin aims of supporting vulnerable children and educating communities to report these types of crimes. ""These atrocious crimes are not rooted in any social class, culture, ethnicity, colour or religion but are the result of evil and immoral intentions of the predators."""
2018-10-21,It is a fact of our political system that you cannot vote with your feet.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/peoples-vote-unlikely-but-the-message-was-loud-and-clear-11531205,"And so arguments over the precise size of the crowd that marched through London today demanding a ""People's Vote"" are largely irrelevant. There was no threshold that the number of marchers could have passed which would trigger a second referendum - whether it was 700 people or, as organisers estimate, 700,000. That's not to say protests do not matter - it was a major expression of public opposition to the government's current trajectory; there were certainly hundreds of thousands of people; and it was certainly one of the largest demonstrations the capital has seen since the anti-war march of 2003. But back then Tony Blair was able to ignore the passion of the million or so anti-Iraq War protesters because he had a majority - and backing from a number of opposition MPs - that would see any decision to go to war in Iraq get through parliament. Theresa May does not have anything like a safe majority, but what she does have is a legal process, in the form of Article 50, which means she can theoretically ignore the people's vote demands. If she can get a deal with the EU, and get that deal passed by a majority of MPs, the UK will leave the EU next year with no requirement for her to grant a second referendum on the terms - no amount of street protests can change that fact. The problem for Theresa May, however, is that it remains far from clear whether a deal on the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU is possible, and even more uncertain whether a deal that the EU are content to sign is one that MPs will accept. Indeed the prospect of complete gridlock in parliament is very real - with no majority for a no-deal exit from the EU, and major question marks over whether there is a majority for the kind of deal Mrs May is hoping for. With the DUP and the ERG wing of hard Brexiteers in her own party seemingly dead set against what the government is trying to negotiate, it would require a significant number of Labour MPs to defy their own party and support Mrs May. While a clutch from certain leave-voting constituencies might do this, it is unlikely to be enough. It is this prospect of impending parliamentary paralysis that increases the plausibility of a further referendum as an option. Arguments that the 2016 vote was illegitimate because voters were misinformed by the campaigns will likely continue, so too will those that say people should have a say on the final details of a deal because these weren't known in the first vote. But so long as she can secure a deal, Theresa May can continue to shrug these off. Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? If, however, parliament gets to the point where a firm decision is impossible, the argument that a second referendum could be used to end the impasse is likely to be harder to dismiss. Labour, of course, say they want a general election in these circumstances. But that is not something the government is obliged to offer due to the Fixed Terms Parliament Act. There are all sorts of issues that a second referendum would create - from what options are on the ballot paper, to the question of timing and whether article 50 process would need to be extended, to what happens in practical terms if the people's vote returns a second majority for leaving the EU. That said, it is not totally implausible that enough Tory MPs could conclude they would rather deal with those issues than fight a general election which could put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. We are not there yet, and despite the massive turnout at the march, it is still the case that you cannot vote with your feet, no matter how many walk together. But you can send a message. And today that message will have been heard loud and clear, not just by the prime minister, but by Jeremy Corbyn - if a second referendum is to happen, one of them will need to back it."

Marco Ianni had pumped his fists in front of the United bench before there was a confrontation in the tunnel. Mourinho had to be restrained by stewards before Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri managed to reconcile the Manchester United manager. When asked about the incident, Mourinho told Sky Sports: ""I can tell you that the 97 minutes game was so good that you have to focus on that. ""I did not get respect back from Chelsea fans but that is not my responsibility. ""What I did here today I will do in Madrid, in Milan, in Porto, the reaction from the fans is not up to me. ""I am not annoyed with anything. What happened with Sarri's assistant, Sarri was the first one to come to me and say he will resolve it. ""The assistant has already come to me and apologised, I told him to forget it. I have made a lot of mistakes in my career.""

The survey focused on companies employing fewer than 500 people and it found that 82% will start to implement their contingency plans by December if the Brexit process does not get any clearer. The news comes as fears grow that the UK could leave the European Union in March without a deal, resulting in tariffs on exports, border checks and travel restrictions. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the situation was ""urgent"", adding: ""The speed of negotiations is being outpaced by the reality firms are facing on the ground. ""Unless a withdrawal agreement is locked down by December, firms will press the button on their contingency plans. ""Jobs will be lost and supply chains moved. ""The knock-on effect for the UK economy would be significant: living standards would be affected and less money would be available for vital public services including schools, hospitals and housing."" Ms Fairbairn said the uncertainty was ""draining investment"" from the UK, adding: ""From a multinational plastics manufacturer which has cancelled a £7m investment, to a fashion house shelving £50m plans for a new UK factory, these are grave losses to our economy. ""Many firms won't publicise these decisions, yet their impact will show in lower GDP years down the line."" According to the CBI, 80% of companies said Brexit had already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, more than double the 36% that said the same a year ago. Two-thirds said Brexit had affected how attractive the UK was to investors. One in four said it had no impact. Last week's summit between prime minister Theresa May and Europe's leaders made little progress towards a deal and a second summit in November has been called off.

2018-10-21,The UK is open to extending the Brexit transition period in a bid to break the impasse in the negotiations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/britain-open-minded-about-extending-brexit-transition-period-dominic-raab-says-11531532,"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would consider such a step, provided it would ""solve"" the Irish backstop issue and there was ""route out"" so it did not go on indefinitely. He suggested three months as a possible time frame. The issue of how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in the event that a deal on Britain's future relationship takes longer than expected has been the source of much contention between both sides. The EU wants the backstop - essentially an insurance policy - to apply to just Northern Ireland, something which Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken out against. Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? Extending the transition period - which will run from March 2019 to the end of December 2020 - may allow more time to sort this out. But the move would prove controversial with eurosceptic MPs, who would likely be against sticking to EU rules and regulations for any longer than is necessary. Using it to potentially remove the thorny issue of the backstop could dampen down such anger, but it is unclear whether it would be something Brussels would agree to. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""If we need a bridge from the end of the implementation period to the future relationship ... I am open minded about using a short extension of the implementation period. ""It is an obvious possible route as long as it is short, perhaps a few months, and secondly that we know how we get out of it and obviously it has to solve the backstop issue so that that falls away then as a possibility."" Mr Raab also said he thought a withdrawal deal needed to be agreed by the end of November in order to get the legislation through parliament in time for when the UK officially leaves in March. His comments on the transition period were echoed by Brexit minister Suella Braverman. She told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: ""Dominic has been clear that we would accept a potential extension by a few months subject to either a finite time limit or mechanism to extricate ourselves from it if it means breaking this impasse and avoiding the very unattractive proposal by the EU, which is an indefinite customs union and a limbo period, which would cause complete uncertainty and not honour Brexit."" Ms Braverman added: ""We need a date or a very clear mechanism or clause in the agreement which enables us to get out of it. ""We cannot sign up to something which is in perpetuity, vague and leaves us exposed to indefinite membership of the customs union."" The latest Brexit developments have piled further pressure on Mrs May, with some MPs reportedly warning the PM she has days to save her job. When asked about the growing criticism of his boss, Mr Raab said it was ""understandable that there are jitters"", but ""we need to hold our nerve"". He added: ""The end is in sight in terms of a good deal, the prize we want."" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer has warned the PM that if she is hoping the party will help her get her Brexit blueprint through parliament then she can ""think again"". The shadow Brexit secretary said there is a ""real lack of confidence"" Mrs May can secure ""anything by way of a good deal"". He told Marr it was not in the national interest to back a bad deal. ""What we're going to see is even if there's a deal, the Tory Party will try to rip it up next year - some of them are already saying they're going to do that - so this idea of an historic moment just before Christmas in the national interest isn't going to happen.

2018-10-21,"Anti-Brexit groups are running at least twice as many adverts as major Leave campaigns on Facebook - and possibly up to 59 times more, Sky News can reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/remain-v-leave-scale-of-facebook-ad-war-revealed-11530148,"The two largest Remain campaigns, People's Vote and Best for Britain, are currently running 16 Facebook ads on their pages. By contrast, Leave Means Leave, the group backed by Nigel Farage, is running five ads. Leave.EU is only running two. A data set of Facebook ads over the last two-and-a-half months, seen exclusively by Sky News, presents an even starker contrast. In this period, the Best For Britain and People's Vote campaigns ran 177 ads, whereas the two largest pro-Brexit campaigns ran only three.   Ahead of the Remain-supporting March for the Future taking place in London on Saturday, People's Vote and Best for Britain aimed ads at different geographic regions of the UK - including Swansea, Edinburgh, Hackney, Liverpool and Stoke. It also targeted ads at supporters of Premiership football clubs, including West Ham United and Manchester City, telling fans how much their club had lost out on in the transfer window as a result of the weak pound. Tom Baldwin, director of communications for People's Vote, told Sky News that the campaign had also targeted Facebook users in the West Midlands after the boss of Jaguar Land Rover said that Brexit could put tens of thousands of jobs at risk. Baldwin said the People's Vote campaign had increased the number of ads it was putting out in recent weeks, adding: ""We've just really started doing this, and we've managed to reach around two or three million people, that's the kind of impressions that we're getting."" The historic Facebook ads come from a start-up called Who Targets Me, which uses a free browser plug-in to collect Facebook ads from around 10,000 different news feeds. It pulls in between 7,000 and 8,000 ads a day, many of which are related to Brexit. ""There's a lot more advertising coming from the Remain side,"" said Sam Jeffers, one of the project's founders. ""We're not seeing a lot of stuff on the Leave side at the moment. ""Maybe that's confidence on their side, that things are going the way they want it to be, or maybe those campaigns haven't really got going yet."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? During the 2016 referendum, the official Vote Leave campaign spent more than £2.7m on Facebook ads, using data taken from social media and other sources to target specific groups with tailored - often wildly exaggerated - messages. Baldwin denied he was repeating the same practice: ""We're trying to reach people in a straightforward way using existing Facebook tools."""

Police said monkeys rained bricks on the man from a treetop after collecting them from a nearby dilapidated building, the Times of India reported. The elderly man later died in hospital from sustained head and chest injuries. Villagers have repeatedly complained about aggressive monkeys in the area, but the animals are a protected species. Mr Singh's family are said to have put in a formal complaint about the incident to police. The victim's brother reportedly told the newspaper: ""Monkeys threw more than 20 bricks at Dharampal on Thursday."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? He was hit on the head, chest and legs. Thrown from a height, the bricks were enough to kill him. The brother added: ""These rogue monkeys are the real culprits and must pay for it."" Chitwan Singh, the station officer at Doghat police station, said: ""How can we register the case against monkeys? This will make us a laughing stock."" Deadly monkey attacks have been on the rise in India, with wildlife experts saying that rhesus macaques are usually to blame. It is unclear which breed attacked Mr Singh. In March, it was reported that a monkey had entered a house in the village of Talabasta, Orissa, and kidnapped a baby. The baby was later found dead in a well. Back in 2007, the deputy mayor of India's capital of Delhi, SS Bajwa, died after being attacked by a horde of wild monkeys and falling from a first floor balcony."

2018-10-21,"Netflix has been accused of ""deceiving"" black subscribers with ""manipulative"" promotional posters for films and TV shows that can change based on who is using the service.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/netflix-deceiving-black-users-with-creepy-posters-11531429,"The streaming giant has previously boasted of the algorithms it uses to serve up personalised suggestions and visuals to its millions of users, but it has now been criticised by black customers who claim the technology is presenting them with misleading artwork imploring them to watch certain content. Among the films to have been highlighted are the comedy Like Father, which stars Kelsey Grammer and Kristen Bell, and the British favourite Love Actually. Rather than showcasing its two white leads, the poster for Like Father instead suggests to some subscribers that there are major roles for African-American actors Blaire Brooks and Leonard Ouzts. And the art for Love Actually - which features a predominantly white cast - seems to imply to certain users that it is a romance centred on characters played by Keira Knightley and Oscar-winning star Chiwetel Ejiofor. Brooks, Ouzts and Ejiofor each have relatively minor roles in the films. Joy Joses - founder and editor of MelanMag.com, a lifestyle magazine for women of colour - told Sky News that the algorithms being used were ""beyond deceptive"". She said: ""In their keenness to cater to black audiences, Netflix has overstepped the mark with this issue."" ""As with recent tone-deaf PR debacles, I won't be surprised if it stems from not having the right people around the table. ""Yes, when I'm scrolling through, looking for what to watch, I instinctively stop when I see black characters highlighted as the lead as that's what I want to watch. ""It's beyond deceptive to think that I am being manipulated based on my so-called algorithm choices. It really is an own goal though, as audiences have caught on. ""Why don't they give us more of what we want instead - black leads in big budget productions? In every other sphere, clear signage is the rule. Why should it be different with film and TV promotions?"" In a blog post last year, Netflix explained that its algorithms were purely based on viewing history, rather than any other information about each user. One example it presented was the 1997 drama Good Will Hunting, which would display fans of comedies with a poster featuring the late Robin Williams, and those who like romance films with a picture of Matt Damon and Minnie Driver. Responding to the accusations regarding the personalised artwork, Netflix said: ""We don't ask members for their race, gender or ethnicity so we cannot use this information to personalise their individual Netflix experience. ""The only information we use is a member's viewing history."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? But a number of Netflix subscribers share Ms Joses' concerns. Writing on Twitter, Stacia Brown said: ""It's weird to try to pass a film off as having a black principal cast (by creating a movie poster-like as featuring just the black people) when it's a white movie. A very white movie."" And Jeff Wetherell tweeted: ""It's not marketing. Marketing would be pushing you movie posters of actual movies with black leads. This is creepy. This is more insidious. ""It doesn't help their bottom line. You watch the first five minutes then realise it's not what it claims."" Despite competition from the likes of Amazon, Netflix remains by far the world's biggest online subscription video service and shares in the company recently leapt by 14% after it announced it had reached 137 million subscribers. It is also due to launch on Sky Q - Sky's premium TV box - in November."
2018-10-21,"A member of Theresa May's cabinet has told the prime minister's critics to ""play for the team"", amid speculation she has just 72 hours to save her job. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/pm-drinking-in-last-chance-saloon-mps-say-11531337,"The warning comes from MPs frustrated by Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations after an unsuccessful summit last week. But Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said ""now is the time to play for the team"", adding: ""We are at the end stage of the negotiation. ""It is understandable that there are jitters on all sides of this debate. ""We need to hold our nerve. The end is in sight in terms of a good deal, the prize we want."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? For a no confidence vote to be triggered, 48 letters from Conservative MPs must be submitted to the party's chairman and some have claimed that that threshold could soon be reached. Brexit supporter Andrew Bridgen told The Mail on Sunday that Mrs May must attend Wednesday's meeting of the Tory 1922 committee of backbenchers or risk making ""the letters go in even faster"". He said: ""This week Theresa May will find that she is drinking in the last chance saloon and the bad news for her is that the bar is already dry."" David Davis, a possible successor to Mrs May, wrote in The Mail on Sunday that the prime minister had ""managed to anger not just Leavers but ardent Remainers as well"". He said that the EU has plenty to lose if the UK crashes out of the bloc without a deal in March, adding: ""We should not allow ourselves to be bullied by the EU."" A number of anonymous MPs have been quoted as using stark language to describe the PM's predicament - with one saying she is in a killing zone and another saying Mrs May should ""bring her own noose"" to a meeting with backbenchers. Brexit minister Suella Braverman declined to condemn such comments, but stressed the Tories should try to stick together. She told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""Colleagues are free to express themselves in the way they wish, but I am very clear that our party is stronger when it's united."" But Robert Halfon, a former minister, told the same programme: ""I say to the people giving those quotes, this is not the way to change things."" He said the Tories had a ""serious image problem"" and warned voters only associate the party with austerity or Brexit. 700,000 people call for final say on Brexit deal However, Mr Halfon dismissed suggestions it was time for Mrs May to go. ""I don't think a change of leader would particularly help, particularly in the middle of Brexit,"" he said. Tory MP Johnny Mercer, who described the government as a ""s***show"" last week, said he had received ""overwhelming"" support from within the party after speaking out. He told The Sunday Times: ""I cannot continue to support an administration that cannot function."" Labour has also added to the pressure on Mrs May, proving that, even if she can manage to strike a deal with Europe, that does not guarantee it will please parliament. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the current situation was a ""mess of the prime minister's own making"". Writing in The Sunday Times, he said: ""To say that things have gone very wrong is an understatement. ""Things could - and should - have been different. ""But at no stage has the prime minister ever reached out to parliament or sought to build a national consensus on our future relationship with the EU. ""If she thinks Labour should prop her up because her own team won't back her, she can think again."" The words come as business warn they will set contingency plans in motion, moving work overseas and axing jobs in the UK, if there is no agreement between the UK and EU by Christmas."
2018-10-21,Saudi Arabia has insisted it does not know how journalist Jamal Khashoggi died and that it will bring those responsible to justice.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-vows-to-bring-journalists-killers-to-justice-11531766,"After initially denying any part in his disappearance, Saudi Arabia admitted on Friday that the outspoken critic of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had died in a fight in the country's consulate in Istanbul. :: Who was Jamal Khashoggi? In its latest comments on the killing, Saudi foreign minister Adel al Jubeir claimed the kingdom does not know how the journalist was killed or where his body is. He described Mr Khashoggi's death as an ""aberration, a mistake"" that the crown prince was not aware of. The comments came as the UK, France and Germany issued a joint statement condemning the killing of Mr Khashoggi ""in the strongest possible terms"", saying there ""remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened"". In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, the Saudi minister said: ""This is a terrible mistake. This is a terrible tragedy. Our condolences go out to them [Mr Khashoggi's family]. We feel their pain."" He said several senior figures had been dismissed after an investigation into the incident. ""The king directed the public prosecutor to launch an investigation, which he did about nine days ago. He discovered that there were discrepancies,"" said Mr al Jubeir. ""We discovered he was killed in the consulate. We don't know in detail how. We don't know where the body is. ""The prosecutor put out orders to detain 18 individuals for questioning and possibly facing trial and the king also dismissed a number of senior officials in this area. ""We're not an authoritarian government, we're a monarchy, we have our checks and balances, we have our systems. The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority."" He said a ""tremendous mistake"" was made and ""compounded"" by ""the attempt to try to cover up"", which he said was ""unacceptable"". He added: ""We want to make sure those who are responsible are punished and we want to make sure that we have procedures in place that prevent it from happening again."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? Turkish authorities have placed Mr Khashoggi's fiancee Hatice Cengiz - who is a Turkish national - under 24-hour police protection, the Istanbul governor's office confirmed to Sky News. Ms Cengiz waited for hours outside the Saudi consulate waiting for Mr Khashoggi and then got in touch with authorities when he failed to re-emerge as he had instructed her to do. After Saudi Arabia confirmed his death, she wrote on Twitter: ""They have taken your body from this world, but your beautiful smile will stay in my world forever."" The international community has expressed doubts about the Saudi version of events. This includes Donald Trump, who has accused Saudi Arabia of ""deception"" and ""lies"" over the killing. The president had previously said he found Riyadh's version of events to be credible. Turkish officials say they have audio evidence that Mr Khashoggi was tortured, killed and cut up on an office desk after a 15-man ""hit squad"" flew into the country. The hunt for Mr Khashoggi's body is continuing in Turkey, with a search of a vast forest near Istanbul. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has since said he will ""go into detail"" about the investigation as he addresses the issue in a speech to party members in parliament on Tuesday. In the statement issued by the European leaders on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, France's Jean-Yves Le Drian and Germany's Heiko Maas said: ""Nothing can justify this killing and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Addressing calls for more details about what happened to Mr Khashoggi, they said: ""There remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened on October 2 - beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts to be considered credible. ""We thus stress that more efforts are needed and expected towards establishing the truth in a comprehensive, transparent and credible manner. ""We will ultimately make our judgement based on the credibility of the further explanation we receive about what happened and our confidence that such a shameful event cannot and will not ever be repeated."" They added: ""The quality and significance of the relationship we have with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also rests with the respect we have for the norms and values to which the Saudi authorities and us are jointly committed under international law."" Britain's relationship with Saudi Arabia - a key regional ally and trading partner - has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance and the subsequent admission from Riyadh that the reporter is dead. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those who have said the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia cannot continue in the current climate. Opposition parties in the UK joined together to tell government it ""cannot be business as usual"" when it comes to ties with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the ""horrifying"" killing."

""People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!""

Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our Souther Border. People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable! The Caravans are a disgrace to the Democrat Party. Change the immigration laws NOW! Around 2,000 Central American migrants are attempting to enter the US, despite Mexican efforts to stop them at the border. The convoy of migrants gave up trying to enter Mexico legally because the asylum application process was too slow and circumvented police at a border bridge. They swam and rafted across the river from Guatemala before deciding to reform their mass caravan and continue their journey towards the US. Their numbers swelled to around 5,000 and on Sunday they began walking towards the Mexican town of Tapachula. An unidentified police officer said there were no orders to block the caravan. He said police ""were just making sure they pass safely and then we'll steer them"" to a migrants shelter outside the city centre of Tapachula, about 32km (20 miles) northwest of the border. It was not immediately clear where the additional travellers had materialised from since about 2,000 gathered on the Mexican side on Saturday night. They are thought to be people who had been waiting on the bridge over the Suchiate River or in the Guatemalan town of Tecun Uman and who decided to cross during the night. At dawn there were still an estimated 1,500 migrants on the Guatemalan side hoping to enter Mexico legally. They marched on through Mexico shouting slogans like ""Si se pudo"" or ""Yes, we could!"" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? As they passed through Mexican villages on the outskirts of the city of Ciudad Hidalgo, they drew applause, cheers and donations of food and clothing from Mexicans. Despite warnings to turn back this week from US President Donald Trump, one migrant, Erasmo Duarte, from Honduras, said before the journey: ""We are going to reach the United States."" Mr Trump threatened to deploy soldiers to the border with Mexico and close it off to stop the ""large caravans"" coming to America. He has sought to make the border security with Mexico a campaign issue around two weeks before midterm elections. His promise to build a wall along the border was also one of his key policies during his election campaign. On Friday he told reporters those travelling to the US en masse were not ""little angels"" but ""hardened criminals"". He said: ""I don't want them in our country. And neither does our country want them in our country."" As a military helicopter circled overhead, migrants who said they were fleeing a toxic mix of violence, poverty andcorruption in Central America wondered if police would seek to turn the caravan back. Authorities handed out numbers for people to be processed in a strategy seen before at US border posts when dealing with large numbers of migrants. But many became impatient before circumventing the border gate and swarming across the river on rafts or swimming in full view of hundreds of Mexican police manning the blockade on the bridge. They were not detained on reaching the Mexican bank. ""We couldn't wait because we had already waited too long and they only told us lies,"" said Mr Duarte, who joined the caravan with his wife and children six days ago."
2018-10-21,"Almost a decade ago, I went to McLaren's swanky headquarters in Surrey to interview Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, newly joined together as Formula One teammates.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181021220942/https://news.sky.com/story/lewis-hamilton-spoilt-brat-or-national-treasure-11531035,"I hadn't met Button before and had been warned he could be prickly. He was full of charm. Hamilton, who I had met, was not. Co-operative, but not warm. Is there a sense of that behind the British reluctance to take this extraordinarily successful driver to their hearts, even as he closes in on a fifth world title in the US Formula One Grand Prix? Mo Farah and Andy Murray have been knighted. When bookies shortened the odds about Hamilton also being invited to kneel before the Queen's sword, in the wake of his fourth world title a year ago, the negatives flowed. And cynics love to jibe that anyone could win races in the current all-conquering Mercedes. It's not about the driver, in other words, it's the car. Let's keep this within bounds. He is adored by millions who recognise Hamilton's achievement in emerging from a Stevenage council estate to become the best in a rich man's sport, closing in on Michael Schumacher's seemingly unmatchable seven world titles. At the British Grand Prix each year, crowds totalling more than 200,000 over three days worship their champion. It's mutual. He crowd-surfed after his 2016 victory there, and this year joined a marshals' picnic on the campsite. ""I love you guys,"" he told the fans. And yet his triumphs have not been as widely and warmly celebrated as those of, say, Sir Andy. And Hamilton has merely an OBE next to his name. Why? It's reasonable to suggest the following: accent, tax exile, lifestyle, skin colour. He shares the mid-Atlantic twang with Murray, the foreign residence with Olympic golf champion Justin Rose, the lifestyle with David Beckham and not being white with Farah and world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. Happy Sunday world from Roscoe & I. Sending you positivity for your day and the week coming. God bless you pic.twitter.com/bFJnCSY3OC But Hamilton has the full set. And beyond that, he's dull, right? Actually he's not. But having spent so many years (from childhood karting days) under McLaren's zealous PR protection, he came very late to the notion of projecting his own personality. Now, he is happy to do his thing his way, and hang the critics. So while other drivers spent time in heat chambers to prepare themselves for last month's Singapore Grand Prix, he flew 25,000 miles in 10 days, attending fashion shows in Shanghai and New York, with a friend's wedding thrown in. He won the race. Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates - have you? For many, it will only enhance his legend - ""what a guy"". Those who need their heroes to sweat their way through public agony on their way to glory will stick with Murray. It won't worry Hamilton. And the older he gets, one suspects, the more we will realise the magnitude of his achievements, and the more he'll relax. Before we know it, perhaps, like Beckham, and Murray before him, his public image will be transformed from spoilt brat to national treasure"

And when we tracked him down, just after lunch by the pool, he was far from relaxed in response to our questions. Sir Philip has reacted angrily to cameras before and he again lashed out, demanding we leave the premises, refusing to provide answers. It was almost a carbon copy of his reaction when Sky News caught up with him on holiday in Greece and questioned him over BHS in 2016. This time, after racing off in his golf buggy, narrowly missing me, he reversed, more calm and measured, and we spoke at length, off-camera at his request, about this week's developments. Sir Philip explained he is prevented from commenting for legal reasons. It might have served him better to say that on-camera and without the drama. It was all somewhat baffling to his fellow guests who jet in from around the world for a jolt of wellness in the stunning landscape and dry heat of Arizona. Sir Philip even suggested I take advantage of the facilities and ""go for a run"". I assume he meant for the good of my health. But the fallout from developments back home are certain to continue to dog one of Britain's most colourful tycoons, and the pressure for him to provide some answers is not going to go away.

""But what people say and how they behave are two very different things and you often have following some scandal involving a consumer company. ""People promising they'll boycott it and then nothing much happens."" Mr Wallop continued: ""The most famous example was following the Rana Plaza disaster when a factory in Bangladesh collapsed and caused the death of more than a thousand people. Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates – have you? ""It supplied lots of the high street chains in the UK - notably Primark - and lots of people at the time said they would never darken the doors of those shops. ""But what happened? The following three months sales and profits jumped at Primark. ""So I would be surprised if this has a huge impact on the takings at Topshop and other Arcadia brands."" Of course everything depends on how things play out in the battle with Lord Hain, who sensationally used parliamentary privilege to name Mr Green as the anonymous figure at the centre of newspaper sexual harassment allegations. The two men are now at loggerheads and neither is showing signs of backing down. The Lord's Authority will now investigate Mr Green's complaint. Luke Gittos, lawyer and legal editor at Spiked Online, said: ""Quite what the investigation will yield is hard to tell. It's very rare for these investigations to occur. ""It's very rare for parliamentary privilege to be breached in this way so we are in slightly unchartered territory. ""Parliamentary privilege is an extremely important principle. It protects members of parliament in that having robust and serious discussion without fear of recourse, so I think it would be regrettable if that principle was diluted. ""I think what should happen now is that Lords and members of parliament should realise it carries a degree of responsibility and that perhaps in this case it wasn't the correct approach to breach what was an interim order of the court of appeal."" Mr Gittos added: ""It's a very complex case and it's not as straightforward as to say MPs and lords can do and act as they please in the name of parliamentary privilege. ""The protections that are afforded to them are very important and have been long fought for and are at the root of our democracy, but they do need to be exercised with an understanding that they interact with other organs of state, including the courts."""
2018-10-28,"A few weeks ago, in the back room of one of those north London pubs where beardy twenty-somethings at some time staged a coup and henceforth refused entry to any locals, four actors took to the stage to tell the story of Lewis Hamilton to an audience they could count on one hand each.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181028221429/https://news.sky.com/story/lewis-hamilton-the-heston-blumenthal-of-british-sport-11538432,"A parody of the hit West End musical, Hamilton (Lewis) was surprisingly funny and sharp. Worthy of wider appreciation - like the man himself, you may or may not think, depending on how you take your sportsmen. An early twist: Hamilton was played by a woman. The sort of contrary note that Hamilton is famous for - flying thousands of miles to party between races, turning his back on the team that raised him, living outside of the UK. The sort of contrary note that has meant the public's affection for him has never really left the starting grid despite him dominating F1 for a decade. Hamilton is a bit like Heston Blumenthal. A lot of the stuff he produces is genius, never been done before, but like an edible graveyard, he sounds weird and doesn't always come across as very palatable. For every serving of snail porridge there's a sulky post-race interview; for every portion of parsnip cereal a soundbite with that jarring Atlantic twang. And like the Fat Duck kitchen, there's the temptation to think it's machines that are doing all the work. That was certainly true of Hamilton's last three titles, when his Mercedes could have won several races with a caravan towed on the DRS flap. But this year has been different. A figment of the British imagination is that our sportspeople are gracious and imperious in equal measure, deeply patriotic, triumphing against the odds. This is not Hamilton. But in 2018 we (or those of us with a Sky Sports subscription) have seen him win against the odds (a true British underdog!) when lining up against faster cars. Or at least one faster car - the red one with four-time champion Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel. This year could be a hairpin in the nation's affections for Hamilton, whose achievements mean he should be recognised as one of Britain's greatest ever sportsmen. It could be his triple cooked chips, the moment he finally won hearts and minds and tummies. But you get the feeling we're not quite there yet. Hamilton has previously declared that he won't be around long enough to better Michael Schumacher's stash of seven world titles - but he'll be favourite again next year and it would be hard to walk away from a sport when you're just one triumph away from being its most successful ever participant. Maybe that is what it will take for the wider appreciation to come his way."
2018-10-28,Sir Philip Green is to lodge a complaint against the Labour peer who outed him as the businessman at the centre of allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181028221429/https://news.sky.com/story/sir-philip-green-to-lodge-complaint-after-being-outed-by-lord-hain-11536938,"Lord Hain used parliamentary privilege protection to identify the Arcadia chairman as the individual who had obtained a legal injunction that prevented The Daily Telegraph from publishing ""confidential information"" from five employees. Sir Philip said Lord Hain had failed to disclose he had a financial relationship with the newspaper's lawyers, and plans to complain to Lords authorities. Lord Hain acts as a global and governmental adviser for the law firm Gordon Dadds but said he had been ""completely unaware"" it was acting for the Telegraph in the case. It comes after Sky News tracked down Sir Philip at a health resort in the US. In announcing his complaint, the Topshop billionaire said: ""When Lord Hain made allegations about me in the House of Lords ... he failed to disclose that he has a financial relationship with the law firm, Gordon Dadds, who represent the Telegraph. ""I have been advised that his actions are likely to have been a breach of the House of Lords Code of Conduct. ""As many people have said, Lord Hain's blatant disregard of a judgement made by three senior judges is outrageous. What is parliamentary privilege? Can the billionaire really lose his knighthood? ""If he hadn't read the judgement, on what basis was he apparently talking about it. If he had, Gordon Dadds' name is on the front page. ""I will be lodging formal complaints with the relevant authorities in the House of Lords."" Sir Philip repeated that ""to the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations"". When Sky News tracked him down in the Canyon Ranch health resort in Tucson, Arizona, he refused to comment. As Sky's Greg Milam tried to question him he responded: ""You need to leave. Can you go away? I believe you're being intrusive."" Sir Philip reacts angrily to cameras and demands that we leave the premises Lord Hain defended his actions, saying on Saturday: ""I stand resolutely by what I've said and neither retract nor apologise for standing up for human rights. ""I always comply fully with my House of Lords obligations as I did on that occasion."" He said Sir Philip's plan to lodge a formal complaint was a ""malevolent diversion"" Lord Hain had earlier said he felt he had a ""duty"" to name Sir Philip, after legal experts strongly criticised his decision to exercise his right to do so while the case was still going through the courts. Lord Hain insisted he took his decision acting in a ""personal capacity"". He added: ""I categorically state that I was completely unaware Gordon Dadds were advising the Telegraph regarding this case. ""Gordon Dadds, a highly respected and reputable international law firm, played absolutely no part whatsoever in either the sourcing of my information or my independent decision to name Sir Philip. Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates – have you? ""They were completely unaware of my intentions until after I spoke in the House of Lords"" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve QC criticised Lord Hain, saying his behaviour had been ""clearly arrogant"" and that he had abused parliamentary privilege in deciding he knew better than the courts. Some MPs have called on the Honours Forfeiture Committee to consider withdrawing Sir Philip's knighthood in light of the allegations. Downing Street stressed that the Honours Forfeiture Committee was independent. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""They are constantly reviewing evidence in relation to matters like this."""

""We train them to be a barista, we provide them with housing within 10 days, a bank account, therapy, support and then within six months after joining us, we support our staff into new jobs."" 100% of the profits goes back into training up people like Thomas Noble. Living on the streets, he'd thought his only way out might be killing himself. Learning to make coffee has proven to be his way back into society. He said: ""I had no money, I had no food, I had nothing. It's changed everything. ""There was a time when I'd first arrived that this wasn't me, I wouldn't talk to you, I would become an angry person. ""Now I'm nice, I love my job, I love my bosses, everything's great.

Charlie Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive of Social Enterprise UK, said the project was ""hugely significant"". He said: ""For a big organisation like Virgin Trains to see the opportunity in buying their coffee from a social enterprise makes a huge difference in terms of the impact that social enterprise can then have by supporting homeless people. ""Social enterprises are already a much bigger sector than people realise - there's about 100,000 social enterprises that contribute £60bn to the UK economy and they're only going to grow based on business.

He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday that revenues from car tax would be used to directly fund what the Treasury is describing as the ""biggest-ever single cash investment"" in motorways and major roads.   In addition to improving major infrastructure, a portion of the £30bn pledge will be targeted at local authorities to assist them in fixing potholes and other road damage. ""I am going to make some additional money available for local authorities to deal with urgent repairs, potholes in roads, repair work on bridges,"" Mr Hammond said. ""These are small projects in themselves but they make a huge difference to people and actually they make a huge difference to the efficiency of the road system overall so this is money well spent, well invested. ""But more widely we have to look at investment in our roads and I will be making an important announcement about the hypothecation of vehicle excise duty so that it's all spent on funding our strategic roads network for the future.

There are already demands for the chancellor to go further. Daniel Cochlin, head of external affairs for the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told Sky News: ""We need investment in HS2 and northern powerhouse rail, it's not a question of either or, it's a question of both. ""We want that commitment from government that the northern powerhouse is alive and kicking and is delivering results. ""And I think that really comes in transport, we've asked for a very ambitious £100bn to tackle transport and we want some recognition of that in the budget.""   Mr Hammond also announced that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal then a ""different approach"" to the economy would be required. ""We would need to look at a different strategy and frankly we'd need to have a new budget that set out a different strategy for the future,"" he told Sky News. Conservative MP Stephen Hammond, a Europhile member of the Treasury select committee, has said the uncertainty around a Brexit deal has limited the options available to the chancellor. He said: ""We all hope the PM can secure a Brexit deal that will allow the economy to prosperity of our country, but that hasn't yet been secured and so there must still be a large element of uncertainty ""So it'd be surprising if the chancellor decided after all these years to get out on a spending spree and a splurge. I think it'll be a measured fiscal loosening but in line with what's appropriate fiscally.""   The chancellor is under pressure to deliver increased public spending following the Prime Minister's pledge at Conservative Party Conference to end austerity. Stronger-than-expected tax receipts in the last year has given Mr Hammond some unexpected headroom, with slower- than-expected government borrowing allowing him an additional £13 billion. But in addition to setting out how he will fund the extra £20bn that has already been pledged to the NHS, the chancellor faces demands to increase the defence budget and threats of rebellion from some Conservative MPs if additional money is not pumped into Universal Credit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has challenged Theresa May on the issue repeatedly at Prime Minister's Questions in recent weeks. In one exchange the prime minister responded by saying: ""Austerity is being brought to an end. What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility."" :: Watch the budget live on Sky News at 3.30pm on Monday"
2018-10-28,"The Simpsons is going to drop Indian character Apu following a backlash against alleged racial stereotyping, a producer has claimed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181028221429/https://news.sky.com/story/the-simpsons-indian-character-apu-axed-after-racial-controversy-11537982,"Kwik-E-Mart owner Apu Nahasapeemapetilon will be quietly written out of the long-running TV cartoon series to ""avoid the controversy"", Adi Shankar said. The Indian-American producer said he was told by two people who work on the show and a third source who works with creator Matt Groening. Shankar said he was disappointed with the decision, having launched a contest in April for the public to help write a script which transformed Apu from a bad stereotype into ""a realistic portrayal of Indians in America"". ""I got some disheartening news back, that I've verified from multiple sources now: They're going to drop the Apu character altogether,"" he told IndieWire. ""They aren't going to make a big deal out of it, or anything like that, but they'll drop him altogether just to avoid the controversy."" He accused the show of ""cowardice"" and said it is ""a massive step sideways"". The producer's crowdsourced script came after Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu produced a documentary last year called The Problem with Apu. It focused on how the Simpsons might be stereotyping the South Asian community with the character, sparking heated debate about cultural sensitivity and racial stereotyping on TV and film. In the documentary he said Apu was one of the only representations of South East Asians on US television when he was younger, and that other children imitated the Kwik-E-Mart owner to make fun of him. In response to the character being dropped, Kondabolu tweeted: ""There are so many ways to make Apu work without getting rid of him. If true, this sucks."" Apu fans, many of them Indian, have blamed the comic for the character's apparent demise. Kondabolu's documentary said one of the main ""problems"" with Apu is that he is voiced by Hank Azaria, a white actor who has said his portrayal is an homage to British actor Peter Sellers playing an Indian in the 1968 comedy The Party. Azaria said earlier this year that he was ""perfectly willing to step aside"" so someone else could play the affable Apu. The reported decision to axe Apu came after The Simpsons tried to address the documentary's accusations in an April episode called No Good Read Goes Unpunished, poking fun at the controversy. In response to Shankar saying the character is to be dropped, a spokeswoman for The Simpsons said: ""Apu appeared in the 10/14/18 episode 'My Way or the Highway to Heaven'."" Apu only appears in a single wide shot that shows dozens of characters gathered around God in the episode.

2018-10-28,"Budgets are always difficult to navigate, but this one is particularly treacherous.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20181028221429/https://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-philip-hammond-facing-particularly-treacherous-budget-11538226,"The prime minister has announced the end of austerity - promising ""better days ahead"" - and Philip Hammond is the man who has to make the numbers add up. To complicate things further, the Brexit negotiations create almost unprecedented uncertainty. When I sat down with the chancellor to interview him for Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he could not have been clearer. ""The approach that I'm going to be setting out tomorrow is based on the assumption, as is the OBR's (Office for Budget Responsibility) report, of a deal being done with the EU and us continuing to be able to trade on reasonable terms with our closest neighbours in Europe,"" he said. In other words - if there is not a deal (or if there is a different deal), the picture will dramatically change. So much so, that another budget would be needed. Mr Hammond continued: ""If we don't get a deal, if we were to leave the EU without any deal - and I think that's an extremely unlikely situation, but of course we have to prepare and plan for all eventualities as any prudent government would - then we would need to take a different approach to the future of Britain's economy. ""We would need to look at a different strategy and frankly we'd need to have a new budget that set out a different strategy for the future."" What would that strategy be? We can only speculate. But one theory would be moving the UK towards a so-called Singapore economic model, by cutting taxes and regulation to attract business investment. Such a move would be likely to infuriate EU leaders and divide opinion in the UK. Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""When you asked him about Brexit, I was really shocked. ""He's gone back to what he said some time ago which is basically he seems to have accepted a no-deal Brexit and he does want us to be like Singapore, a sort of tax haven, which will undermine our manufacturing base and I think put people's living standards at risk."" Thousands have signed our petition for an Independent Leaders' Commission to organise election debates – have you? In contrast, the Brexit-supporting Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told me the chancellor should shake up the economic model regardless of the Brexit deal. ""There are lessons we can learn from other countries about the economic approach we could take,"" he said. ""Look what's happened in America with the significant tax cuts a year ago and an absolutely booming economy. If you cut taxation, you can have more money available for public services, a lower deficit and better economic growth. ""So I think that's an opportunity that should be taken regardless of Brexit."" This week's budget will be a crucial opportunity for the chancellor to pull the fiscal levers that he has available. But it may be that next year's spending review is even more important - when we finally know at least part of the answer to what our future relationship with the EU will look like. :: Watch the budget live on Sky News at 3.30pm on Monday"

The 11 victims have been identified and named by the city's chief medical officer, and their families have been informed. The victims have been named as: Joyce Fienberg, 75; Richard Gottfried, 65; Rose Mallinger, 97; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Cecil Rosenthal, 59; David Rosenthal, 54; Bernice Simon, 84; Sylvan Simon, 86; Daniel Stein, 71; Melvin Wax, 88; Irving Younger, 69. Cecil and David Rosenthal were brothers and Bernice and Sylvan were married. Mr Wax was described as a ""pillar of the congregation"" by fellow members, while his friend Myron Snider called him ""unfailingly generous"". Four police officers were treated for injuries after going into the synagogue to confront the gunman. One has been discharged, one is due to be, and the other two ""need more doing to them"", Pennsylvania police confirmed. Robert Bowers, the suspect, is being treated in hospital for gunshot wounds. He has been charged with 29 counts, including 11 of murdering people exercising their religious beliefs, which carry the death penalty if he is found guilty. What we know about alleged Pittsburgh gunman Robert Bowers According to officials, Bowers expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage, and told officers after he was caught that they were committing genocide and he wanted them all to die. Bowers was charged with 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. He is said to have been carrying an AR-15 rifle and three Glock 357 handguns when he stormed into the place of worship and opened fire during a baby naming ceremony. Calls began coming into police at 10am on Saturday, when people inside the synagogue reported ""they were being attacked"". Bowers, 46, shot one of the first two officers to respond in the hand, and the other was wounded by ""shrapnel and broken glass"". The affidavit said a tactical team found Bowers on the third floor of the synagogue, where he shot two other officers. One of those is critically wounded, but the condition of the fourth is not known. Mayor Bill Peduto called the attack ""the darkest day in Pittsburgh's history"". He added: ""I think the approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns, which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America, out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder."" Bowers will make his first appearance before a magistrate on Monday. Scott Brady, from the FBI, said they would do everything to ensure Bowers was held accountable for his actions. FBI teams from three branches are in Pittsburgh and officials believe it could take a week to gather evidence from the scene. Robert Jones, special agent for FBI Pittsburgh division, said there could have been further violence if Bowers had made it out of the synagogue. Donald Trump said the outcome of the attack may have been different if the synagogue ""had some kind of protection"". He ordered flags at federal buildings to be flown at half-mast for the victims. The state's Democrat governor, Tom Wolf, who is up for re-election, said ""dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way"". Pope Francis led prayers for the city on Sunday, calling the attack an ""inhuman act of violence"" and praying for God to ""help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies""."

Thai billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was owner and chairman of Leicester when, against odds of 5,000-1, they clinched the 2015-16 Premier League title. The warmth of the fans had already been won by then, however: free beers and hot dogs all round on his birthdays will do that. Not for him the cynicism or disdain directed towards many a foreign owner of a British football club. Sky sources have said Srivaddhanaprabha was on-board when the helicopter crashed at around 8.30pm on Saturday, but it was not yet clear if anybody survived. Reuters news agency also said four other people were on-board, including Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's daughter, two pilots and a fifth person who has not been identified. Srivaddhanaprabha's journey to super riches began humbly: he opened a duty-free shop back in Bangkok in 1989. Today he is worth £3.8bn, according to Forbes, making him the fifth richest person in Thailand. He bought Leicester for a reported £39m in 2010 and named his son Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha as his vice-chairman. The family pumped many millions into improving the squad and the stadium. Leicester is now worth £371m, according to Forbes. Keen football fan Srivaddhanaprabha also owns Belgian club OH Leuven. He is married to Aimon Srivaddhanaprabha. The couple have four children together - Voramas, Apichet, Aroonroong and Aiyawatt. In 2012 the family was bestowed the new surname of Srivaddhanaprabha by the King of Thailand.

Starting third, he immediately jumped past Daniel Ricciardo at the start but tyre issues saw both Mercedes cars struggle and Hamilton dropped back to finish fourth - enough to earn 12 points. A lot of what he produces has never been done before but it doesn't always come across as very palatable The title puts him level with Argentinian legend Juan Manuel Fangio, who won five world championships in the 1950s, and behind only Michael Schumacher - the German having won seven. The first to congratulate Hamilton was actor Will Smith, who said over the team radio: ""That's how I taught you, that's how you do it, that's how you drive."" The Briton then set about performing the now-customary doughnuts on the track. Vettel told the crowd afterwards that Hamilton's title was ""well deserved"" - then the pair shared a hug as Hamilton waved to spectators. Hamilton said afterwards: ""I feel very humbled by this whole experience. It's something I dreamed of but I never thought I'd be standing here as a five-time world champion. ""I'm so grateful to everyone who has helped me be here. ""It's definitely been my best year, I feel.""

Eleven people died after he opened fire with what appeared to be an assault rifle and three handguns and is believed to have acted alone, according to authorities. Just hours before the attack, a social media post on a site called Gab, apparently by Bowers said a Jewish refugee organisation called the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) ""likes to bring invaders in that kill our people"". ""I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in."" According to the AP news agency, the cover photo for the account featured a neo-Nazi symbol.   Recent posts on the account reportedly included a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps to cremate Jewish people during World War Two. Other posts are believed to have referenced false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust, in which an estimated six million Jews were killed, was a hoax. In another post, President Donald Trump was criticised for allowing Jewish people to enter the US. Gab, which has condemned the synagogue attack, is a Philadelphia-based social networking service created as an alternative to Twitter. In a statement, Gab.com confirmed the profile belonged to Bowers and also said it had suspended the account and contacted the FBI about it. Gab is popular with far-right extremists. HIAS is a non-profit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. The organisation said it is guided by Jewish values and history. President and chief executive Mark Hetfield said he was not aware of the alleged gunman's ""obsession with HIAS until this morning"". A neighbour of the suspect described him as an ""average 50-year-old dude"". Chris Hall said of Bowers: ""The most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed. ""He kept to himself. He would a smoke a cigarette in his car; go for a drive and then be back at odd hours, TV would be on, but I couldn't really hear."" Mr Hall said he had never received any antisemitic flyers from Bowers, or spotted any strange tattoos on him, and never saw anyone who may have been Bowers' partner. He was not known to law enforcement officials before Saturday's attack, said the FBI. The bureau said Bowers, who is believed to have shouted antisemitic slurs during the attack, murdered worshippers and was then leaving the building when he came into contact with a uniformed police officer. The pair exchanged gunfire and Bowers then went back inside before a SWAT team arrived, according to the FBI. After a shootout, he surrendered.
