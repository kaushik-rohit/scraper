2016-04-01,"We are doing ""everything we can"", the Prime Minister repeated time and again in my short interview with him.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160401223015/http://news.sky.com/story/1670319/plenty-of-steel-but-little-reassurance-from-pm,"We are doing ""everything we can"", the Prime Minister repeated time and again in my short interview with him. That was the message he and the Government needed to convey on Thursday morning after several days on the back foot. When Tata's decision was made on Tuesday, the Prime Minister was still on holiday, the Business Secretary was in Australia and there wasn't even a minister in India to lobby on behalf of workers. And considering a decision had been expected for months, why was no contingency plan ready to roll out? The Government do argue that steps have been taken to help the industry in recent months - help with energy prices and steps to improve procurement issues. But clearly that has not been enough - Tata has put Port Talbot up for sale and there are fears it could be closed before a buyer is found. So what more can the Government do? Well, not nationalisation; David Cameron, while not ruling anything out, did not think that was a viable option. Obviously, finding a buyer is preferable and the Government is likely to offer incentives, probably even loans, to make this happen. However, it is unclear if any buyer would take over the business in its entirety, securing all those jobs, considering Port Talbot alone is losing £1m a day. Ultimately Port Talbot could be a much diminished steelmaking plant. In trying to help, the Government will also have to be careful not to fall foul of EU laws which block support for ""manufacturers in difficulties"" though they do allow for nurturing the ""long-term competitiveness and efficiency"" of industry. Steel is viewed as strategically important by Government, important not just for manufacturing and infrastructure, but for defence as well. They will not want to see a complete collapse. But the Prime Minister was also clear in saying that these are difficult times for the steel industry with no guarantees of success - just more uncertainty for Britain's beleaguered steel communities."
2016-04-01,North Korea has said it will continue its nuclear and ballistic missile programme in defiance of the United States and its allies.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160401223015/http://news.sky.com/story/1670579/north-korea-peninsula-in-a-state-of-semi-war,"By Sky News US Team North Korea has said it will continue its nuclear and ballistic missile programme in defiance of the United States and its allies. The country's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, So Se Pyong, said a state of ""semi-war"" now existed in the divided peninsula. He said military exercises involving South Korea and the US were aimed at ""decapitation of the supreme leadership of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)"". South Korean K-9 self-propelled howitzers during a military exercise ""If the United States continues, then we have to make the counter-measures also. So we have to develop, and we have to make more deterrence, nuclear deterrence,"" he said. The diplomat added: ""The de-nuclearisation of the peninsula has gone."" His comments came after North Korea fired a missile into the sea just hours after South Korea, Japan and the US warned Pyongyang to end its provocations. The surface-to-air missile was fired from a region close to the North's eastern coast, according to a South Korean military official. Yonhap news agency reported it flew a distance of around 100km (62 miles). :: Obama Seals Nuke Pact To Thwart IS 'Madmen' Tensions have heightened on the Pyongyang-Seoul border since the North's nuclear test in January and long-range rocket launch in February. Friday's drill is the fourth missile launch by Kim Jong-Un's regime in recent weeks - and the second in four days - amid military exercises involving South Korea and the US, the largest ever carried out by the two nations. It comes as President Barack Obama, his South Korean counterpart Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to pressure the secretive state over its nuclear programme. The three leaders met on the sidelines of a global nuclear summit in Washington aimed at reducing the risk caused by the proliferation of nuclear technology. Mr Obama said: ""We are united in our efforts to deter and defend against North Korean provocations. We have to work together to meet this challenge."" Mr Obama also held separate talks with President Xi Jinping of China, the closest North Korea has to an ally, Both said they wanted to see ""full implementation"" of the latest United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang. Existing UN sanctions ban North Korea from conducting any ballistic missile test."

Jurors at the Old Bailey in central London convicted the youth of manslaughter, but cleared him of murder. Stefan Appleton, from Islington in north London, died in hospital after the attack in Caldy Walk in June last year. He had been in nearby Nightingale Park with friends when two people pulled up on a moped. One leapt off the vehicle, pulled out a large knife and ran after the teenager and his friends, the court heard. Stefan was repeatedly stabbed by the attacker after he tripped and fell on the ground. The weapon was not found, but police discovered other Zombie Killer knives As the killer fled the scene he allegedly shouted ""RP"", standing for Red Pitch, a rival to another gang in the area. Stefan's attacker claimed the weapon - a 25in (63cm) serrated blade - had been stashed in bushes around the park. The weapon was never found but police seized three more Zombie Killer knives and an assortment of other blades, including a machete, during their search of the area. The attacker tried to flee the country to Spain, but was arrested within days. He claimed he had been attacked as he tried to retrieve his bike which had been stolen by another youth.. His alleged getaway scooter driver was cleared of murder. A third 17-year-old was found not guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. There were gasps from Stefan's family as the verdicts were read out before they left the courtroom in tears. Prosecutor Simon Denison QC described Stefan's death as a ""tragic waste of a young life"". He told jurors while Zombie Killer knives - which are available on the internet for as little as £10 - sounded like a toy, they were anything but. The case was adjourned until 21 April when the youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will be sentenced."
2016-04-01,"A private Muslim school in Yorkshire is promoting an extreme form of Islam, claiming that Jews are engaged in a global conspiracy to take over the world and that adopting British customs is forbidden.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160401223015/http://news.sky.com/story/1670528/exposed-uk-school-promoting-extreme-islam,"By Gerard Tubb, North of England Correspondent A private Muslim school in Yorkshire is promoting an extreme form of Islam, claiming that Jews are engaged in a global conspiracy to take over the world and that adopting British customs is forbidden. The Islamic Tarbiyah Academy in Dewsbury teaches 140 primary school children in an after-school madrasa and runs full-time classes for over-16s and adults. Mufti Zubair Dudha, the centre's founder and head, is a respected cleric from the orthodox Deobandi sect which is thought to control half of all mosques and madrasas in the UK. In one leaflet Mr Dudha quotes the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an early 20th Century anti-Semitic forgery, which claims to prove Jewish people are engaged in a global conspiracy. He claims that colourful pictures, films, magazines and sporting celebrities are part of the conspiracy to ""poison the thinking and minds"" of young Muslim people. ""The various forms of distractions have been successful to considerable extent in achieving their objectives,"" he wrote. The school's head says extracts from the leaflets have been misrepresented Other leaflets and newsletters, some of which are distributed to Deobandi mosques, say all mixed-sex institutions are evil, warn Muslims not to adopt British customs, ban the watching of TV, and tell women not to go out to work and to be fully covered before leaving the house. In a section on jihad he tells Muslims they should be prepared to ""expend ... even life"" to create a world organised ""according to Allah's just order"". Gallery: Gallery: Radical Leaflets At Dewsbury School Deobandis believe in a highly orthodox spiritual version of Islam and Mr Dudha also produces leaflets condemning terrorism and advocating non-violence. Dewsbury has a history of disaffected youth becoming radicalised and was home to Britain's youngest suicide bomber, its youngest convicted terrorist, and one of the 7/7 bombers. Keith Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, told Sky News he believes the centre's teachings are dangerous. ""After what we have seen in Paris and in Brussels and the way in which the Muslim community has come out so strongly in favour of peace and tolerance, I think these kinds of leaflets serve no purpose but to divide in a poisonous and totally reckless way,"" he said. MPs are currently investigating radicalisation and the Government said last year that it intends to regulate madrasas. The Department for Education told us: ""These serious allegations are under investigation. While it would be inappropriate to comment on the specific investigations of these institutions, we are clear that extremism has no place in our society and we are determined to protect children from it."" But in a statement, Mr Dudha told Sky News: ""It saddens me greatly that certain extracts from our publications have been taken and misrepresented to link the Academy with extremism. ""We fully believe in the importance and need of integration whilst being able to practise our faith."""

Pittsburgh-based WTAE anchor Wendy Bell apologised last week for her comments about a 9 March shooting that left six people dead in the poverty-blighted suburb of Wilkinsburg. The station's parent company, Hearst Television, said in a statement: ""WTAE has ended its relationship with anchor Wendy Bell. ""Wendy's recent comments on a WTAE Facebook page were inconsistent with the company's ethics and journalistic standards."" The award-winning reporter, who is white, wrote: ""You needn't be a criminal profiler to draw a mental sketch of the killers who broke so many hearts two weeks ago Wednesday... ""They are young black men, likely teens or in their early 20s. They have multiple siblings from multiple fathers and their mothers work multiple jobs. ""These boys have been in the system before. They've grown up there. They know the police. They've been arrested."" WTAE president and general manager Charles Wolfertz III took Ms Bell off air last week for her ""egregious lack of judgment"" in the comments on her now-deleted Facebook page. On Wednesday, she defended herself, saying her story was about ""African-Americans being killed by other African-Americans"". Ms Bell was an 18-year veteran of WTAE and has won 21 Emmy Awards, according to her station biography. Among those who died in the 9 March shooting were Chanetta Powell, 25, and her unborn child. The other four victims were aged from 26 to 37. Authorities have not made any arrests over the killings, and have not issued any descriptions of possible suspects."

Bailey, also aged 16, died from a knife wound to the chest in a fight at Cults Academy in Aberdeen last October. The teenager was sentenced to nine years' detention at the High Court in Edinburgh after being convicted last month of culpable homicide. The jury at Aberdeen's High Court had ruled against a murder charge following a five-day trial. Flowers were left at the school following the stabbing The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had admitted fatally stabbing Bailey but denied murder. During evidence, the court heard that both boys had been involved in a school corridor row about sharing biscuits. Witnesses did not agree on how the fight unfolded, but the jury was told Bailey had squared up to the teenager after he made a comment about his mother. They both were said to have thrown punches and two onlookers said the killer pulled out a knife after Bailey got him in a headlock. When he was stabbed the blade went directly into the heart, according to a post-mortem examination. Bailey Gwynne died in a fight at Cults Academy in Aberdeen Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC told the trial it was a ""silly, trivial fight"" between the pair. Sentencing, Judge Lady Stacey said to the youngster: ""If you had not carried a knife, the exchange of insults between you and Bailey Gwynne would have led at worst to a fist fight ... and certainly not loss of life."" She also told him: ""Nothing that I can say nor any sentence that I impose will do anything to lessen the grief that Bailey Gwynne's family and friends feel. ""The shock of the death at such a young age was felt in the wider community; nothing I can say or do can alleviate that."" The judge's sentence means the killer will serve nine years in custody - eight for culpable homicide and one for carrying weapons. He will then be supervised for another two years on release. Before sentencing, his lawyer Ian Duguid QC told the court: ""He is profoundly sorry."" He also claimed the youngster was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Last month, Bailey's mother Kate Gwynne paid tribute to her ""sweet boy with a big dream"". She said: ""We will always be immensely proud that Bailey is our son. ""It has always been a true blessing and a privilege to have Bailey and to share the honour of knowing, raising and loving him. That is not something that time or our parting will ever change."""

The lender said its bottom line was weighed down by ""issues of the past"" as it took an extra charge of £72m for the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal as well as extra costs of about £99m relating to breaches of consumer credit rules. It said the result was as expected and that its ""core"" business narrowed losses and that the bank had stemmed an exodus of current account customers seen the year before. The annual loss compared to a £264.2m shortfall in 2014. But chief executive Niall Booker saw his annual pay package surge by 25% to £3.85m, boosted by long-term incentive awards. Part of the lender's business plan has, as earlier revealed by Sky News, been re-submitted to the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) - and approved - after it scaled back its withdrawal from some ""non-core"" loans.

Andrew Moran, 34, was handed an indeterminate sentence and imprisoned for public protection by the same judge he fled from in 2009. He spent four years on the run in Europe, taking pictures of himself posing with luxury cars, motorbikes and machine guns. Andrew Moran posing with firearms Moran - who has a number of convictions - was eventually arrested at his villa in Alicante, Spain, in May 2013, as he relaxed with friends by his pool. He appeared via videolink from HMP Belmarsh prison for sentencing at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday. Judge Norman Wright told him ""you may never be released"". He added: ""You are a ruthless, determined, devious and cunning criminal. You have involved yourself in a premier league criminal lifestyle in all its aspects."" Moran, from Salford, Manchester, cannot apply for parole until he has served eight years and 236 days, and then must prove he is no longer a threat to the public. He was on trial for a £25,000 raid on a Royal Mail van when he escaped from Burnley Crown Court in March 2009, before fleeing the UK on a false passport. Judge Wright had begun his summing up and told Moran he was being remanded in custody. Moran then replied ""I can't be remanded I've got a funeral to go to"", before struggling with dock officers, injuring a female officer, and then running past more security staff. He was later convicted in his absence of conspiracy to commit robbery outside an Asda supermarket in Colne, Lancashire. During the raid, he held a gun to a security guard's neck and shouted ""kill him"" to his accomplice as he was beaten. Moran, who was said to have had a ""fascination with firearms"", even changed his appearance with plastic surgery to avoid capture while on the run. He was eventually traced after a joint operation by Titan (the North West Crime Regional Unit), the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Spanish police. But in November 2012, he escaped from Spanish national police after a high-speed chase, with Moran driving at up to 130mph and ramming two police cars out of the way. When he was eventually arrested, police recovered pictures from his mobile phone showing him in a helicopter and holding sub-machine guns. He used false passports and identity documents on ""a persistent basis"" and had no fewer than five false names."
2016-04-01,"Sajid Javid, once seen as a Tory rising star and potential future party leader, has had plenty of time to reflect that being in the wrong place at the wrong time can be the kiss of death for a political career.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160401223015/http://news.sky.com/story/1670549/business-secretary-flies-back-into-steel-storm,"Sajid Javid, once seen as a Tory rising star and potential future party leader, has had plenty of time to reflect that being in the wrong place at the wrong time can be the kiss of death for a political career. After all, it is estimated that after spending just 34 hours in Sydney while the British steel industry went into meltdown he has now spent 45 hours on aeroplanes flying to and from Australia. Whatever possessed the Business Secretary to go to Australia - on what looks like at best a gentle fact finding mission and at worst a junket - instead of Mumbai to lobby Tata steel bosses, he is paying a heavy political price now. His globe-trotting would not be quite such a serious blunder if he had not taken his eldest daughter Sophia, 16, with him and planned to extend his visit by several days so he could go on a holiday with her. No wonder Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil and now making a name for himself as the new MP for Aberavon and a doughty fighter for the threatened Port Talbot steelworks, is livid with Javid. ""We've known for several weeks that 29 March was D-day for British steel which is why I, Roy Rickhuss (boss of the steel union Community) and others went to Mumbai,” Kinnock junior told Sky News. ""We feel that a minister should have been with us. Instead Sajid Javid jetted off to Australia and now it seems he did so not entirely for work-related reasons. ""It just characterises the incompetence and indifference the government has shown towards the British steel industry since 2010, it reflects a broader pattern."" That has clearly touched a raw nerve with the millionaire ex-banker.  A senior source close to the Business Secretary told Sky News: “This is absolutely ridiculous! “You’d be hard pressed to find anyone who has done more to help the UK steel industry than Sajid Javid. “The fact he has just spent almost 24 hours in the air, flying half-way across the globe, proves how seriously he takes what is going on at Port Talbot. It is frankly insulting to suggest that his focus is anywhere other than securing a viable long-term future. “Mr Javid has been completely transparent regarding his daughter accompanying him on this trip and has covered her costs entirely. There is no suggestion whatsoever that there was any cost to the taxpayer and all proper processes have been followed.” The 'Sophiagate' fiasco could not have come at a worse time for the soon-to-be jet-lagged Business Secretary and his Tory leadership ambitions, however. A survey on who should be the next Conservative Party leader carried out for The Independent puts him on just five per cent with the public and two per cent with Tory members. But Mr Javid is not alone in feeling the heat in the row over the future of the steel industry. Few senior Tories emerge with credit from the events of the past few days. George Osborne broke his silence on the steel crisis during talks with G20 finance ministers in Paris and made the questionable claim that the Government had intervened in the battle to save Port Talbot. “Faced with a situation where the steel price collapsed and the real possibility that Port Talbot could have closed overnight, we intervened to buy breathing space and will do whatever we can to find new buyers so Port Talbot and the steel industry has a long term future,” said the Chancellor. Intervened? What he meant, I’m told, was that the Government has been working with Tata to seek to avoid an outright closure and ensure a breathing space to try to find a buyer, no more than that. Not quite intervening in the Michael Heseltine sense, then. When he was appointed President of the Board of Trade by John Major, “Hezza” told the 1992 Tory conference he would intervene “before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner” and then on the next morning he would start again! I wonder what the 83-year-old Lord Heseltine makes of the present Tory government’s handling of this steel crisis. Another Tory veteran, Ken Clarke, who launched the privatisation of British Steel in a Commons statement in December 1987 when he was a DTI minister, has not been terribly helpful to David Cameron and George Osborne during the current row. “I know South Wales well,” the veteran bruiser said in an interview. “I’ve driven past Port Talbot many times.” At least he didn’t say, as Sajid Javid might, that he had flown over it in an aeroplane."

Thousands of miles from its native North America, a raccoon has been photographed in the Scottish wild by a camera trap set up to record images of the elusive Scottish wildcat. The footage revealed the furry mammal foraging in woodland near Garve in the Highlands. Members of the public have been warned not to approach it, as the animal has a ""nasty bite"". Conservation body, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), said it plans to trap and rehouse the raccoon. SNH wildlife and non-native species manager Stan Whitaker said: ""Raccoons could cause millions of pounds worth of damage per year to the Scottish economy if they became established here. ""They could also cause significant damage to our native wildlife by preying on birds, small animals and amphibians. ""Raccoons aren't dangerous but they may give you a nasty bite if cornered. ""The raccoon that has been recorded is an adult and roughly the size of a domestic cat."" SNH said raccoons have been identified in Scotland as one of the top 50 invasive, non-native species most likely to be introduced and cause negative impacts. They are currently kept as pets and zoo animals, and there have been several escapes in the last few years. Anyone who spots the raccoon is asked to report it immediately to the Scottish Environment and Rural Services (SEARS). The group can be contacted at info@sears.scotland.gsi.uk or on 08452 30 20 50."
2016-04-01,Hundreds more armed police are to be recruited by forces outside London in the next two years as the Government steps up moves to prevent Paris-style terror attacks in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160401223015/http://news.sky.com/story/1670667/uk-terror-threat-more-armed-police-for-regions,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Hundreds more armed police are to be recruited by forces outside London in the next two years as the Government steps up moves to prevent Paris-style terror attacks in the UK. Speaking at a security conference in Washington, David Cameron pledged a further 400 armed police in addition to 600 more in London announced in January. To boost counter-terrorism in the regions, there will also be more round-the-clock specialist teams - mainly in big cities such as Manchester and Birmingham - and 40 more armed-response vehicles. The extra armed officers, which will take the number in England and Wales to nearly 7,000, follows a review ordered by the Prime Minister after the Paris attacks. The Government says every region will benefit. The additional armed-response vehicles and teams will be operational within a year, taking the total to 150 and doubling the number in London. They will carry specialist equipment and enable firearms officers to be transported swiftly. The Prime Minister said: ""Our police and intelligence agencies work round the clock to keep us safe and it is absolutely vital that we support them with the right resources and kit. ""After the terrorist attacks in France last year, we decided to look at whether there was more we could do to protect people from the type of terrorist threat we now face. ""That’s why we are increasing the number of specially trained armed officers up and down the country to make sure the police have greater capability to respond swiftly and effectively should they need to do so."" Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for Armed Policing, added: ""Over recent years we have significantly enhanced the training, tactics and weaponry of armed officers to ensure they are capable of dealing with all types of terrorist attacks.  ""This additional uplift will ensure we are in an even stronger position to respond quickly and effectively to protect the public."" The plan for more armed police comes on top of military contingency planning announced by the Prime Minister following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January last year. This will allow 10,000 troops to be involved in a security response in the event of a terror attack, as well as enabling the military to fill in for armed police, releasing them to respond to incidents. The new measures will be funded from £143m announced at the Strategic Security and Defence Review to increase Armed Response capability and capacity."

England Boxing's junior championships were due to be held in Portsmouth this weekend but have now been called off. The national governing body for boxing said the cancellation was ""tragic"". The organisers said: ""What do we know about what lies behind the police actions? ""The truthful answer is very little because the police have told us virtually nothing beyond the fact that the threat is serious and includes a threat to life. ""The fact that young boxers have not been able to box is a tragedy. ""The fact that there has been a financial loss to clubs and to families is a tragedy. ""The fact that anyone might want to endanger life at a boxing event is beyond our understanding and if it's true, it is disgraceful."" They added: ""The police were clear that if the remaining events for the Junior Championship were not cancelled by England Boxing, they themselves would seek a court order to close the events. ""They were clear that not to cancel the events would jeopardise the safety of everyone involved - potentially to a life threatening degree. ""With little more information, sadly we have very little choice in complying and ensuring the safety of the boxers and their coaches, families and supporters. ""England Boxing has done - and is continuing to do - everything in its power to find a solution that would enable the event to take place at a later date, however intelligence has confirmed that a considerable threat to this event remains at the present time. ""Ultimately, the safety of our members is our absolute priority."" Hampshire Police's superintendent Will Schofield said: ""Hampshire Constabulary officers met with representatives from England Boxing and the Mountbatten Centre management team to discuss plans for a sporting event to be held in Portsmouth. ""At this meeting intelligence relating to ongoing investigations that may have an impact on this event was presented to the organisers. Following discussions it was agreed by all parties that the event should be cancelled. ""We hope to work with the organisers in future to run events in the county following a very positive discussion."""

The organisation sent mystery shoppers seeking deals for any kind of smartphone which met ""average"" needs: around 250 minutes of calls, 250 texts and 200MB of data per month. The monthly tariff recommended to shoppers was between £7 and more than £50, with an average of £23.16. These figures mean that a customer could be paying up to £318.48 more than they need to over the course of a two-year contract. Citizens Advice also said many of the deals recommended were unsuitable for customers - with 40% of its mystery shoppers being given tariffs including 1,000 or more minutes of calls - four times what they said they needed. Around 350 mystery shops were carried out at Vodafone, EE, O2, Three and independent retailers - some in store, some over the phone and some via web chat. The average cost of a deal was also £1 cheaper in store than over web chat. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""While we didn't find evidence of mis-selling, sales pitches were focused overwhelmingly on phone brands which meant not enough attention was paid to tariffs - which are very important. ""The focus on handset brands mean people are essentially taking out loans on expensive phones - but without being able to work out the details of the loan or whether it's value for money. ""Mobile phones have become an essential product for the majority of people and with many contracts now lasting for years it's crucial more is done to help consumers get the best deal for them."""

Tributes were paid to the diminutive star who died on Thursday, having been one of the country's most popular entertainers. It is understood comedian David Walliams launched a campaign to include the 85-year-old on the Queen's 90th Birthday Honours list as concerns about his health grew. A panel which bestows the titles had received a number of letters from famous names in support of his nomination. Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes, who sits on the arts and media honours committee, told The Daily Telegraph he thought ""he [Corbett] should have been awarded a knighthood"" - although he refused to discuss the workings of the panel. Gallery: Iconic Entertainer Ronnie Corbett Dies Aged 85 Ronnie Corbett and Ronnie Barker during filming of The Two Ronnies Writing in the Daily Mail, a friend of the entertainer, Michael Thornton, said he contacted the Cabinet Office to propose a knighthood ""several months ago"". He said there was a ""virtual stampede on the part of celebrated figures"" when it came to gathering letters in support of the nomination. At the time Corbett was ""fighting to survive"" after being diagnosed with suspected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neurone disease, Mr Thornton said. The entertainer's first honour came in 1978, when he was awarded the OBE alongside comedy partner Ronnie Barker. The pair were household favourites at the time for their sketch show, The Two Ronnies. In 2011 Corbett said he did not imagine he would receive a knighthood, adding that Barker, who died in 2005, should have been made Sir Ronnie. Corbett was made CBE in 2012 but the knighthood that some people believed he deserved eluded him. Speaking in 2015, Sir Bruce Forsyth questioned why figures from the world of comedy ""seem to be left out"". The former Strictly Come Dancing host told Sky News on Thursday: ""A great big hole has been left in show business."""

Forecasters have said warm air and sunshine will sweep north from the continent, in marked contrast to the wild weather brought in by Storm Katie over the recent Easter weekend. London is expected to see the highest temperatures on Sunday, peaking at 18C (64F), while it will be only slightly cooler across central and southern England, with highs reaching up to 17C (62F). That will make those parts of Britain as hot as Barcelona, and hotter than the Spanish capital, Madrid, which is expected to see temperatures of 15C (59F). The UK will be able to feel the warmer weather from Saturday, when it will be around 5C higher than the average for April of 11C (52F). Sky News weather presenter Jo Wheeler said: ""It will become milder at the weekend as weather systems set up a southerly flow, which will feed in warmer air from the continent. ""We’re looking at a high of around 18C (64F) on Sunday, which will feel wonderfully summery. ""But don't be caught out. Temperatures will return to April averages later in the week, and there’ll still be the risk of night-time frosts.  Gardeners be warned."""

Enthusiasts had queued overnight outside Tesla stores in California to put down deposits on the car, which will sell for $35,000 (£24,000), half the price of its current models, the Model S and the Model X, which start at $70,000 (£49,000). Chief executive Elon Musk said it was the final step In the company’s plan to develop a ""mass market, affordable car"". It is expected to have a range of more than 200 miles on an electric charge - around double what drivers currently get from competitors it is price range. Features will include automatic lane-changing. Tesla is aiming to lift its car production to 500,000 by 2020, up from 50,000 last year. It also plans to double the number of stores it has worldwide to 441 by the end of 2017. Mr Musk unveiled a prototype of the Model 3 Sedan in Hawthorne, California, outside Los Angeles at an event attended by hundreds of Tesla owners and media. Three of the cars were driven on stage. The four-door vehicles have no grille and also feature a roof that is a panoramic pane of glass from front to back. The Model 3 is seen as critical to Tesla's growth plans and sustaining its share price which has jumped in recent days ahead of the launch, amid concerns by some sceptics about when the business will start to turn a profit. A rival electric car from General Motors, the Chevrolet Bolt, is to launch later this year at a starting price of around $35,000 while a new generation of Nissan’s Leaf electric car is also in the offing."

England looked set for a stunning victory in Kolkata, but suffered last-over heartbreak as Ben Stokes was clubbed for four sixes. In a bad-tempered contest in front of 66,000 fans, Windies celebrated ecstatically, as Stokes sat crumpled in the middle of the field. The Caribbean side, who were chasing 156 to win, are the first team to lift the World T20 trophy twice. They needed 19 off the last six balls, but Carlos Brathwaite launched a vicious assault on Stokes, heaving him over the ropes four times in a row. Brathwaite's heroics sparked jubilant scenes at Eden Park His heroics alongside Marlon Samuels, unbeaten on 85, saw the 2012 champions win with two balls to spare, sparking jubilant scenes at Eden Park. ""I can't really express how much of a top knock (by Samuels) that was. We couldn't turn back, it was a question of when not if,"" said Brathwaite. Windies bowling coach Curtly Ambrose was overjoyed after seeing his team follow the women's title earlier in the day and the Under-19s taking their world crown earlier this year. ""We believe we can chase any target because we've got some real firepower,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how many you've got to chase. We won the under-19 and the women's and now this, it's history."" Put in to bat, England got off to a dreadful start before Joe Root hit a fluent 54 to help the 2010 champions post a competitive 155 for nine wickets. West Indies wobbled early in their chase before Samuels added 75 runs with Dwayne Bravo (25) to steady the ship. Brathwaite then provided the late fireworks to secure an emotional victory."

The government's blueprint to get more people cycling and walking in Britain will see it spend £316m over the next five years, but the CTC says the current rate of spending is simply not enough. ""They've got this great ambition for cycling and they want to change the whole mantra on how we look upon cycling as a way of getting about,"" said Paul Tuohy from the Cyclists' Touring Club. ""That's brilliant but the numbers don't stack up. We do need a lot more investment to get to the levels they want. ""Our estimates are that if we want to get to the Dutch levels, at the current spending, that's going to take until the 23rd century. That's not very good."" In the Netherlands a total of 27% of journeys are made by bike, whereas in the UK that figures drops to just 2%. The Dutch spend £24 per person per year on cycling, but in the UK the figure invested outside London is just £1.39 per person. ""The first thing I would say is that you need to concentrate on making cyclists feel safe,"" Iris van der Horst, Amsterdam's city cycling chief, told Sky News Online. ""You can plan and you can invest, but safety has to be the very first concern. You want everyone on their bike, from four-year-olds up to 84-year-olds. Yes it has been a success here, but it didn't happen overnight. ""We implemented our very first cycling plan for Amsterdam in 1978 and we have worked on improving it ever since. All I would say to people in London is that Rome wasn't built in a day."" Such is the popularity of the bike in Amsterdam nowadays that cyclists often joke it's easier to park a car in the centre than find a space to leave your bike. The council's answer is an ambitious plan to create an extra 40,000 spaces by the end of the year. Ms van der Horst added: ""The benefits from cycling are there for all to see. Less congestion, better quality of air, plus all the health benefits that come from exercise."" Campaigning cyclist Dave Sherry has started filming his bike journeys around London because of the dangers he has faced from motorists. He says he has often been knocked off his bike by erratic drivers - and on one occasion, punched into a ditch. ""Every day in this country cyclists are getting injured, maimed and sometimes even killed,"" said Mr Sherry, who passes his footage on to police. ""More needs to be done. It just can't go on like this, the dangers are too great."""

Of course, a record eighth win for veteran actress Dame Judi Dench - for her role in A Winter's Tale - and a best actress in a musical gong for Imelda Staunton for Gypsy, were to be expected, but otherwise, despite a starry nominees list, relatively unknown names shone. Kenneth Cranham, 71, took best actor for The Father - his first ever Olivier win, having only been nominated once before. Denise Gough and Kenneth Cranham with their awards He told Sky News he could not believe his luck, saying: ""I can't believe I've beat big brands like Cumberbatch and Branagh."" The best actress award was taken home by another relative unknown, Denise Gough, for her acclaimed role in People, Places And Things, and who only a few years ago nearly gave up acting, telling Sky News: ""I could hardly find the rent, so I started waitressing."" The best actor in a musical went to Matt Henry for Kinky Boots, who crossed the invisible line from audience to stage, when 15 years ago he swapped selling ice cream in the interval for walking the boards. Musical Gypsy was the big winner of the night, winning four prizes - the most for a single production. Kinky Boots won three awards including best new musical, thanks in part to Cyndi Lauper who wrote the music and lyrics - proving perhaps, that for all its pomp and ceremony, at the theatre, girls just want to have fun. So while Hollywood may shine a light on the West End, these awards were not blinded by celebrity, as the overall feeling from the Royal Opera House, in the Olivier's 40th year, was that the winners were supremely deserving. Presenters included Dame Shirley Bassey, Vanessa Redgrave and Eddie Izzard and the show was hosted by two-time Oliver Award winner Michael Ball. It featured performances from Grammy and Tony Award winner Cyndi Lauper, Michael Feinstein, Joe Stilgoe and Jack Savoretti."

Speaking to Sky News, Louise Ellman - who is herself Jewish - claimed Labour members were being allowed to ""get away"" with making offensive remarks online. She acknowledged the Labour leader had clearly stated he is against anti-Semitism, but called on Mr Corbyn to back up his words with actions. Ms Ellman told the Murnaghan programme: ""I am very concerned about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Most members of the Labour Party are not anti-Semitic but some are. ""Some are being allowed to get away with posting anti-Semitic comments in their tweets and on their websites. I have raised this in parliamentary meetings."" She added that ""we haven't seen enough"" action being taken against activists who publish inappropriate material online. Recently, there have been several incidents where Labour supporters have written anti-Semitic tweets - with shadow Commons leader Chris Bryant also expressing his concerns. One activist was suspended after posting a series of tweets where he referred to Jews with ""big noses"" and described Hitler as a ""Zionist God"". Earlier, shadow chancellor John McDonnell had insisted Labour were committed to dealing with the issue. ""You can be a critic of the Israeli state and its role, but you mustn't allow that to in any way be used by anti-Semites,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""We've got to root that out and we will do."""

Sajid Javid said that while nationalisation was not the preferred option, ""nothing"" had been ruled out. It will raise hopes at Port Talbot and elsewhere that the Government may be prepared to step in. :: Public Sector Told To Buy British Steel Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I don't think nationalisation is a solution to this. Having said that, I also think it wouldn't be prudent to rule anything out at this stage, but I think that nationalisation is rarely an answer in these situations. ""I do feel, though, for lots of reasons after talking to Tata and many others involved in this, that there will be enough time to find the right buyer working with the Government and being able to take this forward. ""We will look at everything we can do to allow a sale going ahead and I wouldn't rule anything out at this stage."" The Conservative cabinet minister reiterated that the Government's aim was to find a buyer as soon as possible for Tata's UK business. But he revealed Tata had accepted finalising any deal could be a lengthy process, potentially giving the Government more time. ""They know it is not just a matter of weeks. When they talk about weeks, that's the period you would take to get so-called expressions of interest. Then it will take much longer than that to work out a deal,"" Mr Javid said. He added: ""I want to see steel making continuing in Port Talbot, I want to protect as many jobs as possible, I want to find a buyer for the whole of the business. ""Tata will issue an offer document very soon. Alongside that, the UK Government know - I've known for a while - that we're also going to have to offer support to clinch that buyer and give that steel plant a long-term, viable future."" Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle has said it is crucial for the Government to protect the assets of the UK's steel industry in the event a viable buyer is not found. She told Sky's Murnaghan programme: ""Look what they did in Redcar. They sat on their hands they destroyed one of the most modern blast furnaces in Europe and the coke ovens went with it. ""We must not make same mistake with steel industry."" Mr Javid also defended travelling to Australia, instead of being in Mumbai where Tata made the decision.  He argued while he had learned weeks ago the plant in Port Talbot could face closure, he did not expect the announcement it would be sold. Upon hearing on Tuesday that Tata was selling his British operations, Mr Javid said he immediately made the decision to return to the UK and visit steelworkers in Port Talbot."

Deliveries to nearly 27 million homes could be disrupted if the walkout by 4,900 managers goes ahead. They are unhappy about a 1.3% pay rise, which has been described by the Unite trade union as ""paltry"". Unite officer Brian Scott said: ""Our members are disgusted and upset by the abject failure of Royal Mail to take the issue of pay seriously. ""It is adopting a high-handed attitude. ""The company's final pay offer has already been rejected by 95% of Unite members, but the management remains unwilling to sit down and find a way through this difficulty.""

Ballot papers were delivered on Monday to managers who are members of Unite. The voting period closes on 21 April.

When Sajid Javid arrived at Port Talbot’s steelworks, after being scrambled back from Australia amid growing criticism, he wasn't expecting to have to address a large crowd of workers. Staff at the plant had other ideas, though.  While the Business Secretary spent four hours inside the Tata building talking to unions and managers, a crowd gathered outside. Some had come from home, while others joined their workmates at the end of their shifts; all were there for answers.  Just after 4pm, they got their chance. ""You're not gonna let us go to the wall?"" asked Chris Evans, one of many here who have dedicated their lives to steel. ""We're doing everything we can,"" was Sajid Javid's reply. ""Have we got time?"" came a shout from the crowd. ""I think the time is there. The meetings today have been constructive"" was the answer. As the Business Secretary was whisked away in a Jaguar, I asked the workers what they thought of his responses. ""It's more positive than what we've had all week. When the boys came back from Mumbai it was all doom and gloom,"" said Lyndon Jones, who has worked at the site for 30 years. ""He was a lot longer in there than I thought he was gonna be so I take it that's positive."" His colleague Christopher Walters echoed his view, saying: ""It sounded encouraging words, but again it's a time issue. We need something done, rather than words."" Let's make it clear: there is still no buyer, no timeline or clear plan. But for some of the workers this visit has changed one important thing: they now have hope. But hope won't save this site or the 13 others at risk. The workers need to see action if ministers really want to prove that they are – in Mr Javid’s words – ""on your side""."

Crowds danced and cried at the concert in Warrington Singer Kris Leonard, guitarist River Reeves, bassist Tomas Lowe, drummer Jack Dakin and their manager Craig Tarry were all killed when their car crashed through a barrier and into a canal after a concert in Sweden. Despite only forming last year, the band were gaining critical acclaim, and were already booked to appear at festivals and gigs around the world. Amongst the bands performing at the tribute were Blossoms. Viola Beach were on tour with them when the accident happened. Tom Ogden, singer with Blossoms, said they were left stunned by the news of the accident. He told Sky News: ""We started to get to know them really well, and they were a really friendly, fun group of lads."" Luke Pritchard from the Kooks said it was an honour to be asked to perform at the concert, and told the crowd that Viola Beach were superb musicians who'll be hugely missed. Mike Manning was a close friend of River Reeves. He told Sky News before the concert: ""It's really lovely for people to come out and show their support especially for Viola Beach. It's so lovely that it's brought all of Warrington together."" The most poignant moment came when a set recorded by Viola Beach was played to a cheering crowd. As the video played their families took to the stage and danced to the music that is now the soundtrack of their memories."

Millions of documents leaked to a number of media organisations across Europe apparently show the ways the rich and famous can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. It is reported that journalists from more than 80 countries have been reviewing 11.5 million files leaked from the database of Mossack Fonseca, the world's fourth biggest offshore law firm. Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's PM, is named in the Panama Papers Among the revelations is a network of secret deals and loans worth £2bn which apparently leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to The Guardian, one of the media organisations receiving the leaked documents - the so-called 'Panama Papers' - reveal: :: Six members of the House of Lords, three former Conservative MPs and dozens of donors to UK political parties have had offshore assets. :: A key member of FIFA's powerful ethics committee, which is supposed to be spearheading reform at world football's scandal-hit governing body, acted as a lawyer for individuals and companies recently charged with bribery and corruption. :: Twelve national leaders are among 143 politicians, their families and close associates from around the world known to have been using offshore tax havens.

Their companies were harboured by the Seychelles, the British Virgin Islands, Panama and other jurisdictions.

David Cameron, pictured with Iceland's PM, has vowed to tackle tax secrecy The company has denied any wrongdoing. It says it has acted beyond reproach for 40 years and that it has had robust due diligence procedures. The document leak comes from the records of the firm, which was founded in 1977. The information is near live, with the most recent records dating from December 2015. Around 370 reporters from 100 media organisations have spent a year analysing and verifying the documents. David Cameron has promised to ""sweep away"" tax secrecy - but his political opponents claim little has been done. He is planning a summit of world leaders next month, which will focus on the conduct of tax havens. The Prime Minister set out his line in 2011 when he said: ""We need to shine a spotlight on who owns what and where the money is really flowing."" Oxfam's head of UK policy, Richard Pyle, said: ""This leak highlights the key role that UK-linked tax havens like the British Virgin Islands play in allowing a privileged elite to dodge paying their fair share of tax. ""People in the world's poorest countries pay the highest price for the billions of lost tax money when their governments are unable to fund life-saving healthcare such as midwives and vaccinations for children. ""The UK is in a unique position to help clean up the murky world of tax havens - starting by ensuring that the real beneficiaries of shell companies registered in the UK's Crown dependencies and overseas territories, such as the British Virgin Islands, are revealed ahead of May's Anti-Corruption Summit in London."" Campaign group Global Witness said: ""This investigation shows how secretly-owned companies, many of them based in the UK's tax havens, can act as getaway cars for terrorists, dictators, money launderers and tax evaders all over the world. ""The time has clearly come to take away the keys, by requiring the collection and publication of information on who really owns and controls these companies. ""This would make it much harder to launder dirty money and leave the rest of us safer as a result."""

Research by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) found nearly half of UK adults admit to getting out of breath when running for a bus. Around 47% felt they could run up to half a mile, the survey of 2,000 adults by One Poll found. While three in 10 (29%) of those who claimed to be able to run a mile said they had not done so for more than a decade. Almost two-fifths (38%) told the survey they did not feel fit enough to join a gym. Just under three in 10 thought running was for those who are already fit and healthy. The BHF has described the figures as ""worrying"". The organisation is warning that heart and circulatory disease affects around seven million people in the UK and is responsible for around 155,000 deaths each year. The charity wants people to run the marathon distance of 26.2 miles over the course of a month, so they can stay fit. ""These statistics are concerning, and paint a worrying picture about the nation's fitness levels,"" senior cardiac nurse at the BHF Christopher Allen said. ""Heart disease can affect anyone at any age, but keeping physically active is one of the best ways to help build a strong and healthy heart so we shouldn't ignore the benefits. ""Running a marathon is no easy feat, but with the MyMarathon challenge you decide the place and the pace, so it's a great way for people of all fitness levels to get active and help support our vital research."""

Emergency services were called to the scene after the two passenger services were involved in a ""low-speed"" collision on platform six at around 3.30pm on Sunday. Eyewitness described hearing a ""huge bang"" and said passengers were thrown forward by the impact. A spokeswoman for South West Coast Ambulance Service said all eighteen casualties, which include the driver of one of the trains, are reported to be in a stable condition. No one was trapped in the incident. Pic: @dominic_1983 She added: ""The majority of those are walking wounded and eight of those are going to Derriford hospital in Plymouth."" Devon and Somerset fire service said they had helped ambulance crews and the British Transport Police in treating people with ""various injuries"", but no one had been trapped. Dominic Parnell, from Cornwall, was on board the moving train when it collided with the one in front. He said: ""We were travelling fairly slowly as we were arriving at the platform when we came to a sudden stop with a huge bang. The crash is likely to cause delays to train journeys. Pic: @dominic_1983 ""Of course, most people were stood up waiting to alight and were thrown forward. No one appeared to be injured in my immediate area."" A spokesman for the British Transport Police said: ""A number of people, including the driver of one of the trains, have sustained injuries as a result of the collision and are being treated by paramedics at the scene. ""At this stage we believe that a moving train collided into the back of a stationary train on platform six at the station and we are currently looking into the circumstances to determine how this happened."" The crash is likely to cause delays to train journeys in the Plymouth area, he added. Great Western Railway said it is investigating the cause of the incident. Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), said the crash was a ""sober reminder"" of the importance of rail safety. He said: ""Our first thoughts are of course with those hurt in this accident. It is far too early to speculate why today's crash happened and an investigation into its causes will now take place. ""However, it is a sober reminder of how critical safety is for our industry and thanks to the efforts of our hardworking and dedicated staff unfortunate incidents like this sad one are actually so rare."""
2016-04-04,Home Secretary Theresa May has urged police to investigate claims child survivors of the Nepal Earthquake are being sold to British families.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160404115029/http://news.sky.com/story/1672106/slavers-sell-orphans-to-uk-families-report,"Home Secretary Theresa May has urged police to investigate claims child survivors of the Nepal Earthquake are being sold to British families. Slave traders are selling youngsters made homeless in last year's tragedy to UK Asian families as unpaid domestic servants, according to an investigation by The Sun. The newspaper's undercover team said they were offered orphans and destitute children by gangs in Punjab for £5,250. Slave trader Makkhan Singh lined up youngsters for the reporters to pick from, and said: ""We have supplied lads who have gone on to the UK. Most of the ones who are taken to England are Nepalese. ""For the supply of a boy, minimum 500,000 rupees (around £5,250). Then you will have other costs associated with taking him to the UK, but that's your responsibility extra to what  you pay us. Gallery: 2015: Aftermath Of Nepal Earthquake A woman works to clean up the destruction left after earthquakes and aftershocks in the outskirts of Kathmandu, Nepal, in May 2015 ""Take a Nepalese to England. They are good people. They are good at doing all the housework and they're very good cooks. No-one is going to come after you."" Mrs May said the findings were ""disturbing"" and urged police and the National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate. ""Child trafficking is a truly abhorrent crime,"" she said. ""No child, anywhere in the world, should be taken away from their home and forced to work in slavery."" An NCA spokesman told Sky News: ""The NCA works with partners in the UK and internationally to identify and pursue criminals and to safeguard both child and adult victims. ""The hidden nature of human trafficking means that it often goes unreported. Anyone who suspects it should report their concerns to law enforcement."" Thousands of girls are trafficked from Nepal each year. The Sun's probe into the slave trade began in Jalandhar, an Indian city close to the Nepalese border. A reporter posed as a wealthy Sikh living in Britain with a sick wife and elderly mother looking for a housemaid or houseboy to cook, clean and care for them. Unaware he was being secretly filmed, Singh said: ""Brother, I can supply the boy. But as to taking him into the UK and all the documents that you will need, that's your responsibility. That's got nothing to do with us."" He added: ""Once we've done the deal with you, we hand them over to you and you take them to your place, and that's it. No-one is going to come after you. ""Minimum three or four years you've got to keep them here. Train them, make them work for you here. Get them into a routine. Then you can start getting documents for them. ""If you want my advice, take a 12 or 13-year-old. Keep him in your house here, train him, then by the time you're taking him over to the UK … he will be moulded into your ways."" The 7.8-magnitude quake that struck Nepal killed almost 9,000 people and left millions in need of aid."

Michaella McCollum, from Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland, was freed on parole on Thursday after serving more than two years in prison in South America. McCollum and Melissa Reid, from Scotland, were sentenced in 2013 to six years and eight months in jail after admitting trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5m to Spain from Peru. In her first interview since being released, the 23-year-old said: ""I've forgotten the things that everybody takes for granted in life. ""Seeing the sun, seeing the darkness, seeing the moon and the stars, things I haven't seen in almost three years."" McCollum was freed early after two years and three months inside as a result of new prison legislation introduced in Peru last year. It is expected she will have to remain in Peru for several more years as part of her parole conditions. Reid remains in prison in Peru. McCollum at court in Peru prison in 2013 She has been seeking to serve the remainder of her sentence closer to home in Scotland, but has not yet been given the go-ahead. McCollum told a documentary due to be aired on RTE One on Sunday night that she recognised the damage she could have caused. ""I probably would have had a lot of blood on my hands,"" she said. ""I potentially could have filled Europe full of a lot of drugs. ""I could have potentially killed a lot of people, not directly but I could have caused a lot of harm to people."" She added: ""I made a decision in a moment of madness. I'm not a bad person. I want to demonstrate that I'm a good person."" McCollum, from Dungannon, and Reid, from Glasgow, were working in Ibiza when they claim they were forced to board a flight with 24lb of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage. They were caught with the haul at Lima airport on 6 August, 2013, attempting to fly to Spain. They had claimed they were forced to carry the drugs but pleaded guilty to charges later that year. The pair had previously been held at Virgen de Fatima prison but were later moved to the Ancon 2 jail, where conditions are said to be cramped, with poor sanitation and toilet facilities."

The closure of Ravenscraig in 1992 signalled the end of large scale steel making in Scotland, devastating the community of steelworkers. Sky's Scotland Bureau Chief James Matthews spoke to several people connected  to the plant to see how life has unfolded since the closure. Dorothy Macready and her husband were former Ravenscraig employees. ""We first heard the news (of the closure) on the television. There had been rumours, but nothing official.  ""It was disbelief that this thing, that had been there for years and years, now it was gone. There was a sadness, a despondency and uncertainty for what the future held. ""For men, aged 40 and 50, what were they going to do? That’s all they knew - steelmaking.  My husband hated having to write down 'unemployed'. There was nothing. He did find work but the work he found, as he used to say in his own words, 'I’ve got the jobs nobody else wants.' ""Everybody said 'The Craig will close', but we never thought it would close, and when it did it was a shock. Dorothy Macready ""All the shops round about … a lot of them closed, got run down. Going past Ravenscraig and not to see any production, that was sad. ""I wouldn’t imagine there was a family in Motherwell or the surrounding area that wasn’t affected.  ""I know my own family - cousins, husbands and things - eventually they all got jobs but it was part-time, they weren’t well-paying jobs. ""I think there's acceptance that that’s it, it’s gone. We’ve moved on and reconciled ourselves that we’ll get something else but I don’t think Motherwell will be the same again.""      Justin Parkes, Industrial History Curator, Culture NL (North Lanarkshire).  ""Ravenscraig was very important for the Scottish economy. It was two and a half kilometres square in size, twice the size of Monaco.  ""Bearing in mind Motherwell was already an incredibly important steelmaking area - Dalzell Steelworks was the biggest steelworks in Scotland up to the 1930’s but Ravenscraig really changed and made Motherwell the centre of the steel industry in Scotland, one of the most important places in Europe for steelmaking. ""A huge amount of jobs became dependent on the steelworks, not necessarily from working there directly, but it was estimated something like 10,000 people in the area were working in jobs that had some relation to the steelworks. ""I think the fallout’s still ongoing in a way. Ravenscraig’s still very important to local people and I think the Heritage Centre here really demonstrates that.  ""We are doing an ongoing project with the Council and with NHS Scotland, interviewing former steelworkers and that’s part of therapy for steelworkers as well. ""There’s various issues from people who worked in the steelworks, whether it’s alcoholism or depression as a result of being made unemployed."" Ian Livingstone, former Chairman of Lanarkshire Development Agency ""I think we’re in a healthier position now than we were at the time of British Steel because our companies and our employees were dependent on one major industry and if it went down, everything went down.  ""Now we’ve managed to diversify into other industries. We have hi-tech companies, we have call-centres, we have people not dependent on one industry.  ""The result is a healthier economy than we had before. People looking from outside might think, ‘Yes, it was better at that time because it looked better.’  ""To be honest, it’s better now because people have more security in the industries they’re in than they ever had in British Steel because it was always going to be a problem. ""Unemployment has come down. At the time of Ravenscraig, unemployment generally in Lanarkshire was something like 14%. Our challenge was to bring that unemployment level down to the Scottish average and that was achieved within about eight years after the closure of Ravenscraig. ""So, to the extent that people have more employment and are not so worried about their jobs then, to be honest, people will generally feel more contented and happier with the industries that we have here - some of which are very hi-tech and far-reaching with research and development."""

Forces in Lancashire and Cheshire say they have received reports of issues with the bank's ATMs. The warning for Lancashire follows reports of suspicious devices on Santander's machines across the county last week. Police are concerned criminals have targeted the machines in an attempt to steal card details and cash, and have urged those who have lost money to contact the bank. But Santander said only five cash machines had been tampered with and these were shut down at the request of the police. No customers have reported being defrauded, a spokeswoman said. She said: ""Santander was contacted this weekend by police, who requested that 5 ATM machines in the North West and Lancashire area be shut down due to potential criminal activity and vandalism. ""The 5 ATMs in question were shut down immediately. ""The Santander ATM network remains fully operational and we are assisting the police with their enquiries in relation to the 5 ATMs in the Lancashire area. ""Customers are always advised to remain vigilant and if concerned about any other ATM machines, they should contact the police immediately and not use them."" Lancashire Police wrote on Twitter earlier: ""Security at Santander ATMs in Lancs has been compromised. Advice is not to use them. If you have lost money please contact the bank and 101."" Cheshire Police issued a warning to avoid Santander cash machines in Wilmslow, near Manchester. The force tweeted: ""Cheshire Police have received reports of issues with Santander ATM's in Wilmslow. Please do not use the machines and call your bank and 101."" A spokesman for Lancashire Police said it is feared the issue could be more widespread. He said: ""We are advising the public to be vigilant, in particular of Santander machines, but of any cash machines. ""Report anything suspicious, have a visual check of the cashpoint and if in doubt leave it an go somewhere else."" ""It's spread across the whole of Lancashire so it's highly likely other forces may have had reports. We do not know how many are affected."" The force also issued advice to bank customers, telling them not to use a cash machine if it appears to have been tampered with and shielding the keypad when entering the PIN. Greater Manchester Police and Merseyside Police said they have received no reports of compromised cash machines."

The 110 men and women who'll make up the UK team were brought together in central London for the first time for an official photo ahead of the event which takes place in Orlando from 8th-12th May.  After the team photo was taken Prince Harry took time to meet the competitors, asking how their training was going and telling one group they'd all have a few beers to celebrate once the games were over. All of those taking part are wounded, injured and sick (WIS) serving military personnel and veterans. Former Army Captain David Wiseman will be leading the team out in Orlando as UK captain. David said: “I have a huge emotional attachment to the Invictus Games and could not be prouder to have been selected to Captain the UK Team at Orlando 2016. ""The reason for my pride? I think the Invictus Games is a shining example of what this community can achieve, a group of individuals from around the world coming together in order to show everyone that beyond injury, they can achieve the extraordinary."" Prince Harry attends team trials ahead of the 2016 Invictus Games Each member of the team was chosen to take part not just on their athletic ability but also the benefit that taking part will have on their long term recovery. This year there is also an increased focus on the impact of psychological injuries, and the benefits that sport can have for those suffering from mental health issues. The first Invictus Games was held in London in 2014 and saw over 400 competitors from 13 nations compete in nine sports. The event in America will be see 15 nations compete in 10 sports, including Athletics; Archery; Wheelchair Basketball; Road Cycling; Powerlifting; Indoor Rowing; Wheelchair Rugby; Swimming, Sitting Volleyball, and a new sport for 2016, Wheelchair Tennis. Last month Prince Harry also announced that Canada would be hosting the third Invictus Games in Toronto in 2017."

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported growth of 5.3% on the same month last year, with buyers snapping up 518,707 new cars. It credited the biannual number plate change, which took effect on 1 March and said demand was up year-on-year across all fuel types. The SMMT said diesel and petrol registrations grew by 4.8% and 4.7% respectively while alternatively fuelled vehicles enjoyed a rise of 21.5%. The UK figures could be seen as encouraging for Volkswagen, in the wake of the German manufacturer's diesel emissions scandal. Year-on-year VW sales halted a five-month slide in March - the SMMT statistics showed - up fractionally on the same month in 2015. However, its year-to-date registrations remain almost 5% down on the same point last year. Ford's Fiesta continued to top the table in terms of demand, with nearly 23,500 sold in March and over 36,000 in the year to date. The other most popular models were the Vauxhall Corsa, Ford Focus and the VW Golf. The SMMT said more than 17,000 hybrid or electric cars were sold in the month - a rise of 1,173% on March 2006 - as drivers continued to seek greener models despite low fuel costs. Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: ""The sector's strong growth in March rounds off a robust first quarter as British consumers continue to demonstrate their appetite for new cars, especially ultra-low emission vehicles. ""This confidence should see registrations remain at a high but broadly stable level over the year, but could be undermined by political or economic uncertainty."""

2016-04-07,Police in Los Angeles are trying a radical new approach to tackle the epidemic of child prostitution.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160407054206/http://news.sky.com/story/1673404/exclusive-americas-child-prostitution-epidemic,"By Greg Milam, US Correspondent Police in Los Angeles are trying a radical new approach to tackle the epidemic of child prostitution. Vice officers in America's second largest city say treating teenagers as victims rather than criminals gives them the best chance of rebuilding their lives away from the streets. Sky News joined LA vice squad's small human trafficking unit in an undercover operation on ""the tracks"" in south central Los Angeles. They offered help and counselling to young women working as prostitutes. One undercover officer told Sky News: ""There's no such thing as child prostitution. They are victims. Many of them don't realise they are. ""By putting them through the court process we are just re-victimising them. We now deem this a rescue and recovery operation."" In a separate operation, officers found girls advertising online and arranged to meet them in a hotel. Once there, they again offered the girls a way out. Police often find the girls reluctant to defy their pimp or trafficker because, as one officer put it: ""The consequences can be pretty severe"". 'Sandy' says her journey to a life of prostitution began when she was nine and her mother sold her for sex to pay for drugs. She is now 17 and has completed her education thanks to the work of a shelter called Children of the Night in Van Nuys, north of Los Angeles. She told Sky News: ""There's a bunch of young girls that go into prostitution because it is easier and fast money and that's what everyone wants. ""No one wants to sit there and work a 9-to-5 job earning $500 a week when you can earn $1,000 a day."" But as 'Sandy' prepared to return to her home life, she said she could not rule out returning to prostitution. ""With no family or parents there, no one cares that you are on the street, no one's looking for you at night,"" she said.  ""That's why girls go into prostitution, because no one cares about us. My parents didn't care about me, where else was there to go?"" The shelter, founded in a former post office with a grant from Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, has helped 10,000 teenagers over the last 30 years. Founder Dr Lois Lee disagrees with the new police approach because young women ""don't know the word trafficking applies to them"". She said: ""Child prostitution starts at home. The answer is to identify these children at birth through uniform drug testing, so they never hit the crack house, to give mother the chance to pull herself together."" At the nearby Van Nuys police station, commanding officer Captain Lillian Carranza told Sky News: ""Children are the victims. This is, in essence, modern day slavery."" :: Watch Greg Milam's special report on child prostitution in America on Sky News at 11.30am, 2.30pm and 8.30pm."

A team of collaborative robots whirr, not assembling cars or steel, but the building blocks of life itself - DNA. This is the Foundry, a £2m centre which opens today in Imperial College London. It plans to industrialise the process of preparing DNA for use in synthetic biology. The automated lab can run thousands of experiments simultaneously, saving biotechnology researchers from wasting hours with pipettes and Petri dishes. That DNA will be turned into biological 'devices' - mini production centres for antibiotics, vaccines and even fuels. ""We want to have a very standardised, almost open-source model where people can access the data from the Foundry as part of the process of synthetic biology,"" said Professor Paul Freemont, head of molecular biosciences at Imperial College. ""Synthetic biology is an extension of biotechnology. It's about harnessing biology in a much more efficient way, to do stuff for us. ""To manufacture things, to make things, using biological cells as essentially little factories or using them even as biosensors."" The Government has identified synthetic biology as one of eight 'great technologies' where the UK can excel. ""We've been using biology for 5,000 years or more,"" Professor Freemont said. ""What we're doing is now much more detailed. We're beginning to really design and engineer biological systems. Which is, I think, a natural evolution, but it is a transformation as well."" ""This is the future of how we're going to build and manufacture really complex molecules like drugs, pharmaceuticals, even commodity chemicals."" Synthetic biology has been booming since the decoding of the human genome in 2000 - especially over the last three years, thanks to a new technique for gene editing called CRISPR. New synthetic biology companies are springing up across the UK. Chloe Gui, the co-founder and CEO of Aranex, is using CRISPR to create non-allergenic peanuts so that the one in 100 people in the UK who are allergic can eat them. ""The great thing about CRISPR is it's much easier than technologies used in the past,"" she told Sky News. At a time when more traditional manufacturing industries in this country are in crisis, synthetic biology is one area where the UK is a genuine world leader. It's an industry of the future - one that will hopefully arrive soon."

An amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill would make it a criminal offence for some terror suspects to skip the country between being arrested and being charged. The measure follows the UK's senior counter-terrorism officer, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, claiming police bail is a ""toothless"" regime because terror suspects who break bail conditions cannot be prosecuted. It was also prompted by the case of Siddhartha Dhar, who fled to Syria 24 hours after his release on bail and is thought to have replaced Mohammed Emwazi, known as ""Jihadi John"", in videos threatening the UK. The new offence would apply to suspects arrested over a range of crimes, including membership of a proscribed organisation, fundraising in support of terrorism, and encouraging terrorism. Anyone convicted would face a maximum of 12 months in jail and a fine. Home Secretary Theresa May said: ""We are determined to give the police the tools they need to fight terrorism and keep people safe. ""This tough new criminal offence will help stop suspected terrorists from fleeing the UK to join Daesh (Islamic State). ""We have already taken action to deal specifically with the problem of foreign fighters, including introducing powers to seize and hold the passports of those suspected of planning to leave the UK and take part in acts of terror. ""The measure will help the police protect people from the threat of terrorism - it underlines the Government’s determination to tackle those who would do us harm or threaten our way of life."" Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham urged stronger action last month, saying: ""People will find it truly shocking that terror suspects on police bail can waltz out of the country without any real difficulty."" Giving evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee in January, the Prime Minister had made clear the Government's intention to do more work to address the issue."
2016-04-07,"Today marks the official beginning of the 2016/17 tax year, which brings with it a raft of changes to pensions, tax and savings. Here's a guide to what you need to know.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160407054206/http://news.sky.com/story/1673367/a-handy-guide-to-the-new-tax-year,"Today marks the official beginning of the 2016/17 tax year, which brings with it a raft of changes to pensions, tax and savings. Here's a guide to what you need to know. :: There's a new State Pension - but will it affect me? The chances are, yes, it will. The new 'single-tier' State Pension will be allocated to anyone who reaches pension age on or after today and who has been paying National Insurance contributions for a minimum of 10 years. It replaces the Basic State Pension and additional schemes like the Second State Pension and Pension Benefit. :: What will I get? You'll get the full flat rate of £155.65 a week if you have been paying National Insurance for at least 35 years by the time you retire. Anyone who has between 10 and 35 years' worth of contributions will get less than this, depending on how much National Insurance they paid. This includes anyone who has been 'contracted out' at any point: that is, anyone who agreed to pay a lesser rate of National Insurance because they (or their employer) felt their workplace pension was so generous they would not have to rely on an Additional State Pension to supplement their retirement income. :: But I've been paying towards a Second or Additional State Pension - what happens to that? Those who have been contributing towards an Additional State Pension (usually a Second State Pension, also known as SERPS) and who have accrued a significant amount under this scheme will be paid more than the usual weekly flat rate. If you've only accumulated a small amount through an Additional State Pension scheme your flat rate won't be supplemented. Any young people who begin paying National Insurance after today will have their entire pension calculated through the new single-tier system. :: I've heard there are changes to the way I save my money too. What's that about? A new Personal Savings Allowance has come into effect, meaning that you’ll be able to earn up to a maximum of £1,000 worth of interest on your savings without having to pay any tax - that’s up to about £75,000 worth of savings, tax free. Up until now savers paid levies on any interest they earned at the same rate as their income tax, so if you were a basic rate earner you would have be paying £20 in tax for every £100 worth of interest you received. This tax now won't apply. :: So how much can I save tax-free? The amount you'll be allowed to save without paying tax will depend on which tax bracket you're in, and on the rates of interest offered by your current or savings account. If you earn under £43,000 a year and pay the basic 20% tax rate, you'll be eligible for the maximum amount of £1,000 worth of tax-free interest on your savings. If you're a higher rate earner paying income tax at 40% you'll be able to earn £500 worth of interest without having to pay. Additional rate earners, those who are paid over £150,000 a year, won't receive any tax-free savings allowance at all. :: Do I have to open a particular savings account to take advantage? No - the allowance will apply to any interest you earn on any bank account, whether it's a current account you opened with a high street bank, a savings account with a credit union or building society, or any corporate or government bonds you hold. And any interest you receive that was tax-free before 6 April won’t be counted towards your allowance limit, meaning you can keep your tax-free ISA too. :: And are there any changes to income tax? Yes, the income tax personal allowance has been raised again - it's gone up from £10,600 to £11,000. This means you won't have to pay any tax on the first £11,000 you earn. The threshold at which you move from being a Basic Rate taxpayer (paying 20% income tax) to a Higher Rate taxpayer (paying 40% income tax) has also increased, moving from £42,385 to £43,000. It’s also worth noting that, from today, partial responsibility for setting income tax rates in Scotland has been devolved to Holyrood, although they’ll be staying at the same rate as the rest of the UK for this tax year at least."

Deborah Stokes phoned Radio Hauraki presenters Jeremy Wells and Matt Heath after the pair mocked Stokes’ role in England’s loss to the West Indies in the ICC World TWenty20 Final. After being told she was ""off air"", she told the radio duo she was ""totally brassed off"" by the presenters' ""unconscionable"" behaviour. ""It's not about the cricket it's about the personal attack on him,"" she said in the phone call. ""They called him arrogant and then they called him some kind of name. They don't know him! They wouldn't have a blooming clue."" It was only later that she realised her conversation had been broadcast, prompting her to complain to the radio station. The station’s owner, NZME, said it had decided to suspend the pair as punishment. ""Matt and Jeremy are famous for identifying where the line is and then ignoring it,"" the company’s programme director Mike McClung said in a statement. ""However putting Ben's mum to air without her knowledge, albeit defending her son, was obviously well over that line. ""They've been suitably reprimanded, and are off-air tomorrow."" Ben Stokes was born in New Zealand but moved to England as a child. His parents have since moved back to Christchurch."

The advert included two models - one leaning up against a wall in a colourful dress and another in a yellow outfit sitting on a sofa. A complaint was made about about both, who appeared in stills at the end of a video on The Times website in December 2015. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint saying the ""torso and arms"" of the model standing up ""were quite slender and appeared to be out of proportion with her head and lower body"". It went on: ""Further, her pose elongated her torso and accentuated her waist so that it appeared to be very small. ""We also considered that her sombre facial expression and dark make up, particularly around her eyes, made her face look gaunt. A complaint was made about both models in the advert ""For those reasons, we considered that the model leaning against the wall appeared to be unhealthily thin in the image, and therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible."" The Italian fashion house has been told the advert must not appear again in its current form. Gucci told the ASA the advert was aimed at an older, sophisticated audience and that it felt the model appeared ""toned and slim"". It said nowhere in the ads were any models' ""bones"" visible. It said their make up was natural and the lighting uniform and warm to ensure there were no hollows caused by shadows and their clothes were not revealing. Gucci UK told Sky News: ""We take our responsibilities as an advertiser very seriously in the way models are selected for and presented in our advertising campaigns. ""We have noted, but are not in agreement with, the assessment of the UK Advertising Standards Authority, an independent regulator, in relation to one model featured in one image from our Cruise 2015 campaign. ""The campaign itself expired at the end of December 2015."""
2016-04-07,"It is, perhaps, the least-discussed element of the steel crisis - drowned out by all the noise concerning Chinese dumping, business rates and green energy levies.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160407054206/http://news.sky.com/story/1673151/tata-steelworkers-pensions-at-risk-in-sale,"It is, perhaps, the least-discussed element of the steel crisis - drowned out by all the noise concerning Chinese dumping, business rates and green energy levies. And yet the pension liabilities attached to Tata’s UK steel business are likely to be central in any discussions held with would-be buyers of those assets. They also have the potential to capsize any deal. There are 130,000 members in the British Steel pension scheme, of whom 85,000 are currently drawing a pension, in most cases dating back to the days of British Steel, the once state-owned business that in 1999 merged with the Dutch company Hoogovens to form Corus, which Tata bought eight years later. A further 30,000 members of the scheme are what are known as “deferred” members - in other words, they no longer work for Tata Steel UK or any of its predecessors, but are not yet in a position to draw their pension. The remaining 15,000 or so are existing employees of Tata Steel UK. The pension scheme is a big one - it has assets of something like £16bn and a deficit, at the time of the last valuation two years ago, of £485m. That is already one of the largest deficits of any UK pension scheme and is likely to have increased during the last two years due to a combination of factors, including revised assessments of the life expectancy of current and former steel workers, along with movements in bond markets - the latter of which will have served to have increased the deficit. Tata has committed to injecting a further £125m during the next two years - £60m in 2017 and £65m in 2018 - but that is not going to be enough. There is an expectation that this deficit will need to be plugged in the event of a sale of the business. None of the companies being touted as potential buyers of Tata Steel UK will want to take on responsibility either for filling the deficit itself or for any other liabilities pertaining to the retirement savings of former steel workers. So a solution will need to be found for the pension scheme. One option would be for the pensions regulator to insist that Tata fill in the deficit itself. But that would be unreasonable in the extreme, since the company has not only been taking steps to plug the gap, but also because it has borne the £1m-a-day losses incurred by the steel business during the last few years. It could even prompt Tata into retaliating by tipping the UK business into administration. A second solution would be for the scheme to be passed to the Pension Protection Fund. This is a lifeboat paid for by compulsory levies on every other pension scheme in the land and by the recovery of assets from insolvent employers whose schemes end up being rescued by the PPF. The PPF is, for example, currently in talks about taking on the liabilities of the two pension schemes of the retailer BHS. One of the drawbacks with this solution, though, is that current employees and deferred members of the scheme would see their retirement benefits cut. A third possible solution that has been mooted would be for the Government to take on the scheme, as it did in 2012 with the Royal Mail pension scheme, prior to the company’s privatisation. This, however, is likely to be a non-starter because it would fall foul of EU state aid rules. In addition, the Royal Mail precedent is not an apt one, since the business was state-owned at the time its pension scheme was taken on by taxpayers, while the company also demonstrably had a viable future, something that cannot be said of Tata Steel UK. A fourth option would be for Tata, as the current owner, to do what is known as a ‘bulk annuity’ deal, where an insurance company, for a fee, agrees to take on the assets of a company’s pension scheme and assumes the risk of meeting the promises made to retirees. Many UK companies have done this over the last five years or so, including household names such as Tate & Lyle, ICI, Philips UK, EMI and Total. This would be an attractive solution but, given the sheer size of the British Steel pension scheme, many insurers might be deterred. So some kind of deal involving the Pension Protection Fund looks the likeliest option. But rest assured that some kind of deal securing the future of the British Steel pension scheme and its promises to thousands of current and former steel workers is going to have to be struck if any kind of rescue takes place."
2016-04-07,"The new tax year begins today and with it come numerous changes to the ways we earn, save and pay our taxes.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160407054206/http://news.sky.com/story/1673391/new-tax-year-brings-saving-and-pension-changes,"The new tax year begins today and with it come numerous changes to the ways we earn, save and pay our taxes. Several new policies took effect at midnight, including: :: A new State Pension system :: A higher personal tax threshold :: A reduction in the amount of tax you must pay on your savings :: A change in the way income tax is calculated in Scotland Perhaps the most significant and immediate change will be to pensions. The new 'single-tier' pension will affect millions across the country as the Government scraps the old Basic and Additional pension systems, which have been in place for decades. Intended to be simpler than the previous system of a multi-tiered Basic State Pension, which could then be boosted by additional pension schemes such as the Second State Pension, the new scheme introduces a flat rate for everyone who is fully eligible. Those who have paid National Insurance contributions for at least 35 years at the time they retire will receive the flat rate of £155.65 a week, while anyone who has contributed for a total of less than 35 years but more than 10 years of their working life will be paid a lesser amount. :: A Handy Guide To The New Tax Year According to the Treasury, over 75% of women and over 70% of men will gain in the first 15 years of the new State Pension, and by 2030 over three million women stand to gain an average of £550 extra per year as a result of the new system. Commenting on the changes, Chancellor George Osborne said: ""Today's reform of the State Pension is the most significant since its inception. ""The new system means that at last, people will have certainty in what they can expect from the state in old age - and for many women and the self-employed, it will be more generous. ""People will know that the full amount when they reach state pension age will be over £8,000 a year in today's money, so they can plan other retirement saving they may want on top."" But concerns have been raised that the new system unfairly penalises those who took part in workplace pensions in the past. Many company pensions allowed their employees to 'contract out' - that is, pay a lesser rate of National Insurance on their monthly wages in lieu of paying into additional State pension schemes, as they felt their workplace pension would be enough to supplement their basic retirement income. Under the new 'single-tier' scheme, anyone who was 'contracted out' will not be eligible for the full flat rate of £155.65, and will instead be paid based on the total amount of National Insurance they have contributed over the years. The changes to savings have been much more universally welcomed. Whereas previously any interest earned on savings was taxed at the same rate as income tax, individuals can now accrue up to £1,000 worth of interest without paying a penny - provided they don't earn over £150,000 a year. The amount of savings this interest represents depends on the interest rate offered by your bank or building society, but some sources say it could be as much as £76,000. And income tax is seeing some changes too. The Scottish government has now been given the power to alter income tax rates for those living in the country by setting their own rates, which will apply on top of a reduced base rate still determined by the levels set by UK government in Westminster. This means those in Scotland could pay as much as 10% less income tax than earners in the rest of Britain – although Holyrood has chosen to maintain taxes at the UK rate for this year at least. And the amount you can earn without having to pay any tax at all has also increased, rising from £10,600 in the tax year 2015/16 to £11,000 for the coming year. However if you're a high earner with over £100,000 worth of income annually you won't benefit from this. The £11,000 allowance begins to gradually reduce once you hit the £100,000 mark, until it ceases to apply at all if you earn over £122,000 a year."

The Iron Man star said that the treatment - apitherapy - had been used for thousands of years but had fallen out of fashion in recent times. In an interview with The New York Times where she shared beauty advice, she described herself as being ""generally open to anything"". ""I'm always the guinea pig to try everything. I've got to try them all."" The 43-year-old said that apitherapy is used to ""get rid of inflammation and scarring"" and that it was ""actually pretty incredible if you research it"". ""But, man, it's painful."" Apitherapy also covers the use of honey for medicinal purposes as well as being stung - bee venom therapy. It involves angering the bees so that they sting a person on the affected area of the body. Any benefits have not been scientifically proven but it has been used to treat arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Paltrow also said she ""loves"" acupuncture and is keen to try cryotherapy, the use of extremely low temperatures to treat medical issues. The actress also has a history of subscribing to fad diets, spending her 20s on the macrobiotic diet, eating mostly beans and vegetables and chewing her food more thoroughly than most people. She told The New York Times that she has ""a slightly easier philosophy, all around, than 10 years ago"". She added: ""I think I see now that life is really a balance. And it's great to eat nutrient-dense organic food, if you can. ""It’s also really great to drink a vodka and have French fries. Your metabolism does slow as you get older, though. ""If I have to get into tiptop shape, I have to be more careful. But I also don’t seem to care as much as I did."""
2016-04-07,The US Supreme Court has denied a petition to block the execution of a Texas man who claimed he drank the blood of his young victim.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160407054206/http://news.sky.com/story/1673629/vampire-killer-faces-execution-in-texas,"By Sky News US Team The US Supreme Court has denied a petition to block the execution of a Texas man who claimed he drank the blood of his young victim. Pablo Lucio Vasquez, 38, is due to be executed by lethal injection after 6pm local time on Wednesday for the murder of 12-year-old David Cardenas in 1998. His execution would be the 11th this year in the US and the sixth in Texas. But Vasquez's lawyer James Keegan filed the last-minute appeal saying several potential jurors in the murder trial may have been improperly excused because they were either against the death penalty or not comfortable imposing such a judgement. But Assistant Texas Attorney General Jeremy Greenwell said any exclusion of potential jury members was legally proper, adding that the latest appeal is ""nothing more than a meritless attempt to postpone (Vasquez's) execution"". The appeal was the latest in a number of attempts to save Vasquez. The most recent was a month ago and asserted that Vasquez was mentally ill and, therefore, should not be able to be sentenced to death. David Cardenas, then 21, had been a friend of Vasquez's  cousin, Andres Rafael Chapa. Both boys had been at a party in the Texas border town of Donna with Vasquez and others on 18 April, 1998. Vasquez told police he was drunk and high when voices told him to kill seventh-grader David. He said he beat him with a pipe and then slit his throat, saying the devil had told him to ""take (the head) away from him"". He said Chapa, then 15, had used a shovel in an attempt to help. Chapa pleaded guilty to murder and is serving a 35-year jail term. Vasquez told detectives he had later lifted David's body, allowing the blood to drip on his face before drinking it, adding in a statement: ""Something just told me to drink"". David's body was found missing limbs and nearly decapitated in a vacant field five days after the murder. Joseph Orendain, the lead trial prosecutor, described the case as ""really horrendous"", adding: ""Did he drink (the blood)? I don't know."""

More than 5,100 procedures and operations have been postponed due to the 48-hour strike, which started at 8am. Junior doctors have pledged to provide emergency care cover. It is the fourth walkout by the British Medical Association over contracts that stop junior doctors claiming extra pay for day shifts on Saturdays in return for a basic pay rise. Almost 25,000 procedures have been cancelled so far as a result of the dispute. NHS England said 46% of junior doctors had arrived for work on Wednesday.  But that number included staff who had never intended to strike, such as those providing emergency care.  NHS England's National Incident Director, Dr Anne Rainsberry, said: ""Patients are at the heart of the NHS and we can only apologise to the thousands of people facing disruption and uncertainty as a result of this ongoing action."" The Department of Health called the strike ""irresponsible and disproportionate"".  Among those striking in London is Jeeves Wijesuriya, a junior GP, who told Sky News that the new contract ""takes what we already have in a national recruitment crisis and turns that into a national disaster"". He added: ""In so many areas, we struggle to recruit...what this does is actually undermine our ability to keep those staff and make those staff go into those areas."" Dr Johann Malawana from the BMA said doctors had been ""left with no choice"".     ""We want a contract that is fair for all junior doctors - not one which the Government has admitted will disadvantage women - and ensures that they feel valued and motivated so that the NHS can retain the GPs and hospital doctors of the future."" A Department of Health spokesman said the new contracts are ""a huge step forward for achieving fairness for all trainee doctors"". ""For the first time junior doctors will be paid and rewarded solely on the basis of their own hard work and achievement. ""It's worth remembering that 90% of this contract was agreed with the BMA and, as the BMA's own lawyers have advised, nothing in the new contract is discriminatory."" Strikes planned for 26 and 27 April will see the full withdrawal of labour by junior doctors between the hours of 8am and 5pm. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is facing a second legal challenge - from NHS staff campaign group Just Health - to try to block the imposition of the contract."

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has previously refused to apologise to the 92-year-old, whose home was raided while he ate breakfast with his terminally ill wife. He and Assistant Commissioner Patricia Gallan met privately with Lord Bramall on Thursday and listened to his concerns about the investigation. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement Sir Bernard also expressed regret about the ""impact of having his innocence publicly called into question after a long career of public service"". ""The Commissioner listened to Lord Bramall's concerns about the investigation, which will be considered as part of the independent review announced by the Metropolitan Police Service on Wednesday, February 10,"" the statement added. Controversy erupted in January when Lord Bramall was told he would not face any action over historical abuse claims almost nine months after he was interviewed under caution as part of Operation Midland. After he was cleared, Sir Bernard and the Met came under pressure to say sorry to the former head of the Army. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner expressed ""regret"" but refused to apologise during an appearance in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee in February. A statement issued on behalf of Lord Bramall after the meeting described it as ""useful"" and ""constructive"". ""The Commissioner expressed deep regret at the great distress that had been caused to Lord Bramall and his family by the circumstances of Operation Midland which as an innocent man Lord Bramall had to endure for 10 months,"" it said. ""The Commissioner further assured Lord Bramall that the Metropolitan Police Service would be taking the urgent steps to implement the recommendations of the independent review led by Sir Richard Henriques. ""Lord Bramall looks forward to contributing to this review with the aim of establishing whether the investigation could or should have been handled differently. ""Lord Bramall accepts these assurances and appreciates the great pressure the Metropolitan Police have been under."" Sir Bernard has asked Sir Richard to examine the way historical sexual allegations against public figures are investigated. The key findings of the review and the recommendations will be published later this year."
2016-04-09,Police investigating the Brussels attacks are trying to find out if a terror suspect arrested in the Belgian capital is the 'man in the hat' who escaped after the airport bombings.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160409213037/http://news.sky.com/story/1675164/brussels-arrest-could-be-linked-to-man-in-hat,"Police investigating the Brussels attacks are trying to find out if a terror suspect arrested in the Belgian capital is the 'man in the hat' who escaped after the airport bombings. Mohamed Abrini, one of Europe's most wanted men, was the last suspect on the run in connection with last November's shootings and bombings in Paris. He was thought to be the fugitive Brussels airport attacker pictured on CCTV with the two suicide bombers in the departure hall before the blasts, according to French officials. But Belgian authorities said they could not confirm this and the inquiry was still under way as they arrested five people in the city. Abrini (L) and Abdeslam at a petrol station before the Paris attacks ""We are investigating if Abrini can be identified as the third person at the Brussels national airport, the so-called man with the hat,"" said prosecutor Eric Van der Sypt. Abrini's DNA was found in a flat in the Schaarbeek area of the city where airport bombers Ibrahim El Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui left from before they detonated their explosives, say prosecutors. They added his fingerprints were also discovered in a Renault Clio used in the Paris attacks. Abrini was believed to have visited Birmingham a number of times last year, where he met several men suspected of terrorist activity. :: CCTV Footage Of 'Man In The Hat' Mobile phone footage has captured the moment a man believed to be Abrini was arrested in Brussels. In the video - taken by a bystander - the suspect was seen lying face down before being dragged into a car by security forces. Abrini was arrested with two other unnamed people in the operation linked to last month's suicide bombings, which killed 32 people at Zaventem airport and a metro station. Two others were arrested elsewhere in Brussels, including Osama Kraiem who prosecutors say was caught on CCTV at a shopping centre buying the suitcases used in the airport blasts. Authorities are checking whether Kraiem could have been with bomber Khalid El Bakraoui at a metro station before the latter blew himself up on a train. Another man detained has been named as Herve BM. The 'man in the hat' escaped after the airport blasts and a unexploded bomb was found at the site. Abrini, 31, who is a Belgian of Moroccan origin, was arrested in the Anderlecht district of Brussels. The area was home to several other suspects linked to the attacks in Brussels and Paris. Europol said Abrini was filmed two days before the Paris atrocities in November at a petrol station with another suspect, Salah Abdeslam, on the road to the French capital. He later disappeared and was described by Europol as armed and dangerous. Abdeslam was detained last month, a few days before the Brussels attacks, and is now awaiting extradition to France. His lawyer said he had intended to blow himself up in Paris but backed out at the last minute."
2016-04-09,The teenage daughter of Fast & Furious actor Paul Walker has been awarded a $10.1m (£7.15m) settlement from the estate of the man who was behind the wheel of the Porsche in which both men died.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160409213037/http://news.sky.com/story/1675416/paul-walkers-daughter-wins-10-1m-settlement,"The teenage daughter of Fast & Furious actor Paul Walker has been awarded a $10.1m (£7.15m) settlement from the estate of the man who was behind the wheel of the Porsche in which both men died. Walker was a passenger in the Porsche Carrera GT driven by his friend Roger Rodas when the vehicle, travelling between 80-93mph, crashed into trees and burst into flames in Santa Clarita, northwest of Los Angeles, in November 2013. Meadow Walker's attorney, Jeff Milam, said in a statement that the settlement would go into a trust for the 17-year-old. ""The amount paid by the estate of Roger Rodas into a trust for Meadow Walker only covers a fraction of what her father would have earned as an international movie star had his life not tragically been cut short,"" Mr Milam said. Roger Rodas (L) and his widow, Kristine Rodas According to Mr Milam's statement, Mr Rodas was only partially responsible for the crash. Lawyers for Mr Rodas' estate could not immediately be reached for comment. Gallery: In Pictures: Paul Walker Paul Walker appeared in adverts as a child before hitting the big time with The Fast and the Furious in 2001 The settlement was reached in November 2014 but remained undisclosed until now. Mr Milam said his client was continuing her lawsuit against Porsche AG and that she ""intends to hold the company responsible for producing a vehicle that was defective and caused Paul Walker's death"". Meadow, the actor's only child and sole heir, filed the complaint against the German carmaker last September, accusing it of skimping on safety features that could have prevented the crash or at least kept him alive. Porsche has maintained that the actor was responsible for his own death. After a four-month investigation, Los Angeles officials said the crash was caused by excessive speed, not mechanical failure. Mr Milam said Walker survived the impact of the crash, but ""burned to death because of Porsche's defective design"". A federal judge presiding over a similar lawsuit filed by Mr Rodas' estate against Porsche ruled in favour of the car company on Monday, saying: ""The plaintiff has provided no competent evidence that Rodas' death occurred as a result of any wrongdoing on the part of defendant."" Walker's death at the age of 40 led to a lull in production of the seventh episode of the Fast & Furious franchise - the action series about illegal street racing that propelled his career. The 2015 film grossed more than $1.5bn (£1bn) worldwide, making it among the highest-earning films of all time."

Ayeeshia, known as AJ, died from a heart laceration and her injuries were said to have been caused by being stamped on at the family home in Burton-upon-Trent in Staffordshire on 1 May, 2014. Doctors said it was the type of injury usually only seen in crash victims or in a person who has fallen from a height. A post-mortem examination showed a catalogue of other injuries the prosecution claimed were deliberately inflicted but apparently went unnoticed by doctors and social services. The toddler was found to have suffered a bleed on the brain in the months before her death, linked to an incident in February 2014 when she was admitted to hospital after collapsing. Police mugshots of Kathryn Smith and Matthew Rigby Three weeks before Ayeeshia died, Derbyshire social services had discussed taking the youngster into care over concerns Smith, 23, was a victim of domestic abuse, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The child's stepfather Matthew Rigby, 22, was also found guilty of causing or allowing her death. However, he was cleared of her murder. In a police interview, Rigby gave his version of what had happened on the day the toddler died. He said he was outside tidying the garden while Smith was in the kitchen that afternoon. Ayeeshia had been on the sofa watching TV but had taken herself to bed, which he told detectives was ""strange"". After he finished gardening, he said he heard the child cry,  so the couple went to her bedroom where the girl was lying apparently lifeless in her cot. Rigby said he attempted CPR while Smith dialled 999. He claimed the child's broken ribs may have been sustained during his attempts to revive her and told police he ""never raised a hand"" to the child. Gallery: Ayeeshia Jane Smith Murder Trial Kathryn Smith (right) arriving at court. She has been found guilty of murdering her 21-month-old daughter Ayeeshia Speaking after the verdicts, Detective Inspector Andy Maxfield from Staffordshire Police said Smith and Rigby were ""evasive"" and ""obstructive"" at the hospital and told a ""catalogue of lies"". The court heard Smith told a health visitor in 2013 that she was a ""crap mother"". The nurse said the mother was ""young and vulnerable"". Ayeeshia had briefly been in foster care but was discharged back to her mother in October 2013. Wendy Bounds, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""We all recognise the responsibility and duty that rests with parents and those having the care of children to love, protect and nurture them.  ""No child should suffer at the hands of those who should be caring for her; no child should be the victim of broken bones or serious injury caused by violent assault by those caring for her. ""That is precisely what happened to AJ in the eight months or so leading up to her death.  ""Today, a measure of justice has been obtained for AJ, but sadly this cannot bring her back and our thoughts go out to her family at this time."" A serious case review will examine ""new information"" which has emerged from the criminal trial. Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Board's interim chair, Andrew Stokes, said: ""All the agencies involved with the family have contributed to a serious case review which has been held to identify any lessons that can be learned. ""New information has emerged during the criminal trial which we need to consider before we can publish the findings of the review to ensure it is as robust and fully informed as possible."""

Jonathan Mather, 36, was found hiding in bushes near the track at Clay Mills, near Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. The CrossCountry train, carrying 40 people, was travelling at 100mph, but the driver spotted the car and managed to slam on the brakes and reduce his speed to 70mph before hitting the Vauxhall Insignia. No-one was injured in the crash in July, but it cost the rail industry more than £650,000 in delays, compensation and damage to the tracks and train, Stafford Crown Court heard. The train hit the Vauxhall Insignia at 70mph Mather, from Derby, drove his car more than 200 yards down the track before leaving it across the rails and running off. Detective Sergeant Shanie Erwin, from British Transport Police, said: ""When officers and other emergency service colleagues arrived at the scene the area was searched and Mather was discovered hiding in a bush nearby. ""Mather claimed to have had an episode of memory loss as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, however he was fully assessed by an independent mental health team and deemed fit to be interviewed by police and prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service. ""I cannot emphasise the seriousness of his actions. The train could have easily derailed after striking his vehicle at such a speed, and everyone on board could have been seriously injured or killed."" Mather, a convicted conman, pleaded guilty to obstructing the railway at an earlier hearing. In 2014, he was ordered to repay £5,000 to a vulnerable widow after befriending her and conning her out of £13,000. He was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years."

Charles Walker defended David Cameron after he admitted he made money from an offshore fund, sparking calls for him to step down. The Prime Minister said he did not have ""anything to hide"" and promised to publish his own tax returns ""in the coming weeks"". However, Mr Walker told Sky News it was a ""ridiculous notion"" that politicians should have to make details of their finances public, and said ""people should be careful what they wish for"". ""If the Prime Minister starts publishing his tax returns, sooner or later all members of Parliament will publish their tax returns - be required to - and the public will say 'hoorah',"" he said. ""But once all members of Parliament are publishing their tax returns they may well decide that everybody, everybody who pays tax, should publish their tax returns, and people may not feel so comfortable about that, so I would just urge a little bit of caution."" Asked by Sky's Kay Burley if he would publish his own finances, he said: ""I've no intention of publishing my tax return. ""But I tell you what if we do publish tax returns - because people say 'nothing to fear, nothing to hide' - I'll bring forward a Private Member's Bill in Parliament to ban curtains from people's homes on the same basis, nothing to fear, nothing to hide. ""Why should I have my right to look into someone's home impinged by a curtain?"""

The Most Rev Justin Welby, who thought his father was Gavin Welby, recently discovered his biological father is in fact the late Sir Anthony Montague Browne. A DNA test showed a 99.9779% probability they were father and son. Mr Welby decided to take the test after The Daily Telegraph spoke to Lady Montague Browne, Sir Anthony's widow, who said she had been aware her husband may have had another child. She said she noticed a resemblance between her husband and the Archbishop after she saw Mr Welby on television. The Archbishop said his experience is ""typical"" of many people, adding: ""To find that one's father is other than imagined is not unusual."" In a statement, Mr Welby added: ""This revelation has, of course, been a surprise, but in my life and in our marriage Caroline and I have had far worse. ""I know that I find who I am in Jesus Christ, not in genetics, and my identity in him never changes. ""Even more importantly my role as Archbishop makes me constantly aware of the real and genuine pain and suffering of many around the world, which should be the main focus of our prayers."" Mr Welby said his mother Jane Williams and Gavin Welby were both alcoholics, adding his mother had been in recovery since 1968, and had not touched alcohol for almost 50 years. Gavin Welby, a whisky salesman, died ""as a result of the alcohol and smoking"" in 1977 when Mr Welby was 21. ""As a result of my parents' addictions my early life was messy, although I had the blessing and gift of a wonderful education, and was cared for deeply by my grandmother, my mother once she was in recovery, and my father (Gavin Welby) as far as he was able,"" Mr Welby said. The Rt Rev Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, told Sky News that Mr Welby was ""astonishingly calm"" when he heard the news. ""His first concern was for his mother - for whom it was also a great surprise. The Archbishop is intrigued to discover all of this, but it's not altered his sense of who he is. He's the same person as he was three weeks ago,"" Mr James added. Lady Williams said the news had come as an ""almost unbelievable shock"" as her son was born almost nine months to the day after she married Gavin Welby in the US in 1955. She said her then-husband was putting pressure on her to leave her job as personal secretary to the Prime Minister and run away with him at the age of 25. In a statement she said: ""One feature of this pressure is that I was already drinking heavily at times.  ""Although my recollection of events is patchy, I now recognise that during the days leading up to my very sudden marriage, and fuelled by a large amount of alcohol on both sides, I went to bed with Anthony Montague Browne. ""It appears that the precautions taken at the time didn’t work and my wonderful son was conceived as a result of this liaison."" Lady Williams said she saw Sir Anthony occasionally after her marriage to Gavin Welby broke up in 1958, but that he gave no hints he might have thought he was the Archbishop's father. Sir Anthony died in 2013."

The 66-year-old said he and the E Street Band were calling off Sunday's performance in Greensboro to ""show solidarity for those freedom fighters"" who oppose the legislation. The HB2 law requires transgender people to use public bathrooms that match their birth gender. ""Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry is one of them,"" said the Born in the USA singer in a statement on Twitter. Earlier this week, PayPal dropped plans to build a new operations centre in Charlotte, which would have employed some 400 skilled workers, because of the law. Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band’s April 10th show is canceled. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase. https://t.co/YahXTKffvV The state's Republican Governor Pat McCrory signed the measure on 23 March. It overturned a Charlotte city ordinance that allowed transgender people to use public toilets that matched their gender identities. State Republican lawmakers warned the ""radical"" Charlotte measure would have allowed predators to enter women's bathrooms. Critics decried the governor's move as an attack on the LGBT community. Google, Apple, IBM and American Airlines are among other companies that have condemned the law. It is one of a series of socially conservative measures passed or considered by Republican state lawmakers recently. Tennessee is proposing similar legislation to the North Carolina law. Mississippi provoked outcry this week by enacting a ""religious freedom"" law that allows businesses to refuse service to gay couples. Missouri is also considering a religious liberties bill, but governors in Georgia and South Dakota have vetoed such proposals."
2016-04-09,Survivors of a notorious Belfast children's home have vowed to fight a court decision that has blocked their attempts to be incorporated into the Goddard Inquiry.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160409213037/http://news.sky.com/story/1675361/kincora-survivors-fight-exclusion-from-inquiry,"By Tom Parmenter, Sky News Correspondent Survivors of a notorious Belfast children's home have vowed to fight a court decision that has blocked their attempts to be incorporated into the Goddard Inquiry. Currently the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is limited to examining what happened to children at institutions in England and Wales. A separate inquiry centred on Northern Ireland - the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry - will examine Kincora but survivors of the home had argued it doesn't have the powers needed to uncover the truth. Dozens of children were sexually abused at Kincora in east Belfast through the 60s and 70s by staff and visitors - one survivor has described being trafficked to London to be further abused by VIPs linked to Westminster. Kincora boys' home in Belfast Former resident Richard Kerr, who now lives in the US, has previously revealed how he was taken to the Dolphin Square apartment complex and Elm Guest House in Barnes - locations in London that have been linked to other sexual abuse investigations. Speaking after the hearing in Belfast, Mr Kerr said: ""I know 100% that the intelligence services were involved in Kincora, I know it, I lived it, I know what went on there. ""There are a lot of secrets to come out. They are just trying to put a lid on it so that it doesn't come out."" Along with other survivors he has vowed to keep on fighting for full disclosure of what happened. He said: ""I am not going to let those boys be let down who took their lives. I haven't forgotten them. ""It is not about winning, it is about justice - I'll do what it takes."" Former Kincora resident Richard Kerr speaking after the hearing In court, Mr Justice Treacy ruled that the application made by survivors was ""misconceived and premature"" and said the inquiry in Northern Ireland should be allowed to do its work. He said: ""The HIA Inquiry has made plain that if there is any attempt to frustrate its work it will not hesitate to say so, it will then endeavour to obtain whatever powers it considers necessary to resolve the matter."" Former British Army intelligence officer Colin Wallace is one of many who believe the Goddard Inquiry is the only forum in which the true extent of the abuse at Kincora can be fully understood. Mr Wallace became suspicious about what was happening at the home while he was serving with the military in Northern Ireland. He was wrongly convicted and jailed in 1981 after raising concerns about Kincora, underlining his suspicions that there was a campaign to discredit him. He told Sky News: ""It could be that initially there was some low-level cover up and then as people became more aware of who was involved ... that it became almost a conveyor belt of cover up that there was never a good time to get off that conveyor belt and put hands up and say 'we got it wrong'."""

Robert O'Neill was found by police asleep in a car parked at a convenience store in his Montana hometown. Customers at the store called police to report a sleeping man behind the wheel of the running car around 2.30am, Butte-Silver Bow County Undersheriff George Skuletich said. An officer woke up the man, identified him as O'Neill and noticed odd behaviour. He denied drinking and gave different stories about where he had been, Undersheriff Skuletich said. Bin Laden was killed at his hideout in Pakistan in 2011 O'Neill then failed a sobriety test at the scene and refused another test to find out his blood alcohol level, police said. He was charged with driving under the influence, a misdemeanour. O'Neill was released after posting a $685 bond, jail records show. It is the first time he has been arrested. It is not clear whether he has hired an attorney. O'Neill said in a statement released through a public relations firm that he took a prescribed sleep aid to help him with severe insomnia. He added he is innocent of the charge and will plead not guilty. O'Neill also thanked officers for their professionalism and courtesy. O'Neill first began publicly discussing his role in the 2011 raid that killed Bin Laden two years ago. He told the Associated Press the American public had a right to know more details about the operation. Pentagon officials have previously said it is not clear whose shots killed Bin Laden."
2016-04-09,The Government's controversial pro-EU leaflet will soon be winging its way to 27 million letterboxes around the UK - so it could have a real impact on the referendum.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160409213037/http://news.sky.com/story/1674414/whats-in-the-eu-leaflet-and-is-it-true,"The Government's controversial pro-EU leaflet will soon be winging its way to 27 million letterboxes around the UK - so it could have a real impact on the referendum. But do the claims in the hotly-disputed document stack up? Here, our Political Editor Faisal Islam unpicks six key passages. :: ""The UK has secured a special status in a reformed EU"" ""Special status"" is a central achievement claimed by the Government of David Cameron's nine-month renegotiation and the deal struck in Brussels in February. It is a subjective and not a legal description. Helpfully, other EU leaders including Presidents Tusk and Juncker have used the term to describe Britain's position, but it was not part of the text of the final deal. The PM is referring, though, not just to his new safeguards, but principally to long-standing British opt-outs of the Eurozone and border-free Schengen area. As a whole the UK does have a unique role in the EU. The process of reform in the EU though, is very much a work in progress. :: ""Remaining inside the EU guarantees our full access to Single Market. By contrast, leaving creates risk and uncertainty"" This is true. The Leave campaigns have not disputed that full access to the Single Market could be disrupted. The German finance minister has backed this up, as has the French President. Yes, Britain would get some sort of trade deal, perhaps free trade in goods, but what about services, which comprise the vast bulk of the UK economy? A common thread of various slightly different Leave positions is, in fact, that overall the Single Market is a bad thing, because the regulatory costs outweigh the trade benefits. Leave campaigners would also contend that there is ""risk and uncertainty"" from staying in the Single Market. Worth noting that the Single Market was in fact a British creation, the brainchild of Lord Arthur Cockfield. :: ""If the UK voted to leave the EU, the resulting economic shock would put pressure on the pound, which would risk higher prices of some household goods"" Many things impact upon the value of the pound, from government borrowing, to bank stability, to opinion polls. Leave campaigners will point to actual EU policy on, for example, protecting farming, which has artificially inflated food prices, and led to extra tariffs for many goods imported into the EU. A lower pound, though, could increase the prices of imports. Sterling has slumped 8.5% against the dollar and 11.6% versus the euro since October. Brexit fears are a part, though not all of that - a record current account deficit, property crash concerns and differences in interest rates are also large factors. :: ""Over the last decade, foreign companies have invested £540bn in the UK, equivalent to £148m every day"" As facts go, this is true, but it is at most tangentially relevant to the EU debate. This is all of the foreign investment into the UK from across the world. Some of it is helped by EU membership, perhaps, but no one could argue it was all or even half at stake. Perhaps a fraction. A staunch Leave supporter would argue that number would be even higher outside the EU. :: ""The Government has negotiated a deal that will make our benefit system less of a draw for EU citizens"" The question here is really ""how much less of a draw?"". Independent experts question if the deal will have much of an impact on immigration, even as child benefits and tax credits are limited to some EU migrants. The Office for Budget Responsibility says it expects ""not much"" impact on migration. Indeed the biggest draw into the UK was always the number of available jobs. The new national living wage seems likely to increase the incentive for EU migrants to come as much, perhaps more than the restrictions on benefits. Separately, it is still unclear what the final form of the tax credit restrictions will be, as they are subject to European Parliament votes and negotiation. :: ""A vote to leave could mean a decade or more of uncertainty"" It could, or it could not. The Government calculation is based on a two-year Article 50 EU exit process, followed by a renegotiation of a trade deal with the remaining European Union members. At the same time, there would then be UK trade deals having to be struck with other non-EU nations. Alternatively, the EU members could take a pragmatic approach, and help the UK inherit most of the existing arrangements, and strike a clear free trade deal in lieu of UK membership. There's no real precedent for this. The Leave campaign cites Greenland leaving the EU taking three years, and free trade deals between the US and Australia and Switzerland and China, taking two. A UK disentanglement from the EU and reattachment to the world trading system would appear to be rather more complicated."
2016-04-09,A paedophile who kidnapped and raped an 11-year-old girl after grabbing her off the street has been jailed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160409213037/http://news.sky.com/story/1675125/nightmare-rapist-who-snatched-girl-is-jailed,"A paedophile who kidnapped and raped an 11-year-old girl after grabbing her off the street has been jailed. Paul Ripley, 53, abducted the youngster in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, on a winter's night last year, Chester Crown Court heard. He bundled her into his car, then drove her hundreds of miles, before raping her twice in a field, after wrapping duct tape over her eyes and mouth.  Jailing him, a judge described Ripley as the ""living embodiment of every parent's worst nightmare"". The court was told how the girl was near her house walking from a friend's home at around 7pm, on 7 November last year, when Ripley struck. A witness heard a girl scream and a car drive off at speed, after Ripley had bundled his victim into the vehicle.  As her frantic parents searched the streets and called police, Ripley drove the girl hundreds of miles north, before pulling into a field. There he raped her twice before abandoning her in a village near Darlington, County Durham, in the early hours of the morning. She flagged a passing taxi down, telling the driver: ""I don't know where I am. I've been raped..."" But police were able to trace Ripley's Hyundai car as it drove back to Cheshire, arresting him on the M6 in Lancashire, within hours. The defendant's DNA was recovered from the girl and Ripley admitted two counts of rape, kidnap and dangerous driving. He has been given an extended sentence on licence, meaning he will serve between 10 and 16 years in jail. He will then be on parole depending on an assessment of his dangerousness and be on licence under supervision for 24 years in all. Ripley, originally from the Darlington area but living in Ellesmere Port at the time, showed no emotion as he was sentenced. The girl is still undergoing counselling. In a statement to the court, her mother said: ""I can only imagine what my daughter went through that night. ""The pain, confusion, panic and fear. ""What that man did to her that night has changed her and changed me forever. ""I can't and never will understand what drives a human being to do what he did. ""The thought is disgusting, it makes my skin crawl."" Judge Nicholas Woodward told him: ""This must have been a harrowing ordeal where you specifically targeted a vulnerable child for your own sexual gratification. ""Children's freedom in modern society is affected by the concern caused by people like you ... In short, you are the living embodiment of every parent's worst nightmare."""

The booms were described by some on the ground as ""huge explosions"" - with fire crews even being sent out to investigate the area around Northampton and Brackley. They were told to stand down after it was confirmed the noise was caused by the jets speeding over the area. Some locals posted on social media, worried about the cause of the booms, with Linda Sgoluppi tweeting: ""Anyone know what the almighty bang about 15 minutes ago was over Northampton area? #Bang."" Laura later posted: ""Here's me blaming the boiler when it was a sonic boom the first time around"". Anyone know what the almighty bang about 15 minutes ago was over Northampton area? #Bang :: Jets Caused Sonic Booms Mistaken For Earthquakes A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""Quick reaction alert Typhoon aircraft were launched today from RAF Coningsby to identify an unresponsive civilian aircraft.

Ratan Tata, who retired aged 75 in 2012, was group chairman when its steel business snapped up Corus in 2007 - taking control of plants including the sprawling Port Talbot steelworks now threatened by Tata's decision to exit steel in Britain. Mr Tata told a conference in Washington cuts would be necessary to make Port Talbot profitable, saying the ""bottom just opened up"" in the UK amid a flood of cheap steel from China that has saturated the market and hit jobs worldwide. The slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy, has led to massive overproduction - with the Beijing authorities predicting 500,000 of its own steel jobs will be lost in the coming years. Price is the key factor - with producers in China losing an estimated $15.5bn (£11bn) last year. Port Talbot is said to be losing £1m daily. World export prices have plummeted from an all time high of $1,113 per metric tonne in July 2008 to just $321 last month, according to the website steelbenchmarker.com - mostly a result of the Chinese glut. ""Right now, the problem is that the (UK) facilities are underinvested (and) overmanned,"" Mr Tata said, according to the Financial Times. He added that a potential buyer at Port Talbot would need to cut back on the size and the scale of the operations to make it profitable, adding that this would be ""extremely challenging"". Some 40,000 jobs linked to the UK steel industry are at risk if Tata pulls out of Britain. It is hoped that a deal is imminent to save the Scunthorpe operation, with Greybull Capital asking workers to accept a cut to pay and pension contributions if it is to take the business on. On Friday, Liberty House took control of two mothballed Tata mills in Lanarkshire following a buyout hailed by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a demonstration of the ""art of the possible."" The international metals firm hopes to restart work in August and has also indicated interest in purchasing Port Talbot and other Tata operations. Its owner, Sanjeev Gupta, has spoken of a desire to save jobs with the potential to remodel Port Talbot as a producer of steel through the use of electric arc furnaces - to take advantage of recycling opportunities. But top of his list of concerns are high energy costs in the UK, which he told Sky News this week would have to be ""rectified"" by the Government. He also warned there would be no quick-fix, overnight solution. Mr Gupta said: ""There are issues to resolve which will become more apparent as prospective buyers do their due diligence. ""As they do we hope there will be an equitable solution for the industry."""

Students at Saint Kentigern College in Auckland were performing the opening night of the musical when the mishap happened. Headteacher Steve Cole told radio station Newstalk ZB the razor used on stage was real, but had been bound in duct tape. He said he had no idea what went wrong. ""It had been bound in Cellophane, bound in all sorts of things,"" he said. Johnny Depp in the 2007 film version of the musical ""It was very non-sharp, blunted, and had been through all sorts of health and safety checks. It was a very unfortunate mishap."" The two 16-year-olds were rushed to hospital for treatment - one with serious, and the other with moderate injuries. They were released the next day and are said to be recovering. Mr Cole said he hoped the show would resume on Friday, ""obviously without those particular props"".

About two-and-a-half minutes after Friday afternoon's liftoff from Cape Canaveral in Florida the main part of the two-stage booster separated. The Falcon 9 craft turned around and headed toward a so-called drone ship - named Of Course I Still Love You - in the Atlantic Ocean, neatly accomplishing a vertical landing. The company said the achievement marks a historic first in the effort to make rockets recyclable and deliver cheaper, more accessible space travel. SpaceX mission control in Hawthorne, California, erupted in cheers and chants of ""USA"" as the rocket stood upright on the barge about eight minutes after launch. 1st stage has landed on Of Course I Still Love You https://t.co/tdni53IviI The unmanned Falcon spaceship was launched to carry supplies and a futuristic inflatable living quarters to the International Space Station. The Dragon capsule and its 7,000lb (3,175kg) cargo of food, equipment and science experiments is expected to reach the 260-mile-high space station by Sunday. SpaceX is run by Elon Musk - the billionaire founder of Tesla electric cars. Four previous at-sea landing bids have failed.  SpaceX did manage a ground-based landing for its rocket in December. That marked the first time a rocket ascended into orbit and landed back on Earth. Friday's double triumph also means the company has resumed space station deliveries for NASA. The company's last attempt in June 2015 ended in flames after just two minutes. That unmanned craft was doomed by a snapped strut in the oxygen tank of the upper stage. Rocket boosters are usually jettisoned after a couple of minutes and land in the sea where they are recovered and eventually refurbished - a costly and time-consuming process."

A photo posted on Snapchat shows an apparent version of beer pong with plastic cups arranged in the shapes of a swastika and a Star of David. Several young men are seen standing round the table with cans of Coors Light. The image allegedly shows Princeton High School students playing ""Holocaust Pong"" or ""Alcoholocaust"". Beer pong is a popular game on college campuses According to rules of the game posted online, the team of ""Jews"" receives an ""Anne Frank"" cup that they can hide anywhere in the room. The team of ""Nazis"" has the ability to ""Auschwitz"" one of their opponents, forcing him to sit out. Gallery: 2015 - Holocaust Survivors Mark Auschwitz Liberation About 300 Holocaust survivors gathered to mark 70 years since Soviet troops liberated the Auschwitz death camp Jamaica Ponder, a 17-year-old student who blogged about the photo, told NJ.com the students were her classmates. Ms Ponder blogged: ""Well, perhaps it is a joke. But then I guess the punchline would be: genocide. Pardon me if I don't find that to be hilarious."" She added: ""They must be trapped in the delusional mindset that making a drinking game based off of the Holocaust is cool. Or funny. ""Or anything besides insane. Because that's what this is: insanity. I'm not even Jewish and I'm still offended."" The Princeton Police Department said on Friday it had started an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo. Princeton Superintendent Steve Cochrane said he's outraged that students played a drinking game with ""clearly anti-Semitic"" overtones."
2016-04-09,Ten men who committed sexual offences against young girls in Rochdale have been jailed - with a judge sentencing them to more than 125 years behind bars.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160409213037/http://news.sky.com/story/1675112/rochdale-ring-jailed-for-abusing-young-girls,"Ten men who committed sexual offences against young girls in Rochdale have been jailed - with a judge sentencing them to more than 125 years behind bars. Their convictions relate to crimes against eight people who were aged between 13 and 23 at the time. A massive investigation into the gang began when one of their teenage victims walked into a police station. She told detectives that she had been repeatedly groomed by the group from the age of 14, and said ""hundreds"" of men would ring her up for sex. That victim, who was white and had learning difficulties, was described as an ""extremely vulnerable young woman"" who had endured a ""very difficult home life"" in the Greater Manchester town. Her statement prompted seven other complainants to come forward and give evidence during two trials which led to the convictions of the defendants, many of whom are of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage. Afraz Ahmed, 33, was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment after being found guilty of various sexual offences against five underage victims, including rape and sexual activity with a child. A 40-year-old man, who cannot be named, was jailed for 23 years after being convicted of rape and attempting to abduct a child. His crimes affected three victims, and he will be forced to serve a further eight years on extended licence upon release. One of the men, Choudry Ikhalaq Hussein, was sentenced in his absence to 19 years for rape, conspiracy to rape and sexual activity with a child. The 38-year-old is believed to have absconded to Pakistan as the trial took place. Six others - Rehan Ali, Kutab Miah, Abid Khan, Mohammed Zahid, Mohammed Dauood and David Law - also received custodial sentences at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court. A tenth man, Mahfuz Rahman, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to three counts of sexual activity with a child, and was subsequently jailed for five-and-a-half years last September. Most of their offences took place between 2004 and 2008. Following the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Jamie Daniels of Greater Manchester Police said: ""This was an extremely complex case and I want to commend the victims for the immense bravery they have shown - only with their support have we arrived at this point. ""The process can be emotionally demanding and traumatic for the victims and we do not underestimate the courage this took. ""Child sexual exploitation is more than a criminal issue - it is a social problem that we are working closely with our partners to tackle on many levels … these are victim-led investigations and care of those victims is of paramount importance."""
2016-04-09,"Finally, after five days and five statements, the Prime Minister has admitted that he did have a £30,000 investment in a fund mentioned in the Panama Papers, established by his late father.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160409213037/http://news.sky.com/story/1674737/pm-evaded-question-but-has-not-avoided-damage,"Finally, after five days and five statements, the Prime Minister has admitted that he did have a £30,000 investment in a fund mentioned in the Panama Papers, established by his late father. The Number 10 case is this: that the Blairmore fund was not a tax avoidance vehicle, even though the fund itself bypassed UK taxes. Its structure was aimed at investing in dollar shares from Panama. And yet when I asked him on Tuesday specifically what he has now answered, he dodged the question. I asked him: ""Can you clarify for the record that you and your family have not derived any benefit in the past and will not in the future from the offshore Blairmore Holdings fund mentioned in the Panama Papers?"" Mr Cameron replied: ""The two things I'm responsible for are my own financial affairs and for the tax system of the United Kingdom. In terms of my own financial affairs, I own no shares, I have a salary as Prime Minister and I have some savings which I get some interest from and I have a house which we used to live in, which we now let out while we're living in Downing Street. And that's all I have. I have no shares, no offshore trusts, no offshore funds, nothing like that. And so that I think is a very clear description."" That reply qualifies as evasion at the very best, given the answer he decided to give some 48 hours later. Did the Prime Minister do anything wrong? He says all appropriate taxes have and were paid on the sale of his shares in the trust in 2010, a few months before becoming PM. Number 10 cites the views of leading tax avoidance expert Graham Aaronson QC, that this was a means by which Ian Cameron invested in dollar shares, rather than tax avoidance. Mr Aaronson advised Mr Cameron and George Osborne on the establishment of the GAAR anti-avoidance rule under the Coalition. Another Labour supporting QC and tax expert, Jolyon Maugham, has backed that view, but says there are still questions around the Panama-based fund's use of anonymous bearer shares. Furthermore, there are also questions about the PM's inheritance of £300,000 from his father. Mr Cameron does not rule out the possibility that some of that money benefited from legal offshore tax avoidance. This is the issue for the PM. He himself created an arbitrary category of ""morally wrong"" though entirely legal tax avoidance, when talking about the tax affairs of certain celebrities. That test is subjective. The combination of that with the piecemeal, evasive response to the Panama Papers release has undoubtedly damaged him. On Tuesday, Number 10 even invited journalists and politicians to ""put up or shut up"". That it has happened when he wants the entire nation to trust his judgement on the EU referendum is almost the worst possible timing. Even before his admission, Brexit-supporting members of his own Government were pointing out in unsolicited contacts with journalists that Number 10 was issuing ""very precisely worded statements"". Trust is the currency of political leadership. Against a backdrop of a split party, a sluggishly handled steel crisis, and Budget U-turns, Mr Cameron faces a crucial few days to re-establish his authority. He may well feel the consequences of this week in the days after the EU referendum."

Britain's biggest supermarket hailed ""significant progress"" in its turnaround as it published annual results for the year to 27 February. It also reported a 0.9% rise in UK like-for-like sales for the fourth quarter, its first full quarter of growth since 2013 - as the group's recovery under Mr Lewis gathers pace. Tesco said it was continuing to cut prices to stay competitive in a ""challenging, deflationary and uncertain market"" - and warned this would slow the pace of profit improvement, particularly in the first half of the current financial year. Its share price closed almost 8% lower - bucking the trend in the wider market as the FTSE 100 rose to a fresh high for the year on the back of strong China export data that aided a surge in bank and commodity stock values. Mr Lewis, a former Unilever executive, took over a year and a half ago, after the embattled group parted company with previous boss Philip Clarke amid a ferocious supermarket price war. Soon afterwards the new boss also had to deal with the fallout from a £326m accounting scandal but the chief executive has now indicated the business is turning a corner. He said: ""We feel like we stabilised the business. We don't feel that we're in the crisis that, being candid, we were 16 months ago. More customers are buying more things more often at Tesco.  ""We have regained competitiveness in the UK with significantly better service, a simpler range, record levels of availability and lower and more stable prices."" Tesco had tumbled to a record loss in the previous year as it took big accounting write-offs on the value of its business. Latest annual results stripping out finance costs showed an operating profit of £1.05bn, up from a £5.75bn loss the year before. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: ""We believe that Dave Lewis deserves considerable credit for steering this near retail shipwreck to calmer waters."" Tesco said that during the latest financial year it had improved service by adding 9,000 ""customer-facing"" roles and reducing prices on thousands of products. The supermarket has also reviewed each of its 33 food categories, reducing the number of products by 18%, and cut the price of an average weekly shop by 3% in the last year, while introducing 2,000 new lines. A management shake-up has seen 25% of office-based roles reduced, while 60 unprofitable stores have been closed. Mr Lewis has sought to streamline the business by selling off its loss-making Blinkbox online video operation and switching its main headquarters from Cheshunt to Welwyn Garden City. It is also looking to offload businesses including garden centre chain Dobbies and restaurant business Giraffe."

The SDU is a team of officers that deal exclusively with dangerous dogs. Most of the animals are pit bull terriers that cannot be returned to their owners or rehomed. The SDU's Inspector Patrick O'Hara said: ""They are not necessarily all healthy dogs or safe dogs to have around people. Far from it in fact. ""What I can say is we have rehomed around 56 dogs this year and we won't destroy a dog without some kind of a paper trail like a disclaimer, when the dogs can't be lawfully rehomed or a court order that says it must be destroyed. ""But if a court rules that a dog is not a danger to the public and the owner is a fit and proper person then nine times out of 10 that dog goes home."" Four breeds were banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act in 1991 following a spate of horrific attacks - the pit bull terrier, Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and fila Brasileiro. The controversial piece of legislation was designed to make the ownership and breeding of the four types of dog illegal. It was hoped the breeds would die out naturally. But that has not happened. According to an undercover investigation by The Dogs Trust charity, many are smuggled in from Eastern Europe by breeders using fake pet passports. Inspector O'Hara told Sky News they have seen a 7% increase in seizures. He also said his figures show the four breeds most likely to be involved in attacks are bull types including pit bull cross breeds. These are the dogs with the strongest links to criminality, he added. It is one reason why the Status Dogs Unit also works closely with Trident, the Met's specialist team that deals with gang violence in London. Pit bull terriers are popular with gangs because the penalty for illegal dog ownership is far less severe than getting caught with a gun or a knife. That is why these dogs are also known as weapon or status dogs. Animal campaigners want to see a change in the law. Groups like DDA Watch say breed-specific legislation was a knee-jerk reaction to the problem. ""Killing healthy animals that have done nothing wrong is inhumane,"" a spokesperson said. ""Dogs should be treated on a case-by-case basis and not have its fate sealed at birth because of its breed."" Inspector O'Hara disagrees. ""It's difficult to measure the effectiveness of the legislation because you can never know the preventative effect that it has had,"" he said. ""But I think by and large it is fit for purpose and it could be enhanced with a few small tweaks."" :: Watch a special programme about dangerous dogs and the work of the Status Dogs Unit tonight at 8.30pm on Sky News."

DPRK Today published the letter in which the 16th US President gives ""a little advice"" from the grave, warning Mr Obama will be ridiculed for demanding Pyongyang scraps its nuclear weapons programme. Abraham Lincoln, who served in office for four years until his assassination in 1865, appears to deride Obama's push to build a nuclear-free world by questioning why the US has not taken the initiative to scale back its own nuclear arsenal. Obama in front of the portrait referred to in the North Korean letter ""Hey, Obama,"" it begins. ""I know you have a lot on your mind these days ... I've decided to give you a little advice after seeing you lost in thought before my portrait during a recent Easter Prayer Breakfast. ""If the United States, a country with the world's largest nuclear weapons stockpile, only pays lip service, like a parrot, and doesn't do anything actively, it will be a mockery to the entire world. ""Hey, Obama, it's the 21st Century. The tactic by past American presidents, including me, who deceived the people ... is outdated. ""That doesn't work now. The world doesn't trust an America that doesn't take responsibility for what it says."" Tensions have been on the rise since North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test in January, followed by a series of apparent ballistic missile tests. The letter comes two weeks after North Korea threatened to lay waste to Washington with a submarine-launched nuclear missile in a menacing propaganda video. The four-minute film 'Last Chance' runs through the history of US-Korea relations, including images of US prisoners of war on Korean soil. In 2014, the North's state news agency, KCNA, called Mr Obama a ""monkey."" Earlier that year, it called Secretary of State John Kerry a wolf with a ""hideous lantern jaw"" after US and South Korean troops launched summertime drills.

Philip Hammond is facing fresh calls to make a Commons statement from the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has released the latest exchange of correspondence on the issue. The row follows a visit by MPs on the committee to Egypt and Tunisia last month, during which they claimed they were told the UK was to contribute 1,000 troops to a 6,000-strong international force which would be sent to the north African country to support a new UN-backed government of national unity ""in the near future"". In his latest letter to the committee, Mr Hammond said no decisions had been made about any future deployment. He wrote: ""I have taken the precaution of checking with our embassies in Cairo and Tunis. ""They have confirmed that at no point did British diplomats brief you to this effect. Your assertions are wrong on a number of accounts."" This drew an angry response from committee chairman Crispin Blunt, who said Mr Hammond's letter was designed to be ""wholly and deliberately misleading to the uninformed reader"". The Conservative MP said: ""As you are no doubt aware given your careful choice of words, the briefing came from another British source working at the direction of the defence attache and witnessed by British diplomats."" He added: ""The Foreign Affairs Committee remains deeply concerned by potential British military involvement in Libya. ""The welcome candour of briefings by all whom we met in Cairo and Tunis contrasts sharply with your less-than-candid reply to my request for further detail on a rapidly developing situation that may require further active British engagement."" The former minister called on Mr Hammond to make a statement to the Commons ""clarifying"" the UK's current military involvement in Libya. After the release of the correspondence, Mr Blunt told Sky News: ""To start dancing around words like when is a plan not a plan, and the fact that no formal decision had been taken, therefore means Parliament shouldn't be involved in consideration of this, don't worry your little heads about it, struck me as less than candid and less than straightforward. ""The Government now has to come to Parliament to seek authority for the deployment of troops in this way."" A Foreign Office spokesman said there were no plans to deploy combat troops. He said: ""As the Foreign Secretary has made clear, the UK continues to work with international partners on how to best support the new Libyan government. This includes discussions about a Libyan International Assistance Mission. ""The Foreign Secretary has also been consistently clear that while no decisions have yet been taken, there are no plans to deploy combat troops and that planning has been focused on training Libyan security forces to provide their own security."""

According to reports, Adrian St John, who was on holiday on the island, was killed on Sunday night. The 22-year-old, who worked as a recruitment consultant in London and was a Level 2 cricket coach, had stopped his car to pick up the daughter of a female passenger when they were confronted by two men. After robbing the young cricketer he was ordered to drive off but one of the attackers opened fire, hitting him in the head, according to a report in the Trinidad Guardian. St John was due to return to the UK next Tuesday One of the women flagged down a passing police car which took Mr St John to a nearby medical centre where he died shortly after. A 24-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Adrian's uncle Ian Campbell told Sky that his nephew was a ""balanced kid looking forward to a bright future"". He said: ""I got a phone call yesterday morning from my cousin in America. He was screaming and crying and I thought my aunt had died. It turned out Adrian had been killed. ""It was a complete shock. He had passed his degree in philosophy and history and was the first in our family to get that far and we were all very proud of him. ""He was just loveable. He was the original nice guy. He was a handsome kid, he was tall and handsome and personable. It was his personality that made him do well. ""He was a balanced kid looking forward to a bright future. Cricket was a passion from an early age and he was very good at it."" West Indies star Chris Gayle reacted to the news on Twitter: ""Such sad news to hear. My condolences to his family & friends."" He said Mr St John was the captain of his academy side. In utter shock to hear that one of my good friends Adrian has passed away. One of the funniest and nicest people.... pic.twitter.com/BMCxgZrFxv One of his friends, Tommy Smith, said: ""In utter shock to hear that one of my good friends Adrian has passed away.

Rest in peace Adrian St John.""  Alleyn Cricket Club, which Mr St John has played for, write on Twitter: ""Adrian St John, who played for us 85 times from 2009 to 2014, has been murdered in Trinidad. We're devastated."" Mr St John's cousin, Leandra Alexander, said the cricketer came to Trinidad & Tobago in February for the country's annual carnival and enjoyed his visit so much he extended his stay but was scheduled to return to the UK next Tuesday.  ""Adrian was very cool and jolly,"" she said. ""He was a darling. He was never rude, never disrespectful, he was just a cool and quiet child."" A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""We are in contact with local authorities following the death of a British national in Trinidad and are ready to provide consular assistance."""
2016-04-13,The shadow boxing is nearly over. The real campaign is about to begin. Ten weeks to decide Britain’s place in Europe.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160413193724/http://news.sky.com/story/1677529/how-the-corbynites-learned-to-love-the-eu,"The shadow boxing is nearly over. The real campaign is about to begin. Ten weeks to decide Britain’s place in Europe. The Labour Party will be key to determining what happens, or rather, traditional Labour Party voters. On Sky News, the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell conceded that the Labour leadership could be doing more to help the pro-EU Remain side. He said: ""We've been up to our necks in local campaigns...and, to be frank, that's been our main focus. ""As we move forward now towards those elections and then towards the European Union referendum, you'll see us going on the stump. ""(Labour leader) Jeremy Corbyn's doing a major speech this week."" Mr McDonnell, recently a rather committed Eurosceptic member of the Campaign Group (one of 19 Labour rebels who defied the whip to vote for a referendum in 2011, alongside Jeremy Corbyn, and Gisela Stuart, now the chair of Vote Leave) cited concerns about economic uncertainty and the environment as reasons to stay in the European Union. He wants to get the Corbynite foot soldiers ""out on the stump"" campaigning to prevent Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn will make his ""big speech"" on the EU on Thursday. Only a few months ago Mr Corbyn, during the Leadership campaign, was sounding really rather sceptical about the EU. I interviewed him last July in the House of Commons alongside Tory EU sceptic Steve Baker, at the height of the Greek crisis – it was difficult to discern much difference between their views on EU democracy. After becoming Labour leader, he clearly decided that Europe was the main area for pragmatism. Among the many fits he was to have with his parliamentary party, the EU has not featured. Still, in the first few weeks it did seem that he would praise the EU with his fingers crossed behind his back. But something has changed. It is significant. The unions are mainly pro-EU. Mr Corbyn has now attended two Brussels pre-summits of the Party of European Socialists alongside centre left prime ministers and presidents. He now says, more convincingly, that he thinks that staying in the EU is the best way to connect with other European left wing forces for a more progressive reform. What started off as political expedience, now has some philosophical foundation. Mr Corbyn will share a stage with some of his fiercest party critics on the issue of the EU. We heard a flavour of that from David Miliband. He was repeatedly invited to criticise the foot-dragging of Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell over the European Union, and he declined. ""Labour is 98% united on the European question, the important thing is that we don’t take it for granted...We should let Jeremy Corbyn speak for himself on Europe,"" he said in an interview. There has been some broad coordination of a series of events from all parties in the Remain campaign, starting with David Cameron's visit to Exeter to persuade young people to turn out to vote last week. Labour MP Chuka Umunna and Tory minister Jo Johnson had a shared photo op this week. But do not expect the Labour leadership to be sharing many platforms. Labour feels it learnt its lesson from the damage done by Better Together in the Scottish referendum campaign. Brexit campaigners, meanwhile, feel Mr Corbyn's endorsement will provide opportunities for them to make their case. So the Corbynites have joined the EU referendum fray. Some leftist groups have already announced that they are for Remain, and other Labour MPs expect the Momentum grouping to help make the case for Remain. Mr Corbyn's move towards the EU is a significant development in the referendum campaign. If he can bring the core Labour support with him – it could go a long way towards settling the referendum."

Sergeant David Jennings has now been formally identified as the man who died after being hit by a lorry between junctions 29 and 28 in Essex on 31 March. Detectives believe the 48-year-old had pulled up on the hard shoulder after his car collided with the motorway's central reservation. He had got out of his car and been hit by a passing lorry. The lorry driver had stopped briefly but allegedly drove away from the scene before emergency services arrived. A 28-year-old man was arrested the next day on suspicion of causing death by careless driving. He has been bailed until July. Meanwhile, Sgt Jennings's family released a statement paying tribute to a ""devoted father, husband, brother and son who was dependable, hard-working and completed rooted to his family"". ""He was committed to his job and was loved and respected by his family and friends. ""He will be deeply missed and the world will be a darker place without him."" Chief Superintendent Bert Moore, of Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, described Sgt Jennings as a ""consummate professional who displayed all that is good about the Metropolitan Police"". ""He was my staff officer, so I saw daily the commitment he gave to the force,"" he added. ""His death will be keenly felt by his colleagues and friends and our thoughts are with his family at this time."" :: Detectives from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses to the crash, asking people to call the Roads and Transport Police on 020 8597 4874."

There have already been 107 transferred to WHSmith over the past decade. Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells said it would help secure the presence of branches on the high street, as well as bringing new investment into the network. However, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) said it was a ""kick in the teeth"" for Post Office workers. The announcement covers so-called Crown offices that are directly run by the Post Office. Roger Gale, general manager of the Crown branch network, said: ""The vast majority of the Post Office's network of 11,500 Post Office branches is already run on a franchise or agency basis."" ""Crown branches are still run by directly by the Post Office but factors such as high property costs and changing customer habits mean we have to consider new ways to provide our services in some locations."" The agreement was announced as WHSmith reported an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to £80m for the six months to the end of February. Stationery and book sales were boosted by the craze for colouring-in and activity books for adults. Overall same-store sales rose 2% with a 5% increase at travel stores - based largely at airports and railway stations – and a flat performance for WHSmith's high street network."

That’s an old-fashioned scoop every paper would jump at, you might think. So why did four national newspapers who knew about it for months and carried out various degrees of investigation – The People, The Sun, The Mail on Sunday and the Independent – decide not to run the scurrilous tale about Culture Secretary John Whittingdale. Campaigners for tighter regulation of the press smell a rat. Mr Whittingdale was not in Cabinet at the time but, as chair of the Culture Select Committee, he was a notable defender of press freedom and a critic of the Leveson Inquiry. Hacked Off's Brian Cathcart - who is now in the strange position of encouraging the papers to run a story about a politician's private life – makes the big claim that newspapers were ""getting together, not reporting this story"" because they wanted power over a Government minister and hoped to ""influence him in some way"". :: Calls For Minister To Quit Media Supervision James Cusick of The Independent, who wanted to expose how Fleet Street were ignoring the story but claims bosses then spiked his article, points out that, if the press was afraid of attacking him because he was its friend on Leveson, that would be a major conflict of interest. Of course. But newspaper hacks point to several gaping holes in the case against them. For example, Mr Whittingdale was an opponent of statutory regulation long before his six-month relationship with the woman. It's also the case that the tabloids have become much more cautious of running stories about anyone's – even a politician's – love life in recent years. A journalist at one of the newspaper groups involved explains: ""The public interest grounds for invading his privacy are pretty thin. They were both single adults, it happened before he became Culture Secretary, and he broke it off when he found out what she did for a living. ""If it had happened 10 years ago, I'm sure someone would have printed it. Although Hacked Off don't like to admit it, papers are much more wary about publishing this kind of stuff post-Leveson."" It's also worth noting that the threat of press regulation doesn't make a Culture Secretary invincible. When Mr Whittingdale's predecessor, Maria Miller, found herself in hot water over her expenses and her special adviser decided to ring the Daily Telegraph to ""flag up"" her boss's role in the Leveson discussions, the newspaper exposed it - and set off a chain of events that culminated in Mrs Miller's resignation. Labour have made this into a political row by saying that there are serious questions over whether Mr Whittingdale's private life influenced his decisions about media policy and that he should ""step aside"" from media regulation – the biggest policy area in his job. As long as critics are just dealing in suspicions and questions, Downing Street will be standing firm. But No 10 will be wondering if there is more to come out."

The survey of more than 4,000 British adults found that nearly one fifth of British women (18.1%) and eight per cent of British men say they have been stalked. And of all those who have been stalked - online and offline - only 26.6% reported it to the police Claire Waxman, the director of Voice4Victims and a victim of stalking for 12 years, told Sky News: ""The whole profile of a stalker is they have fixated obsessive behaviour, so they will try and find any which way to communicate with their victims. ""So what's happening in the digital world, it's just giving them more and more tools to use to access victims, to stalk them, to harass them and to get information which fuels their compulsion."" Rachel Griffin, director of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which carried out the survey in association with YouGov, said technology firms could do more to help. ""The unfortunate reality for a lot of people is that they feel they've really got nowhere to hide. ""We've really got to train up the police and other parts of the criminal justice system to really understand how to investigate and prosecute digital stalking. It's no longer something that can be treated as an add-on. ""Technology companies do have a responsibility, yes… They could do an awful lot more."" Facebook, Twitter and Google all declined Sky News' request for an interview, but Tech UK, the trade body that represents technology firms, said technology was only one part of the solution. Charlotte Holloway, head of policy at Tech UK, said: ""Treating this is as an online-only crime doesn’t get to the heart of the problem. ""It doesn't help the police tackle the problem and it doesn't ultimately bring victims the justice they need. ""Instead, we need to encourage the police and CPS to continue to work with tech companies on the nature of these crimes and how they're changing."""

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ""A post-mortem will be held in due course. Next of kin are in the process of being informed."" He's described the death as ""non-suspicious"". Liza Minnelli and David Gest in May 2003 The former Celebrity Big Brother star was married to Liza Minnelli from 2002-2003, but they only officially divorced in 2007. He was also known for being a close friend of the late Michael Jackson. Sad to hear that ""Uncle David"" Gest has passed. Some of my favorite childhood memories are of him & my mom ""Mickey"" bickering like siblings. In 2001, he produced a two-hour documentary entitled Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration. Following the pop star's death, he helped produce a tribute about Jackson's life. The TV personality gained a following in the UK recently when he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother. Close friend Imad Handi said in a statement: ""David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon. ""I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners. ""If I may steal the words of one eminent critic, David was a natural star and a genuine celebrity. I will miss him desperately.""

""When I got the call today, I just couldn't believe it. ""We've lost one of the most wonderful, kindest men ever."" Gest was due to go on tour again in July, with a show called David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul Tour.

Now make it worse. Worse still. Now you're approaching something close to the interviewing process for the eight unlucky candidates vying to be the new United Nations Secretary General.

Oh yes, and it's going to be broadcast live across the world. The UN flag pictured in front of the organisation's headquarters The candidates have also had to submit a 'Vision Statement' to their interviewers ahead of time, just so there's plenty of ammunition to clobber them with. As if that wasn't hard enough, there will also be some wildcard questions submitted via video by ordinary people who aren't connected to the UN. I understand this will include questions from UK school children and even indigenous groups who will want to know about a candidate's positions on issues important to them. It's enough to bring you out in a cold sweat. The current favourite for the top job is former New Zealand PM Helen Clark This process has never happened before. Previously the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - America, UK, France, Russia and China - have anointed a candidate and presented them to the rest of the UN as a done deal. But this time current UN president Mogens Lykketoft has other ideas. In a statement, his office said he has ""committed to running his presidency in the most open and transparent manner possible. ""This also applies to the process of selecting and appointing the next United Nations Secretary-General."" The P5, as they are known, will still submit a name for general approval, but not until all the candidates have been through the new process of public and rigorous scrutiny. The candidates are from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Bulgaria, the Republic of Moldova and Portugal, but the current favourite is former prime minister of New Zealand Helen Clark. If successful she would be the first woman to occupy the role, currently held by Ban Ki-Moon."

Stoke Gifford Parish Council in Gloucestershire voted to charge the fee at a council meeting on Tuesday, arguing that Parkrun should contribute towards the maintenance of Little Stoke Park. The council said the event - which is held every Saturday - is organised by a group with paid directors and staff, and is sponsored by national companies. It added that the runners ""monopolise the park paths and car park"", and also use toilets, washing facilities and council storage space. ""Parkrun are an organised group and like any other group using the facilities should contribute towards the maintenance,"" the council added. But world record marathon runner Paula Radcliffe described the decision as ""short-sighted"", adding that Parkruns should be ""free for everyone, always"". Runners join a Parkrun event in Bushy Park, London Dame Kelly Holmes also took to Twitter to criticise the council, writing: ""Have I missed the whole reason park runs exist & are free?"". Parkrun's chief operating officer Tom Williams said the decision ""threatens"" the future of the event in Little Stoke and beyond. ""Parkrun has had unprecedented success in engaging the least active and encouraging them to exercise regularly,"" he said. ""Providing free weekly access has been fundamental to this and we are disappointed that this opportunity is to be removed for the residents of Little Stoke. ""As a nation we must make a decision about whether we want to be healthier or not. The costs to all of us of inactivity and poor health are immense."" Parkrun operates hundreds of weekly 5km runs across the UK every week. The event in Little Stoke Park attracts more than 300 runners. The group has begun a petition to oppose the council's charge."

On Friday, US District Judge Gary Klausner said the 1971 song and an instrumental work called Taurus, written by the band Spirit in 1967,  had ""substantial"" similarities. His decision means that Led Zeppelin's lead singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page will appear on 10 May in a Los Angeles court accused of copyright infringement. The judge said: ""While it is true that a descending chromatic four-chord progression is a common convention that abounds in the music industry, the similarities here transcend this core structure,"" he wrote. ""What remains is a subjective assessment of the 'concept and feel' of two works ... a task no more suitable for a judge than for a jury."" Gallery: Key Facts About Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin onsisted of: singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, keyboardist/bass John Paul Jones and Drummer John Bonham (deceased) The lawsuit was brought by Michael Skidmore, a trustee for the late Randy Wolfe, who was Spirit's guitarist and composer of Taurus. Mr Skidmore says the two bands toured together in 1968 and 1969 and this may have been when Page was inspired to write Stairway To Heaven. According to Mr Skidmore's lawsuit, Wolfe had complained about the similarity between the two songs not long before he drowned in 1997 while attempting to rescue his son. Plant and Page, however, say that Wolfe was a songwriter for hire and, therefore, had no claim to copyright. They also say that the chord progressions in Stairway To Heaven were too well-known for such protection. Stairway To Heaven has earned Led Zeppelin hundreds of millions of pounds and is one of the most successful rock songs of all time. But the British rockers often drew inspiration from other groups and some of these have resulted in legal challenges. As a result, the band has already been forced to alter the credits and pay portions of their royalties for songs such as Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and Whole Lotta Love. Last year Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay Marvin Gaye's family millions of dollars after a court ruled they had infringed the copyright of his song Got To Give It Up with their hit Blurred Lines."

He was educated at Tonbridge School in Kent before heading to Christchurch College, Oxford, where he was a graduate of politics, philosophy and economics. His most recent book - Through Spain With Wellington - was launched in March. A second man, aged 26, had been arrested on suspicion of murdering Mr Greenwood but he was released without charge on Saturday."

The amount of alcohol in a ""standard drink"" varies greatly in different countries, with 8g in Iceland and the UK to 20g in Australia. In many conservative countries, ""low-risk"" drinking means no more than 10g of alcohol per day for women and 20g for men. In Chile, however, a person can drink 56g of alcohol per day and still be considered a low-risk drinker.  The figures come from research in the journal Addiction, which surveyed the definitions of ""standard drink"" and ""low-risk"" drinking in 37 countries. Professor Keith Humphreys, a psychiatrist from Stanford University in the US and one of the researchers, said: ""There's a substantial chance for misunderstanding. ""A study of the health effects of low-risk drinking in France could be misinterpreted by researchers in the United States who may use a different definition of drinking levels. ""Inconsistent guidelines are also likely to increase scepticism among the public about their accuracy. It is not possible that every country is correct; maybe they are all wrong."" Prof Humphreys also said it was unclear whether women should drink less than men, as had been accepted for decades. In January, recommended alcohol limits were revised in the UK, with a weekly maximum of 14 units for men and women. Previously, the weekly limit was 21 units for men and 14 units for women. Other nations using the same guidelines for men as for women include Australia, Portugal and South Africa but countries such as the US continue to recommend different limits based on gender. Prof Humphreys said: ""More and more countries are trying to give their citizens guidelines about how much alcohol is safe to drink, and for whom. ""At the very least, we should know whether it's true that women should drink less than men. But even this is unclear."" He added: ""If you think your country should have a different definition of a standard drink or low-risk drinking, take heart - there's probably another country that agrees with you."""

Oliver Robbins was asked to leave the hearing after MPs grew increasingly frustrated with his inability to answer questions about the Home Office on Tuesday. Chairman Keith Vaz had told him to return to the department and get the answers for the committee by 6pm that evening but he failed to comply. Now, the second permanent secretary to the Home Office will be hauled back in front of the committee on 20 April. Mr Robbins had sidestepped repeated questions about whether the head of the Border Force, Sir Charles Montgomery, had been told what his budget was for the year. Sky's Chief Political Correspondent Jon Craig described the mandarin's performance as ""awful"" - as he had ""muttered, mumbled and given barely audible monosyllabic answers"" during his 20-minute ordeal. Sir Charles, who reports to Mr Robbins, previously told the committee he expected to know the figure by the start of the financial year. But Mr Robbins insisted it was ""not easy to answer it in a simple yes or no"". Mr Vaz had also threatened to hold the civil servant in contempt during the heated hearing. The committee chairman has warned he intends to complain about Mr Robbins' conduct to the Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood."

They both scored 49%, just above the international calls specialist Lebara at 46%, in the Which? annual mobile satisfaction survey. Vodafone was the most complained about pay-monthly provider while one in 10 EE users rated customer service and being able to contact the company as poor or very poor. Over 4,000 members of the public who took part gave star ratings on a range of factors including customer service, ease of contacting, value for money and incentives.  Giffgaff, which has no shops or call centres, topped the table for the second year running with 79%. The online provider's low prices plus flexible approach to selling pay-as-you-go (PAYG) Sim cards and unlocked handsets that can be used with any network proved popular. Asda Mobile scored 72% while Tesco Mobile recorded 70%. Asda's good standing may have been boosted by a PAYG service which was rated highly for value for money, according to the survey. Among the providers, ID scored 64%, Virgin Mobile 62%, Three 61%, O2 60%, Talk Mobile 56% and TalkTalk got 54%. Alex Neill, campaigns director of Which?, estimates that customers are collectively losing out on £5.4bn a year by being on the wrong contract. He said: ""Our latest survey once again shows that the major mobile providers are still failing on the basics of customer service. Telecoms are an essential part of modern life and so providers need to start delivering for their customers."""

Stacey Konwiser, 38, suffered a ""severe bite"" wound while inside the big cat's habitat on Friday afternoon, say zoo officials. She was performing basic tasks with the male Malayan tiger at the time, said zoo spokeswoman Naki Carter. ""This is the first death at the hands of an animal in the history of the Palm Beach Zoo,"" she told the Palm Beach Post. The tiger was not on exhibit at the time of the attack and guests were never in danger, Ms Carter added. Ms Konwiser was taken to St Mary's Medical Center, where she died. West Palm Beach police said the Malayan tiger, a critically endangered species, was tranquillized. Ms Carter said Ms Konwiser was known as ""the tiger whisperer"" because of how well she handled the attraction's four Malayan tigers. It is not known which big cat carried out the attack, but the victim earlier this year uploaded a photo of a tiger to Facebook. Ms Konwiser, who was married to another keeper at the zoo, commented on the picture: ""The newest man in my life."" The zoo will remain closed until further notice."

Marian Clode died after being charged at by a herd of cattle while out for a walk in Belford, Northumberland, on 3 April. She was on a short break with her family when the incident happened. The 61-year-old had been walking along a public bridlepath with her husband Chris, daughter Lucy Rowe and son-in-law Kevin when they were approached by a herd of cattle which included several calves. Marian Clode, 61, died after being attacked by a herd of cattle Chris said the cows suddenly attacked. ""I could see the cows at the top of the hill, I could see they were really running fast, clearly at speed,"" he told Sky News. ""The most horrible thing of all is I couldn't see Marian. ""I could see this animal and it was scraping his paws and it was so sinister it was unbelievable. I will never forget the sight of that cow, like a bull fight, matador."" Lucy said: ""It charged at her a third time, it flipped my mum like a rag doll over the fence into the next fence. ""The consultant said the injuries that my mum sustained were the worst they had ever seen, equivalent to those of a high-speed crash. ""She did not stand a chance against that animal. My mum went blue when I looked, the cows were staring at me, her lips went blue. I was screaming her name."" An ambulance was called and paramedics attempted resuscitation. Marian, from Ashton-under-Lyne, was airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle but died two days later. There have been 74 fatalities involving cattle recorded since 2000 - with 18 of those being members of the public. In comparison, dangerous dogs have killed 17 people in the last eight years. The family is urging the public to be more aware of the dangers posed by cows and their young calves. ""Farmers should know it's the time of the year when cattle are with their calves and it could be dangerous and they have to look after the public,"" said Chris. ""My life has gone now, here is someone who was very fit, nothing is going to be the same ever again, it's just traumatic, so sad and silly, and totally ridiculous that this has happened, it could happen to anyone. ""We all go on walks, you don't expect to finish up in this situation and this should never happen to anyone again."""

A representative for the singer told entertainment website TMZ that Prince had performed in Atlanta on Thursday night despite having the flu, and felt worse after boarding the jet following his show. The concert was originally scheduled for last week, but was postponed after the 57-year-old came down with the virus several weeks ago. Prince's plane diverted to Quad City International Airport in Moline, Illinois, and the singer was reportedly rushed to hospital in a ""medical emergency"", TMZ said. The representative said Prince ""was released three hours later, got back on the plane and is now back home"" recovering in Chanhassen, Minnesota. A few hours after the scare, the singer's official Twitter account posted the enigmatic message ""I am #transformed,"" before linking to favourable reviews of the Atlanta show and tweeting that he was listening to Controversy, the title track to his 1981 album. Fans flooded his Instagram page to wish him a speedy recovery. ""I don't know you personally... but I hope you're okay. I have lots of love for you, like if you were part of my family,"" one fan said."

Jack McCullough, 76, was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 following his conviction in one of the oldest unsolved US cases to go to trial. Maria Ridulph was abducted in 1957 as she played in the snow near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 65 miles west of Chicago. Her remains were found five months later by hikers. Maria Ridulph was abducted and killed in December 1957 A judge has now ordered Mr McCullough's release based on newly discovered phone records that supported his long-held contention that he was about 40 miles away on the day Maria disappeared. The new evidence was found during a review of the trial by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack. Mr Schmack wrote in his findings that documents he found contained ""a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt"". At trial, prosecutors alleged Mr McCullough was the man who approached Maria and her friend on 3 December 1957, identifying himself as ""Johnny"". When the friend returned from retrieving mittens from her home nearby, the man and Maria had vanished. Mr McCullough, who went by the name John Tessier in his youth, was one of nearly 100 people suspected by police at the time. He was not arrested based on what was thought to be a solid alibi. The then-19-year-old contended he was in Rockford that day attempting to enlist with the US Air Force. Authorities went after Mr McCullough again some 50 years later after his half-sister, Janet Tessier, said Mr McCullough's mother made incriminating comments about him just before her death in 1994. During a follow-up investigation, Maria's childhood friend identified Mr McCullough as ""Johnny"" from an old photograph. On Friday, Judge William Brady made clear his decision to free Mr McCullough was not a new verdict in the case. He said: ""Rest assured I am not trying this case ... You will not hear the words, 'Mr McCullough is guilty' or 'Mr McCullough is not guilty' coming from my mouth."" Maria's family said they remain convinced the girl's killer is Mr McCullough, who lived most of his adult life in Washington state, where he worked as a police officer. Maria's brother, 70-year-old Charles Ridulph, told local media the family feels let down by the prosecution office's about-face."
2016-04-16,The Czech Republic has finally picked a short form English name for the country - Czechia.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160416085847/http://news.sky.com/story/1679404/czech-republics-leaders-agree-on-new-name,"The Czech Republic has finally picked a short form English name for the country - Czechia. Politicians say the name will make it easier for companies, sportsmen and others to label products and clothing. The debate has raged since the republic split with partner Slovakia in 1993, spelling the end of Czechoslovakia. But on Thursday, the president, prime minister, heads of parliament, foreign and defence ministers agreed on Czechia. The country is often called 'Cesko' in the Czech Republic Once it is approved officially at a cabinet meeting the foreign ministry can lodge it with the UN. Up until now, many people wanting to promote the country have written ""Czech"" across sports jerseys or product, but critics of that point out the word is an adjective so cannot be used as a one-word proper noun. The new name needed to be inclusive because, while the largest part of the country is known as Bohemia - or Cechy in Czech - any new name needed to take in the historic regions of Moravia and Silesia. Czech president Milos Zeman is backing the change Supporters of Czechia say the name, which was suggested soon after the 1993 split, can be traced back to the 19th century. However, some opponents say the name sounds ugly and others suggest it sounds too similar to the Chechen Republic, or Chechnya, leading to possible confusion."

The Public Accounts Committee of MPs said the looming appointment of a new chief executive at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) should act as a catalyst in recovering more of the estimated £16bn in lost tax revenues believed due annually. Dame Lin Homer - long a target for critics of HMRC's performance - steps down this month after four years at the helm. Committee chair Meg Hillier said it would set her successor, Jon Thompson, a deadline of November to come up with a new strategy on tackling evasion and bringing more offenders to justice. She cited the failure to land more than one UK prosecution in the wake of the 2008 leak of the so-called Falciani list of details of tens of thousands of accounts at HSBC's Swiss private bank. The latest demand for action was issued just hours after the Chancellor announced a partnership between tax and legal agencies in Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain to help tackle corruption and tax evasion. George Osborne said the exchange of information, in areas including beneficial ownership registers, would ""deal another hammer blow against those who hide their illegal tax evasion in the dark corners of the financial system"". Separately, the EU published new rules this week aimed at boosting transparency over sales and profits at big firms. The fallout from the Panama leak has been felt by businesses and individuals worldwide - with top UK politicians publishing tax returns amid a clamour for clarity. The Prime Minister admitted he could have handled better the release of details on his own past investments,but denied any suggestion of legal tax avoidance let alone evasion. A bitter political debate has raged in areas ranging from the rights of individuals to create wealth to the funding of HMRC. A spokesman for HMRC defended its record in the wake of the PAC's report. He said: ""HMRC is one of the most effective tax collectors in the world, getting 93 pence of every pound due. Few other countries have a smaller tax gap. ""We remain relentless and strategic in tracking down the few that try to get out of paying their fair share. ""Tackling tax evasion is an absolute priority for HMRC, with 26,000 staff focusing on evasion, avoidance and fraud. ""We have increased prosecutions of wealthy tax cheats and our crackdown on offshore tax cheats has already brought in more than £2bn since 2010."" He added that HMRC was currently investigating 1,100 cases of offshore evasion, including 90 criminal cases of which 29 were already in the court system."

Mars Food is introducing new labels to distinguish between ""everyday"" and ""occasional"" products. All Dolmio lasagne meal kits, lasagne sauces, oven bake kits and pesto will fall into the latter category. It is part of a five-year global health initiative announced by the company. Mars Food said: ""To maintain the authentic nature of the recipe, some Mars Food products are higher in salt, added sugar or fat. ""As these products are not intended to be eaten daily, Mars Food will provide guidance to consumers on-pack and on its website regarding how often these meal offerings should be consumed within a balanced diet. ""The Mars Food website will be updated within the next few months with a list of 'occasional' products - those to be enjoyed once per week - and a list of 'everyday' products."" The ingredients in a 320g jar of Dolmio Bolognese sauce include tomatoes (78%), tomato paste (11%), onions, lemon juice, cornflour, salt, basil (0.3%), sugar, garlic, parsley, herb and spices. According to the company's website, a 160g serving contains 53 calories, 0.2g fat, no saturates, 6.7g of sugars (7% of the recommended daily intake for an adult) and 1.28g of salt (21% of the RDI). Mars Food plans to revamp many of its products, including Dolmio pasta sauces, by reducing salt, added sugar and fat. It says the majority of products will still be ""everyday"" and only 10% are likely to be recommended for occasional use. The company has pledged to cut salt internationally by an average of 20% by 2021. In the UK, some Uncle Ben's products will be reformulated to reduce the sugar. Mars Food added: ""We're holding ourselves to a much higher standard, based on guidance from leading health authorities such as the World Health Organisation, which will lead us to further reducing sodium across our global product portfolio by an average of 20% by 2021 and added sugar in a limited number of sauces and light meals by 2018. ""While we have some work to do, 70% percent of our tomato-based Dolmio jar products already meet this 'everyday' standard."""

At least 36 women in Britain, Canada and the US are thought to have got pregnant from the donor's sperm over the last decade. Now three Canadian families have filed a lawsuit saying US-based Xytex Corp and Ontario's Outreach Health Services misled them. ""It's horrifying,"" said lawyer James Fireman. ""These couples were seeking assistance to build a family and were very vulnerable, they put their faith in the (cryobank) industry, and this happens."" The plaintiffs - whose allegations have not been proven in court - are seeking $11.7m (£8.2m). They say the companies lied about the donor's IQ, said he was extremely healthy and was doing a PhD in neuroscience engineering. The families learned his true identity when Xytex inadvertently included his contact information in an email to them. An internet search and subsequent investigation revealed he was actually a 39-year-old Georgia man who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, narcissistic personality disorder, drug-induced psychotic disorder and significant grandiose delusions. The man had been jailed for burglary and other crimes. According to the claim, the companies continued to sell his sperm even after being informed of the discrepancies in 2014."
2016-04-16,Day one of official campaigning and it's time to put heavyweights in the ring with gloves removed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160416085847/http://news.sky.com/story/1679435/eu-fight-looking-messy-as-first-jabs-thrown,"Day one of official campaigning and it's time to put heavyweights in the ring with gloves removed. Vote Leave's Boris Johnson said ""it is time to believe in Britain again,"" an opening jab so predictable that former Chancellor Alistair Darling had his counter punch ready. He fired back: ""There is nothing patriotic about turning a blind eye to credible warnings of economic disaster."" This came with new figures suggesting UK trade could be damaged to the tune of almost £100bn in the wake of a Brexit. Again a predicable swipe fended off with an accusation of 'scaremongering'. To the traditional voter used to left and right politics, this fight is already starting to look messy. Vote leave is backed by Tory MPs including Michael Gove and Boris Johnson This was emphasised by the opening message from Vote Leave: ""Let's give our NHS the £350m we give the the EU every week."" It appears on a red Labour-style background, but sounds very Nigel Farage and last year might well have been set in purple hue. The figure which amounts to £20bn a year is almost true for 2014, but doesn't account for the roughly £9bn we got back form the EU (although clearly we are a substantial net contributor). It also doesn't account for the fact that some of that money might be demanded by others such as the farmers who would lose subsidies if we leave the EU. When pressed on whether this £350m weekly sum would really be made available to the NHS if we left the European Union, Labour MP Gisela Stuart - chair of the Vote Leave campaign - said the message was ""illustrative"". Meanwhile MP Graham Stringer, cofounder of Labour Leave campaign, candidly admitted he ""always agreed with UKIP on this point"" and not the views of his own party. Party allegiance and party messages are beginning to blur, especially with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove effectively arguing that under their own government's plans the NHS will have a several billion shortfall in its budget. This will anger David Cameron, but a focus on the NHS and the fact the Leave campaign chose the old Granada studios in Manchester for its launch shows it has identified Labour voters in the north as key to its success. No one denies it is strange, even confusing, to see Labour MPs siding with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. But are things any clearer over at the In camp? Down the road, also in Manchester, Labour's Stronger In campaigners waited for a battle bus containing Lucy Powell, who was vice-chair of Ed Miliband's 2015 general election campaign. Mostly Labour activists, some admitted it was ""awkward"" working on the side of David Cameron and other conservatives for the Remain campaign. ""You have to remember we will be fighting against them soon in the local elections,"" said one. They welcome Jeremy Corbyn's intervention yesterday: the Labour leader's qualified support for a ""reformed"" EU has been seized on as ""unequivocal"" backing for the remain camp. But Mr Corbyn's demands for change had nothing to do with David Cameron's EU reforms and as well as questioning the current priorities of the EU - it was an attack on his conservative co-campaigners, warning that outside of the European Union a Tory government would threaten workers' rights under the guise of cutting red tape for businesses. This might chime with undecided Labour voters and would obviously never come out of the mouth of David Cameron. But then when asked about EU immigration levels, Mr Corbyn said: ""I don't think too many have come."" This doesn't play too well into the narrative that Mr Cameron's reforms are designed to tackle that problem. The bottom line is you couldn't make a political party out of either the In or Out camp. It would be like making a salad out of gherkins, blue cheese and strawberry ice cream. The campaigners on both sides hope voters will pick the flavours they like and leave the rest on the side of the plate. So prepare for some colourful campaigning which when put together you may find hard to digest."

At a meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC, George Osborne said the agreement struck with Germany, France, Italy and Spain will ""lift the veil of secrecy"" that criminals hide under to evade tax and commit other white-collar crimes. It is hoped the new arrangement will allow investigations into financial wrongdoing to be performed more effectively - and he has called for other G20 members to follow their example and build upon the system of European co-operation. Mr Osborne with fellow finance ministers and officials at the IMF He said: ""Today we deal another hammer blow against those who hide their illegal tax evasion in the dark corners of the financial system. ""Britain will work with our major European partners to find out who really owns the secretive shell companies and trusts that have been used as conduits for evading tax, laundering money and benefiting from corruption."" Tax and law enforcement agencies are going to be involved in the new effort involving Europe's five largest economies. Mr Osborne added: ""No single country can tackle international tax evasion alone - and Britain should never fool itself into thinking that it can do this by itself."" The announcement follows the Panama Papers scandal, which saw millions of documents leaked from the database of offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Some of the files appeared to show how the rich and famous can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. The fallout has prompted senior British politicians, including Mr Osborne, the Prime Minister and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, to reveal details about their private finances. Meanwhile, UK banks and financial institutions face a deadline on Friday to report back to the Financial Conduct Authority on whether they had done business with Mossack Fonseca."

2016-04-16,"Solvency vs. Sovereignty. The Chancellor vs. the Mayor. Day One of the EU referendum campaign in a nutshell, and themes that will endure for the next 69 days of the campaign.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160416085847/http://news.sky.com/story/1679604/eu-referendum-osborne-takes-on-johnson,"By Faisal Islam, Political Editor Solvency vs. Sovereignty. The Chancellor vs. the Mayor. Day One of the EU referendum campaign in a nutshell, and themes that will endure for the next 69 days of the campaign. Here in Washington, DC, at annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund, Chancellor George Osborne told me something I had not fully expected. In response to a question about the official Remain campaign's claim that mortgage rates would rise in the event of a leave vote, he said: ""Yes, it was likely."" Ordinarily the Chancellor is very cautious about anything that could be perceived to be the domain of the Bank of England. :: Osborne's Mortgage Warning Over Quitting EU But Mr Osborne pointed to recent deliberations of two independent expert committees on monetary and financial policy that give separate rationales for why rates could rise. ""Interest rates are a matter for our independent Bank of England, but if you look at the view of the experts here at the IMF it’s pretty clear that if Britain votes to leave prices will go up and there will be instability in financial markets,” he said. “What that means for families is that mortgage rates are likely to go up. “It will be families paying the price if Britain votes to leave the EU, and it’s another reason frankly we are stronger, safer and better off inside the EU.” There are two pathways he suggests. A rise in inflation caused by a Brexit-related sterling slump already discussed by the Monetary Policy Committee could lead to base interest rates being hiked. The second is that fears over a financial shock and associated uncertainty pushes up financial funding costs and therefore mortgage rates. It was an attempt to crystallise the message he was hearing from finance ministers, central bank governors and financiers here. One leading official of a large UK bank here said that this channel for rising mortgage costs was ""entirely realistic"". Surely, however, the public has become inured to all this Project Fear scaremongering? Mr Osborne says the sheer array of international expert voices now raising Brexit concerns should be rather telling. ""The idea that NATO or the IMF or the American government are in some giant conspiracy is of course fanciful,” he said. “It is all this project fantasy that you hear about that say Britain could leave and somehow be better off or no worse off - just not true. “Prices would go up, jobs would be lost, living standards would go down - people need to know those facts before they make their decision."" He went on to hail the creation of a new ""coalition"" involving a ""Conservative Government and the Labour Party, businesses and trade unions"" for the European Union. Every question I asked about steel, or tax blacklists, came back to Brexit. Two hours later, 3,500 miles away at the Coronation Street set in Manchester, Boris Johnson launched the Vote Leave campaign with a message based on regaining control of areas of British public life ""invaded"" by the EU - from trains to tampons. It was a jolly opening - a live reading of greatest hits of his Telegraph columns. But there was a serious message about Britain taking control. A dig at Mr Osborne too, those warning of rising interest rates were reminiscent of ""Millennium Bug prophets of doom"", he said. Although the Mayor of London has been caught out for exaggerating the impact of the EU on, for example, children's use of balloons, and prospective recyclers of teabags. His argument was that the fees paid by the British taxpayer could be redeployed to the NHS. He said remain campaigners who say the EU is not perfect but there is no alternative are the ""Gerald Ratners"" of modern politics. ""My friends, they are the Gerald Ratners of modern politics. The EU, they say - it's crap but we have no alternative,” he said. “Well we do have an alternative, and it is a glorious alternative, a relationship with Europe based not on the whims of unelected bureaucrats but on cooperation between elected governments."" But Mr Johnson's Labour foes said that he had been no friend of the NHS, and was ""talking Britain down"", in the words of Labour MP Chuka Umunna. The ""Bremainers"" depress Mr Johnson, he says, because of their sheer lack of ""idealism"". Mr Osborne would argue he is a realist, not an idealist. Soap opera set vs. global financial diplomacy meeting. Sovereignty vs. solvency. Idealism vs. realism. Day one of 70."

Phil Sayer, 62, was heard on most automated public address systems across the UK rail network. He died on Thursday, and his widow Elinor Hamilton wrote on Facebook: ""Phil Sayer - voice of reason, radio, and railways. A dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend. ""We are sorry to announce that this service terminates here."" Mr Sayer worked as a BBC presenter before going on to set up a voiceover company with his wife. One London Underground station that his voice notably isn't heard at is Embankment. Instead, a 40-year-old recording by Oswald Laurence is played at his widow's request. Dr Margaret McCollum said she loved hearing her late husband's voice when she travelled through Embankment. In 2013 Transport for London (TfL) stopped using the recording - but relented following her request. TfL began using the ""mind the gap"" message from 1969, and there have been several voices used on the Tube network over the years. They include The Archers actor Tim Bentinck, who was the voice on the Piccadilly Line for 15 years from 1990."

But the combined pre-tax profit figure for the 20 clubs for 2014/15 was down 37% from the year before - at £120m from £190m - as the league's wage bill swelled by 6% to a record £6bn. Income from broadcast deals beefed up clubs' finances as their total revenue went up by 3% to a record £3.4bn, the figures showed. They also revealed that, on the basis of operating profits - which exclude player transfers, interest charges and player contract re-valuations - 17 of England's 20 top-flight teams were in the black last season. Dan Jones, a partner in Deloitte's sports business group, said it pointed to a period of sustained profitability for clubs ahead of next season's record television deal. The new contract with Sky Sports and BT Sport for 2016-19 is worth £5.1bn, a 70% increase on the current deal. Adam Bull, senior consultant at Deloitte's sports business group, said: ""Clubs now enjoy a significant revenue advantage over all but a handful of the biggest clubs from elsewhere in Europe. ""The security of world-leading revenues, now augmented with sustained profitability, aided by cost-control measures in place for both domestic and European competitions, makes clubs playing in the Premier League, and those with aspirations to get there, particularly attractive to investors from around the globe."""

The three-year-old was found earlier this month dragging her paws and covered in blood after disappearing from her home in Ardleigh, Essex. X-rays by a vet revealed she had been wounded by 30 gun pellets all over her body. One was in her paw which was why she was limping, another was removed from the middle of an eye. RSPCA inspector Adam Jones said: ""The vet said two had just missed her spinal cord and it is a miracle she survived. ""We were shocked to find that Puss-Puss was peppered with such an extraordinary number of pellet wounds."" Owner Doug Taw said ""We heard some gunshots but didn't imagine at first it could have anything to do with Puss-Puss. ""Then we found her crouched under a car, frightened and injured. She ran off and we couldn't find her for a week. ""I was beside myself with worry. Then she eventually dragged herself back in a terrible state and we rushed her straight to the vet. ""It is heartbreaking seeing her in such a distressed state, and I am so upset that she will now lose her eye."" Anyone with information about the attack can contact the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018."

The Argentinian footballer said that management ensured he failed to make enough appearances to trigger a contract extension worth up to £2m. He claimed the club froze him out of the first team after being diagnosed with the illness in 2013. Delivering its findings, the tribunal panel found that there was a ""continuing course of conduct"" by Newcastle to ""remove"" Gutierrez from the club. The panel said: ""We concluded that the reason why the respondent managed the claimant's selection was because they no longer wanted him at the club because of his cancer."" The footballer could now receive a large payout after winning his disability discrimination claim.  Gutierrez was a popular figure among fans and received a standing ovation on his return after being given the all-clear. Alan Pardew told Gutierrez he was not part of the club's future His goal in the last game of last season helped keep the side from relegation. Despite this, the player - who was with Newcastle for seven seasons - said he was informed by the club's then-manager Alan Pardew that he did not feature in his plans and was free to agree terms with another club. Gutierrez thanked fans on Twitter, posting: ""I am a Geordie thanks Newcastle fans for your support. I love the city. I hope we stay up. ""Come on the Toon. Once a Geordie always a Geordie."" In another he wrote that ""the players not the board"" make the club. Gutierrez's lawyer, Carol Course, said: ""Having battled cancer on two occasions and subsequently suffered unfair treatment by the club as a result of this, Jonas is pleased that the employment tribunal has today found in his favour and held that he was indeed discriminated against by Newcastle United due to his cancer diagnosis and treatment. ""He wishes to place on record his thanks to all the Newcastle fans who have supported him throughout his case."" A Newcastle United statement said the club was ""dismayed"" by the tribunal's decision, adding that it would be consulting its legal team to consider its available options."

The Trussell Trust handed over 1,109,309 three-day parcels during 2015-16 - up 2% on the previous year. More than 415,000 of the parcels went to children. Estimates suggest more than 500,000 people used one of the trust's 424 food banks. The trust said a million emergency food supplies a year must not become the ""new normal"". Chief executive David McAuley said: ""Today's figures on national food bank use prove that the numbers of people hitting a crisis where they cannot afford to buy food are still far too high. ""One million three-day food supplies given out by our food banks every year is one million too many."" Almost half of food banks said benefit sanctions were responsible for increased visits. Low wages, high living costs and insecure work contracts were also to blame, according to the trust. Shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary Kerry McCarthy called the findings a ""national scandal"". But a Government spokesman said: ""Reasons for food bank use are complex so it is misleading to link them to any one thing. ""This Government is determined to move to a higher-wage society, introducing the new National Living Wage that will benefit over one million workers directly this year, and we're also spending £80bn on working-age benefits to ensure a strong safety net for those who need it most. ""The vast majority of benefits are processed on time and the number of sanctions have actually gone down."" More than 40,000 volunteers helped at food banks in the past year, with the public donating more than 10,500 tonnes of food."

The pair, aged 13 and 14 from Tyneside, are also accused of shoplifting dummies, baby milk and a bottle. The toddler went missing from a Primark store on Northumberland Street in Newcastle city centre at 4.55pm on Wednesday. A major search was launched and officers scoured CCTV belonging to the council and local shops. She was found an hour later in Gosforth, several miles from where she was last seen. The accused, wearing grey tracksuits, appeared in the dock at South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court, sitting as a youth court. The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are both charged with kidnap ""with the intention of committing a relevant sexual offence"" contrary to the Sexual Offences Act of 2003. District Judge Roger Elsey told them: ""You appreciate that you are charged with very serious offences."" He also told them not to discuss the case on social media. They spoke quietly to confirm their address and date of birth. Both defendants were denied bail, ordered to be tagged and remanded into local authority care, to live and sleep at an address, from 7pm to 7am. They were also told they must not enter Newcastle city centre. No relatives of the pair or the alleged victim were in court for Friday's 30-minute hearing. The case was adjourned until 13 May when the girls will appear before North Tyneside Youth Court."

At least 32 people are confirmed dead and more than 1,000 injured after the 7.3-magnitude earthquake hit southwestern Japan in the early hours of Saturday morning. The number of casualties is expected to rise as rescue workers dig through collapsed buildings, mud and debris. The government said about 190 of those injured were in serious condition. ""Nothing is more important than human life and it's a race against time,"" said Mr Abe. A landslide cuts a road in two ""Daytime today is the big test,"" he added. The epicentre of the quake was near the city of Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu, the same region hit by a 6.2 tremor which killed nine people a day earlier. Gallery: City Of Kumamoto Rocked By Second Earthquake In 24 Hours The earthquake's epicentre was near Kumamoto city in southwest Japan. It is the second quake to hit the area in two days Rescue efforts have been hindered by damage to the region's transport network, with one tunnel caved in, a highway bridge damaged, roads blocked by landslips and train and air services halted. The number of military personnel sent to the area has been increased to 20,000. Heavy rain and strong winds forecast for the next few hours are threatening to further complicate the emergency response. It is feared that rainfall hitting soil loosened by the quake could set off further mudslides in isolated rural towns, where people in collapsed homes are waiting to be rescued. Continued tremors are also being felt, with more than 230 aftershocks of at least level one on the Japanese scale reported since Thursday's quake, the country's meteorological agency said. One massive landslide has already torn open a mountainside in Kumamato Prefecture all the way from the top to a highway below. Almost 170,000 homes are without power across the region, while drinking water systems have failed. Some 70,000 people have fled their homes. Hundreds of patients have also been evacuated from a hospital in Kumamoto over fears it could collapse. In a televised address, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""We are making every effort to respond. Please let's help each other and stay calm."" Despite the damage, experts said there was nothing irregular reported at the three nearby nuclear power plants. The Japanese Meteorological Agency initially issued a tsunami alert but later lifted it. Seven hours after the quake a small eruption occurred at Mount Aso, about 30 miles from Kumamoto city, with smoke rising about 100 metres. Thursday's 6.5-magnitude tremor hit at about 9.26pm local time, leaving nine people dead and injuring around 800 others. Many people have been sleeping out in the open and away from buildings, in case of further quakes, but with bad weather forecast, there are fears they will be vulnerable to the elements."
2016-04-19,"Dinosaurs were heading for extinction millions of years before the meteor impact that is widely believed to have wiped them out, according to scientists.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160419215915/http://news.sky.com/story/1681005/dinosaurs-past-their-prime-before-meteor-hit,"Dinosaurs were heading for extinction millions of years before the meteor impact that is widely believed to have wiped them out, according to scientists. Until now, most experts have thought dinosaurs were flourishing just before a huge asteroid or comet smashed into the Earth off the coast of Mexico. New research suggests that in reality, more dinosaur species were disappearing than new ones were emerging up to 50 million years earlier. Giant long-necked plant-eaters such as Diplodocus were vanishing at the fastest rate, while meat-eating relatives of Tyrannosaurus rex were in more gradual decline. The scientists, whose findings are based on sophisticated statistical analysis and fossil evidence, believe the meteor impact 66 million years ago finished off a process that was already well under way. Lead researcher Dr Manabu Sakamoto, from the University of Reading, said: ""While the asteroid impact is still the prime candidate for the dinosaurs' final disappearance, it is clear that they were already past their prime in an evolutionary sense. ""Our work is ground-breaking in that, once again, it will change our understanding of the fate of these mighty creatures. ""While a sudden apocalypse may have been the final nail in the coffin, something else had already been preventing dinosaurs from evolving new species as fast as old species were dying out. Gallery: 'Weird' Horned Dinosaur Unveiled A new species of dinosaur, dubbed 'Hellboy' has been unveiled in Canada. Pic: Royal Tyrrell Museum ""This suggests that for tens of millions of years before their ultimate demise, dinosaurs were beginning to lose their edge as the dominant species on Earth."" The scientists say that for unexplained reasons, possibly linked to the break-up of continental land masses and sustained volcanic activity, dinosaurs stopped producing enough new species to replace those that were lost. Because of this, they were unable to recover from the environmental crisis caused by the meteor impact, which blacked out the sun with millions of tons of dust, cooled the global climate and caused widespread loss of vegetation. Huge herbivores with massive appetites would not have been able to feed themselves, and their predators in turn would have been left hungry. A long gradual dinosaur decline may have set the stage for mammals, according to the researchers, whose findings appear in the journal Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences. Co-author Dr Chris Venditti, also from the University of Reading, said: ""The decline of the dinosaurs would have left plenty of room for mammals, the group of species which humans are a member of, to flourish before the impact, priming them to replace dinosaurs as the dominant animals on Earth."""

Some 49 cases in which pilgrims were conned out of thousands of pounds for bogus trips were reported to Action Fraud - the UK's fraud reporting centre - between April 2015 and 31 March this year. The average loss was around £2,600 and hotspots for offending were London, Birmingham, Manchester and Blackburn. Around 25,000 British Muslims make the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia each year. A total of 16 police forces across England and Wales are taking part in the initiative to raise awareness of scams. The campaign is being supported by the British Council of Hajjis, travel association ABTA and ATOL, a financial protection scheme from the Civil Aviation Authority. People booking package trips with flights this autumn are being advised to make sure the firm they are using is covered by the ATOL scheme - and to not use cash or a direct bank transfer for payment. They are also being advised to get everything in writing and to check the details of their flight and accommodation and make sure their Hajj visas are valid. City of London Police Commander Chris Greany said: ""Many victims will have saved for years to be able to afford to travel to Saudi Arabia and as a result will be absolutely devastated when they find out that they have in fact been conned by fraudsters."""

The Hollywood star and actress-model Amber Heard released the video after she admitted failing to declare their dogs Pistol and Boo when they flew in to Queensland a year ago. In it, Heard says: ""Australia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people. ""It has to be protected."" Depp then deadpans that Aussies are ""just as unique"" as their wildlife. The video - which has received more than two million hits on YouTube - has been compared with a hostage plea or North Korean-style propaganda on social media. Barnaby Joyce, who is also the country's agriculture minister, last year threatened to have the couple's pet dogs put down unless they ""b***ered off back to the United States"". And on Tuesday he could not resist a dig at Depp. ""I don't think he'll get an Academy Award for his performance ... he looked like he was auditioning for the Godfather,"" Mr Joyce told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He went on: ""At the end of it we've got a message that is going all around the world right now. ""It's going off like a frog in a sock telling people that if you come into this nation and you don't obey our laws, you're in trouble. ""That's what this is about, it's making sure we keep this nation, protect our flora, our fauna and protect our biosecurity laws.""  Australia has strict quarantine laws to prevent pests and diseases entering the country."

Editors of the Sun On Sunday wanted to publish an account of the man's ""sexual exploits"" with others. The man took legal action and earlier this year two Court of Appeal judges imposed an injunction preventing the newspaper from identifying him. Three appeal court judges have now said the injunction can be lifted following a challenge by lawyers for the newspaper. But they did not name the man in their ruling pending further legal action by his lawyers. Lawyers for the celebrity - referred to as PJS - are asking appeal judges to give them permission to take the case to the Supreme Court. And the appeal judges said the celebrity cannot be identified until they have ruled on whether the case should go to the highest court in the UK. Lord Justice Jackson announced the decision and said: ""No one must publish anything which is covered by the present injunction until this court has heard, and adjudicated, upon the claimant's application for a stay pending appeal."" Sun On Sunday editors argued the ban should go because the man - a showbusiness personality and public figure - has been named in articles abroad and his identity could be found on the internet. The man opposed the application and said the ban should stay in place. Lord Justice Jackson said appeal judges had concluded that ""knowledge of relevant matters"" was ""now so widespread"" that confidentiality had ""probably been lost"". ""Much of the harm which the injunction was intended to prevent has already occurred,"" he said. ""The court should not make orders which are ineffective."" Appeal judges said their decision to lift the injunction would be stayed until 1pm on Wednesday to give the man's lawyers time to prepare a Supreme Court application."
2016-04-19,Sky News can reveal that a group of men arrested in Denmark two weeks ago were all named in Islamic State recruitment files leaked to us in March.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160419215915/http://news.sky.com/story/1680874/is-files-reveal-danish-recruiters-links-to-uk,"By Mark Stone, Europe Correspondent, in Denmark Sky News can reveal that a group of men arrested in Denmark two weeks ago were all named in Islamic State recruitment files leaked to us in March. The link between the arrests and the files also exposes a connection between Danish IS recruiters and British extremists. On 7 April, Danish police raided properties in several parts of Copenhagen. A number of arrests were made. Two days earlier, a 20-year-old man was arrested at the city's airport. It is understood he was trying to board a plane with a large quantity of cash. In total, five people were detained and a further four ""detained in absentia"". Their whereabouts are not known. However, authorities refused to give many further details. In a so-called ""double-locked door"" legal hearing, the media were prevented from publishing the names of the men. But Sky News has seen their names and those of the men still being sought. All appear in files leaked to Sky by a disillusioned IS member in March. Filled out by IS gate keepers when recruits entered the self-proclaimed caliphate, the files are now exposing fighters who have slipped back into their home countries. One by one authorities are picking them up and piecing together a terror franchise that spans the continent. We rang the doorbell at the address of one of the detained men. His entry form lists him as married. He lists his occupation as ""childcare"" and it states that he entered IS territory on 1 July 2013. It is not clear when he returned to Denmark. A neighbour told us she knew the man well. ""I would say hello to him every time I walk in or out of the door. A really nice guy, very helpful. He offers to drive me so I don't have to take a cab,"" Lise-Lotte Christensen said. We showed her the man's file. ""It really surprises me. I had no idea he was that kind of guy, he was just really nice. A lovely, warm person,"" she said. She confirmed to us that he has two young children and a Danish wife, all information which tallies with the associated file. As with all the files, it lists the person who recommended the man's entry to IS. In his case it was an individual called Abu Hifs al Pakistani, one of two names which crops up frequently in the files. Across town, we visit another neighbourhood and the scene of another raid. One man was taken from a second floor apartment in a block. The name on the doorbell is the same as that on the file which lists further details. Born 1990, married, entered IS - 9 September 2013, recruiter - Abu Khatab al Pakstani. His name is the other which appears in a number of the files. The form of the man arrested at the airport details him as a 20-year-old former mobile phone technician who travelled to Syria on 10 July 2013 when he'd have been just seventeen. A well-known Copenhagen mosque is listed as his home address. We know the man was close to the mosque's imam. We were told the imam was away in Mecca and our calls to his mobile phone didn't connect. The recruit's sponsor is, once again, Abu Hifs al Pakistani. Between them, Abu Hifs and Abu Khatab are named as the recruiters in all but three of the Danish files. We have obtained footage of Abu Khatab at a rally in Copenhagen in late 2012. The IS files show us that he would have been recruiting people for jihad at this time. In the footage, he is seen plugging a mobile phone into a loudspeaker. On the other end of the line is the radical cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed, who was once based in Britain and whose connections to radical groups in the UK remain strong. YouTube footage shows Abu Khatab alongside Abu Hifs in Syria in 2013. Both men are now dead, but both had contact with known British extremists like Bakri Mohammed and another who can't currently be named for legal reasons. The two men's exposure as high profile recruiters helps European intelligence agencies join up the dots. A former analyst at the Danish Intelligence Service says that highlighting patterns in the forms is crucial in helping to understand IS.  ""One of the most interesting things in the files is who recommended the recruits,"" Anja Dalgaard-Neilsen said. Ms Dalgaard-Neilsen is now the director of the Institute for Strategy at the Royal Danish Defence College. She says the files help not only to apprehend suspects but to prosecute them. ""It has now been criminalised to join a terrorist organisation and that's the reason why these files are potentially very interesting to the authorities, because they could support the argument of the authorities of the prosecution that these people joined a terrorist organisation,"" she said. ""It is, for obvious reasons, difficult to gather evidence in a war zone. ""Until recently it wasn't a crime in and of itself to travel to Syria so you couldn't know if people were doing humanitarian work or whether they had actually joined a terrorist organisation."" The challenge for the authorities is identifying all those in the files. There are many more Europeans named in files than there have been arrests. Some individuals may have died in Syria. But others could have travelled back to their home countries. After the atrocities in Paris and Brussels, and IS' pledge to attack again, there is an urgency to find them."
2016-04-19,Michael Gove confirmed to me today that the Leave campaign advocates leaving Europe's Single Market as well as the European Union.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160419215915/http://news.sky.com/story/1681513/gove-puts-migration-control-above-banker-jobs,"Michael Gove confirmed to me today that the Leave campaign advocates leaving Europe's Single Market as well as the European Union. This is a major strategic decision for the Leave campaign, and it will have consequences until polling day. In a nutshell, the Justice Secretary has chosen to prioritise sovereignty and control of immigration policy over a now tangible risk to the City, financial services generally, and thousands of jobs. The UK will not become a member of the European Economic Area, and so will exit the Single Market. The Single Market is widely considered a great British diplomatic win under the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. The upside for Leave and Mr Gove's vision for a post-Brexit UK is more control over migration policy, and smaller payments to the EU. Above all, the UK would not have to abide by the judgements of the European Court of Justice. The downside is the prospect of extra trade barriers in goods and services. Most prominently it puts under severe pressure the crucial ""financial services passport"" which allows London banks access to European markets. Last month the Governor of the Bank of England cited threats to financial passporting at the top of reasons for relocation of finance jobs and investment away from London and the UK. Mr Carney said he had seen contingency plans for some international banks to move from London to Ireland. I put that to Mr Gove: ""Financial services are already flourishing in London. We were told before, when the single currency was being established, We were told when the single currency was being established that London would shrivel and die as financial centre if we were outside the single currency. ""If we are outside the EU but part of a free-trade zone, then the ingenuity, the energy, and the attractiveness of London as a financial capital will ensure that our financial services continue to thrive."" The position creates risks. Uncertainty around one of the UK's top sectors is now real, tangible, and justifiable. It is not scaremongering or Project Fear to say that thousands of bank jobs are now in doubt and big banks could leave, and have plans to leave, London. However, the Leave position is intellectually coherent - that risk might be more than made up for by a concrete new approach to migration and paying less or nothing in EU membership fees. The stakes in the referendum just increased again."
2016-04-19,An investigation into sexual violence in schools is being launched after it was claimed some teachers were turning a blind eye to bullying among pupils.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160419215915/http://news.sky.com/story/1681102/sexual-violence-in-schools-to-be-investigated,"An investigation into sexual violence in schools is being launched after it was claimed some teachers were turning a blind eye to bullying among pupils. MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee have decided to take action after it emerged an average of 200 alleged rapes are being reported in schools every year. Evidence also suggests many pupils are afraid to report incidents of assault because they fear the victim will be punished as well as the offender. The committee's chairman, Maria Miller, is asking teachers, students and parents from across the country to get in touch and share their experiences to stop the issue from ""blighting the lives of another generation of young people - both male and female"". She added: ""It's clear from the young people we've heard from that sexual harassment and sexual violence in schools is having a profound impact on their day-to-day lives."" In 2010, a YouGov poll of 16 to 18-year-olds found 29% of girls had experienced unwanted sexual touching at school. Separate research by Fixers, a youth charity, found some schools struggle to recognise the pressures their students face when dealing with incidents of sexual harassment and sexual bullying. One 18-year-old girl told the charity: ""At my school a girl was pressured into performing oral sex on an older boy in school. ""They were caught and both suspended for the same amount of time."" Gemma, 22, added that boys would regularly grab girls in her school and try to push them into changing rooms - only to justify their behaviour by describing it as ""banter"". It is hoped the committee's investigation, which will run until 22 May, will determine whether such harassment is becoming more prolific in schools, what the impact of sexual bullying on the internet is, and potential solutions for tackling all types of intimidation. The End Violence Against Women Coalition has welcomed the parliamentary inquiry, with director Sarah Green saying: ""This behaviour is endemic and it stops girls feeling safe and achieving their best at school. ""When teachers and school leaders do not challenge sexual harassment, boys and girls observe and learn that sexual harassment is acceptable. ""Girls learn that they are supposed to put up with it in school and beyond, while boys are given a message that they can get away with it. ""It is likely to create a context where more serious assaults are both more likely to happen and less likely to be reported."""

The veteran actress passed away in her sleep at her home in Los Angeles, a family spokeswoman said. Her cause of death has not been made public, but a statement said the Missouri-born actress had been healthy and active. Roberts' performance as Ray Romano's meddlesome mother in the TV comedy about a dysfunctional family was one of her best-known roles. Roberts pictured with the cast of Everybody Loves Raymond in 2005 Upon hearing of her death, Romano said: ""Doris Roberts had an energy and a spirit that amazed me. She never stopped. ""Whether working professionally or with her many charities, or just nurturing and mentoring a green young comic trying to make it as an actor, she did everything with such a grand love for life and people and I will miss her dearly."" We loved our mom, the great #DorisRoberts. A wonderful, funny, indelible actress and friend. pic.twitter.com/539JOa8EWo During Everybody Loves Raymond's nine-year run, she won the outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series award at the Emmys four times - and was nominated a further three times. In 1983, she also won the outstanding supporting actress in a drama series award for her role in the medical soap opera St Elsewhere. After Everybody Loves Raymond came to an end in 2005, she made guest appearances in other well-known TV shows such as Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives. Phil Rosenthal, who created Everybody Loves Raymond, tweeted: ""We loved our mom, the great Doris Roberts. A wonderful, funny, indelible actress and friend."" She is survived by her son, Michael, and three grandchildren."

Rikki Neave was last seen leaving his home on the Welland Estate in Peterborough to go to school on 28 November, 1994. His naked body was found in nearby woodland the following day. He had been strangled. In June last year, Cambridgeshire Police relaunched an investigation into Rikki's murder and a team of officers and specialists have been methodically building a timeline of the schoolboy's last movements. There was also a national TV appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch programme in November during which detectives said they wanted to talk to two teenage boys over the killing. Rikki's mum Ruth Neave leaving her son's funeral in 1995 The police force said on Tuesday that a man in his 30s from Peterborough had been detained and is in custody. The suspect's age means he was likely to have been a juvenile at the time of Rikki's death. Rikki's mother, Ruth Neave, was charged with murder at the time but found not guilty by a jury. Neave, now aged 45, admitted child neglect and cruelty and was sentenced to seven years in prison. In recent years she has called for Cambridgeshire Police to reinvestigate the murder, saying his killer remains at large. She told a news conference in 2014: ""I loved Rikki, he was a wonderful child. ""I wasn't a perfect mother but I never hurt my children and I should never have admitted to those offences. ""I know people out there think I'm a murderer but I'm determined to prove that somebody else did this to my boy.""

2016-04-19,"Clacton-on-Sea, or its lesser known district of Tendring, may be one of the most Eurosceptic towns in the UK.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160419215915/http://news.sky.com/story/1680911/germans-warn-clacton-on-sea-against-brexit,"Clacton-on-Sea, or its lesser known district of Tendring, may be one of the most Eurosceptic towns in the UK. But it is twinned with a bastion of Europhilia, the town of Biberach in southern Germany. It is hard to imagine a town less like Clacton. Miles inland, rich and open-minded, and staunchly pro-EU. It is partly economics, of course. Europe has been very good to this town. Biberach is in the middle of Europe and in one of its most prosperous regions. It is home to Europe's biggest crane company. BMW, Daimler and Porsche are based nearby. Unemployment is never more than 2 or 3%. Pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim employs more than 5,000 people and has a plant in Bracknell, Berkshire. Plant director Dr Hans Michelberger says they are concerned about the impact Brexit could have on their business and on Britain. He said: ""I'm quite worried because it seems as though they seem somehow to forget this is a global world right now and it is pretty difficult to act in this global world as a single country."" He is not the only one. German economists warn that the German economy could be the worst hit by Brexit. The UK is Germany's third biggest export market and, if the UK leaves, it would have to increase its funding of the EU to make up for the lack of British contributions. Dr Peter Kulitz, Biberach's Chamber of Commerce president, said: ""I'm quite worried about what will happen if Great Britain decides to pull out of the European Union. ""Trade between Germany and the UK totals £90bn a year. Then we have to take into consideration that there are 2,200 German owned companies in Great Britain, employing approximately three and and 50,000 people. ""These figures indicate that companies doing bilateral business have a very strong interest in the United Kingdom staying in the firm."" But it is not just economics that makes Germans here think the British are mad even for thinking of leaving Europe. There is a different mindset. They view Europe and its problems differently, as British expat Gareth Thomas observes. ""Germans on the whole are, 'Yes, there are big problems with Europe, let's fix them,' whereas in Britain, 'Yes, there are big problems, let's leave'."" So while the people of Biberach's twin town Clacton may see refugees and migrants as a threat, here they have celebrated their story. In the town's youth theatre, young Germans and refugees perform together in a play written by a young Syrian. Houzayfa al Rahmoun, who fled the Syrian town of Hama with his family two years ago, has nothing but gratitude for his adoptive nation. ""Right now Europe means everything to me because I've been banished from my country,"" he said. ""It means everything to me because whatever I want to do I can do here because I was banished from my country."" Economics, geography and politics all play a role, and so does history. Wolfgang Grimm has led efforts to twin Biberach with other European nations. As a child he and his family were bombed out of their home in the town Darmstadt by the RAF. Like many in his generation, he sees European unity as a bulwark against war ever returning to the continent. He said: ""We realised the history of Europe and we realised two world wars, and now for the first time we have peace for 70 years and this is an unbelievable achievement, and we should do everything to keep this - and therefore I'm convinced that Europe should come together even closer."""

Harry Greaves told friends he wanted to spend a day by himself on a mountain on 7 April. They expected to see him on 10 April - but the 29-year-old did not return and a search of the mountain area was not successful. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports Britons in crisis abroad, said on Tuesday: ""Overnight we believe that there is a local who has sighted Harry more recently than the last sighting of him - he was heading towards Pisac. ""That is where the search effort is now being concentrated."" The charity added the sighting ""is as confirmed as it can be"". ""It was a local who came forward to friends over there and said this happened,"" a spokesman said. The charity is meeting Mr Greaves' family later and will discuss the possibility of bringing in drones to assist with the search. A crowdfunding page has raised nearly £21,000 to pay for the quest. Mr Greaves, from near Oswestry in Shropshire, flew out to Peru on 20 February and had been travelling while visiting friends in Pisac, near Coscou. The furniture maker's sister said it was ""out of character"" for him to not be in touch for so long."

Philip Hammond made the comments to the House of Commons following media speculation that British special forces were already operating in the country. ""I am clear that there is no appetite in Libya for foreign combat troops on the ground,"" said Mr Hammond, who has just returned from a visit to the country. A newly established Government of National Accord (GNA) is now in power in Tripoli. ""We do not anticipate any requests from the GNA for ground combat forces to take on Daesh (Islamic State) or any other armed groups and we have no plans to deploy troops in such a role,"" Mr Hammond added.   ""I will of course keep the House informed of any plans we develop in the future in response to requests from the Libyan government. ""But the type of mission that we currently envisage would be focused on providing training and technical support away from any frontline operations."" Mr Hammond's visit to Libya was a show of support for prime minister-designate Fayez Sarraj and his new administration. Speculation has been growing that as many as 1,000 British troops may be asked to take part in an international force in the country. The shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, said Labour backed a UN resolution which recognises that member states should provide support to the new Libyan administration as requested. He said he welcomed the establishment of the Libyan Government of National Accord. ""As the Foreign Secretary says, it faces a formidable task in ensuring security, restoring public services, building up the economy and tackling the threat from Daesh,"" Mr Benn said."

The cuts represent 11% of the Norwegian group's UK workforce. It is the latest blow to the North Sea oil industry which has seen thousands of jobs go amid the slump which has seen the price of a barrel of Brent crude fall from more than $115 in June 2014 to less than $30 earlier this year. It is currently around $40. Aker had suspended dividend payments in February and warned market conditions would remain challenging as the slump in prices has led to reduced spending by oil firms. The company said it had begun ""a consultation with employee representatives on reducing its UK subsea workforce capacity because of a continued market slowdown"". David Clark, Aker Solutions' regional head for Europe and Africa, said: ""These are tough but necessary measures to help ensure we stay competitive during a challenging time for our industry."" Aker employs around 15,000 people worldwide including 2,500 based in Britain. The job cuts are part of Aker's plan to reduce costs by shrinking its workforce by 25% compared with mid-2014. Last month it announced 600 jobs would go in its Norwegian subsea engineering and services division. Oil was ahead in the latest session as a strike by Kuwaiti workers cut production. But there was downward pressure on the price earlier this week after major producers meeting in Qatar failed to reach an agreement on trimming output to tackle the global glut of supply that has caused the slump."
2016-04-19,"Eurosceptics have brought down prime ministers, dismantled governments and generally been a thorn in the side of leading politicians for decades.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160419215915/http://news.sky.com/story/1681048/how-age-and-income-may-show-you-back-brexit,"By Harry Carr, Political Analyst Eurosceptics have brought down prime ministers, dismantled governments and generally been a thorn in the side of leading politicians for decades. In finally giving them the referendum they craved, David Cameron has, for now, amplified their voices further. But who are the Eurosceptics, and why do they want to leave the European Union? There are two key groups who tend to support a Brexit: older people and poorer people. The impact of this can be seen in the likes of Clacton - the only parliamentary seat held by UKIP, whose local authority of Tendring is rated as the most Eurosceptic in Britain according to our Sky Data Brexit map. The least Eurosceptic areas of Britain are in yellow, the most in blue In this Essex constituency, there are more pensioners than full-time workers, and more than half of voters are on incomes of less than £15,000 per year. The factors which indicate someone supports a Brexit also manifest themselves in other, less obvious ways. For example, Sky Data analysis shows Waitrose shoppers are more likely to vote Remain, while those who shop at Aldi are more likely to vote Leave. Luxury car owners are more likely to be Europhiles, while those who drive small utility cars tend to be more Eurosceptic. And more obscurely, if you like going fishing, you're more likely to support the Out campaign - with the reverse being true of cinemagoers. The main issue driving Leave supporters is immigration. Two in three Britons (63%) say immigration has had a negative effect on British culture. The EU is also seen as having a particularly negative impact for unskilled British workers, for whom 42% of Britons think the EU is a bad thing, compared with 16% who think it's beneficial. In short, poorer people are worried about their jobs and think their wages are being undercut, while older people feel alienated and intimidated by a multicultural, polylingual Britain that they don't recognise. On the other hand, data from YouGov shows the EU is seen as a good thing for our influence on the world stage, employment in the UK generally, and keeping prices down. For now, neither side is winning the argument on the terrorist threat, nor on the economy - though we shall see if this week's Treasury forecast of a Brexit costing each UK household £4,300 per year has an impact. The fact only half of Britons say they have enough information to make an informed decision suggests that opinions may yet be changed ahead of June's referendum."
2016-04-19,Judges have overturned Government plans to deny legal aid to people who have not lived in the UK continuously for at least 12 months.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160419215915/http://news.sky.com/story/1681022/government-defeated-in-legal-aid-test-plan,"Judges have overturned Government plans to deny legal aid to people who have not lived in the UK continuously for at least 12 months. The Supreme Court announced it is to allow an appeal by campaigners against proposals for a so-called residence test, which they argued restricted access to justice for foreign-born individuals in civil cases. The ruling was a victory for legal charity Public Law Project (PLP), represented by law firm Bindmans. The residence test would have restricted civic legal aid to people who have lived in the UK, Crown dependencies or British overseas territories continuously for a period of at least 12 months at the time they applied for aid. But human rights campaigners had warned the plans would have had a particularly serious impact on recently arrived migrants and their children. Michael Fordham QC, appearing for PLP, argued that Lord Chancellor Michael Gove would be acting beyond his powers if he amended the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. A panel of seven Supreme Court justices agreed and ruled that if implemented the move would constitute an act ultra vires (beyond legal authority). The ruling ends an ongoing controversy which split the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After hearing how the move could impact on vulnerable people, three judges in the High Court initially ruled the plans were unjustifiably discriminatory. But the Court of Appeal, composed of three different judges, subsequently declared in November that the Lord Chancellor did have power to introduce the test by way of secondary legislation, even though withholding legal aid from particular groups might be discriminatory. Government lawyers had argued the country has one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world and the move was necessary to save costs and restore public confidence in the system amid public concern."

The British Medical Association (BMA) said it is attempting to avert the first all-out strike in the history of the NHS. The industrial action is due to begin next Tuesday morning and will see thousands of junior doctors across England withdraw full labour - including emergency care. The BMA's junior doctor committee chairman Dr Johann Malawana has asked for an urgent meeting with health secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said: ""This is a clear offer in a bid to avert industrial action. Simply put, if the Government agrees to lift the imposition, junior doctors will call off next week's action."" In a letter to Mr Hunt, Dr Malawana said the ""imposition of this contract is tremendously damaging to the morale of junior doctors and medical students and has resulted in a complete breakdown of trust between doctors and the Government"". He added: ""I believe that your decision in February to give up on negotiations and impose a contract, reiterated in the House of Commons yesterday, marks a watershed in relations with the profession, but I am happy to meet or discuss this offer with you at any time between now and the start of next week's industrial action."" Mr Hunt's opponents say there is uncertainty over whether Mr Hunt has the legal right to force trainees to accept new terms and conditions, which have led to four strikes. But in the Commons on Monday Mr Hunt said: ""Yes, we are imposing a new contract and we are doing it with the greatest of regret because the BMA refused to talk over three years, with three independent processes."" He said that maternity units, intensive care units and emergency departments will be at ""most risk"" when junior doctors stage their strike. He described the full walk-out as a bridge the NHS has ""never crossed before"", adding that ""no-one wants there to be any kind of tragedy"". Junior doctors will fully withdraw labour between the hours of 8am and 5pm on 26 and 27 April - with no emergency care cover."

During a speech in Buffalo, a slip of the tongue meant he referred to the September 11 atrocity as ""7-Eleven"", which is in fact the name of a popular chain of convenience stores. Failing to correct himself after the gaffe, the Republican front runner said: ""It's very close to my heart because I was down there, and I watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11, down at the World Trade Center right after it came down, and I saw the greatest people I've ever seen in action."" The mistake could prove embarrassing for Mr Trump as he has repeatedly mentioned the terror attacks while campaigning across New York, his home state. Earlier this month, he also paid his first visit to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. An estimated 11,000 people were attending the rally at a hockey arena - and earlier in his speech, about a dozen protesters interrupted him by locking arms and sitting down on the stadium's floor. Authorities carried out some of the demonstrators by their arms and legs. Mr Trump told supporters that ""no New Yorker"" could vote for his rival Ted Cruz, as he didn't represent what the state needs. The businessman also expressed confidence that he would secure the 1,237 delegates required for him to become the party's presidential nominee, despite claims that he may fall short - leading to a contested convention. In the run-up to Monday night's speech, Mr Trump was widely predicted to win comfortably during the contest in New York, which has 95 Republican delegates up for grabs."

Results of the groundbreaking study reveal the cocktail of two drugs can wipe out all traces of melanoma in more than one in five patients, even if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Doctors have hailed the findings as ""very promising"". The latest figures show more than 14,500 people in the UK developed melanoma in 2013, and 2,100 died. Doctors gave 142 patients with advanced melanoma either the drug ipilimumab alone or in combination with a similar treatment called nivolumab. Results of the study, called CheckMate, show 69% of patients given the combination were alive two years later, compared to 53% of those given ipilimumab alone. And even more dramatically, the tumour was destroyed in 22% of patients when the two drugs were used together. None of the patients who were given just ipilimumab had such a remarkable response. Dr James Larkin, consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden Hospital said: ""Combining these two immunotherapies is an effective two-pronged attack against the cancer. ""The overall survival rates … are very promising and provide further hope for patients and their families affected by this disease."" The findings were revealed at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. The two drugs block the tumour's ability to neutralise key cells in the immune system, and the strategy allows the body to mount an all-out assault on the cancer. But the combination has not yet been approved for use in the UK. Ipilimumab has a list price of £63,000 for a course of just four infusions, while nivolumab costs £5,700 a month and is taken long term. Dr Aine McCarthy from Cancer Research UK said: ""We know both of these drugs are already available individually on the NHS so the next stage is to see whether the combination will be approved. ""With more clinical trials we can make sure the right patients get treatment, confirm it is safe and effective, and then think about the costs."" Lucy Davis, 39, said the drug combination had been ""extraordinarily successful."" The mother-of-two told Sky News: ""At my previous hospital, I was told I had months not years to live. ""It's two-and-a-half years later and I'm still very much here and feeling really quite well at the moment. ""I just wish everyone had access to this."""

Around half a million seven-year-olds were due to take the Key Stage 1 grammar, punctuation and spelling test as part of Sats assessments in May. But the test was cancelled after ""human error"" led to it being accidentally uploaded as a sample on the Department for Education website. The blunder was only noticed this week when teacher Charlotte Smiles conducted a trial of the exam and a pupil appeared to know all the answers. ""During Wednesday's test one of the children appeared to know the spellings that were being read out,"" she told Sky News. ""So we did a little bit of extra research … and found the test paper had actually been published on the DfE website."" Ms Smiles said she was ""frustrated"" to learn that the paper had been online since January.  ""We are actually held to some quite stringent security measures when administering and storing these papers and we aren’t allowed to break those. ""If it was us that had published that paper … we could have lost our jobs. She called on the DfE not only to reassess its security measures, but to reconsider the test as a whole, which she said has been ""widely criticised"".  ""The spelling, punctuation and grammar test has ... been a bone of contention amongst educators and authors and for it to be this test, it just seems laughable."" The blunder has prompted a fierce backlash against assessment in primary schools, with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers labelling it ""farcical"", while the National Union of Teachers called for the whole assessment to be cancelled. Schools Minister Nick Gibb responded by saying the incident was ""clearly regrettable"" and that this year's pupils would not have to sit the spelling test. He said: ""To remove any uncertainty and clarify the situation for schools, I have decided that we will remove the requirement on them to administer the Key Stage 1 grammar, punctuation and spelling test for this year only. ""Schools will still need to submit a teacher assessment judgement based on pupils' work in the classroom as has always been the case. ""However there will be no requirement this year for them to administer the KS1 grammar, punctuation and spelling test or use the result as part of that assessment. ""Our immediate inquiry has shown none of the other KS1 test papers have been affected by this error."" The Standards and Testing Agency said it has launched an urgent investigation into the incident. Chief executive Jennifer Coupland said: ""We believe this issue has arisen as a result of human error by a member of staff within the agency and a failure to follow appropriate clearance processes. ""An immediate review is under way to establish the precise facts and we would like to apologise to schools and parents for any distress caused."""

The refugees are in addition to the 20,000 Syrians David Cameron has already agreed to house in Britain but, crucially, will not be taken from migrant camps in Europe. Earlier this year Mr Cameron was branded ""heartless"" after refusing to take 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees from the European camps on the grounds that it would make them a ""magnet"" for those making the dangerous sea crossing to Europe. :: PM 'Heartless' For Rejecting Syrian Children Gov't statement today has nothing new to help lone #childrefugees in Europe.

All of the children will be brought to Britain by 2020 under the scheme which the Government claims is the ""largest resettlement programme in the world"" for children from the Middle East and north Africa. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ""The UK Government is committed to providing life-saving support and assistance to the vulnerable children who have been unjustly impacted by this ongoing humanitarian crisis.

However, Labour's Yvette Cooper said: ""This is the same announcement as the Government made back in January and includes nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse."" The Government will be working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to resettle the children and their families. The UNHCR representative to the UK, Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, said: ""We welcome the scheme's focus on children at risk, including unaccompanied and separated children, and the UK's commitment to upholding the principles of child protection and the child's best interest, in implementing the programme."" Anne Longfield, Children's Commissioner for England, said: ""In the UK they will be provided with the vital protection and support they need. ""Other countries in Europe also need to fulfil their moral and legal responsibilities to child migrants, providing protection and immediate care for children in their countries and helping them to reunite with close family members."""

The Hello singer topped The Sunday Times' 2016 line-up of wealthy under-30s after amassing a personal fortune of £85m. That figure has risen from £35m last year thanks to the release of her first album since 2011. It was a resounding win, with the singer's nearest rival Ed Sheeran, 25, a distant second with a fortune of £45m. The 27-year-old's wealth also saw her safely into 30th place in the paper's list of the Top 50 music millionaires in Britain and Ireland, above artists including Sir Cliff Richard, Gary Barlow and Kylie Minogue. The only other female artist above her on that list was Irishwoman Enya, with a fortune of £91m. Ian Coxon, who has edited the Sunday Times Rich List for 20 years, said he expected Adele's fortune to continue to grow. ""Adele is only 27 so I would see her getting in the main list of the richest 1,000 in a couple of years - she is only £15 to £20m away now,"" he said. Adele made her debut on the under-30s list in 2011 in ninth place, behind stars such as Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Katherine Jenkins. But by the following year she was number one, a spot she has held onto ever since. The singer has previously said that money does not mean too much to her and that she has turned down lucrative offers in the past. Earlier this year she made history at the Brits when she picked up four trophies in total - for best female solo artist, Brits global success award, best single for Hello and British album of the year for 25 - an achievement only equalled by Blur in 1995. The 10 richest young musicians in Britain and Ireland: 1. Adele £85m 2. Ed Sheeran £45m 3. Niall Horan £33m 4. Liam Payne £33m 5. Louis Tomlinson £33m 6. Harry Styles £33m 7.

The President said a free trade arrangement would not happen ""any time soon"" in the event of Brexit. Speaking alongside Prime Minister David Cameron at the Foreign Office, he said: ""I think it's fair to say that maybe some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement. ""But it's not going to happen any time soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done. ""The UK is going to be in the back of the queue."" Trying to do ""piecemeal trade agreements"" was ""hugely inefficient"", the President said. He added, however, that the referendum was a decision for the British people and his comments were ""not a threat"" or an attempt to ""fix any votes"". He was speaking after his comments in the Daily Telegraph urging the UK to stay in the Union triggered a furious row. The remarks enraged many Tory eurosceptics, but delighted pro-EU campaigners. President Obama again made no bones about his views as he faced reporters at the Foreign Office. He said the matter was of of ""deep interest"" to the US and that the UK was at its best when helping lead Europe. ""It leverages UK power to be part of the European Union. I don't believe the EU moderates British influence in the world, it magnifies it,"" said President Obama. David Cameron told reporters ""it surely makes sense to listen to what our friends think, to listen to their opinion"". He also pointed to the UK's ""absolutely leading part"" in current negotiations between the EU and the US on setting up the ""biggest trade deal in the whole world"". Analysis: Will Obama's Lyrical EU Plea Help Remain? Writing in The Telegraph on Friday, the President said the sacrifice of his country's soldiers in Europe during the Second World War amplified America's stake in the debate. He wrote: ""Our special relationship was forged as we spilled blood together on the battlefield."" But his intervention ignited fury among Leave campaigners, including Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who accused the President of ""hypocrisy"". Mr Johnson said: ""It is a fact that America guards its sovereignty with such hysterical jealousy... ""It is paradoxical, inconsistent and incoherent that we are being urged every week to send £350m of our money to Brussels. ""What you have is a situation where the Government is ringing round every other friendly government saying 'we are in a bit of a spot, can you say something positive about the EU?'"" The London mayor also caused further controversy by referring to the President as ""part-Kenyan"" while suggesting he has a reason for disliking the UK. It comes as a Sky Data Snap Poll found that the majority of respondents thought Mr Obama should not intervene in the debate. Gallery: Sky Poll: Obama's EU Vote Intervention The majority of respondents to a Sky Data Snap Poll say Mr Obama should not have intervened on in the debate over whether the UK should leave the EU When asked whether he should or should not intervene, 29% said he 'should', 60% said he 'should not', and 10% said they 'don't know'. Sky Data also asked whether Barack Obama’s support for Britain to remain in the EU made them more or less likely to vote to remain, with 25% saying 'more', 17% saying 'less', and 57% saying that it would make 'no difference'. President Obama began Friday with lunch at Windsor Castle with the Queen and Prince Philip. The President and his wife Michelle were greeted by the Royals outside the castle. They were driven into the courtyard by the 95-year-old Duke of Edinburgh - a ride President Obama later described as ""very smooth"". This evening, the President will attend a dinner hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. :: For the Sky Data Snap Poll, Sky interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,050 Sky customers by SMS on 21 April 2016.

The 23-year-old woman and her partner, 25, had just left the Goose Green Club on Saturday 9 April when they saw a man being attacked by two other men. The woman's partner walked towards the men and shouted at them to stop, at which point the two men turned on him and started punching him. She was then also punched after shouting at the pair, leaving her with ""life-changing injuries"". The attackers ran off in the direction of the club and the original victim also fled. The woman was taken to hospital where she was operated on, but now it has been confirmed that she has permanently lost the sight in her left eye. Her partner received bruises and a cut to his right hand. Detective Constable Brian Johnston, from GMP's Wigan division, said: ""This couple are completely innocent and it is heartbreaking that, as a result of them simply trying to help someone else in distress, this woman has now been left with life-changing injuries and is blind in one eye. ""If you were the man being assaulted by these two men, then please get in touch with the police, as you may be able to help us identify these two offenders so we can take these men off our streets."" The first man is described as aged 20 to 30, with a peculiar haircut - the side shaved and the middle left long. He was wearing a white T-shirt and jeans. The second man is also said to be aged 20 to 30. Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 7182 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

David Lakatos, who is 30 and from Peterborough, was found hiding under his duvet when police raided his home in December. Each of his victims was homeless and vulnerable when approached at a railway station in Nove Zamky, Slovakia, and offered a home and work in the UK. But when they arrived, they were exploited - sent to work in food packaging factories without proper clothing and given just £1 of the wages they earned per hour. Detective Inspector Jenny Bristow said: ""I must recognise the bravery of the victims and thank them for putting their trust in the police. ""This case sends a strong message that we take modern slavery very seriously and we will do all we can to protect vulnerable victims from this type of crime, which is all too often still hidden from public view."" Officers from Cambridgeshire Police were told how Lakatos had assisted the victims to get national insurance numbers and bank accounts, but he would then keep all the documents. The workers were only fed once a day - usually leftovers - and had limited access to bathroom facilities in the main house. At times, they would also face violence and abuse. Lakatos, who spends part of his time in Britain and the rest in Slovakia, pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to facilitate the entry into the UK for the purpose of exploitation, two charges of battery and two charges of fraud at Huntingdon Crown Court. He has been sentenced to a total of six years and nine months in prison for his crimes, which took place between 2010 and 2015. His mother Maria Lakatosova, aged 51, of Highbury Street, Peterborough, pleaded guilty to benefits fraud, after claiming money under the name of one of her son's victims. She received a six month prison sentence. The case forms part of a wider investigation into modern slavery in Peterborough, known as Operation Launch, which has seen 36 arrests since April 2015."

A report by the Department for Transport on nitrogen oxide levels revealed that none of the 37 top-selling diesel vehicles met the legal level of 180mg/km when observed out on the road. But a spokesman for motor industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the difference between results from laboratory tests and those performed in the real world were ""well known"". Cars that met Euro 5 standards, which could be sold up to September last year, were all ""substantially higher"" in real-world conditions than the measurements recorded in the laboratory, according to the research. The worst performer was the Vauxhall Insignia, which emitted more than 1,800 mg/km. Even the best performer, the Citroen C4, was found to emit around three times the legal laboratory level. Real-world emissions tests will be introduced next year, although diesel cars will at first be allowed to pollute more than double the current legal level because of their limited ability to reduce real-world emissions in the short term. Cars that meet the current Euro 6 standards have to comply with 80 mg/km NOx limits in laboratory tests, but in real-world driving for 90 minutes on normal roads the average level recorded was six times higher. The Peugeot 3008 was found to perform the worst, at around 13 times higher. The £1m investigation found no evidence of car manufacturers other than Volkswagen fitting devices to cheat emissions tests. But the study did reveal the widespread use of systems to prevent engine damage, which can also lead to higher emissions in the real-world when the temperature is lower than during the approved laboratory test. VW admitted last September that 482,000 of its diesel vehicles in the US had been fitted with software to switch engines to a cleaner mode when they were being tested for emissions. The German-based firm said some 11 million vehicles were affected worldwide - including almost 1.2 million in the UK. :: VW Agrees Huge US Settlement In 'Dieselgate' Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ""Our tests published today have not detected evidence of manipulation of emissions lab tests as used by the VW Group by any other car manufacturer."" He added: ""The UK has been leading in Europe in pushing for real-world emissions tests which will address this problem. ""Real-world tests will be introduced next year to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and give consumers confidence in the performance of their cars. ""Following the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the whole of the automotive industry must work hard to restore public trust by being transparent about the systems they employ and advancing plans for introducing cleaner engine technology."" Transport Minister Robert Goodwill insisted the manufacturers ""have not done anything illegal"" by using engine management systems which cut emissions outside of the laboratory. On the real-world emissions observed, he said: ""What's been disappointing is the levels of non-compliance have been higher than we'd expected."" Mr Goodwill continued: ""It's a bit like, you can pass your driving test on the day that you're being very careful but then in the real world it's slightly different. ""That's the difficulty that we face."""

Sir Terry said he believes plants like the one in Port Talbot, south Wales, can return to profit, and is backing a bid which could potentially save thousands of jobs. He was speaking after the UK and Welsh governments said they were prepared to take a stake of up to 25% to support a future takeover of the company. Sir Terry said: ""I think I would (put up his own money), and I mean not that I have to, if something's a good deal for financial investors, it's not difficult to finance."" He added: ""Is it a good investment? Can you get a good future out of it? We believe the answer is very much yes. It's not no. It's very much yes. And so it makes sense."" The Prime Minister's official spokeswoman earlier said the cash on offer would be given in the form of debt financing. ""It would be supporting a potential buyer in order to keep the operation safe,"" she said. ""We would work alongside a potential buyer to make sure that the Government is doing what it could to support a viable sale. ""If we were to take an extra stake it would be a minority one with the aim of supporting the purchaser in delivering a long term future for the business, we are certainly not seeking to be controlling the company."" The announcement follows a second meeting between Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Tata Global Chairman Cyrus Mistry this week in Mumbai, India, where progress on the sales process was discussed. Tata is selling its entire loss-making UK business and has asked for expressions of interest as part of the negotiation process. The steel crisis has been driven by falling prices and a global oversupply. In the UK, high energy costs and cheaper Chinese imports have exacerbated the issue. On Wednesday, Stuart Wilkie, managing director of the Tata's Strip Products division, started approaching workers about launching a bid to buy out the works. He was believed to be seeking a contribution of up to £10,000 from interested employees. It is understood the proposal is based around a rescue deal which was rejected by the firm's board in Mumbai last month. About £100m in investment could be needed in total, and the revitalised company would aim to generate profits of £100m per year."

Two people had legs amputated after the collision on the Smiler ride in June last year, while three others suffered life-changing injuries. The five victims all attended court to hear Merlin Attractions Ltd indicate a guilty plea to a charge of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Details of the crash and what went wrong were also revealed to the court.  Vicky Balch, Leah Washington (C) and Joe Pugh Bernard Thorogood, for the Health and Safety Executive, said its case was that the ride's operatives ""overrode"" the controlling computer system. In doing so, they failed to spot a stationary train on the track, sending another crashing into it.  Merlin's counsel Simon Antrobus said: ""The company is accepting additional reasonable and practicable measures could have been taken to guard against the safety risk that arose on the day."" The carriage the injured riders were in collided with a stationary car on the ride. District Judge Jack McGarva, sitting at North Staffordshire justice centre, warned that the company ""may be ordered to pay a very large fine"". He ordered the case be moved to Stafford Crown Court for sentencing, on a date to be fixed, due to the gravity of the offence.  Speaking outside the court, a lawyer for the victims said the guilty plea was ""a milestone along the way to psychological rehabilitation"".  Paul Paxton said: ""Given that such serious injuries could be sustained on a fun day out, it is hardly surprising that a criminal offence was committed. ""However, it is comforting for the families that a plea of guilty has been entered rather than the victims having to endure a drawn out trial"".  The guilty plea comes after an internal investigation by Merlin had already resulted in the company accepting responsibility for the crash. It has since cut jobs at Alton Towers, citing a slump in visitor numbers but reopened the Smiler ride last month - nine months after the accident. Bosses said they had ""sought to learn every possible lesson to help ensure there is no repeat of what happened"". Two teenage passengers - Vicky Balch and Leah Washington - each lost a leg in the aftermath of the accident. Their carriage collided with a stationary car on the ride. Miss Washington's boyfriend, Joe Pugh, broke both knees and endured extensive hand injuries, Daniel Thorpe suffered a fractured leg and a punctured lung, and mother-of-two Chanda Singh suffered internal bleeding."
2016-04-22,"Overweight patients and smokers are becoming ""soft targets"" for NHS savings, the Royal College of Surgeons has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160422165423/http://news.sky.com/story/1683129/overweight-people-soft-targets-for-nhs-cuts,"By Thomas Moore, Health Correspondent Overweight patients and smokers are becoming ""soft targets"" for NHS savings, the Royal College of Surgeons has warned. More than a third of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England are denying or delaying routine surgery to patients until they lose weight or stop smoking, according to a report by the organisation. The practice, which affects common procedures such as hip and knee replacements, contravenes national clinical guidance. Clare Marx, president of the college, said: ""Blanket bans that deny or delay patients' access to surgery are wrong. ""NHS surgical treatment should be based on clinical guidance and patients should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. ""In some cases patients might need surgery in order to help them to do exercise and lose weight."" According to the college, 34% of the 200 health bodies that took part in the Freedom of Information survey had policies restricting access to surgery by body mass index (BMI) or smoking status. More than a fifth set mandatory weight limits on patients who can be referred for hip or knee replacements - an increase on the 13% who imposed restrictions in 2014. ""While it is difficult to categorically prove such policies are aimed at saving money, it is unlikely to be a coincidence that many financially challenged CCGs are restricting access to surgery,"" said Miss Marx. ""Our worry is that smokers and overweight patients are becoming soft targets for NHS savings."" Luton CCG requires a patient's BMI to be under 30 - the cut-off for obesity - or they have to be referred for weight management before they qualify for surgery. And North East Essex CCG requires smokers to go to 'quit classes' prior to surgery. Tim Wilton, president of the British Orthopaedic Association, said ""management dictat"" had no place in clinical care. ""There is no clinical, or value for money, justification for refusing to fund hip or knee replacements based on BMI or smoker status,"" he said. ""Good outcomes can be achieved for patients regardless of whether they smoke or are obese, even at BMIs of over 50, and these surgeries are highly cost effective: typically delivering sustained pain relief for a cost that equates to just £7.50 a week. ""Hard-and-fast rules also undermine the NHS's ability to involve patients in decisions about their own care."" Heidi Alexander MP, Labour's shadow health secretary, said the report was further evidence of the financial crisis in the NHS. ""It's utterly unacceptable for people to be waiting in pain and discomfort for an operation because of an arbitrary restriction, which isn't in the best interest of their own or the nation's health,"" she said."
2016-04-22,"If President Obama had come to the UK and simply said what we thought he was going to say, it would have had very little impact.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160422165423/http://news.sky.com/story/1683455/will-obamas-lyrical-eu-plea-help-remain,"If President Obama had come to the UK and simply said what we thought he was going to say, it would have had very little impact. Last week his deputy National Security Advisor, Ben Rhodes, suggested the President ""will make it clear it is a decision for the people of the UK to make, not ours"", but he would ""offer his view if he is asked"". So if, in a press Conference, the President had offered a view that Britain should remain within the EU, tempered with something like ""it’s not my place to interfere"", then the point would be made, but it would hardly sway votes.     The fact is he has gone much further. Rather than waiting to be asked, he has written an article in the Telegraph which is full of his trademark lyrical and emotional language, and his message could influence votes. Firstly he defends his right to intervene by using the thought-provoking image of American soldiers who sacrificed their lives on European soil and now ""rest in Europe's cemeteries… a silent testament to just how intertwined our prosperity and security truly are"". The evocative language could have been penned by The West Wing's Sam Seaborn. To the President's credit he actually puts forward – hitherto hardly seen – positive messages about the EU, which he argues doesn't moderate Britain's influence ""it magnifies it"". Although his intervention is being conveyed by much of the media as ""a warning"" – his article titled ""As your friend, I tell you that the EU makes Britain even greater"", is more a celebration of the European Union's achievements and how that reflects on Britain. Does it make a difference to British voters? A Sky Data Snap Poll taken mostly before the President wrote the article suggests 60% of people think he shouldn't intervene compared to 29% who think he should. But asked if his support made people more or less likely to vote to remain in the UK, 25% said it would sway them towards staying in while 17% said it would make them less likely. That's a win for the Remainers.  As far as the Out campaign is concerned, Mr Obama has over-stepped the mark and is patronising the British public. Boris Johnson counters Obama's shared wartime history pitch with a story of the President seemingly moving a bust of Sir Winston Churchill from the Oval Office – and controversially writes: ""Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British Empire, of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender."" The London mayor also strongly argues that ""American's wouldn't contemplate anything like the EU"" for themselves. He gives examples of America refusing to recognise the jurisdiction of the International court, or signing up to certain international conventions, concluding that the US ""guards its democracy with more hysterical jealousy than any other country on earth"". Out campaigners are furious because Mr Obama's comments really could play into the debate. We haven't seen this kind of article from Angela Merkel or Francois Hollande – and we probably won't because it is too easy to see the self-interest. With President Obama, self-interest is certainly a factor but it is less clear. People might well see it as friendly advice; he has respect in the UK and his country is the UK's most powerful ally and an important trading partner. All this matters if he is expressing not just an opinion in response to a question but proactively laying out an argument for Britain to remain."

A witness told how Amy Inita Joyner-Francis was fatally injured in a confrontation with a number of other girls at the school in Wilmington, Delaware, when she hit her head on a sink. Police have not released any details about what happened in the toilets at Howard High School of Technology, but homicide detectives have interviewed several students and two girls were taken in for further questioning, Wilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said.  School was dismissed after the incident on Thursday morning but was due to resume on Friday with a shortened day to provide counselling for the victim's traumatised classmates. The victim was taken out of school on a stretcher. Pic: 6ABC Hundreds of students and community activists attended a vigil outside the school on Thursday night. Friends and classmates flooded social media with posts expressing their shock and sharing memories, using the hashtag #RIPAmy. One of Amy's friends, Shytera Dawkins, said she was an energetic and bubbly person who looked forward to graduating from high school. She told Delaware Online: ""All I wanted to do with my friend was walk across the stage and get our diplomas. ""And now that dream is taken away because she's not there. ""This was like the first time that someone died over a fight. ""Amy is a good girl who gets good grades who stays out of trouble. For them to fight, it's just wow, a shocker for everybody."" Nik Stryminski said Amy had stepped in to prevent him from getting into a fight at school in the past. He said: ""It's not even like she went in there to fight. She went in there to talk things out."" City councilman Nnamdi Chukwuocha told Delaware Online fights among young women were not uncommon. He said: ""Some of the worst fights I've seen in the community have been with the females. ""We need to address the needs of the young women. As of right now, I don't think we're doing that."""
2016-04-22,A post-mortem examination has begun to determine what caused the death of pop superstar Prince.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160422165423/http://news.sky.com/story/1683146/prince-autopsy-set-to-determine-how-he-died,"A post-mortem examination has begun to determine what caused the death of pop superstar Prince. It follows reports on TMZ that the 57-year-old underwent treatment for a drug overdose just days before his passing. Quoting multiple sources, the website says Prince left hospital against the advice of doctors. He was found unresponsive and alone in an elevator at his complex in Paisley Park, Minnesota, on Thursday. The emergency services attempted CPR on arrival but could not revive the singer-songwriter. Gallery: Prince: Watch Our Special Programme As tributes came from the likes of Madonna and Barack Obama, shocked fans have laid bouquets and purple balloons outside his home. Hundreds of people braved the rain to mourn and celebrate the life and work of the music icon - and his sister, Tyka Nelson, came outside to tell the crowd: ""He loved all of you. Thank you for loving him back."" An all-night dance party was held in Prince's honour at the Minneapolis nightclub where he filmed Purple Rain. In New York, roughly 1,000 people attended an impromptu street party organised by Spike Lee - wearing purple and dancing along as Prince's music played from loudspeakers. At a news conference in London, president Obama paid tribute to Prince as an ""extraordinary"" performer.  Gallery: Pop Genius Prince: The Purple Life Prince's publicist has confirmed the music icon was found dead at his Minneapolis home He revealed he played Purple Rain and Delirious on a turntable at the US ambassador's London residence this morning to ""warm up"" for the day's bilateral meetings. A transcript has emerged of the frantic 911 call made by someone inside the superstar's compound, in which they said: ""The person is dead here … and the people are distraught."" When asked by an operator for the address, the caller appeared confused and said: ""Um, we're at Prince's house."" Barely a week before his unexpected death, Prince had become unwell during a flight and his private jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Illinois. He is understood to have spent a few hours in a hospital in Moline before leaving and returning to his home. Prince cancelled two shows because of ill health in the run-up to his death. :: Prince's Legacy: The Master Of Reinvention Medical examiners have warned it could be days before they have preliminary findings from the post-mortem examination, and weeks for toxicology results. Officials at the Carver County Sheriff's Office are investigating the circumstances of his death, and say foul play ""is neither suspected nor not suspected"". Prince's passing has stunned the music industry - dominating the world's newspapers and prompting other artists to pay tribute. Jennifer Hudson and stars of Broadway's The Color Purple performed a rendition of Purple Rain on Thursday night and posted a video online. His first wife, Mayte Garcia, told People magazine Prince was her ""everything"". They were married in 1996, and in that year, they lost their son a week after he was born with a rare genetic disorder. :: Prince Joins Long List Of Stars To Die In 2016 ""I loved him then, I love him now and will love him eternally.

Chris Spiegel, who attended one of the intimate performances Prince regularly performed at Paisley Park, said: ""We were in there and he performed until 3am, it was so special. He shook my hand. ""It's just very sad that he's gone. We were very proud of him."" The nation's favourite Prince song is Purple Rain, according to a Sky Data poll.

Up to a point.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160422165423/http://news.sky.com/story/1682829/boris-has-a-point-about-obama-eu-intervention,"Boris Johnson is right, of course. Up to a point. Most Americans, including their President, wouldn't dream of signing up to a project like the European Union. Being sucked in to a sprawling Euro monster of big government, riddled with European socialists, swallowing up the sovereignty of free nations? Enough to curdle the blood of any right thinking American. It's true. Barack Obama is coming to tell us to stay in something he, and many of his countrymen, would never be a part of. :: Obama Flies In To Call For UK To Stay In EU Officially that's not the main reason for his visit. The White House says: ""If he's asked his view as a friend, he will offer it."" But he won't need much asking.  Washington is worried. US officials have long been exasperated by the fact this referendum is even happening - as they were with the one on Scotland.  A close ally risking one union was unfortunate but then jeopardising an even bigger one? Unforgivably careless. Simply put, they see Europe as a stronger partner if Britain stays in. It is not just the danger of Brexit but the possible domino effect of other nations leaving the EU, should it happen. America needs a strong united partner to tackle the challenges of an uncertain future: turmoil in the Middle East, rising economic giants like China and India, and, most importantly in the mind of President Obama, climate change. :: 100 Things About The EU Eurosceptics may argue that the European project is only likely to deliver greater economic failure, political polarisation and division.  But most in the US government don't seem to share that outlook.  So, the EU may be anathema to many Americans in theory but in practice their leaders are glad it exists and want Britain to stay in. That is ""exorbitant outrageous hypocrisy"" says the Mayor of London. But note there are limits to his principled outrage. He has not pilloried Obama for being welcomed by the Queen. As US president, Obama leads a meritocratic democracy and represents its values abroad. Britain's unelected head of state owes her position entirely to hereditary privilege. But far from calling for her role to be abolished, he's meeting her for lunch then her children for dinner. Even worse, he'll have just flown in from Saudi Arabia after being hosted by the leader of an authoritarian regime that beheads people every other day. It is realpolitik. Seeing the world for what it is and pursuing your national interests, as Boris knows full well. But he also knows that knocking Americans can be good politics. Remember Mitt Romney having a go at London's readiness for the Olympics?  Disastrous for him, brilliant for Boris. Brits resent Yanks coming over here and sticking their oar in, even celebrity presidents like Obama.  He will want to choose his words carefully. But Boris won't want to over-egg it, either."
2016-04-22,Greenpeace has threatened the prospect of legal action if state aid is granted to enable French energy firm EDF to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160422165423/http://news.sky.com/story/1683409/hinkley-point-c-faces-state-aid-legal-threat,"Greenpeace has threatened the prospect of legal action if state aid is granted to enable French energy firm EDF to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. The environmental campaign group and green energy firm Ecotricity have published what they say is independent legal opinion that a package of support for the company from the French government would be against EU law. A final investment decision on the £18bn Hinkley Point C project has yet to be taken, despite assurances from EDF that the Somerset plant will be built. Funding appears to be the only issue delaying the start - with EDF Energy's chief executive telling MPs in March it had been a ""long road"" to clear regulatory and other hurdles and a positive decision would be taken ""soon"". It is expected in May as cash talks continue in France. EDF has invested almost £2.5bn so far and is unwilling to write off that sum. But Greenpeace and Ecotricity said they could go to court and lodge a complaint with the European Commission if the French state - a majority shareholder in EDF - provides financial assistance. The legal opinion, by competition and EU law barristers from Monckton Chambers, said reported refinancing plans for EDF were likely to be illegal unless they are approved by the Commission. Dale Vince, Ecotricity founder, said: ""Illegal state aid is one thing, and we'll work with Greenpeace to challenge that if it happens, but it's not just financial issues, there are technical problems with Hinkley Point too. ""EDF are yet to build one of these reactors and their first two attempts are, between them, sixteen years late and billions over budget."" EDF declined to comment. Hinkley would be the first nuclear power plant to be built in Britain in two decades. EDF is financing two-thirds of the project with the rest coming from Chinese investment. The Chinese input has proved controversial in some quarters on security grounds while the Government's commitment to a new nuclear mix within the UK's energy future has also drawn sharp criticism on environmental and cost grounds. Greenpeace has accused ministers of abandoning support for renewables ""in favour of propping up an ailing state-owned nuclear industry in France."""

It comes after the Supreme Court in London was told the man's family would suffer ""devastating consequences"" if an injunction preventing him from being named was lifted. A lawyer representing the man, who has ""young"" children, said this would still be the case even though he has already been identified abroad and online. Desmond Browne QC said there would be a ""storm of harassment"" if the injunction was discharged. Supreme Court justices have been hearing a challenge by the celebrity - referred to as PJS - against a decision by the Court of Appeal that an order barring The Sun on Sunday from naming him should no longer apply. Earlier this year the newspaper sought to publish an account of the man's alleged sexual activities, but he argued he had a right to privacy and took legal action. The newspaper won the first round in January when a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction. Two Court of Appeal judges later issued a ban protecting the man. But on Monday, three appeal judges ruled it should be lifted following representations from the tabloid's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN). It argued the ban should end because the celebrity had been named in articles abroad - outside the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales - and his name could be found on the internet. NGN maintains it would be in the public interest for it to publish the story and measures could be taken to protect the children. Ultimately, it says, the case is about balancing rights. Judges have revealed the man is in the entertainment business and that his spouse - referred to as YMA - is also well-known in the industry, and the couple have ""young"" children. The Supreme Court president has said he and his fellow justices will give their decision ""as soon as we can"". In the meantime, the injunction will remain in place."

Paul Mallin, 51, armed himself with a meat cleaver and 10in (25cm) carving knife before attacking Karen Reid, 53, and John Down at the sheltered housing complex where they all lived. The sheltered housing complex in Ilford, east London After he was arrested, police found more than 300 internet searches on poison in Mallin's flat, including ""Ricin - Breaking Bad"" - an apparent reference to the hit TV show about a teacher turned drug dealer. Mallin denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which was accepted by the prosecution in light of reports on his mental state. The Old Bailey heard Mallin's relationship with wheelchair-bound Ms Reid, who had a muscle-wasting condition, had ended in February last year. She then met Mr Down, who had moved into the complex in Ilford, east London, after breaking his hip in a fall and the couple got engaged and moved in together. Judge Richard Marks QC told Mallin: ""You had become increasingly bitter and resentful at the way things had turned out leading to considerable friction between you and them."" He told the defendant that his was a ""sad life characterised by loneliness, isolation and inadequacy"" which had made it hard for him to accept Ms Reid's rejection. In April 2015, Mallin had argued with Ms Reid and stabbed the wall of Mr Down's flat with a knife after becoming upset about gifts he had bought her in the past. The following month, the defendant was punched in the face by a member of Ms Reid's family although no charges were brought, the court heard. Just hours before the killing on 5 September last year, the defendant became upset in the lounge area. He said: ""I want to kill them"" after claiming Ms Reid told him she hated him, the court heard. Later that evening, an agency staff worker found Mr Down's blood-stained door ajar and then saw Mallin standing over Ms Reid, repeatedly stabbing her with the carving knife. When asked what he was doing, he replied: ""I have stabbed them both."" Police found Mr Down slumped behind his front door with multiple stab wounds to the body, neck and stomach. His dentures were found on the floor beside him. Ms Reid was sitting in an armchair opposite him, also fatally injured. The judge said it was an aggravating feature of the case that she would have seen and heard the brutal attack on her partner before Mallin turned his violent attentions to her. Mallin had never had a job and had suffered from depression, anxiety and schizoid personality disorder, the court heard.  He appeared tearful and red-faced and there were angry shouts of ""I will never forgive you"" and ""we'll be waiting for you"" from the public gallery as he was sent down."

2016-04-25,A 'poison garden' growing plants containing strychnine and morphine is being used to teach teenagers about the dangers of drugs.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160425131631/http://news.sky.com/story/1684155/poison-garden-teaches-teens-drug-dangers,"By Gerard Tubb, North of England Correspondent A 'poison garden' growing plants containing strychnine and morphine is being used to teach teenagers about the dangers of drugs. The Alnwick Garden in Northumberland is offering local schools free guided tours of its most dangerous plants as part of a structured drugs awareness programme. The ornate gardens have been developed under the guidance of Jane Percy, the Duchess of Northumberland, in the grounds of Alnwick Castle at a reported cost of more than £40m. School parties are being given talks on drug awareness and an opportunity to see some of the plants that produce common drugs. The Duchess told Sky News the poison garden was created to give visitors subliminal messages about the dangers of drugs. ""I thought: if you can engage a child through stories of gruesome and very painful deaths, which is how most of these plants kill, you can then teach them about other things by stealth without them realising they are being taught a valuable lesson.  ""If they knew that, it would also fail. ""It was all about story-telling and there are so many great true stories out there which have been forgotten really."" The gardens are now run by a charitable trust which offered the first drugs awareness day to 13 and 14 year-olds from Northumberland Church of England Academy in Ashington. Teacher Mark Fox said the experience was invaluable: ""These students will take this information back to school, to their friends and to their families. ""It is a marvellous opportunity to be able to come here and to learn about the dangers of drugs in a garden where they are being grown."""

The research, which questioned 2,120 motorists, suggests the problem of using phones illegally while driving has grown worse. Some 6% of those polled reported seeing between five and seven drivers breaking the law. Only 26% of people polled reported seeing no wrongdoing. A RAC spokesman said: ""Thirteen years after the introduction of the current law forbidding use of a hand-held phone at the wheel of a vehicle, this behaviour is far from being stamped out. ""In fact, the results of our research suggests the problem has got worse rather than better. ""Using a hand-held phone should be regarded as being as socially unacceptable as drinking and driving."" The Government is currently examining responses to a consultation held earlier this year which proposed tougher penalties for drivers who break the law. MPs are considering raising the number of penalty points for those caught from three to four. Fines may also be increased by 50%, to £150. The use of a mobile phone was a contributing factor in 21 fatal accidents in 2014, according to Department for Transport statistics for Britain."

Seven adults and one teenage boy were found with gunshot wounds to their heads in Piketon, in the south of the state. Attorney General Mike DeWine adding that the killings appeared to be the result of planned executions. Investigators also revealed that several marijuana-growing operations were found at the crime scenes, although it remains unclear if that was in any way linked to the killings. The shootings took place at four separate homes in the rural community The shooter or shooters remain on the loose. Authorities earlier released audio from 911 calls made after the slayings. In one call, a frantic female voice is heard describing the horrific scene inside one of four homes where the killings took place. ""There is blood all over the house,"" the woman tells an emergency dispatcher. ""My brother-in-law is in the bedroom. Looks like someone has beat the hell out of him."" In a separate 911 call, a relative of one victim says: ""I just found my cousin with a gunshot wound."" ""Is he alive?"" the dispatcher asks. ""No, no,"" the man responds. Authorities said the first 911 call came in shortly before 8am on Friday, with the second call coming several hours later from a different location. The victims have been identified as Christopher Rhoden Sr, 40, Christopher Rhoden Jr, 16, Dana Rhoden, 37, Kenneth Rhoden, 44, Gary Rhoden, 38, Clarence Rhoden, 20, Hannah Gilley, 20, and 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden. An infant and two other small children who were in the homes at the time of the shootings were not hurt. Pastor Phil Fulton of Union Hill Church told CBS News the local sheriff encouraged relatives of the dead to ""be very careful"" and ""arm yourself"". Todd Beekman, the owner of a local outdoors shop, said at least one customer came in to stock up on ammunition after the shootings. However, he said most people were not concerned for their safety because local residents know and look out for each other. ""The word spread pretty fast, as it does in any rural area,"" Mr Beekman told the AP news agency. ""Everybody's kind of their own brother's keeper down here."" Pike County lies about 80 miles (130km) east of Cincinnati on the western edge of Appalachia. It has around 28,000 residents, more than a quarter of whom live in poverty. A Cincinnati-area businessman put up a $25,000 (£17,000) reward for information leading to the capture and conviction of the killer or killers, officials said."

Mr Johnson, one of the most high-profile figures in the Vote Leave camp, said Mr Obama's suggestion that the UK would be at the back of the queue for free trade deals if it chose to leave the union was ""ridiculous"". He dodged questions about whether his comments that the President was anti-British because of his Kenyan heritage were ""racist"". ""I think it is absolutely ridiculous that the UK is now being told it has to go to the back of the queue for any free trade deal,"" Mr Johnson said. ""For us to be bullied in this way, I don't want to exaggerate, for people to say we are going to be unable to cope on our own is absolutely wrong."" 12) The comments issued by @MayorofLondon and endorsed by @Nigel_Farage, the biggest figures of #Brexit are very alarming to us Mr Johnson said the real reason the UK had not been able to do a free trade deal with the US in the last 43 years was because of EU membership. :: Obama: Europe Cannot Take Itself 'For Granted' Writing separately in his regular Daily Telegraph column he said that the Remain group ""think they have bombed us into submission"". But Mr Johnson suggested they ""think it's game over"", were ""crowing too soon"" and could be ""ignoring the resilience and thoughtfulness of many middle-of-the-road"" voters. And he claimed Prime Minister David Cameron achieved ""two thirds of diddly squat"" in his negotiations on EU reform in the lead up to the referendum. During his visit to the UK, the President said Britain may have to wait a decade for a free trade deal with the US if it votes to quit the EU on 23 June. Mr Johnson was widely criticised for suggesting that Mr Obama's Kenyan heritage might have given him negative feelings towards Britain. Labour former frontbencher Chuka Umunna told Sky's Murnaghan show: ""What Boris Johnson said was disgraceful. ""For any Londoner, for our Mayor of London to raise the issue of the President of the United States' ethnicity and then very publicly have to be slapped down by that President for doing so ... it's an embarrassment. ""This man is simply not fit to hold the office that he clearly aspires to, which is the Prime Minister of our country."" The London Mayor's comments prompted Africans for Britain to withdraw its support for the Brexit campaign saying Mr Johnson's comments were deplorable and alarming. Mr Johnson, whose article contained a reference to Mr Obama allegedly removing a bust of Winston Churchill from the White House, wrote in Friday's The Sun: ""Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British empire - of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender."" But speaking at the Foreign Office alongside the Prime Minister, Mr Obama made clear his admiration for the wartime leader. ""Right outside the door of the Treaty Room, so that I see it every day - including on weekends when I'm going into that office to watch a basketball game - the primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill. I love the guy,"" he said."

The Home Secretary used a speech to set out the security and economic reasons for the UK to retain its membership of the EU to make her argument for a British Bill of Rights. Mrs May said the UK's membership of the EU ""caused problems"" and it was ""nonsense"" that the country could not go it alone, but she thought the country was still better off in the union. However, she said the convention ""binds the hands of Parliament, adds nothing to our prosperity, makes us less secure by preventing the deportation of dangerous foreign nationals"". :: Faisal Islam Analysis - May Offers 'Third Way' On EU Referendum :: Obama: Europe Cannot Take Itself For Granted She said: ""If we want to reform human rights laws in this country, it isn't the EU we should leave, but the European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisdiction of its court"". She cited the cases of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada  - extremist Islamic clerics who were charged with terrorist offences abroad and who the UK had to fight to extradite in the European Court of Human Rights. The Government has pledged to break the link between UK courts and the European Court of Human Rights but has been more reticent on the idea of leaving the convention itself, set up as a response to the horrors of the Second World War. Mrs May started her speech by saying it was not a ""rally"" for the Remain camp and that she would not seek to shoot down the Leave campaign. :: Boris Johnson: US Should Not Bully UK On EU Setting out the case for the UK to remain in the EU, she said she did not want to ""insult people's intelligence by claiming that everything about the EU is perfect, that membership of the EU is wholly good"". She went on: ""There are certainly problems that are caused by our membership of the EU, but of course there are advantages too. ""Our decision must come down to whether, after serious thought about the pros and all the cons, we believe there is more in the credit column than in the debit column for remaining on the inside."" Mrs May admitted the EU's freedom of movement principle made it more difficult for the UK to control the volume of immigration but insisted Britain did have control of its borders. Her speech, which was apparently approved by the Prime Minister, will be seen as an attempt to appease eurosceptic Tory party members ahead of any leadership bid she might make when Mr Cameron steps down. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said: ""What a backward step that would be. What a terrible message to send to the world. Will fight May's plans all the way.""  Mrs May's comments came after Barack Obama warned the UK it would go to the back of the queue for free trade deals with the US if it voted to leave the EU. London Mayor and key Leave campaigner Boris Johnson said the UK should not be ""bullied"" by America and said the trade threat was ""ridiculous""."

She tumbled to the ground at around 22 miles of the 26.2-mile course after seemingly tangling feet with Ethiopian Aselefech Mergia. Despite her discomfort, the runner-up in Boston, Chicago and New York got back up and chased the leading pack in the elite women's race. It looked all over for Sumgong - but it wasn't Sumgong eventually managed to overhaul the entire field, finishing in 2:22:58. ""The fall really affected me and I was unsure if I could continue,"" she said. ""I have a cut on my head and on my shoulder, they are bleeding but I don't feel any pain yet. ""I did feel it in my legs, though, so I am so surprised I won."" Her victory was all the sweeter as her countryman Eliud Kipchoge won the men's race, making it a double for Kenya. His time of 2:03:05 was also a new course record. In the men's wheelchair race, six-time winner David Weir came a disappointing third, losing out to Swiss Marcel Hug. The women's race was won by Tatyana McFadden, 27, of the USA. British astronaut Tim Peake was among the thousands of other runners - albeit hundreds of miles above Earth. Mr Peake completed the marathon distance while strapped to a treadmill at the International Space Station. The 44-year-old had previously run the course in three hours, 18 minutes and 50 seconds in 1999. Altogether more than 39,000 people took part in the annual race, which was due to see the one millionth competitor cross the finish line. Other runners included Game of Thrones actress Natalie Dormer, competing for the NSPCC, and Top Gear host Chris Evans, running for Children in Need. Double Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes also joined in to raise money for a number of charities."
2016-04-25,Europe's largest research centre dedicated to preventing early miscarriage is being set up to co-ordinate tests and treatments for parents-to-be.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160425131631/http://news.sky.com/story/1684443/new-miscarriage-clinics-to-offer-more-support,"By Joe Tidy, Sky News Reporter Europe's largest research centre dedicated to preventing early miscarriage is being set up to co-ordinate tests and treatments for parents-to-be. Antenatal charity Tommy's is bringing together specialists at three universities to form its National Centre for Miscarriage Research. Miscarriage is by far the biggest cause of pregnancy loss in the UK with more than 200,000 a year, but it's also the least understood. The charity says women are too often left without answers and must endure three miscarriages before any clinical investigation can be carried out. The University of Birmingham, the University of Warwick, and Imperial College London will run specialist clinics enabling 24,000 women per year to access treatment and support and participate in Tommy's research studies. The network will seek to understand why miscarriage happens, if it is likely to happen again, how to prevent it, and how to provide appropriate aftercare. CEO of the charity, Jane Brenwin, said: ""This research centre is all about increasing the knowledge which will allow the NHS to deliver a much greater service for women, particularly looking after women who've experienced a miscarriage. ""We have a lot to learn about how to look after women a lot better."" Nicole Martin and Ben Crewe had three miscarriages in one year before they had their second child Joseph. They welcome the idea of more support for couples. Ms Martin told Sky News: ""Women think it's a failure to have a miscarriage and look for reasons as to why it happened. ""At the moment you have to suffer three in a row before the NHS will investigate, so you're left in limbo and it's really hard. ""The centre should help by offering women help when they really need it."""

According to its study, fathers in full-time work earn 21% more than their childless counterparts, although that 'wage bonus' falls to 9% if they have two children. However, there is a ""stark contrast"" for full-time working mothers, who earn 7% less than women who do not have children. The TUC described it as a ""motherhood penalty"", as it says mothers suffer from lost experience and workplace discrimination. They are also more likely to work part-time, earning less, than fathers in work. The ""wage penalty"" only hits women who became mothers before they reached 33. Women who had their first child after reaching 33 earn 12% more than similar women without children. The pay gap exists for those without children, too: childless women earn 12% less than childless men in similar jobs, according to the survey. The report says the reason for the fatherhood bonus is not clear, but suggests ""it is likely to relate to hours worked, increased effort and positive discrimination."" Working fathers tend to work longer hours after having children, while mothers are likely to work shorter hours. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""It says much about current attitudes that men with children are seen as more committed by employers, while mothers are still often treated as liabilities."" The study cited findings by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) that showed 77% of pregnant women and new mothers had experienced discrimination in the workplace. A quarter of employers, the survey found, said it was reasonable to ask women about their plans to have children, despite it being illegal to discriminate on the basis of that information when hiring. The survey analysed the pay of 17,000 42-year-olds in full-time work."

From 16 May, all direct marketing companies registered in the UK will need to display their phone numbers when making unsolicited calls, even if they have call centres overseas. Companies can risk fines of up to £2 million from Ofcom and a further £500,000 from the ICO if they continue to bombard consumers with unwanted calls. The move will make it easier for people to decide whether to answer their phone and to make formal complaints if they are harassed. It will also help the regulator - the Information Commissioner's Office - to investigate those who break the rules by continuing to make nuisance calls. Ofcom estimates that every year UK consumers receive approximately 4.8 billion nuisance calls, 1.7 billion live sales calls, 1.5 billion silent calls, 940 million recorded sales messages and 200 million abandoned calls. One in five direct marketing calls is from an anonymous or withheld number. Steve Eckersley, the ICO's head of enforcement, said: ""Any change that makes it easier for us to track down companies making nuisance calls is a change that will reduce the annoyance these calls cause. ""We do investigate unscrupulous companies who hide their identities, and we can track them down, but it certainly makes our job more difficult. ""When people are able to identify the number behind the call they have received they are more likely to complain and that means we are able to take action."" Baroness Neville-Rolfe, the minister responsible for data protection, said the Government was acting because of the ""significant harm"" that such calls could cause to elderly and vulnerable people. She said: ""The Government is committed to tackling this problem, which is why we are making it easier for consumers to report companies by forcing them to display their phone numbers. ""We are sending a clear message to rogue direct marketing companies. Nuisance calls are unacceptable and we will not hesitate to take action against the companies behind them."""

Series 6 marks the first time the show has overtaken the books with author George RR Martin still to release The Winds Of Winter. Showrunners David Benioff and D B Weiss say despite not having to base episodes on the books, they know exactly where they are going with the story. ""We're approaching the finish line, from the outset, our hope was to tell a complete story - beginning, middle and end. ""We are writing the final act now, and the last thing we want to do is stay on stage after the play is over.""

Click through to see more Season 5 finished on a multitude of cliff hangers, including Jon Snow's apparent death, Cersei's walk of shame in King's Landing and the White Walkers on the march. Alfie Allen, who plays Theon Greyjoy, told Sky News even he struggles to keep up-to-date with the programme. ""It's funny because you'll be sitting there watching it with your mates and then something happens and you're like 'What, Oh my God' - and your friend looks at you as if to say 'Aren't you in this show, aren't you meant to know this?'. ""It feels good to be a fan of it, just as much as everyone else, and to be just as surprised by things."" One storyline that we know will return is the re-emergence of Bran Stark, a character missing in the whole of the last season. He is played by Isaac Hempstead Wright who told Sky News his real life escapades have been far more mundane: ""It was quite convenient as it was my GCSE year at school. ""It was really weird, it was the first time in about six years I'd ever done a full term at school. ""I'd got so used to doing three weeks and jetting off somewhere, I was like 'What, you're here the full time how do you guys do it?'."" Appearing on Game Of Thrones is now one of the most high-profile jobs on television - but not everyone in the cast was keen on the show at the start. Veteran actor Jonathan Pryce, whose character High Sparrow will be at the forefront of the action in season six, admits he is grateful to be in it after turning down a part in season one. ""It's a genre that's never appealed to me,"" he said. ""There's lots of blockbuster series of things to do with fantasy, space and all that that I'd never seen and didn't want to see, and Game Of Thrones initially fell into that slot, so I passed on it. ""But they came back with the character of High Sparrow and it was too good a chance to pass over this time."" Game Of Thrones premiered at 2am and will be shown again today at 9pm on Sky Atlantic."

Lemonade, the multimillion-selling artist's new 'visual album', premiered on the US cable subscription channel HBO on Saturday night. In between the album's 11 songs are several spoken elements, some of which contain words that many have interpreted as being about her relationship with her rapper husband. In one song, Intuition, she says: ""In the tradition of men in my blood, you come home at 3am and lie to me. What are you hiding?"" During stark visual imagery in another song, Formation, she is seen in water as she asks the question: ""Are you cheating on me?"" It follows extensive speculation around the state of the power couple's marriage following reports Jay Z was accosted in a lift by Beyonce's sister Solange in 2014. The three were forced to release a statement shortly after saying ""families have problems and we're no different"" and that ""our family has worked through it,"" but the speculation has refused to go away. According to Reuters, Beyonce makes clear in the last tracks of the new album that she has decided to reconcile with Jay Z and continue in her marriage to him. Many music industry observers says the release shows Beyonce being typically innovative because of its visual quality and the way it was premiered. Lemonade was shown for free on HBO, after being mysteriously trailed, following the pay-TV premiere of Jurassic World and before a major boxing match. Gallery: Coldplay And Beyonce Perform At Super Bowl 50 The 12-minute spectacular was watched live by an estimated audience of 100 million people It is due to be shown again on Sunday night before the first episode of the latest series of Game of Thrones, according to The Hollywood Reporter. As soon as Lemonade had aired, it was made available on the music streaming subscription service Tidal, which is co-owned by Beyonce, Jay Z and many other top musicians. The album includes interviews with the mothers of two black men, Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, who were shot by police. There are also references to the Black Lives Matter campaign and a quote from human rights activist Malcolm X praising black women, which together with appearances by other famous black women, have led commentators to describe the album as a homage to the resilience of females from her ethnic background."

The 25-year-old Algerian national is also the first Leicester player to become Player of the Year, with the award coming after a season in which he has scored 17 goals and made 11 assists in 34 league games. Mahrez's strong performance has helped bring Leicester City to the brink of their first Premier League title. He finished ahead of fellow Leicester stars Jamie Vardy and N'Golo Kante, Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Arsenal's Mesut Ozil, and West Ham United’s Dimitri Payet. The footballer joined Leicester from the French second-tier side Le Havre in January 2014. Receiving the award at the Grosvenor Hotel in London, Mahrez paid tribute to his teammates. ""All the credit is for them, seriously. And for my manager and the staff,"" he said. ""Without them I wouldn't receive this award and I wouldn't score. It's the team spirit, and I want to dedicate it to them. ""It's extra special because if the players vote for me it's because they've seen I've been great this year so I'm happy. ""Without my team mates I wouldn't get this award."" Mahrez also spoke of his pride at being the first African player to receive the award, which was won last year by Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard. ""It's an honour to be the first African - not the best but the first,"" he said. The 20-year-old Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli was named PFA Young Player of the Year."
2016-04-25,"If hardline Tory Eurosceptics were angry after reading Barack Obama's Daily Telegraph plea for the UK to remain in the European Union, they would have been spitting fury after his joint news conference with David Cameron.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160425131631/http://news.sky.com/story/1683642/obama-lets-rip-in-blockbuster-eu-intervention,"If hardline Tory Eurosceptics were angry after reading Barack Obama's Daily Telegraph plea for the UK to remain in the European Union, they would have been spitting fury after his joint news conference with David Cameron. As ever, the President’s remarks in the glittering Locarno Room in the Foreign Office were delivered slowly, thoughtfully and even – at times – in a slightly ponderous tone. And his answers to questions were, as usual, very long. But all that made the impact of his blistering warning on the threat to British trade if the UK votes to leave the EU even more dramatic. From David Cameron's perspective, it couldn't have gone any better He brutally demolished the Leave campaign’s claims that Britain could ""cut our own trade deals"" with the US. :: Obama: UK-US Trade Deal Would Be Back Of Queue ""Maybe some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement,"" he said. ""But it's not going to happen any time soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done."" And then came the killer quote, that had most people in the room wincing at its ferocity: ""The UK is going to be in the back of the queue."" David Cameron, standing alongside the President, must have thought all his Christmases had come at once. Although Mr Obama said he hadn’t come to the UK ""to fix any votes"", he abandoned all diplomatic restraint about not meddling in another country’s politics. And he let rip! Could it be because, like David Cameron, he has fought his last election and feels free to speak his mind candidly? Could it be because he genuinely wants to help Mr Cameron? Or is it simply US self interest, because it’s in the United States’ interests for the UK to stay in the EU? Certainly the last, probably the first and possibly the second as well. There may not be the warmth of a Thatcher-Reagan or Blair-Clinton relationship between these two men, but there were some warm words for the Prime Minister here. Besides his broadside at Tory ""Outers"" on trade – ""I figured you might want to hear from the President of the United States what I think the United States is going to do,"" he told them pointedly - the President also said staying in the EU would ""enhance"" – his word – the fight against terrorism. ""Precisely because I have a confidence in the UK, and I know that if we are not working effectively with Paris or Brussels then those attacks are going to migrate to the United States and to London, I want one of my strongest partners in that conversation,"" he said. This has been the most controversial and provocative intervention in British politics by an American president in living memory. If Mr Cameron wins the referendum on 23 June he will owe President Obama big time. The leading Leave campaigners have been left battered and bruised by the President’s blockbuster intervention and, in Boris Johnson’s case, facing accusations of racism. His ""part-Kenyan president"" jibe in his Sun article has appalled many Tories as well as his political opponents. :: President Hails Churchill After Johnson Remarks The President graciously laughed when he was asked about the London Mayor’s reference to his African ancestry. But in an echo of Tony Blair’s ""John is John"" slapdown of John Prescott after he thumped a voter in 2001, Mr Cameron said: ""Questions for Boris are questions for Boris."" Deftly, the President responded to Boris’s claim that he had removed a Winston Churchill bust from the Oval Office by revealing that as the first African-American president he felt he ought to replace it with one of Martin Luther-King. But there remains, he said, a Churchill bust in the Treaty Room, his private office in his official residence, which he sees every day, even when he goes to watch basketball on TV. Was that a subtle way of suggesting London’s Mayor was guilty of racism? Possibly. Leave campaigners, meanwhile, will claim the reason Britain doesn’t have a trade deal with the US is because it’s a member of the EU and the proposed EU-US deal, known as TTIP, would be disastrous for UK workers, they argue. But as a piece of raw theatre – and a potential turning point in the EU referendum campaign – the President’s bombshell in the Locarno Room could not have been more sensational."

The musician was found collapsed in a lift by staff members on Thursday after last being seen alive 12 hours earlier. His brother-in-law Maurice Phillips has claimed the singer worked for six days non-stop before his death. Speaking after a private family service at the estate,  Mr Phillips said: ""He worked 154 hours straight. ""I was with him just last weekend. He was a good brother-in-law."" Meanwhile, Mr Phillips told The Sun that Prince's estate will be turned into a museum as a lasting memorial. ""It would be for the fans. He was all about the fans - this would remember his music, which is his legacy,"" he said. ""Prince was always private but would have wanted his music remembered."" :: Prince Secretly Cremated By Family And Friends Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death after authorities said they had ""no reason to believe"" Prince committed suicide. Authorities added that there were ""no obvious signs of trauma"" on his body. Employees at the Electric Fetus record shop in Minneapolis said the musician appeared to be ""pale"" and ""weak"" when he visited five days before his death. Max Timander, who works at Electric Fetus, told the Press Association: ""Everyone I've talked to on that Saturday said he looked kind of pale and he was not totally looking in the best shape as he normally is. ""It sounded like he was looking kind of weak. I know he had just got over the flu supposedly."" A state senator in Prince's home state of Minnesota has, meanwhile, called for it to adopt purple as its official colour, reported the St Paul Pioneer Press. Sales of Prince's music have skyrocketed worldwide since the artist's death last week and several songs or albums are expected to make it into the next UK chart when it is published on Thursday. The mayor of Chanhassan, the city which is home to Paisley Park, said a private funeral service would be held for Prince in early May."
2016-04-25,"There has been a painful air of inevitability about the demise of BHS since, just over a year ago, Sir Philip Green sold the business for £1.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160425131631/http://news.sky.com/story/1684737/bhs-collapse-was-painfully-inevitable,"There has been a painful air of inevitability about the demise of BHS since, just over a year ago, Sir Philip Green sold the business for £1. The buyer, an outfit called Retail Acquisitions, was unknown and the people behind it had little retail experience. The majority owner of the consortium, Dominic Chappell, was best-known as a twice bankrupt former racing driver. The first thing he had to do was appoint a new chief executive after Richard Price defected to Tesco. Unfortunately, the man he appointed, Darren Topp – an experienced retailer with more than 20 years at Marks & Spencer under his belt – was unable to stem years of decline. It was probably unfair to expect him to do so when even Sir Philip, one of the high street’s most successful operators during the last three decades, had not been able to. The problems BHS faced have been well-documented. Despite a loyal but ageing clientele, the brand has struggled to make itself relevant to younger shoppers, particularly in the face of competition from the likes of Matalan, Primark, TK Maxx and Dunelm. Making that task harder still was the fact that BHS was locked into a number of onerous property leases that were draining it of resources. The most notorious of these, in Clydebank, was agreed in 1979, was due to run until 2103 and was costing BHS £404,000 annually, a sum estimated to be two-thirds above the market rate. It was little wonder that Clydebank was one of 52 stores earmarked for closure when, last month, Retail Acquisitions proposed a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA) – an agreement with creditors aimed at reducing its debts. That deal was voted through, saving BHS roughly £27m annually from its rent bill, but at the time it was warned that the company would still need to raise a further £100m to fund a modernisation plan and to help plug a £571m deficit in the company’s two pension schemes. It was this need to raise extra money that has ultimately tipped BHS into administration. One lender, Gordon Brothers, was prepared to make available some £60m in loans to BHS but, in order for the retailer to secure that loan, it would have meant other creditors would have seen their debt ""subordinated"", in other words, pushed further down the pecking order in the event of the company being wound up. One of these creditors is Sir Philip himself, who is owed between £35-£40m, according to reports. Adding to this problem was that Retail Acquisitions failed to raise as much as anticipated from property sales that, it had been hoped, would have got other creditors, including the private equity firm Grovepoint, off its back. For example, the sale of the lease on BHS’s flagship store on London’s Oxford Street raised just £50m, some £20m less than had been hoped for. Further property sales, that had been targeted to raise some £30m, have raised just £2m to date. It was this failure to raise the expected sums from sales that, according to reports, made existing creditors reluctant to sign off on new loans to BHS. For his part, Sir Philip is said to have been prepared to have seen his debt subordinated, but was concerned at the failure by Retail Acquisitions to raise as much from property sales as expected. :: Retailer BHS Goes Into Administration Alternatives were sought by Retail Acquisitions. A sale to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct was considered but the Newcastle United owner was, it is said, not prepared to take on the pension scheme and its liabilities. The fate of the pension scheme will now assume centre stage. Retail Acquisitions has been in talks for more than a month with the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), a lifeboat scheme funded by levies paid by other pension funds, about decanting the BHS pension scheme into the PPF. However, for this to happen, others will be expected to make a contribution to plug the shortfall. These will include Sir Philip. He is said to have offered to contribute £80m –  £40m in cash and a further £40m in the charges he holds over some BHS assets. But, the Pensions regulator has reportedly been pressing him to contribute more on the grounds that he and his family received some £400m in dividends from BHS during the 15 years in which they owned the business and an estimated £150m or so in rents. Sir Philip, for his part, can argue that, when he sold BHS, he wrote off £200m worth of charges held over BHS assets  and left some £65m worth of cash in the business – as well as freehold and leasehold assets worth more than £100m. He told The Sunday Times shortly after the sale last year: ""In terms of the actions we’ve put in place, there's no reason they should get in trouble. Now, where they get to – I’m not the driver. If I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you’re a great driver and you crash it into the first f****** mountain, is that my fault? I know what they're getting today is 100% clean."" Should the schemes be taken over by the PPF, some 13,000 current scheme members will see a 10% reduction in the payments they could have expected to enjoy in retirement, while 8,000 members of the schemes who are already retired would see future increases in their pensions capped at 2.5% annually. There are also questions for the Pensions Regulator itself, though, as well as the scheme trustees – not least why they signed off on the sale of BHS a year ago to a consortium led by a man whose experience in the sector was so lacking."
2016-04-25,Families of British armed forces personnel who have died in training have welcomed a recommendation that the Ministry of Defence be prosecuted for avoidable deaths.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160425131631/http://news.sky.com/story/1684112/mod-exemption-to-prosecution-must-change,"By Rebecca Williams, Sky News Reporter Families of British armed forces personnel who have died in training have welcomed a recommendation that the Ministry of Defence be prosecuted for avoidable deaths. At the moment the MOD is exempt and can't be taken to court, even if failings are found to have taken place. But The Commons Defence Committee has said such a situation ""must change"", adding: ""The lives of serving personnel are worth no less than those of civilians and those responsible for their deaths must be equally liable under the law."" In 2013, three men died during an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons. An inquest found they had been neglected on the 16-mile march. If it weren't for immunity the MOD would have been prosecuted. The victims' families have welcomed the recommendation. Corporal James Dunsby’s father, David, told Sky News: ""I still think there’s a macho culture. ""They want to keep pushing these men and that’s fair enough. ""They've got to be pushed, but how far do you want to push training? You can push it to the limits but the MOD doesn't have a license to kill."" Lance Corporal Craig Roberts died on the same march and his parents, Kelvin and Margaret, have said they ""totally agree"" that the MOD should be open to prosecution. They wrote in a statement: ""As the committee states 'The lives of serving personnel are worth no less than those of civilians and those responsible for their deaths must be equally liable under the law'."" Cpl Dunsby and L Cpl Roberts are among 135 members of the armed forces who have died in training and selection since the year 2000. In that time there have been 11 Crown censures – the highest penalty that can be issued to the MOD where deaths are deemed avoidable. However, former Major-General Jonathan Shaw, who was in the army for more than three decades, believes changing the legislation would dumb down training. ""The more restrictions in place on people, the more hurdles you make them go through before they undergo training,"" the former Director of Special Forces and Assistant Chief of Defence Staff said. ""That means training will be less difficult, less demanding and less risky, so people will be less prepared when they go into conflict."" The Ministry of Defence said: ""The safety of our personnel is an absolute priority and, while each death is tragic, deaths in training are rare. ""We are grateful for the committee's acknowledgement of how seriously we take the risks associated with training and that we are moving in the right direction. ""We acknowledge that more needs to be done, which is why we set up the Defence Safety Authority last year. We will now carefully consider this report and respond in due course."""

Police used DNA in December to identify the remains after 46 years as those of Reet Jurvetson, a 19-year-old Canadian. Her sister had recognised an online photo of the body that was named by a coroner as Jane Doe No. 59. Investigators spoke to Charles Manson about the woman a few months ago at the California prison where he is serving nine life sentences. The sister of Reet Jurvetson (pictured) described her as naive But the interview turned up no new information, said Detective Luis Rivera. Jurvetson's body was found on 16 November 1969 by a birdwatcher in dense brush off Mulholland Drive. She did not have identification. Her remains turned up about six miles from the site of the most notorious Manson family killings, including the murder of pregnant actress Sharon Tate, director Roman Polanski's wife. Charles Manson is serving nine life sentences Police say they cannot discount a link between Jurvetson's murder and the Manson family killings, even though they have not found any solid evidence. ""We don't rule anything out,"" Detective Rivera said. ""Everything is on the table until proven otherwise."" Detective Rivera said the main lead they have is a man named ""John"" or ""Jean,"" whom Jurvetson met in Toronto before flying to Los Angeles to see him in the summer of 1969. Manson at court in Los Angeles in 1970 Jurvetson's sister, Anne Jurvetson, said in a statement released through police that her free-spirited and naive sister moved to Los Angeles after becoming smitten with ""John"". Anne Jurvetson, 73, said Reet sent her family a postcard saying she had found an apartment and was happy. But they never heard from her again. Her parents never reported her missing because ""they thought that she was just living her life somewhere"", Anne Jurvetson said."

Many doctors were torn between their loyalty to their patients and their determination to protest over the contract. :: Junior Doctors Are 'Wrong' To Strike, Says PM Dr Shiv Gulati was due to be working in the critical care unit. Dr Shiv Gulati says strike action will benefit patients in the long term ""I am conflicted to be honest,"" he told Sky News. ""Standing outside and not attending to my patients is a difficult decision to make. ""It's not what I am trained to do. ""But I have come to appreciate that if I am to provide safe and effective care I need to think about the long term."" :: Why Are The Junior Doctors Striking? Inside A&E it was unusually quiet; the warnings to the public to stay away unless they had an urgent and serious medical problem seem to have paid off. Contingency plans formulated over the last few weeks were tested for real. That’s resulted in the cancellation of almost 900 outpatient appointments and just over 100 routine operations over the two-day strike. Dr Charles Thomson, an emergency care consultant, said: ""A lot of elective activity has had to be taken down. ""So that's allowed us to have surgeons and anaesthetists available, and the intensive care doctors have come down to assist us. ""We have also ensured there is minimal leave being taken, and study leave has been cancelled."" Junior doctors will be working this evening to catch up with any backlog in blood tests and paperwork, before walking out at 8am on Wednesday for another nine-hour strike."
2016-04-28,The entrepreneurs who bought BHS for £1 and the accountants and lawyers who worked on the takeover are to be summoned by MPs probing the high street retailer’s collapse into administration.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160428111019/http://news.sky.com/story/1686350/bhs-buyers-to-be-summoned-to-mps-inquiry,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The entrepreneurs who bought BHS for £1 and the accountants and lawyers who worked on the takeover are to be summoned by MPs probing the high street retailer’s collapse into administration. Sky News has learnt that the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Select Committee will announce on Thursday that it wants to examine the level of due diligence that Retail Acquisitions Limited (RAL) was legally required to undertake before buying BHS from Sir Philip Green just over a year ago. Sources said on Wednesday that ""representatives of RAL"", along with professional advisers on the transaction would be among the witnesses called to give evidence by the Committee. The BIS inquiry will run in tandem with a separate investigation by the Department for Work and Pensions Select Committee, which is to examine the circumstances surrounding BHS’s £571m pension deficit and its possible implications for taxpayers. An insider said MPs on the BIS Committee would want to ascertain the extent of the checks made by Sir Philip’s Arcadia Group to ensure that RAL – majority-owned by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt and one-time racing driver – was a responsible owner. It is possible that Sir Philip will be invited to give evidence to both committees. The parliamentary scrutiny of the takeover of BHS – which fell into administration this week, threatening its 11,000-strong workforce – may shed further light on the robustness of the work undertaken by City advisers. One source said the MPs would want to establish the parameters of the advisers’ role and to understand whether regulatory frameworks appropriately incentivised participants in the BHS deal to behave ethically. The BIS Committee was also likely, they added, to examine whether the statutory obligations for company directors – and the consequences of breaching them – were sufficiently robust during corporate sale processes. News of the details of the BIS inquiry came on another day of intense debate about the conduct of BHS’s assorted former owners. Mr Chappell has been linked to an attempt to buy back BHS, which trades from around 160 stores, but there was scepticism in the City that he would succeed in raising the necessary financing or convincing the administrator that he was an acceptable buyer. Sky News revealed that the taxman issued a warning notice last week for BHS to pay an outstanding VAT bill of £2.6m within seven days. The company was also facing a demand for a further £10m in VAT following the sale of its Oxford Street store, which would have been due at the end of June, they added. A chunk of the proceeds from that disposal were paid to RAL rather than to BHS. The revelation will fuel questions about the timing of the decision to place BHS in administration even as the row over its collapse threatens to descend into one of the most controversial business closures for many years. While Duff & Phelps, BHS's administrator, has received dozens of expressions of interest from prospective buyers, most of those parties are likely to be focused on acquiring packages of stores rather than the whole business. The BHS pension scheme has a £571m deficit under the most expensive calculation, and Sir Philip faces the prospect of writing a large cheque to contribute to plugging that gap. He is reported to have offered £80m, but that figure was regarded as inadequate. The retailer's pension liabilities are expected to pass to the Pension Protection Fund, which is funded through a levy on other major employers."

Its ""autonomous driving"" cars will initially be semi-autonomous, although there are plans to test a more advanced driverless version in 2018. The Swedish carmaker said: ""Drive Me London will begin in early 2017 with a limited number of semi-autonomous driving cars and expand in 2018 to include up to 100 AD cars, making it the largest and most extensive AD testing programme on Britain's streets.""  The semi-autonomous cars will take passengers to their destinations without human intervention unless bad weather makes conditions too dangerous. Engineers have been running supervised tests in Gothenburg, where Volvo has its headquarters, since 2014. Motorists there will also be given the chance to test the vehicles next year. The cars use a 360-degree camera system, GPS and other sensors to ""see"" the road and avoid collisions. Volvo has said self-driving cars will improve transport times and driver comfort and reduce traffic jams, pollution and accidents. But it is unclear how the cars will be treated legally - for example regarding liability, which currently rests with the driver. Volvo, along with Ford, Google and Uber, is a founding member of the Self-Driving Coalition For Safer Streets - which is pushing for clear self-driving car laws in the US to help promote the technology. The Swedish firm is also looking for partners to expand testing of the technology in China - where its owner Geely is based."

In a speech designed to burnish his national security credentials, he complained that too often the US telegraphs its plans to foes. Mr Trump vowed to get rid of the Islamic State group ""very, very quickly"" if elected, but said he would not provide details so as to catch the jihadists off guard. ""We must as a nation be more unpredictable,"" he told his audience at a Washington DC hotel. ""We are totally predictable. ""We tell everything, we're sending troops, we tell them, we're sending something else, we have a news conference. ""We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable, starting now."" Mr Trump also warned allies they would be left to defend themselves if they don't ""pay their fair share"". Speaking a day after landslide victories in five primaries, he said it was time to ""shake the rust off"" US foreign policy. Mr Trump said America's world standing had been rendered ""a complete and total disaster"" under the Obama administration, with ""no vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy"". He said Mr Obama was leaving a legacy of ""weakness, confusion and disarray"", which he argued Democratic presidential front runner Hillary Clinton would only continue. The billionaire businessman said he would get out of the nation-building business and focus unyieldingly on what is best for the US, in an ""America first"" approach. ""President Obama has not been a friend to Israel,"" Mr Trump also said in his speech, which was otherwise largely in line with the conservative world view. ""He's treated Iran with tender love and care."" Mr Trump also appealed to Russia and China, saying the US and those world powers were ""not bound to be adversaries"". He read the 38-minute remarks off a teleprompter - unusual for a candidate known for his freewheeling style. Critics have said repeatedly the property magnate lacks an ability to act and sound ""presidential"". Mr Trump spoke to an invited audience of conservative-leaning national security and foreign policy experts."
2016-04-28,"After just two weeks, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has declared victory in this, the most important battle of the ten-week 'Brexit War'.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160428111019/http://news.sky.com/story/1686289/why-is-osborne-so-sure-of-eu-campaign-victory,"After just two weeks, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has declared victory in this, the most important battle of the ten-week 'Brexit War'. ""I think we should end this debate about the economic merits of staying in or leaving the EU,"" he told me at a media company in West London. ""It's clear if we leave we'll be poorer."" It was an extraordinary claim, given the heated debate on this subject. But a combination of Treasury equations, the White House, and a series of international expert economic views, leads George Osborne to conclude he has won and he has set the frame of the debate to be had after the local and regional elections. Obviously I picked him up on it, pointing out that the Treasury analysis had given no possibility for a more efficient economy after Brexit. The Chancellor again referred to the international consensus. I've heard this talk from the Chancellor before, when he told me just weeks after the Omnishambles Budget that he had ""completely won"" the argument on austerity. Why does he think it? Because no serious economic organisation, in his eyes, has backed Brexit, and plenty have suggested its economics are deeply suspect and risky. He also sees the Bank of England shaping an argument that the economy is starting to suffer from uncertainty, as it has in unanimous minutes (including external experts) of its key monetary and financial policy committees. It was the Monetary Policy Committee's quoting of Deloitte's CFO report, and the OECD report on Wednesday morning warning of a ""Brexit tax"" in the long term, but also in the short term by 2020. The Chancellor told me that the OECD findings so far were ""similar"" to he Treasury's ""you've got the OECD saying there's a Brexit tax, and it's pretty clear there would be"". This is a preview to the long anticipated HM Treasury report into the short-term impact of a Brexit vote. As we know, the Chancellor has already anticipated that this could include a spike in mortgage costs. Undoubtedly, this will leave pro-Leave campaigners absolutely furious. This second report due in early May will be much more the horror story than the Project Fear alleged of the first report. So what is the Osborne declaration of victory about? He is encouraged, clearly, by that bad week for the Leave campaign, with US President Barack Obama unpicking its free trade strategy, and slapping down its chief cheerleader. Every authority that has warned about Brexit has had its intentions questioned by the Leave campaign. The Chancellor sees Leave retreating to the comfort blanket of immigration, for which he sees a natural upper limit to its polling potential. But the Leave campaign aren't about to give up that easily."

Charlotte Hennessy's father James died after supporters were crushed before Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. She was just six at the time of the tragedy and has spent years campaigning for the truth to come out. :: Hillsborough: 14 Decisions Reached By Jury ""It's been my whole life - I don't know any different. I feel like my childhood was robbed from me,"" she told Sky News. ""I feel like I couldn't enjoy my teen years because I was so confused and so angry. ""I don't feel like I've been able to enjoy my children in the last few years as I should have. ""Not only did I have years stolen from what I should have had with my dad but I've also had to sacrifice time with my own children as well."" ""Hillsborough robbed so many lives. Not just the lives of those that were dead - but our lives were put on hold as well."" :: Hillsborough Inquests Consign Lies To History The inquest found that errors by the police and ambulance service had ""caused or contributed"" to Britain's worst sporting disaster. And Charlotte also discovered exactly what happened to her father - and that if he had been treated sooner he would probably have survived. ""He was found moving on the pitch by a police officer who felt that he was alive and said so in court and gave him CPR and then with a fireman and somebody else, on a fireman's stretcher, they took my dad through to the gym where he was just left basically. ""Somebody declared him as dead but no medical professional was actually called to come and confirm that. And then the confirmations that were given by off-duty doctors - I don't feel they were thorough enough because now we know my dad was alive.

He had been suspended on Tuesday after it was claimed he used derogatory names to refer to Paralympic cyclists. This came shortly after cycling's UK governing body announced an independent review into claims of sexism made by cyclist Jess Varnish. Mr Sutton denies the allegations. He said he had quit to give British cyclists time to prepare with a different boss, ahead of the Rio Olympics in the summer. From Wednesday, there are 100 days to go before the games' opening ceremony. Mr Sutton said: ""It is absolutely crucial that, as our athletes begin their final preparations for Rio, they are able to do so free of distraction. ""The developments over the past few days have clearly become a distraction. ""It is for this reason, and having spoken to friends and family, that I believe it is in the best interests of British Cycling for me to step down from my position as technical director."" The sport's governing body launched an internal investigation after Varnish claimed in a newspaper she was told to ""go and have a baby"" when her contract was not renewed. Mr Sutton had been key in the careers of umpteen cyclists, from Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins to double Olympic gold medallist Laura Trott. The 58-year-old was head coach when Britain won eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games and four years later in London. British Cycling promoted the Australian-born former professional cyclist in April 2014 to replace former Performance Director Dave Brailsford, who left to focus solely on Team Sky. British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake said: ""I understand and respect Shane's decision to stand down.  ""His primary focus has always been the athletes, and this decision is something he has taken to allow them to focus on their preparation for Rio."" He said programmes director Andy Harrison would be taking over immediately and would manage the team in the build up to the Rio games. Mr Sutton said he would continue to cooperate with the review and was looking forward to responding ""to the allegations in detail""."

Designed by Adidas creative director Stella McCartney, the kit is made to be an average 10% lighter than that worn by British athletes at London 2012. It features a specially-commissioned Coat of Arms and references to all four home nations. Ms McCartney said: ""The goal for Rio 2016 was to rewrite the rules of performance and design for athletes, allowing them to look and feel like champions on and off the field. ""The inspiration behind the design was this idea of contrasting British tradition with a modern attitude. ""The new Coat Of Arms, specially commissioned for this project, and traditional Union Flag hues sit alongside bold textures and modern silhouettes to create a strong identity and make the athletes feel like a team."" A number of athletes were involved in the design process, including 2012 Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hall, who said: ""It’s an amazing design and I think it will give British athletes a massive sense of pride and give us an edge in Rio."" Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of the British Paralympic Association, said the paralympicsGB athletes wear their kit ""with a huge amount of pride""."

The 22-year-old has been seeking to serve the remainder of her six-year sentence closer to home in Scotland following her conviction for cocaine smuggling in 2013. Reid and Michaella McCollum were jailed for six years and eight months after admitting trying to smuggle cocaine worth an estimated £1.5m from Peru to Spain. An embassy spokeswoman said Reid had been ""granted expulsion back to the UK"", adding that she would be returning ""very soon"". McCollum, 23, was freed last month under new legislation on early prison release introduced in Peru last year. Michaella McCollum, 23, was released from jail last month She served two years and three months, although it is expected she will need to remain in Peru for some time as part of her parole. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said it had not yet received information of Reid's expulsion, adding they would only be notified if she was set to serve the remainder of her sentence in Scotland. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said: ""We continue to provide consular assistance.""

Although there is a possibility that e-cigarettes could cause some long-term harm, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) has said such devices have the potential to make a ""major contribution"" to preventing premature death and disease among smokers. No evidence was found to suggest e-cigarettes are a ""gateway to smoking"" or normalise the habit - but experts agree they are beneficial for encouraging smokers to quit. The report also stated ""the public can be reassured that e-cigarettes are much safer than smoking"". Professor John Britton, who chairs the RCP's Tobacco Advisory Group, said: ""The growing use of electronic cigarettes as a substitute for tobacco smoking has been a topic of great controversy, with much speculation over their potential risks and benefits. ""This report lays to rest almost all of the concerns over these products … Smokers should be reassured that these products can help them quit all tobacco use forever."" RCP president Professor Jane Dacre added there was an ""opportunity to improve the lives of millions of people"" if e-cigarettes are carefully managed and proportionately regulated. Cancer Research UK has said e-cigarettes have ""real promise in helping to reduce the huge death toll from tobacco"" - and described the RCP's report as ""an accurate summary of the latest scientific evidence on e-cigarettes"". The organisation's director of prevention, Alison Cox, added: ""Tobacco kills more than 100,000 people in the UK every year, we should grasp every opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to stop smoking for good."" Public Health England said e-cigarettes should be combined with local stop smoking services to give Britons ""an extremely good chance of quitting smoking successfully"". There were an estimated 2.2 million Britons using e-cigarettes in 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics - and more than half said their main reason for vaping was to try and quit smoking for good. ONS figures suggest just 3% of those who regularly used an e-cigarette had never smoked before."

Police say her miniature daschund called Boris is also missing from her home in Royston, Hertfordshire, and she may have taken him with her. They are urging hotel and B&B owners to keep an eye out for the writer, who has links to the Northumberland and Kent areas. Mrs Bailey - best known for her books about fictional character Electra Brown - was last seen at around 2.45pm on 11 April, near her home. Police say Mrs Bailey may have her pet dog Boris with her She was reported missing to police four days later. Her friends issued a statement, saying: ""Her disappearance is a mystery to her family and friends who are doing their utmost to find her.""

Mrs Bailey, whose husband drowned while they were on holiday in the Caribbean in 2011, had reportedly said she ""needed a little time to herself"" prior to her disappearance. Specialist searches around the writer's home have now been completed After his death, she began writing a blog called Planet Grief, describing her struggle with being a widow.

2016-04-28,Junior doctors across England have finished their second day of strike action with no resolution in their dispute with the Government over contracts.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160428111019/http://news.sky.com/story/1685739/thousands-of-doctors-strike-for-second-day,"Junior doctors across England have finished their second day of strike action with no resolution in their dispute with the Government over contracts. More than 20,000 junior doctors walked off the job on Tuesday and Wednesday, strikes which saw them withdraw emergency care for the first time in the health service's history. Figures from NHS England suggested 78%  of junior doctors who were expected to work on Tuesday did not report for duty. NHS England warned the figures had not been fully validated and include those who may have been absent due to sickness or other reasons. :: Why Are The Junior Doctors Striking? More than 125,000 appointments and operations were cancelled because of the strike action and will need to be rearranged. The strike action ended at 5pm. Junior doctors have accused Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of being ""afraid to debate in public"" the issues raised by a new contract, which they say he is seeking to ""force down their throats"". Medics are unhappy with proposals to impose the contract, which the Government says is designed to gear the NHS up for seven-day care. Junior doctors say the Government is stretching resources too thinly and should invest in more staff - although the Government has pledged to train 11,000 more doctors by 2020. Doctors are concerned they will be under pressure to work longer hours, risking patient safety, despite the contract reducing the working week. :: What Does The Strike Mean For Hunt? As the industrial action began on Tuesday, Prime Minister David Cameron defended Mr Hunt, saying doctors were ""wrong"" to stage the first all-out strike in NHS history. He said three-quarters of doctors would be ""better off"" under the new contract Mr Hunt has said he will impose on medics from August. Mr Cameron said: ""There is a good contract on the table with a 13.5% increase in basic pay - 75% of doctors will be better off with this contract. ""It's the wrong thing to do to go ahead with this strike, and particularly to go ahead with the withdrawal of emergency care - that is not right."" Mr Hunt said the action was not ""proportionate"" and insisted that junior doctors would be ""responsible"" if patients died because of the industrial action. When asked on Sky News if he would have to take some responsibility if a patient died because of industrial action, he said: ""The people who are responsible for what is happening are the people who chose to strike."""

On Monday, it was disclosed she had shared a post on Facebook suggesting Israel should be relocated in the US, along with the comment ""problem solved"". Another post made before Ms Shah was an MP used the hashtag #IsraelApartheid above a quote saying ""Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal"". Party leader Jeremy Corbyn had initially settled for reprimanding the Bradford West MP, despite pressure to take a stronger stance. He told her that her comments were ""offensive and unacceptable"" but that he believed she no longer held such views. Prime Minister David Cameron, however, told Prime Minister's Questions that it was ""extraordinary"" that Ms Shah had not been suspended from the party. Two hours later, Ms Shah ""wholeheartedly apologised"" in the House of Commons, adding that she ""deeply regret(ted)"" causing ""upset and hurt"" to the Jewish community. She said the post did not reflect her views and was made ""at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict"". ""But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise."" She published a further apology in Jewish News on Wednesday morning, saying: ""With the understanding of the issues I have now I would never have posted them. ""The language I used was wrong. It is hurtful. What's important is the impact these posts have had on other people. ""I understand that referring to Israel and Hitler as I did is deeply offensive to Jewish people, for which I apologise."" On Wednesday afternoon, however, the Labour Party confirmed she had been suspended. A party spokesman said: ""Jeremy Corbyn and Naz Shah have mutually agreed that she is administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the General Secretary. ""Pending investigation, she is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed."" JEWISH NEWS EXCLUSIVE: Naz Shah: ‘My apology to the Jewish community’ https://t.co/i2lVCkSWex pic.twitter.com/ESC87rH2Ah Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, a Corbyn ally, said Ms Shah's remarks were not anti-Semitic and her suspension was unnecessary, telling LBC Radio: ""We expelled a couple of people from the Labour Party early on for saying things that could clearly be interpreted as anti-Semitic. ""This is not that; this is an over-the-top comment about the horrendous conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians."" John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, told Sky News the suspension was ""inevitable"", and called on Mr Corbyn to ""make sure she gets a proper education programme on anti-Semitism to understand how deeply offensive the comments she made are to people"". He suggested this should include a visit to Israel, including the country's Holocaust museum. Mr Mann also commented on claims published by BuzzFeed News that Labour officials had edited Ms Shah's apology, removing the term ""anti-Semitic"" and references to the wider problem of anti-Semitism in left-wing politics. He said: ""I want (Mr Corbyn) to clarify if that happened, who did it and obviously he'll want to sack that person."" Stephen Pollard, editor of The Jewish Chronicle, told Sky News that the ""initial draft...was really a rather good apology...what was published was so-so"". The Labour Party denied the claims that the apology had been edited, with a spokesperson saying they were ""completely inaccurate"". Ms Shah quit her role as a Parliamentary assistant to shadow chancellor John McDonnell on Tuesday. The Labour Party has been under increasing pressure to deal with anti-Semitism from members, something Mr Pollard said Mr Corbyn needed to deal with more strongly. I am truly sorry and I will be putting out a more detailed explanation later. pic.twitter.com/x74FDKNCJE He told Sky News: ""The Labour Party leadership that appears to have no real interest in dealing with anti-Semitism. It doesn't mean just suspending people when the media happens to find out about someone."" He said one could be against Israel's actions without being an anti-Semite, but added: ""People have caught onto the idea that they can say they're anti-Zionist and it gives them a sort of 'get out of jail free' card. ""If you substitute 'Zion' for 'Jew', which is what they really mean...that's not being anti-Israel, it's being anti-Semitic."" He added: ""I think there's definitely an unpleasant tone in a lot of politics."" Earlier this month, senior Labour MP Louise Ellman - who is Jewish - told Sky News: ""Some (party members) are being allowed to get away with posting anti-Semitic comments in their tweets and on their websites. I have raised this in parliamentary meetings"". In March, local Labour Party vice-chair Vicki Kirby was suspended for using her Twitter feed to make anti-Semitic comments, such as saying that Jewish people have ""big noses"". The comments had been made between 2011 and 2014. She had been suspended from the party in 2014 but her suspension was later lifted until being reinstated after complaints following her being made vice-chair of Labour's Woking branch."

Of the 2,150 men and women surveyed in the online poll, 8% admitted to sexting. But a far greater proportion - 35% - did not think it amounted to being unfaithful. Sexting is defined as sending flirty messages or explicit images to someone who is not your partner. The study was commissioned by law firm Slater and Gordon after finding its clients were increasingly citing adultery in divorce proceedings. However, in the UK someone can only sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery if their husband or wife has had extramarital sex. Rupi Rai, family lawyer at Slater and Gordon, said: ""We have seen a rise in the number of clients coming to us who think their partner has crossed the line and committed adultery, but not in the traditional sense. ""What some might consider sending flirty messages or explicit pictures, others consider to be detrimental to their relationship and cause as much hurt and upset as physically cheating. ""The research is a real warning to couples about being careful not to cross that line.""
