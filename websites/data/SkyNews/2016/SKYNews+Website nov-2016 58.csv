2016-11-08,"Stephen Fry will again be hosting the BAFTAs - despite a backlash over his ""bag lady"" joke at the awards ceremony earlier this year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/stephen-fry-to-return-as-baftas-host-despite-bag-lady-joke-backlash-10649214,"The comedian and actor will be hosting the event for a 12th year at its new venue, the Royal Albert Hall, in February. The 59-year-old was criticised last year after calling costume design winner Jenny Beavan a ""bag lady"" after she collected her award for Mad Max: Fury Road dressed in trousers, a leather jacket and scarf. ""Only one of the great cinematic costume designers would come to an awards dressed as a bag lady,"" Fry said as Beavan walked off the stage. After audible boos in the auditorium and criticism on Twitter, Fry announced he was quitting the social media website. ""So just a word to the tragic figures who think calling Jenny Beavan a bag lady was an insult. She's a dear friend and she got it. Derrr,"" he wrote. However, some users appeared to find the joke distasteful. One Twitter user said: ""Bit rich of Stephen Fry to slag that woman's outfit off and say she looks a bag lady when he's dressed as a pool table #EEBAFTAs."" ""Will all you sanctimonious f****** f*** the f*** off Jenny Beavan is a friend and joshing is legitimate. Christ I want to leave the planet,"" Fry added before erasing the account. ""Too many people have peed in the pool for you to want to swim there any more."" The comedian later announced he was planning to move to Hollywood with his husband Elliott Spencer. It wasn't the first time Fry quit social media, and the presenter has now returned to Twitter. BAFTA bosses announced Fry's return and the new location as a ""perfect fit for the awards"". The ceremony will also feature Cirque du Soleil, which will be in residence at the Royal Albert Hall when the awards are held. ""I am also thrilled we have the opportunity to work with Cirque du Soleil, during its season at the Royal Albert Hall,"" BAFTA chief executive Amanda Berry said. ""And have no doubt that next year's ceremony will be all the more magical for this creative collaboration."" Nominations for the awards will be announced on 10 January. The awards ceremony will be on 12 February."
2016-11-08,Two prisoners remain on the run after escaping from Pentonville prison in north London.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/two-escaped-pentonville-prisoners-left-dummies-in-their-beds-10649210,"They were discovered missing on Monday morning when jail staff found mannequins in their beds.  It is believed the pair used diamond-tipped cutting equipment to break through cell bars before scaling the perimeter wall.  A manhunt is now underway for James Whitlock, aged 31, and 28-year-old Matthew Baker.  Police have warned the public not to approach the two convicts as they could become violent, but to call 999 if they see either of them.  Baker was on remand awaiting sentencing after being found guilty two weeks ago of the attempted murder of a man at a flat in Dagenham. He was due to be sentenced on Friday. Whitlock, who has the word 'Tracy' tattooed on his body, was also on remand after being charged with conspiracy to burgle more than 19 ATMs between December 2015 and August 2016. Mike Rolfe, from the Prison Officers' Association, told Sky News the escapees would have had help from outside, and equipment may have been sent in by drone.  The Metropolitan Police said it was called to Pentonville in Islington at 11.44am on Monday.  A spokeswoman from the Prison Service said: ""Public protection is our top priority and we take escapes from custody extremely seriously.  ""We are working closely with the police and are urgently investigating the matter.""  Last month a 21-year-old inmate, Jamal Mahmoud, died after being stabbed in Pentonville, while two others were injured in the same attack. A convicted murderer, John Massey, escaped the north London jail in 2012 after managing to climb a wall using a rope made out of bed sheets, before being recaptured after 48 hours on the run.  The former Justice Secretary, Michael Gove, described Pentonville last year as ""the most dramatic example of failure"" within the prisons estate.  Shadow justice minister Yasmin Qureshi said: ""The past 24 hours have provided yet more evidence of the crisis in our prison estate which has developed under this Tory government."""
2016-11-08,"With the US presidential election nearly upon us, how is the US likely to vote?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/hillary-clinton-or-donald-trump-the-most-likely-scenarios-10649170,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump each need 270 electoral votes.   :: A narrow Clinton victory Most likely - as she retains a 2-3% polling lead.  In the Midwest, she is likely to take Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, plus Virginia and Colorado, which have lots of college-educated voters.  She is also likely to take a few of the close-call states, such as New Hampshire, North Carolina, Florida and Nevada.  Latinos have been turning out in record numbers in early voting, indicating an advantage for Mrs Clinton in the likes of Nevada and Florida in particular.   So long as she wins one of them she edges over the line. Win all of them, and she may almost reach the 332 electoral votes won by Barack Obama in 2012.  :: A Clinton landslide Were she to take the whole lot, it would be a very different scenario.     While the large white working-class populations have put Ohio and Iowa in Mr Trump's column, they could yet swing back.  Traditional Republican strongholds such as Arizona and Georgia are also in doubt for the tycoon.   We could then be heading towards something like Mr Obama's 365 electoral votes in 2008, or even Bill Clinton's 379 in 1996.   :: A narrow Trump victory But if Mrs Clinton falls short in key swing states, then Mr Trump, who is competitive in them all, does have a path to victory. It's even possible that he could win the election while losing the popular vote - as George W Bush did in 2000.  :: A Trump landslide If working-class white voters turn out in unprecedented numbers - as happened with Brexit - it could upset the polls in the Midwest.   And if Mr Trump can add those states to those in which he is already competitive, it is possible he could win well.  :: A strange map Could there be a genuine split from the past?    It's possible - if unlikely - that Mr Trump could win the traditional Democratic states with a large white population in the north, while Mrs Clinton sweeps southern states with a high proportion of college-educated voters and ethnic minorities.  Thus Georgia could vote Democrat for the first time since 1992, at the same time as Minnesota votes Republican for the first time since 1972.  The feasibility of this scenario - even at a stretch - is an indication of how American politics has changed. :: Sky News will bring you every twist and turn of the US election results - and we're the only UK news organisation which will bring you details of the official exit poll. Our special coverage starts on Tuesday at 10pm.

2016-11-08,"Theresa May's childhood sporting hero has affectionately described her as ""like Margaret Thatcher"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-is-like-thatcher-says-ex-cricketer-geoffrey-boycott-10649156,"Geoffrey Boycott, who happened to be staying at the same hotel as the Prime Minister in Delhi, described Mrs May as someone with ""integrity and principles"". The Yorkshire sporting legend, much admired by the cricket-loving PM, said of Mrs May: ""She'll be like Margaret Thatcher, she'll be brilliant."" Asked if he had advice for her, he said: ""She's good, she doesn't need my advice, she'll be fine. She's got a few more strokes than me."" He added: ""She has views and she's strong. Life is about integrity and principles - it should be. We want politicians like that with integrity, with principles, with honesty."" It was reported that whilst Home Secretary, Mrs May had attempted to get Boycott knighted, but her request was blocked by Government officials because of his conviction for assaulting a former girlfriend. He received a three-month suspended sentence and a £5,300 fine from a French court in 1996 for the assault.  He has always denied the charges and a campaign was launched to clear his name, which could lead to the Prime Minister getting her wish. The former England batsman is in India to commentate on the five-match test series, while Mrs May is on an international trade mission.  Asked whether he was in favour of leaving the EU, Boycott said: ""Yes, I always was because we will be independent, not run by France and Germany. ""It's the principle of being ourselves. We've always been successful as an island; trade with people but not let them run our lives."" He added: ""Some of the rules from Europe are stupid."" Another cricketing idol Ian Botham actively campaigned for Brexit."
2016-11-08,"House prices increased by 5.2% in the three months to October, compared to the same period last year, according to a survey by the mortgage lender Halifax.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-house-prices-surge-unexpectedly-in-october-survey-10648893,"The results, which were higher than expected, suggest a reversal of a broad slowdown in the housing market over the past six months. Prices increased by 1.4% in October, compared to 0.3% in September. ""Annual house price growth has nearly halved from a peak of 10% in March this year, but remains robust at 5.2%,"" said Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist. ""This expected slowdown appears to have been largely due to mounting affordability pressures, which have increasingly constrained housing demand,"" he added. Halifax said house price growth may ease further in the coming months, but low mortgage rates and a shortage of properties available should help support price levels. The amount of housing available for sale was largely flat for the period of July to September, but remains around the lowest levels ever recorded. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS market, said that due to the currently resilient state of the economy, house prices may well rise modestly in the near term. ""We believe housing market activity is likely to be increasingly pressurised in 2017 by heightened uncertainty constraining consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, as well as hampering economic activity,"" Mr Archer said. Home sales have broadly stabilised in recent months, following distortions earlier in the year due to the increase in stamp duty on second homes and buy to let purchases. However, year on year, they are down for the third quarter, between July and September, showing an 8% drop compared to the same period in 2015, indicating an overall softening in activity."
2016-11-08,Food courier firm Deliveroo is facing a challenge from a union which has taken steps to try to obtain workers' rights for its riders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/deliveroo-faces-challenge-from-union-over-riders-rights-10649709,"The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) says that as independent contractors, couriers currently have no employment rights. It wants them to gain recognition as workers so that they can obtain paid holiday, the minimum wage, and trade union recognition. The challenge, centred on the collective bargaining rights of Deliveroo riders in the north London borough of Camden, comes after a separate case in which a tribunal ruled in favour of two drivers at ride-hailing app Uber. Uber has said it will appeal. In the Deliveroo case, the union expects a request on collective bargaining to go to a tribunal, which could find that its riders in Camden should be classed as ""workers"". It said the case in Camden would set a legal precedent. IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: ""This case strikes at the very basis upon which the so called 'gig economy' rests. ""The companies say these workers are all independent business people who don't need employment rights and don't need to unionise, we say they are workers hired by big companies and need to be treated as such."" Deliveroo, founded in 2013, has more than 2,500 food outlets signed up to its service in London. The company said in a statement: ""As Deliveroo continues to grow, we are committed to providing great opportunities for UK riders, with the flexible work riders value, and a payment model which is fair, rewarding and better matches riders' time with our customers' orders."""
2016-11-08,"""We will begin by focusing on the core UK business. For our customers this means that in clothing we will improve our core M&S ranges, so that the unique quality, style and fashion of the M&S brand stand out.""",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/rowe-has-work-cut-out-to-make-ms-great-again-10649780,"The determined words of the new Marks & Spencer chief executive, plotting a revival of Britain's most closely watched high street brand. But this is not the utterance of Steve Rowe, in charge of M&S since April this year; rather, it was a pledge made by his predecessor, Marc Bolland, setting out his vision for the brand exactly six years ago. Like many M&S bosses before him, Mr Bolland found the going tough - and if Tuesday's half-year results are a logical yardstick, the chances are that Mr Rowe will too. :: M&S to close dozens of stores as half-year profits tumble by 88% Pessimists would be forgiven for interpreting his announcement as an attempt to manage decline. After a ""forensic"" review of its business, the new boss has confirmed that 30 UK clothing stores and more than 50 overseas outlets will close, with dozens more in its home market being repositioned from general shops to food-only ones. The short-term reasons are understandable: despite an improvement in clothing margins over the last 18 months, critics of M&S's fashion business say it has failed to deliver consistently affordable, attractive product to its core female customer base. The depreciation of sterling has eroded the potential margin gain this year, while the headline figure of total clothing and home sales declining by 5.3% in the half-year to 1 October tells its own story. Looming inflation - flagged by rivals including Lord Wolfson, the boss of Next - presents another headache for Mr Rowe. And realistically, without a permanent clothing boss in place, its sales performance is likely to get worse before it gets better. Mr Rowe is, however, determined to present a picture of M&S's future as one of growth potential. He has reiterated plans to open another 200 Simply Food stores by the end of its 2018-19 financial year. Even there, though, the picture isn't one of unmitigated promise. Like-for-like food sales fell by 0.9% in the first half, suggesting that price-sensitive consumers are also looking elsewhere for their discretionary shop. Against this backdrop, Mr Rowe has probably done the sensible thing and warned the City that his turnaround programme is going to cost up to £200m to exit some of its overseas businesses, as well as £350m to implement the changes in its UK operations. Given this rash of worrying news, M&S is warning about cash returns to shareholders in the second half of the year. Unpredictable and disappointing: M&S's dividend policy is in danger of resembling a too-long narrative of womenswear ranges. Mr Rowe has his work cut out if his tenure is to turn out better than his predecessor's."
2016-11-08,Dame Lowell Goddard has refused to give evidence about her resignation from the child abuse inquiry and rounded on the Government for failing to defend her.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/child-abuse-inquiry-judge-i-will-not-give-evidence-10649738,"The New Zealand judge has refused to speak in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee because it would be ""unacceptable"" for allegations against her to be aired in public, where those who make them are protected from prosecution. In a letter to the committee, Dame Lowell said she had been the ""subject of malicious defamatory attacks"" in the UK media and had informed the committee of ""the falsity of these and their apparent purpose"". She added that were she to give evidence via video link from New Zealand she would not be afforded freedom from prosecution in any allegations she might need to make in her defence. She also heavily criticised the Government for failing to robustly defend her against the allegations of racism and poor treatment of colleagues. Dame Lowell has always denied all the claims made against her. She wrote: ""I am disappointed that there has been no Government defence of me in England, despite the fact that information refuting some of the more serious allegations has been held by the Home Office and your Committee since the time of my initial recruitment."" Dame Lowell's response triggered a furious reaction from the committee chairwoman, Yvette Cooper, who said that it was ""essential"" for Dame Lowell to give evidence either in person or via video link. Ms Cooper said it was ""disgraceful"" from someone ""paid significant amounts of public money to do an extremely important job which she suddenly resigned from, leaving a serious of questions about what has been happening over the last 18 months and why the Inquiry got into difficulties."" She added: ""This is an astonishing response from a paid public servant who should know how important transparency is in an inquiry as sensitive and crucial as this one. ""Child abuse survivors have been let down by the extremely rocky start to this inquiry and we do need answers as to why it went wrong in order to be confident it is back on track now."" However, the committee has no power to force Dame Lowell to give evidence. Last month Dame Lowell disclosed in a letter that she had become the third chairwoman to quit after members of the £100m inquiry panel turned against her in an apparent power struggle. She told of a crunch meeting on 4 August when three of the four members of the panel had confronted her over allegations about her behaviour in the media. Dame Lowell said it was then it became clear she did not have the support of her team and she resigned from her £360,000-a-year position. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Dame Lowell, who has returned home to New Zealand, left because she was lonely and homesick. The Government has come under fire over what they knew and when about the allegations against Dame Lowell. Ms Rudd insists the Home Office was not officially made aware of concerns until 29 July - six days before Theresa May became Prime Minister. However, Mrs May admitted during Prime Minister's Questions last month that there were ""stories"" around about the chairwoman before that. However, she said that as Home Secretary she could not intervene on the basis of ""suspicion"" or ""hearsay"". Drusilla Sharpling, a member of the panel, has told the Home Affairs Select Committee she raised concerns with a Home Office official in the spring, although had asked for it not to be escalated."
2016-11-08,Sports Direct has said it had no knowledge of a camera said to have been hidden in a tray of sandwiches to record a private MPs' meeting.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/sports-direct-denies-knowledge-of-hidden-camera-in-tray-of-sandwiches-10649803,"The sportswear giant was responding to the accusations which came after six members of the business select committee made a surprise visit to the firm's controversial Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. It said it was disappointed that the visit had been overshadowed by reports about the ""possible recording device ... the veracity of which has yet to be determined"". ""The board would like to make it clear that it did not authorise or have any knowledge of the possible recording device,"" the company said. Sports Direct also said members of its workforce had expressed positive views about the company in their meetings with MPs and claimed many expressed ""dissatisfaction"" with how it was portrayed. Mike Ashley, the company's majority owner, said: ""I stand firmly behind the people of Sports Direct, who through no fault of their own have been made a political football by MPs and unions."" Sports Direct said it was delighted that the MPs had made their unannounced visit, but disappointed they made it on a day when they knew Mr Ashley would not be on site. Members of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee visited the Shirebrook warehouse to follow up on their inquiry into working practices at the company. Redcar MP Anna Turley, who was on the visit, said: ""We had a positive tour around, we got to speak to a lot of the workforce and we got to see a lot of people who were very positive about the brand. ""Then at the end of the meeting we sat down to have a private conversation in a room by ourselves, a lady came in with some sandwiches - which was very kind - and I saw her put a recording device on the floor. ""When she left the room I went over to pick it up and there it was: a camera and a recording device. Very disappointing."" Business Secretary Greg Clark today told Parliament the claims were ""extraordinary ... especially for a company that has made declarations that it wants to improve its reputation and image"". Sports Direct has been under fire from unions, investors and politicians over claims of Victorian workhouse conditions at the warehouse, and over its corporate structure. Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, has taken over the role of chief executive after long-term aide Dave Forsey resigned at the end of September. The retailer has now made a commitment to hold an independent review into its corporate governance and working conditions. That followed a bruising AGM when chairman Keith Hellawell clung on despite a vote to oust him by independent shareholders."

""Reunion at some point, definitely - but we just couldn't get our diaries to work in the next 12 months."" Williams left the chart-topping boy band in 1995 to embark on a solo career.  The group, known for hits such as Back For Good, A Million Love Songs and Never Forget, disbanded a year later. Four of the members - Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and Jason Orange - got back together a decade later, before Orange left in 2014. Williams, who has just released a new album The Heavy Entertainment Show, also announced a European tour next year. Joined by pop duo Erasure, the 42-year-old will play 29 shows in 18 countries starting in Britain in June. The Let me Entertain You singer already has 17 Brit music awards and is being presented with another accolade, the Brits Icon Award. He will put on a one-off show in London on Monday night to celebrate. Previous recipients include Elton John and the late David Bowie.  ""The other two people were absolute legends and absolute icons and now I'm getting it and have mixed feelings,"" Williams said.  Adding: ""But I am honoured to be receiving it."""

He said that while Labour MPs would not ""frustrate the process"" the party did have red lines on retaining the ""fullest possible access to the single market"" and staying in the customs union. :: Confusion as Corbyn says he won't block Brexit Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""We accept the mandate to leave the EU and we will not frustrate the process by simply voting down Article 50. ""But the terms upon which we exit are really important and we will be insisting that the Government puts its basic plan before MPs so that we can see it - because what we cannot have is a vote on Article 50 in a vacuum."" Sir Keir added: ""The Government really needs to come clean now and just put its plans before Parliament so we can proceed to examine it and question it."" He warned against the suggestion the Government might try to fast-track Article 50 through Parliament using a resolution, rather than a full bill, saying it would not work. ""It is not right to continue this approach which is to ensure there is no scrutiny. ""Of course the detailed negotiations have to be confidential, of course there cannot be a running commentary for two years, but we are entitled to know the basic terms upon which the Prime Minister is intending to negotiate our future. ""We have all got a stake in it."" It comes after confusion over Labour's position on Article 50 following last week's High Court ruling which said the Prime Minister could not trigger Brexit without putting it before MPs. On Sunday, Jeremy Corbyn told a newspaper that he would join forces with Conservative 'Remain' supporters and other parties to block the process for leaving the EU if the Prime Minister did not guarantee access to the single market and other conditions.  But this morning a source close to Mr Corbyn told Sky News that Labour's support for triggering Article 50 - the starting gun for leaving the EU - was ""unconditional""."

In a radio broadcasting career spanning almost 30 years, Sir Jimmy became known as the ""housewives' choice"" and counted prime ministers and the Queen among his many millions of faithful listeners. The presenter interviewed every PM since Harold Macmillan, with Baroness Thatcher a guest no fewer than 14 times. #Jimmy Young's died.So sad. Such memories from my childhood and teens.I loved his versions of The Man From Laramie and Unchained Melody And he was known as much for his singing talents as for his radio broadcasting, making it to the top of the charts in 1954 with The Man From Laramie, and again in 1955 with Unchained Melody. He was born Leslie Ronald Young in 1921, the only child of a miner in Cinderford, Gloucestershire. His love of music came from his mother who taught him to play the piano at the age of seven, and he went on to become a choirboy at Gloucester Cathedral before winning a scholarship to East Green Grammar School. But his parents could not afford for him to continue his education and he left school to become a baker's boy.  He spent time working as a Minister of Education clerk and managed a hair salon, but had already set his heart on a career in broadcasting and entertainment. While singing and playing piano on the club circuit he landed a record deal in 1949 after being spotted by a producer before going on to help launch Radio 1 in 1967. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1979 and a knighthood in 2002. Me & Sir Jimmy Young in 2003, after recording an hour-long special with him about his book. Without doubt, he was one of the radio greats. pic.twitter.com/Ue8DcJw4Pl Sir Cliff Richard said: ""My first memory of Jimmy Young was as a singer. As a teenager I bought his records Unchained Melody and The Man From Laramie. ""The fact that he could switch from pop star of his time to a top radio presenter speaks highly of his ability to succeed regardless of what he chose to do. He was a great ambassador for our musical profession. We will miss him."" Sir Jimmy Young presented Radio 2's lunchtime show for nearly 30 years, joining the station in 1973 and continuing until his retirement in late 2002. BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: ""Sir Jimmy Young defined Radio 2 and was a true broadcasting pioneer. He will be dearly missed by his many fans."" Radio 2's current lunchtime show presenter Jeremy Vine said: ""Jimmy Young was one of the most important figures in Radio 2's history. ""He understood that listeners were central to the lunchtime show, he brought them on board, and he ensured that politicians were held accountable in a way that was firm but always polite. ""His achievement was his staying power - to still be doing ten hours of live radio a week at the age of 82 was nothing short of remarkable."" LBC radio presenter Iain Dale tweeted: ""Much respect to Sir Jimmy Young ... the word 'legend' is overused, but not in his case. A true icon of radio.""

He allegedly gave them overdoses of GHB, commonly referred to as a rape drug. In his closing speech, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC called Port a ""habitual and compulsive liar"" motivated by his sexual desires. ""The prosecution case is not hard to understand because we say this defendant was driven by his seemingly insatiable appetite for sex with Twinks while they were unconscious,"" he said. Mr Rees went on to argue that Port ""needed to find a way of raping them against their will. The obvious solution was drugs"". The prosecutor pointed to evidence he said showed that the four men all died shortly after being at Port's flat, and said another eight had come forward saying he had tried to take advantage of them sexually. He asked the jury to consider whether Port had been ""selfishly pursuing a fetish for drugging and raping unconscious Twinks"" or whether - as Port claims - it was just a ""dreadful series of coincidences"". During the trial, the jury was shown footage of Port allegedly raping an unconscious man. Port denies murdering Daniel Whitworth, 21; Gabriel Kovari, 22; Anthony Walgate, 23; and Jack Taylor, 25. He also denies a string of sex charges, including administering a substance and rape, in relation to the other eight men, whom he had met through dating websites. The trial continues."
2016-11-08,An MP has accused Sports Direct of hiding a camera in a tray of sandwiches to record a private meeting.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/mps-accuse-sports-direct-of-planting-recording-device-during-meeting-10649432,"The accusation came after six MPs from the business select committee made a surprise visit to the controversial Shirebrook warehouse.  They spent the afternoon at the site in Derbyshire, to follow up on their inquiry into working practices at the company.  Redcar MP Anna Turley, who was on the visit, said: ""We had a positive tour around, we got to speak to a lot of the workforce and we got to see a lot of people who were very positive about the brand. ""Then at the end of the meeting we sat down to have a private conversation in a room by ourselves, a lady came in with some sandwiches - which was very kind - and I saw her put a recording device on the floor. ""When she left the room I went over to pick it up and there it was: a camera and a recording device. Very disappointing."" The sporting goods retailer has been under fire from unions, investors and politicians over its treatment of workers and corporate structure. It is understood Sports Direct was only told about the visit when members of the committee were on their way - and that chief executive Mike Ashley was not on site. Mr Ashley, who took over the role as chief executive after long-term aide Dave Forsey resigned at the end of September, has pledged to put right all the issues of concern within the business. The retailer made a commitment to hold an independent review into its corporate governance and working conditions around the same time as Mr Forsey's departure from the company. That followed a bruising AGM which also left Mr Ashley red-faced after he pulled out wads of personal cash, in £50 notes, from his pockets during a security check. The climbdown followed months of pressure from City institutions concerned about a slump in Sports Direct's share price and the extent of Mr Ashley's control. Sports Direct has already announced new safeguards to combat allegations of Victorian workhouse conditions - including the bullying of staff and aggressive rules - at the Shirebrook warehouse. The visit by members of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee followed a row with Mr Ashley who had once made his appearance before their inquiry conditional on a site visit. The billionaire tycoon, who also owns Newcastle United, has blamed bad publicity from the outcry over Sports Direct's troubles as a reason for a wobble in sales. More recently, it has warned on the effects of the weak pound on its profits."
2016-11-08,"Lower growth forecasts in the wake of the Brexit vote are on course to take a £25bn toll on the public finances, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/hammond-facing-16325bn-budget-black-hole-ifs-study-10649553,"Its analysis of Treasury coffers ahead of Chancellor Philip Hammond's first Autumn Statement later this month estimates weaker gross domestic product (GDP) growth will knock £31bn from tax revenues by 2019/20. It believes this could be offset by savings of £6bn through payments to the EU budget - hence the £25bn figure. However, it said the impact of the extra borrowing would signal a deficit of almost £15bn rather than a surplus of £10bn targeted by former chancellor George Osborne in his final Budget in March. While the economy has proved more resilient than economists forecast after June's EU referendum, Mr Hammond has signalled targeted support for economic growth rather than a spending spree in the wake of predictions that much gloomier times lie ahead. Just last week the Bank of England raised its expectations that the pound's collapse in value risked damaging consumer and business spending through higher inflation, as imported goods become more expensive and filter through. IFS research economist, Thomas Pope, said: ""The new chancellor's first fiscal event will not be easy. ""Growth forecasts are almost sure to be cut, leading to a significant increase in the deficit even if all the very challenging spending cuts currently planned are in fact delivered. ""Given the levels of uncertainty, he might be wise to respond cautiously for now. ""Any new fiscal targets should be reasonably flexible. Any decisions to increase spending or cut taxes in the short run should be taken in the knowledge that significant further austerity after 2020 looks to be on the cards."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the lack of a credible plan in the event of a Leave vote had come back to haunt the Government. He said: ""This report further highlights the past six years of Tory failure on the economy that Philip Hammond supported every step of the way, and which has meant our economy is not properly equipped for any downturn that may arise fromBrexit. ""It is time the Chancellor learnt the lessons of George Osborne rather than repeat them."""

Other stores will be relocated while some new full-line stores will be opened in underserved areas, M&S said. Details of the changes confirm a story first reported last week by Sky News. It follows a review launched by new M&S boss Steve Rowe earlier this year. Mr Rowe said: ""These are tough decisions, but vital to building a future M&S that is simpler, more relevant, multi-channel and focused on delivering sustainable returns."" He said M&S did not have a full list of outlets closing, saying it would look at the overhaul on a ""store-by-store basis"". The group was tight-lipped on the number of UK staff affected by the plans but said where possible it would keep ""job continuity"" for affected employees. :: Rowe has work cut out to make M&S great again M&S reported a fall in profits to £25m for the six months to 1 October, compared to £216m for the same period a year ago. The slump largely related to pension charges but underlying profits were also down, by 19%, thanks to lower clothing and home sales. Shares were down nearly 2%. M&S currently has 304 ""full-line"" stores selling both its food and clothing and home ranges. They account for two-thirds of its UK selling space. But clothing sales have struggled, and were down 5.9% on a like-for-like basis for the first half, including a huge 8.9% slump in the first quarter. Food sales have fared better, but were still down 0.9% over the six-month period. The company said: ""As customer shopping patterns change and customers migrate online, we need to manage our estate proactively to ensure that our clothing and home space is relevant for our customers and profitable for our shareholders."" Meanwhile, M&S is expanding its Simply Food store network, opening 200 new sites by the end of 2018/19. ""In total, M&S expects to have more stores, in more convenient locations for our customers, offering greater employment opportunities for employees,"" it said. Elsewhere, M&S is taking action over loss-making foreign markets with plans to close 53 stores in China, France, Belgium, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Slovakia and slash 2,100 jobs. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the shake-up was a ""bold"" first step by Mr Rowe. He added: ""M&S is cutting its cloth to meet the changing shopping habits of its customers. ""The retailer is shifting away from clothes towards food, focusing on the bit of the business which has been most successful in recent times."" Mr Rowe's move comes two months after he announced more than 500 head office jobs were to be axed."
2016-11-08,Theresa May has offered to relax visa restrictions for Indian people wanting to come to the UK - in return for faster returns of illegal immigrants and overstayers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/pm-visa-deal-if-india-takes-back-more-illegal-migrants-10648916,"Speaking on a trade visit to Delhi, the Prime Minister said: ""The UK will consider further improvements to our visa offer if at the same time we can step up the speed and volume of returns of Indians with no right to remain in the UK."" Pressure has been on Theresa May to offer better visa access to the UK in return for post-Brexit trade. But she is also focused on trying to reach the long-missed target of reducing UK immigration to the tens of thousands. Some have commented that in return for controlling immigration from the EU, Britain will have to relax border controls on citizens from other counties in order to forge global trade deals. Local media in India have reacted negatively to increased restrictions on student visas since new rules came into force in 2011. This has led to a 20,000 drop in the number of international students coming to the UK, Indian officials have claimed. There is also pressure on the Prime Minister to allow more work visas to the UK as she attempts to build trade relationships with the world's fastest growing major economy. Asked yesterday by Sky News whether new trade deals could lead to a relaxation of the visa system, the PM said: ""We have a visa system for countries outside of the EU that ensures the brightest and the best can come to the United Kingdom."" When it came to visa applications from India, she added: ""Nine out of 10 are already accepted. We have, I believe, a good system. We will be talking about trade and I expect new deals will be signed while we are here."" Mrs May has also offered to make India the first visa country to be added to the Registered Traveller Scheme, under which business travellers can clear border control more quickly in British airports.  It will allow passengers to come through the e-Passport gates usually reserved for Britons and Europeans and without a requirement to complete a landing card. The Prime Minister, who is in Delhi to pave the way for the UK's first post-Brexit trade deal, said: ""Trade is an important part of our relationship with India. ""India is the third biggest investor into the UK - second biggest creator of private sector jobs in the UK - and the UK is the biggest G20 investor into India, but there is more we can do."" Mrs May said her visit would coincide with business deals between the two countries worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Speaking after the the speech, a Number 10 spokeswoman said the ""assessment criteria won't change"" but the ""offer"" on visas would be based around ""improving our service to make it easier for people to apply - for example we could look at cost""."

It comes after a senior Government source revealed to Sky News Theresa May's administration was preparing the first draft of a bill to invoke Article 50 in case it loses the appeal. In a statement to the Commons, Mr Davis insisted the Government remained on course to deliver on the timetable promised by the Prime Minister, whatever the Supreme Court decides. He told MPs: ""It's likely that any hearing will be scheduled in the Supreme Court in early December. We would hope the judgment would be provided soon after. ""This timetable remains consistent with our aim to trigger Article 50 by the end of March next year."" Mr Davis criticised attempts by opposition MPs, including former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, to secure a second referendum, saying they were attempting to ""thwart"" Brexit. He said another public vote on the terms of the UK's exit would encourage the rest of the EU to impose ""impossibly difficult conditions"" in a bid to ensure voters opted to reverse June's decision to leave. ""In other words, the whole approach is designed to wreck the negotiations,"" Mr Davis said. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said ministers had refused to detail how it would respond if it lost the appeal. He said that while he did not expect Mrs May to reveal her negotiating hand, there were issues such as the single market and customs union where ministers should set out their stance. He said her administration's approach was ""unravelling"" in an ""ugly way"", stepping up his attack on ministers over the treatment of the judiciary following the High Court verdict. ""We saw a series of appalling personal attacks on the judges, including the suggestion that they were enemies of the people,"" Sir Keir said. Sir Keir, a former director of public prosecutions, said Lord Chancellor Liz Truss had been ""too slow and too reluctant"" to defend the judiciary. Mr Davis said in his statement that ""we believe in and value the independence of our judiciary"", but he also defended the freedom of the press. ""Both these things underpin our democracy,"" he said."

It has raised its long-term traffic forecasts by more than 10% to 200 million passengers by March 2024, despite its Brexit concerns. The company said traffic increased by 12% to 65 million customers over the first half of the year, whilst the price of an average air fare fell 10% to €50 (£44.61). CEO Michael O'Leary described this as ""good news for customers, not so good news for shareholders"", but added that the latter would have to ""learn to live with it for the foreseeable future"". He went on: ""For passengers what is inevitable is in the next 12 to 18 months you benefit by having lower fares. ""But over the medium term if there is a hard Brexit there will be less capacity here in the UK and less capacity means higher prices, once the hell we know what Brexit looks like."" The boost in profits comes despite a turbulent market that has been impacted by terror attacks overseas, the economic fallout following the Brexit vote and air traffic control strikes. Mr O'Leary, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, said uncertainty over Brexit had led the airline to reduce its planned growth in the UK next year from 12% to 5% - switching this capacity to accelerate growth in markets such as Italy, Germany and Belgium. He said the company had faced ""difficult market conditions"" that included ""the adverse economic impact of the Brexit vote in June which saw sterling weaken materially over the peak summer period"". The Dublin-based airline slashed its earnings forecast in October as it off-sets the impact of the fall in the value of the pound. However the company said it remained comfortable with its adjusted full-year forecast and expects annual earnings of between €1.30bn and €1.35bn (£1.17bn and £1.22bn). British airlines are waiting to see whether the UK will remain a member of the EU's Open Skies aviation free market as part of Brexit negotiations with the EU. ""We hope that the UK will remain a member of Europe's 'Open Skies' system, but until the final outcome of Brexit has been determined, we will continue to adapt to changing circumstances in the best interests of our customers, our people and our shareholders,"" the company said."

But after an operation that lasted more than six hours, the situation was brought under control. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""Specially trained prison officers and staff from the emergency services have successfully resolved an incident involving a number of prisoners at HMP Bedford. ""An investigation into this incident will take place. We are absolutely clear that prisoners who behave in this way will be punished and could spend significantly longer behind bars."" Mobile phone footage from inside a prison - but which cannot be verified - was posted on social media. Videos showed chaotic scenes with scores of prisoners out of their cells and in the prison's gangways, shouting and bellowing. One video showed what appeared to be paper and furniture strewn across an atrium floor. There were also reports of loud bangs or explosions coming from inside the prison. There were no injuries to prison staff but two inmates were treated for injuries that were not thought to be serious. Tyler Johnston, 21, who said he spent four months inside the jail on drugs charges, said prisoners took batons, raided safes containing phones and drugs, and locked other inmates inside cells. Speaking outside the prison, he said: ""The prisoners were running it last night, not the screws. ""Bedford Prison is falling apart, there's cockroaches everywhere, the floor's peeling off... it's an absolute state. When you put people under that much strain they're going to bite."" On Monday, a prison official said batches of inmates would be transferred from the jail ""throughout the day"". The first inmates were taken away from the prison on Sunday night after the disturbances were brought under control, the official added. Private contractor trucks were stationed outside the compound on Monday, with police vehicles including a dog unit nearby. Police vans marked as carrying chemicals including ""irritants"", ""flammable liquid"" and ""compressed gas"" were also outside the walls of the compound. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association (POA), said some guards were forced to retreat to a ""safe place"" while large numbers of prisoners ran amok. The disorder comes after the head of the POA Mike Rolfe last week warned British jails had been engulfed by a ""bloodbath"". Mr Gillan said: ""The POA has been warning about this situation of violence in our prisons - it would appear it's coming to fruition. ""I just hope there's no prisoners or indeed prison officers injured in the violence."" Richard Fuller, MP for Bedford and Kempston, will put an ""urgent question"" to Justice Secretary Liz Truss in Parliament on Monday, according to local media. HMP Bedford, which has been on its current site since 1801, currently holds around 500 inmates, according to a HM Inspectorate of Prisons report in September."

The body of her boyfriend was found a day later - they had been missing since October. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright has said investigators are ""not even close"" on identifying the victims. Earlier on Sunday, Kohlhepp had appeared in court charged with the murders of four other people at a motorcycle garage in 2003. The 45-year-old, who is a registered sex offender, had confessed to the massacre hours after the woman was discovered at his rural property. His court appearance fell on the 13th anniversary of the mass shooting, which shocked and mystified the state and was left unresolved for years. The hearing was attended by loved ones of the four victims, and they claim Kohlhepp was a disgruntled customer who had visited the store several times. Investigators say Kohlhepp has given them information about the cold case that only the killer would know. Police have warned they may make more disturbing discoveries as they trace Kohlhepp's steps since his release from an Arizonan prison in 2001. As a teenager, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbour at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Police officers, as well as FBI and Homeland Security agents, are now widening their investigation to properties currently or formerly owned by Kohlhepp - some of which may lie beyond South Carolina."
2016-11-08,The Pensions Regulator's decision to initiate formal proceedings against Sir Philip and Lady Green and Dominic Chappell over the hole in the BHS pension scheme is a dramatic moment in this long-running saga.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161108101115/http://news.sky.com/story/bhs-pensioners-face-drawn-out-process-over-pensions-wrangle-10643010,"However, for the 20,000 or so former employees of BHS who are anxious about the health of the scheme, there is unlikely to be any quick relief. This is merely the start of what is likely to be a very long and drawn-out process. :: Watchdog steps up probe into Green after failure to reach BHS pension deal What the regulator has done this week is send a ""warning notice"" to Sir Philip, to Mr Chappell and to Taveta Investments, the ultimate holding company of Sir Philip's Arcadia retail empire, which is controlled by his wife, Tina. This is a written statement setting out to those contacted why the team working on the BHS situation at the Pensions Regulator believes there is a case for the regulator to pursue them for money. Sir Philip, Taveta and Mr Chappell are now given ""a reasonable opportunity"" to respond to the warning notice. Once these have been received, the case is reviewed, if necessary being referred to a Determinations Panel. If the panel then decides that the regulator can move ahead to the next stage, those being pursued for money can appeal to an Upper Tribunal in the courts, which reviews the case from scratch. The tribunal's decisions can also be challenged in the Court of Appeal. Then, and only then - assuming the tribunal or the courts agree that there is a case to answer - would the regulator be able to go after the various parties. The regulator's first step, assuming it has the backing of the tribunal or the courts, would be to go for a Financial Support Direction (FSD). This would require Sir Philip, Taveta and Mr Chappell to put in place ongoing support for the BHS pension scheme that would first have to be agreed with the regulator. If no agreement can be reached, the regulator may then issue a Contribution Notice (CN), which would demand a specified sum of money from Sir Philip, Mr Chappell and Taveta. These rules have been in place since 2004, when the then Pensions Minister, Malcolm Wicks, stressed that individuals would only be issued with contribution notices if they have had some say in the company's decision to evade its responsibilities to the pension scheme, as well as giving them plenty of scope to appeal. The rules were subsequently tweaked in 2008 to give legal protection to the sellers of companies with large pension deficits, allowing them to seek a ""clearance notice"" from the regulator, protecting them from subsequent demands to fill in any such deficits. Ros Altmann, the former Pensions Minister, has questioned this morning why, when he sold BHS to Mr Chappell for £1 in March last year, Sir Philip did not seek such a clearance notice. The regulator has only used its powers sparingly down the years. Contribution notices are pretty rare and one has never been issued before in the kind of size likely in the case of BHS. Recent examples have involved relatively small sums, such as the contribution notice issued in May last year, when the regulator chased a businessman called Richard Williams for £382,136. This was in respect of Carrington Wire, a Yorkshire-based business he had previously owned, which went into liquidation in December 2012 leaving the pension scheme with an £18m shortfall. On another occasion, in February 2010, the regulator issued a contribution notice against two former directors of Desmond & Sons, a Northern Ireland-based clothing manufacturer that went bust in 2004. They were ordered to contribute £1m. These examples, though, only serve to highlight the typical length of time between a company becoming insolvent and the regulator issuing a contribution notice against those deemed to be responsible for a pension scheme deficit. The regulator has, though, not been afraid to go after large companies as well as small businessmen. In 2014, it issued a contribution notice to Dunelm, the soft furnishings and homewares group, after payroll errors at the company prevented some employees from being automatically enrolled into the pension scheme. Again though, the payment sought was a relatively small one, of £143,000. By issuing a warning notice, the Pensions Regulator is clearly signalling its frustration with how negotiations have been going so far with Sir Philip, despite his insistence that the chairman of the trustees of the BHS pension scheme supports the ""credible and substantial"" proposal he has made. And, although it could take many years and could prove very costly for the regulator to pursue Taveta, Sir Philip and Mr Chappell, it is unlikely to back down. This is because the sheer size of the pensions deficit at BHS is so large that it will want to avoid the cost of that being borne by the Pensions Protection Fund lifeboat. Moreover, as this has been such a high profile case, the regulator will be keen to prove that the current pensions regulation is working effectively and that it is an effective regulator. The shots fired on Wednesday evening could merely be the opening skirmishes of a very long war."

However, he said that was only possible as long as people retain faith in democracy and are unwavering in their democratic principles. Mr Obama spoke of the importance of free elections, ""even if your candidate doesn't always win"", and reiterated his pledge to work with Mr Trump's team in the coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition of power. In what is likely to be his final major address abroad, he warned fellow world leaders on Wednesday: ""People have to know that they're being heard."" He said communities were increasingly feeling disconnected from their governments and other institutions. Mr Obama said globalisation has brought many economic benefits to the world. But in a reference to the anger that saw the UK vote to leave the European Union and Mr Trump's shock victory last week, he warned it is feeding a rising ""tribalism"" and ""nationalism"" that is breeding a ""suspicion"" of institutions. ""The same forces of globalisation and technology and integration that have delivered so much progress, have created so much wealth, have also revealed deep fault lines,"" he said. ""If you had to choose blindly what moment you'd want to be born, you'd choose now, because the world has never collectively been wealthier, better educated, healthier, less violent - that's hard to imagine given what we see in the news - but it's true."" However, coupled with advances in technology, part of the effect of globalisation has been an increase in feelings of inequality, with smaller workforces being used to produce goods and jobs and manufacturing moving abroad, he said. The sight of ""the rich and the powerful"" seemingly living by a different set of rules - ""avoiding taxes, manipulating loopholes"" - ""feeds a profound sense of injustice and a feeling that our economies are increasingly unfair"", he warned.

2016-11-16,A controlled explosion has been carried out on a WW2 bomb which was dislodged from the seabed in Portsmouth Harbour.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161116232851/http://news.sky.com/story/evacuation-as-unexploded-ww2-bomb-found-in-portsmouth-harbour-10659246,"The 500lb explosive was found during routine dredging work for the next generation of Royal Navy aircraft carriers. Its discovery prompted the closure of the port, as well as the evacuation of shops and residential areas at Gunwharf Quays. The bomb was towed to an area east of the Isle of Wight, where a controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Navy's Fleet Diving Squadron. An area of restricted air space was established while the bomb was destroyed. The discovery came after another 1,100lb German bomb was found at the end of September during dredging work, which led to the evacuation of Gunwharf Quays. A torpedo was also found earlier in September. Commander Del McKnight, the diving squadron's chief, said the incident was ""business as usual"" for the Royal Navy. He said: ""We've had more callouts to Portsmouth than we would usually see because of the extent of the dredging works being done to make way for HMS Queen Elizabeth. ""But we have teams on standby at 10 minutes notice around the UK ready to deal with these things."" Vice Admiral Jonathan Woodcock said the bomb disposal team which dealt with the device was ""cool as a cucumber"". After the explosive was discovered the Wight Link terminal, Old Portsmouth, Portsmouth Harbour station and Gosport ferry station were placed behind a 300m safety cordon. Staff at the naval base were moved outside the cordon while attractions in the port city were also closed to visitors, including Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Around 200 people were stranded in a ferry off the harbour as a Commodore Clipper was held away from the area. A Royal Navy spokesperson said: ""The device was found by a dredging barge carrying out work in the harbour before the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth - the Navy's new 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier - into the naval base next spring."""

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""At 11.55pm on Tuesday, a 26-year-old man was shot while sitting in his Audi vehicle at a junction in Scotland Street, Glasgow. ""He was taken by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, where he died a short time later. Police are treating the death as murder."" Scotland Street has been closed both ways to all traffic while police carry out their investigations. A police van was present outside the multi-storey car park at the scene on Wednesday morning.

2016-11-16,"Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have agreed they will work together to tackle international terrorism and extremism, the Kremlin says.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161116232851/http://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-putin-agree-to-target-terrorism-and-extremism-10657849,"The two men spoke for the first time on the telephone since Mr Trump's unexpected election victory last Tuesday, with the Kremlin adding they will work towards ""constructive co-operation"" to improve ""the extremely unsatisfactory state of Russian-US relations at present"". Moscow said the pair would continue contact by phone but would not be meeting before Mr Trump is inaugurated as President on 20 January next year. A Kremlin spokesman said Syria and the Crimea were not among the topics discussed during the first call. A possible thawing of East-West relations appeared to be having an effect when NATO also appeared to reach out by saying the military alliance wanted more discussions with Russia. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""The message from NATO has been that we want dialogue with Russia. ""Russia is our biggest neighbour, Russia is there to stay and especially when tensions run high and especially when we face many different security challenges, it is important to have dialogue."" Mr Trump will enter the White House as relations between Barack Obama and Mr Putin have become strained over several issues including the Syrian war, where the countries back different sides. There has also been tension in recent years over the Ukraine conflict, while allegations of Russian cyber attacks featured in the election campaign. Mr Trump's team said he and Mr Putin discussed a range of issues including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economic issues and the historical US-Russia relationship. A statement added: ""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia."" During the election race, Mr Trump had warm words for the Russian president, suggesting he was a stronger leader than Mr Obama. When asked how he would be able to change Mr Putin's stance on key issues, Mr Trump said he thought he could. He said: ""I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin, and I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia."" After Mr Trump won the election, Mr Putin said Russia was ready to do its part to fully restore ties with Washington. Mr Trump's apparent warmth to Mr Putin and his election campaign comments that NATO was ""obsolete"" had led some European nations to express concern about his foreign policy.  President Obama, who is on his last tour of Europe before Mr Trump takes office, assured people in his first stop Greece on Tuesday that the US considers the NATO alliance a cornerstone of its security. Mr Stoltenberg added that he was adamant that the Ukraine's ""territorial integrity"" should never be violated and that he agreed with Mr Trump that European NATO members should step up their defence spending. The UK Prime Minister Theresa May's spokeswoman said on Tuesday that Britain hopes to raise the issue of NATO with Mr Trump at any early engagement."

2016-11-16,A Sky News investigation has discovered the NHS trusts putting patients at risk by not protecting their data online.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161116232851/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-patients-being-put-at-risk-because-of-cybersecurity-flaws-10657537,"Seven NHS trusts, serving more than two million people, spent nothing on cybersecurity in 2015. Sky News worked with security experts to find serious flaws in their cybersecurity, which could be easily exploited by relatively unskilled hackers. Hacker House was able to find misconfigured email servers, outdated software and security certificates, along with NHS trusts' emails and passwords, through public searches. Jennifer Arcuri, co-founder of Hacker House, told Sky News: ""I would have to say that the security across the board was weak for many factors. ""Out of date SSLs, out of date software, it was very clear that you could bypass any number of these trusts just by doing the right recon online. ""So if I was an adversary looking to get into any of these trusts or take advantage or change, manipulate or send communications on behalf of a doctor, I could, just because the information was already there."" Gary Colman, an NHS employee attached to the West Midlands Ambulance Service who conducts penetration testing of trusts, told Sky News: ""It's a game of cat and mouse to be honest. ""It's ever evolving. And trying to stay on top as both a hacker, an ethical hacker, but also from the point of view of NHS IT teams, is just a huge task. ""We find varying levels of IT security within the NHS, and local government as well. Some organisations are very very secure, others need a little more attention. ""At the end of the day if someone hacks into an NHS trust, somebody could die."" Last week, two NHS trusts in Lincolnshire were forced to cancel operations after a virus infected their computer systems. Derriford Hospital in Plymouth was also targeted by hackers and had to restore its systems from a back-up. Hospitals in the US have been shut down by hackers demanding ransoms. The investigation, carried out using Freedom of Information laws, revealed a postcode lottery when it comes to cybersecurity. Sky News received responses from 97 NHS trusts. The average annual spend for an NHS trust was £23,040, but six trusts spent at least £100,000. Forty-five NHS trusts were unable to specify their cybersecurity budget at all. The investigation also revealed that trusts are suffering an increasing amount of personal data breaches, from 3,133 in 2014 to 4,177 last year, and that cyber incidents are accounting for more breaches, from eight in 2014 to 60 last year. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We expect all parts of the NHS to take the threat of cybersecurity extremely seriously so that patient data is protected. ""We already have in place cybersecurity support services such as careCERT, and are continuing to take action with NHS Digital to enable Hospital Trusts to drive forward improvements in security where needed."" :: A previous version of this article said Derriford Hospital paid a ransom.  This was incorrect.  The hospital restored its system from a back-up, avoiding a ransom."
2016-11-16,The unemployment rate fell to its lowest level for almost 11 years in the three months after the UK's shock vote to leave the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161116232851/http://news.sky.com/story/jobless-rate-falls-to-48-lowest-level-since-2005-10659296,"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a rate of 4.8% between July and September - a level not seen since the third quarter of 2005 - with the number of unemployed falling by 37,000 to 1.6 million. But there was some evidence that hiring was easing as the number of people in work rose by 49,000. That was the slowest increase since the first quarter of the year. The referendum result sparked warnings of a possible recession ahead, but the economy has proved more resilient than those forecasts suggested as consumers and businesses await details of the country's planned exit from the bloc. New independent stats show the employment rate is the highest since records began in 1971 pic.twitter.com/H3AnLLk2oj Amid a looming threat to spending from higher inflation - a consequence of the pound's slump in value making overseas goods more expensive - the ONS said wages, excluding the effects of bonuses, were growing by an average 2.4% year-on-year. That is comfortably above the current rate of consumer price inflation of 0.9%, but there are grim predictions of a new squeeze to consumer spending power in 2017. The Bank of England sees a jobless rate of 5.6% in two years' time - at the height of the negotiations with Brussels on the terms of the UK's EU departure. The ONS reported a larger-than-expected rise in unemployment benefit claimants in October - with the number jumping by 9,800 - but it said the figure had been revised upwards to take changes to the system into account. It also confirmed a slowing in productivity, in statistics that will worry economists, with output per hour growing 0.2% in the third quarter of the year, down from 0.6% in the previous three months. The ONS blamed slower GDP growth ""combined with an increase in average weekly hours worked and stronger employment."" The figures were also being scrutinised for signs the Brexit vote had sparked an exodus of EU nationals. The ONS said that limited evidence available from the Labour Force Survey suggested ""the referendum outcome and subsequent devaluation of sterling has had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force"". Giving his reaction to the wider figures, employment minister Damian Hinds said: ""Yet again we have a strong set of figures, with employment continuing to run at a record high and unemployment falling to an 11-year low. ""Growth is being fuelled by full-time professional jobs while wages are continuing to perform strongly, which underlines the resilience of the UK labour market."" But TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Real pay growth is the slowest it's been since early 2015. ""Wages are not growing fast enough to withstand the rise in inflation expected next year. ""Without swift action from the government, working people could soon by paying the price for Brexit with another fall in living standards."""

Broadly it is focused at home, but his new approach to trade creates opportunities and problems for Britain's own efforts to change its relationship in the world. The new US President faces a sceptical world, but clearly believes that Brexit Britain is both trailblazer and kindred spirit for his ""anti-elite"" political revolution. That should enable a fast-track trade arrangement. Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House has close relations with senior Conservatives, and soon after Brexit called for ""discussions with Great Britain to ease concerns so that we do have a smooth trade relationship with Great Britain... our indispensable ally"". This could be one of the areas where Mr Trump can carry his fellow Republicans. So the prospect of being near the ""front of a queue"" rather than behind the EU and Trans-Pacific Partnership is now very real. For good measure, Nigel Farage may even get a job with President Trump. Whereas Hillary Clinton would have almost certainly made a beeline for Berlin and Chancellor Angela Merkel as her first visit as President, Mr Trump may well focus on London. He has expressed scepticism about the European Union, and described his own electoral earthquake as ""Brexit times five, Brexit times ten"". However, it is impossible to escape his wider plans which involve ripping up some of the international trading architecture. He is a critic of the World Trade Organisation, in particular China's membership terms. He wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement deal with Canada and Mexico. He wants to build a wall on the US southern border with Mexico. He repeatedly told voters that China and Mexico were stealing US jobs and ""stealing US prosperity"". During the campaign he actively threatened tariffs against China. His team believes that Germany and China manipulate their currencies in order to boost their exports. He has threatened to use trade tariffs to ""end trade wars"" that are already in existence, by what seems to many as starting trade wars. It is very difficult not to see his election as part of a backlash against globalisation, which could fundamentally alter the architecture of the world economy. On security, the relationship with an increasingly assertive Russia will be key. Baltic states will need reassuring about Mr Trump's lukewarm approach to NATO and warm words about President Putin. Theresa May is leading the charge on Russian sanctions, it is unclear whether Mr Trump will back them. So yes, Britain stands to be at the front of the queue of Trump trade deals. But does that queue lead anywhere quickly? A closer special relationship is plausible, but where President Trump takes the world more generally is far more of a mystery. :: Watch every twist and turn of the US election fallout live on Sky News Read more::: Donald Trump wins: US election results in full:: Markets take Trump win in stride after wobble:: Inequality, globalisation and why Donald Trump won:: Donald Trump: US President number 45 stand up:: So what does Donald Trump mean for Brexit?:: Melania Trump: From model to US First Lady:: Who is Vice President-elect Mike Pence?"

Details of his accuser's sexual behaviour were disclosed in court following an ""exceptional"" ruling by the Court of Appeal. The review announcement comes amid concerns the move ""weakened"" safeguards for alleged victims and could deter women coming forward to report sexual offences in other cases. Mr Evans, 27, was originally found guilty of rape in 2012, but the second trial was ordered after his conviction was quashed earlier this year. Defence lawyers have been barred from cross-examining alleged rape victims in court about their sexual behaviour or history since 1999. However, Lady Justice Hallett ruled the case involving Mr Evans was ""rare"" and that it was appropriate to allow ""forensic examination"" of the complainant's sexual behaviour. The unusual step saw the inclusion of evidence from two other men who claimed they had sex with the woman at around the same time of the alleged offence, and who described their encounters in terms that supported Mr Evans' account of what happened. Campaigners reacted angrily to the move, saying it set a dangerous legal precedent. Calls for a report into the operation of the legislation, which appears under Section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, were made during the committee stage of the Policing and Crime Bill in the House of Lords. Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames, a Liberal Democrat peer and QC, said: ""The point here and the point that we seek to have reviewed is whether as a result of the Ched Evans case there might be cases where the restrictive nature of Section 41 has or may be watered down and we need to look at how it's operating. ""It is very important that rape gets reported and it is very important that the legislation in place is certainly as restrictive as we always thought Section 41 was and as the textbooks say it is. ""And the public concern is that this case seems to have weakened that protection."" Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford told peers questions about a complainant's previous sexual history were only allowed when ""a strict set of criteria are met"". But she added: ""We are aware of the recent concern about the admissibility of a complainant's sexual history and wider perceptions about the law. ""We accept that the concerns should be looked at and we intend to deal with it. ""We have committed to looking at how the law is working in practice and we will do so as expeditiously as possible in order to understand whether any further action needs to be taken."""

It was in the area of her temple.  ""She fell backwards into the ground and there was blood pouring down her face."" Ms Major added that he was shouting something like ""keep Britain independent"" or ""British independence"".  Continuing her evidence, Ms Major said: ""Fazila shouted 'get away from us, she has two little kids'.  ""I was just screaming for help. I thought if some people came, he might go away. ""He was making motions towards us with the knife and Jo was lying in the road and she shouted out 'get away, get away you two. Let him hurt me. Don't let him hurt you'. ""He shot her twice more and then started stabbing her again.  ""She was on the floor. She didn't get up again."" Ms Aswat told the Old Bailey she had urged Ms Cox to run away between attacks but the MP replied: ""Fazila, I can't run, I'm hurt."" Ms Aswat added: ""When he first came back I was standing over Jo, saying to her 'just think of (your children), you need to get up and run.'   ""When he came back I started swinging my handbag.   ""He swung his knife towards me, a couple of times, not to attack but because he wanted to get me away from her so he could attack her again.    ""Jo was in my arms. It was probably only two or three minutes before the ambulance arrived but it felt like a lifetime.""  The Old Bailey has also heard that Thomas Mair told police ""it's me"" and ""I'm a political activist"" as he was apprehended by police.   The court was told that a black holdall Mair was carrying contained a loaded sawn-off rifle, a bag of bullets, a dagger and a leaflet about the EU referendum.  Mair is accused of killing Ms Cox a week before the vote took place in June.  Giving evidence, PC Craig Nicholls said he and PC Jonathan Wright arrested Mair in Risedale Avenue, about a mile from where the MP had been attacked.  PC Nicholls told the jury that PC Wright leaned out of the patrol car and ordered Mair to put his bag down and show his hands ""several times"".   PC Nicholls said: ""He dropped the bag to his right-hand side. He turned around and it was very quick, put his hands into his pockets. ""I just remember seeing loose change fall out of his pockets. ""At that point he put his arms out and said 'It's me'."" PC Nicholls added that as he and his colleague ""rugby-tackled him to the ground"", Mair said: ""I'm a political activist.""  PC Wright told the jury: ""As we reached the male, his arms moved towards his belt line. ""I was fearful because he had a loose-fitting shirt and I could not see what he had underneath so we both took him to the ground. ""I asked him: 'What have you got on you?' and he told me 'I've got a knife in my pocket'."" PC Wright added: ""I opened the bag to have a look in it. I saw a firearm.""  Simon Russell Flint QC, defending Mair, suggested his client did not say ""it's me"", or claim to be a political activist, pointing out there was a lot of radio noise and the police car's engine was running.  But PC Nicholls replied: ""He did say it."" A scenes of crime officer found a dagger and sheath inside the sports bag, the Old Bailey heard.  Jurors were also told that another blade in a gold-coloured cylinder was among some items in the road.   Mair denies murder, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon.  In addition, he has also pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to a 77-year-old man, Bernard Carter-Kenny, on the same date. The trial continues."

""The current political approach and the absence of a clear overarching plan for exiting the EU means there is neither."" It claims there is no public justification for the Government's communication silence, saying: ""Silence is not a strategy.  ""Failure to reveal the Government's plan to reach a negotiating position is eroding confidence among business and investors, and encouraging unhelpful speculation about what the final destination might be."""

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch said its initial review of the on-tram data shows it was travelling at a speed of approximately 44mph as it entered a sharp bend with a 12mph limit. Six men and one woman died, and more than 50 people were injured. The investigation has found no evidence of track defects or a malfunction of the tram's braking system. Investigators also revealed the tram travelled for 25 metres on its side after overturning.  Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Logan, 52, Philip Seary, 57, and Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, and Robert Huxley, 63, all from New Addington, were all killed in the crash. Mark Smith, 35, and Donald Collett, 62, both from Croydon, also died. The tram's driver, Alfred Dorris, 42, was arrested at the scene and was questioned on suspicion of manslaughter. Mr Dorris from Beckenham, south London, has been bailed until May. The RAIB issued ""urgent safety advice"" to First Group, which carries out the day-to-day operation of the trams, and Transport for London. Both organisations were urged to take measures to reduce the risk of trams travelling ""at an excessive speed"" once the line is reopened. This could be done with another speed restriction before the start of the 12mph limit and additional warning signs, the report suggested. Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents Simon French said he would be in contact with the casualties and the families of those who died, and said they would investigate previous reports of speeding on the line. He said: ""Our ongoing detailed investigation will now look at the wider context of the accident, including the sequence of events, the way the tram was driven, the infrastructure and how people received their injuries. ""We will also be looking into previous occurrences of over-speeding in this area and underlying management issues."" Mike Brown, London's Transport Commissioner, described the RAIB's interim investigation as ""thorough and swift"". Engineers have repaired the track and associated equipment, and trams have run over that section of the line. But Mr Brown said services will only resume once a ""rigorous assurance process"" has been completed. TfL has offered to pay for the funerals of the seven victims. A full report on the crash will not be completed for many months."

In the North East, not one child on free school meals went to either university after leaving school in 2010. :: Only 4% of doctors, 6% of barristers and 11% of journalists are from working class backgrounds. :: Only one in eight children from low income backgrounds is likely to become a high income earner as an adult. :: In the North East and the South West, children eligible for free school meals are half as likely to start a higher level apprenticeship and half as likely to complete it as their wealthier peers. :: In Yorkshire and the Humber, only 2% of poorer young people will complete their apprenticeship. :: In the last decade, 500,000 poorer children were not school-ready by age five. :: More than half of adults in Wales, the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands and Northern Ireland have less than £100 in savings. The Commission has called for ""new thinking"" and a new approach to tackle the problem and urged the Government to implement an ambitious 10-year programme of social reform comprising 26 key recommendations for change. Commission chairman Alan Milburn, a former Labour MP, said: ""The rungs on the social-mobility ladder are growing further apart. It is becoming harder for this generation of struggling families to move up. ""The social divisions we face impact many more people and places than the very poorest in society or the few thousand youngsters who miss out on a top university. Whole sections of society and whole tracts of Britain feel left behind. ""The growing sense that we have become an 'us and them' society - where a few unfairly entrench power and wealth to themselves - is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a nation. ""As the EU referendum result showed, the public mood is sour and decision-makers have been far too slow to respond."""

""This is in order to allow the ongoing police and IPCC investigations to continue so that we can avoid potential issues around witness overlap,"" she said. ""We are still absolutely committed to holding oral hearings on this investigation."" The late peer was charged with 22 historic sexual offences against nine alleged victims, but died in December 2015, aged 87. He is accused of abusing vulnerable youngsters at children's homes and hotels over a period spanning more than 30 years dating back to the 1950s. Some are said to have occurred during his long career as an MP and well known figure in Leicestershire. The allegations against him were due to be examined at hearings of the public inquiry. Richard Scorer, head of abuse at Slater and Gordon, which represents a number of Lord Janner's alleged victims, has called for ""swift clarification"" on when the hearings will begin. ""Further delays to the inquiry are extremely disappointing for alleged victims who have already had to wait decades for justice,"" he said. ""We understand the legal reasons for the delay, given the ongoing police investigations, but the survivors need swift clarification on when the inquiry hearings will begin."" In January, an independent inquiry found there was enough evidence to put the Labour peer before the courts in 1991, 2002 and 2007, but failings by police and lawyers meant he was never prosecuted. Meanwhile, the national child sex abuse inquiry has been hit by the resignation of another senior lawyer. Aileen McColgan has reportedly quit because of leadership concerns. The inquiry is now on to its fourth chairwoman, Professor Alexis Jay, after Dame Lowell Goddard resigned at the end of the summer amid claims over her conduct, which she has denied."

Theresa May, almost in bobbing rhyme to the dispatch box, was equally repetitive: ""We have a plan … and we will get the best deal for Britain,"" she bellowed back at Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader, after a very early excursion via the Chagos Islands, used all his questions to bang on about Brexit. ""Isn't the truth that the Government is making a total shambles of Brexit and nobody understands what her strategy actually is?"" Mr Corbyn's attack was all the more effective given the Foreign Secretary's off-message remarks to a Czech newspaper yesterday about us probably leaving the customs union. But Mrs May was giving nothing away - Brexit does mean Brexit, and at the moment that is where it starts and ends. The result? The Prime Minister on the defensive again, with no real answers, having to justify Boris. Never ideal. And it's becoming a recurring weekly theme. It is proving irritating not just to opposition MPs but clearly to many Conservatives too. The normally loyal Tory Alberto Costa, son of Italian parents, asked the Prime Minister not to ask MPs to remove the rights of EU migrants. A reminder of the complex political, cross-party challenges Brexit poses for this Government. And that without the headache of Nigel Farage. Is the man who has tried, unsuccessfully, seven times to become an MP about to become a peer? Lord Farage? When Theresa May was asked yes or no, the reply: ""All I can say to the honourable gentleman is such matters are never normally discussed in public."" Again it wasn't an answer, but we've come to expect from PMQs these days. If only Tim Farron could ask a question."

Although the group of MPs say the RSPCA should continue to investigate animal cruelty cases, it is calling on the Government to change the law so the charity passes on any findings to the Crown Prosecution Service to take the cases to court. Last year, the charity secured 1,781 convictions - however, the organisation has been criticised for sometimes being too eager to take people to court in private prosecution cases. But the RSPCA is concerned that the move could affect prosecution rates.  In a report, the charity said it had a 92.4% prosecution success rate in 2015.   David Bowles, head of public affairs at the RSPCA, told Sky News: ""If you hand it over to the CPS - of course they will have other more important high-profile things; murders, rapes, those sorts of things. ""You'd expect them to take priority over animal cases - my fear is that animals will go to the bottom of the list.""    In Scotland and Northern Ireland, animal welfare groups have the power to investigate cases, but the decision to prosecute lies with the state. Tory MP and committee chair Neil Parish said this model must be considered as a potential alternative in England and Wales, adding: ""We are saying there is potential for conflict of interest. ""The committee is not convinced, however, that the RSPCA is in a better position than the Crown Prosecution Service when it comes to prosecuting animal welfare cases. ""It should step back from making prosecutions itself, continuing instead to work closely with the police and prosecution service to protect the welfare of animals."" The chief executive of the RSPCA, Jeremy Cooper, said: ""We are extremely proud of our near 200 years of experience investigating and prosecuting animal cruelty and our 92% success rate - which is currently a higher percentage than the CPS. ""Our research shows that 89% of the general public back our prosecutions work and they will be confused why a small number of MPs would suggest stopping the RSPCA carrying out a role which we are very good at and which is paid for by public donations rather than out of taxes. ""This recommendation is not supported by the Government, vets, other major animal welfare charities and local authorities, and flies in the face of the majority of evidence put before the committee. ""We will consider this report carefully while we will continue to prosecute those who starve, beat, stab, burn and abuse animals."""

It said the development raised ""another layer of questions"" about the role his children would play when he becomes President in January. Such clearance would allow Mr Trump to discuss matters of national security with his daughter, Ivanka, sons Eric and Donald Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner. :: Trump tells diners: 'I'll get your taxes down' during secret restaurant trip But Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said no official request has been made and his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told reporters that if there was such an inquiry, it was informal. I am not trying to get ""top level security clearance"" for my children. This was a typically false news story. ""The President-elect has not requested security clearance for any family members and no paperwork has been submitted to this effect. Any reporting otherwise is inaccurate,"" Mr Miller said. Mr Trump, who has insisted that to avoid conflicts of interest his children would run his sprawling business empire once he assumed the presidency, later tweeted: ""I am not trying to get 'top level security clearance' for my children. ""This was a typically false news story.""   The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. It comes amid increasing friction between Mr Trump and some sections of the American media, who he claims are misreporting his transition to power. Journalists were recently left frustrated after he went for a private dinner in New York after they were told he had no further engagements. He also wrote on Twitter that the New York Times was ""totally wrong"" to allege his transition team was ""in disarray"". During his presidential campaign he condemned the media's behaviour, saying ""there has never been dishonesty like it"". Meanwhile, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, reported to be a key member of Mr Trump's transition team, has said a potential proposal to reinstate a national registry for immigrants from countries where extremist organisations are active is being discussed. Mr Kobach helped design the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) programme while serving in the Department of Justice after 9/11. Under NSEERS, which was abandoned in 2011, people from countries deemed ""higher risk"" were required to undergo interrogations and fingerprinting. Some non-citizen male residents from countries with active militant threats were also required to register at government offices and periodically check in."

Meanwhile, over at Number 10 they were only ninth in the queue for a phone call. The photo opportunity has driven calls from a few Conservatives that Britain, seeking friends and trade deals outside the EU, should make use of Mr Farage to build bridges with the new administration. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth told newspapers: ""Farage clearly struck a chord with Trump and Trump struck a chord with him. I just do not think in the current climate you should forego any opportunity - if Farage can access parts that we can't reach then fine."" :: Government 'doesn't need' Farage's help with Trump Tory peer and former trade envoy Lord Marland remarked that ""any manufacturer would use its best salesman to try and get a market for them"" and if Number 10 decides that is Mr Farage ""then so be it"". Is it going to happen? Downing Street are adamant that he won't have a role, and it's hard to see what they would gain from such a move. Mrs May has now spoken to the President-elect, who assured her the relationship was still ""very, very special"" and even invoked the Thatcher-Reagan days to make his point. The stakes to win a trade deal with the US are high. Those suggesting we may as well engage with the UKIP MEP want to throw everything at ensuring Britain is not at the back of the queue. But any role for Mr Farage would cause havoc in the Conservative party - and more widely. Tory MP Stephen Phillips has already resigned, triggering a by-election, because he thought the Tories were becoming ""UKIP-lite"". Mr Farage is seen as toxic not just among the party's Remainers, but those who wanted to distance their Vote Leave campaign from his outfit. And any role for the ex-UKIP leader would go down like a lead balloon in Brussels - where Britain needs to make alliances.  One senior Leaver told me: ""On professional or political grounds, it would convey weakness straight out of the gate (to work with him). In fact, fundamentally Theresa May has played this right. ""She's not trying to be Donald Trump's best buddy, she's not his political soulmate, Nigel can play that role if he wants. ""We want our relationship with the US to be quiet, steady and grow over time."" Brexiteer Dominic Raab told Sky News: ""Nigel is taking a curtain call, he may be looking for a new role, but I certainly don't believe we should be contracting our foreign policy out to him."" Just to be discussing that possibility is a sign of the new reality. For Mr Farage, it's a photo which puts two fingers up to critics who say he and UKIP no longer have a role following the referendum. For a man who isn't even an MP and whose party is in disarray, that's a coup in itself."

Dr Speth said that if the UK's divorce from Europe resulted in new tax and tariff barriers it would be a ""huge challenge"" for the company, which is the UK's biggest industrial employer. But he revealed that JLR, which employs 25,000 people in the UK and is owned by India's Tata Motors, has been in contact with ministers and was ""very much encouraged"". It follows a deal - whose details have been kept secret - which saw Japanese manufacturer Nissan commit to building two new models at its Sunderland plant. :: Boris Johnson under fire over Brexit prosecco threat That came after a much-publicised meeting between Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn and Prime Minister Theresa May at 10 Downing Street. Mrs May and Chancellor Philip Hammond visited a JLR plant in September. JLR has called for a level playing field for UK car makers. Dr Speth said: ""Nissan has been 30 years in this country. ""Jaguar Land Rover is going to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary next year. ""So I am quite sure that the Government understands the importance of Jaguar Land Rover and so I am not concerned at all."" He said restrictions on exports to the continent would be a problem because Europe, where it sells more than 100,000 vehicles, is the company's biggest market. Taxes and tariffs on imports into the UK would also mean higher costs, as half of JLR's spending on materials for manufacturing goes to Europe. ""If tax and tariffs will increase the overall cost side then we will see a huge challenge for Jaguar Land Rover,"" Dr Speth said. Asked whether manufacturing might leave the UK, he said: ""That's not up to us to decide now. ""First of all we have to see the facts and then we can decide."" Dr Speth was speaking as JLR unveiled its first electric vehicle at the Los Angeles motor show. The car is being assembled at a plant in Austria because all of its UK manufacturing sites - at Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the West Midlands and at Halewood on Merseyside - are already working at full capacity. That might be seen by some as an indicator of how it could place future manufacturing work outside the UK if Britain were to lose access to the single market."

He was 15m below the surface when he was pulled onto the boat, said Col McKenzie, head of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators. The man was given oxygen and a defibrillator was used, but without success.   A doctor airlifted to a nearby helicopter pad continued the CPR efforts but the man was pronounced dead. He was on his second dive of the day and was travelling with his wife, the Cairns Post reported. ""Accidents like this are a tragedy for the surviving family members, the crew and the passengers,"" said Col McKenzie, who added the boat had carried 230,000 divers without any fatalities.  The excursion was operated by the Quicksilver tour company. Two French tourists - Jacques Goron, 76, and Danielle Franck, 74 - also died on Wednesday after suffering heart attacks while snorkelling on Michaelmas Cay, near Cairns. The pair were among a group of 21 people ""with pre-existing medical conditions"", said the Passions of Paradise tour operator. A lookout on the beach spotted Mr Goron floating in the water and he was pulled onto the sand for CPR. Moments later, Ms Franck was also seen face down in the water and hauled onto a catamaran. Despite the use of bottled oxygen and defibrillation equipment - a requirement for dive boats on the reef - they could not be saved. ""It might just simply be a coincidence, but we may well find out that one person saw the other person being rescued and that caused the onset of the second emergency,"" said tourism boss Col McKenzie. ""We have about five deaths each year on the Great Barrier Reef but in 35 years in the industry, I have never seen two people die on the same tour."""

It's not going to be a quick job; the palace is 108m wide, 120m deep and 24m high, with 775 rooms and a floor area covering more than 77,000 square metres - just over 19 acres. Here are the refurbishment facts and figures: :: Buckingham Palace is a grade I listed building with 775 rooms in total, including 19 state rooms, 52 royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms. :: The most urgent work is scheduled to take place first, over two years April. The focus will be on the basement, and replacing electrical and heating generation and distribution services. :: Some of the building's electrical cables are more than 60 years old and need to be replaced because of the ""significant risk of electric shock and fire"". :: The 30-year-old boilers will also have to be changed and it is hoped new, more efficient ones will lower the palace's carbon footprint by around a fifth. :: Among the fixtures and fittings to be replaced will be 100 miles of electrical cabling, 6,500 electrical sockets, 5,000 light fittings, 330 fuse boxes, 20 miles of heating pipework, 2,500 radiators and 20 miles of skirting board. :: Some 30,000 square metres of flooring will have to be taken up - equivalent to 3.5 football pitches. :: By April 2019, officials hope to be starting work on the East wing - the front of the palace where thousands of visitors gather every day - and working clockwise, one wing at a time. :: Work on the West wing and state apartments will be done gradually throughout the 10 years, allowing the palace to stay open to visitors. :: Up to 125 staff could have to be moved to temporary accommodation in the garden, but the Royal Family will remain in residence. :: Officials have said there is ""not an anticipation"" to erect scaffold fully around the building, saying much of the work will be ""quite hidden"" from the public."

Broadly it is focused at home, but his new approach to trade creates opportunities and problems for Britain's own efforts to change its relationship in the world. The new US President faces a sceptical world, but clearly believes that Brexit Britain is both trailblazer and kindred spirit for his ""anti-elite"" political revolution. That should enable a fast-track trade arrangement. Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House has close relations with senior Conservatives, and soon after Brexit called for ""discussions with Great Britain to ease concerns so that we do have a smooth trade relationship with Great Britain... our indispensable ally"". This could be one of the areas where Mr Trump can carry his fellow Republicans. So the prospect of being near the ""front of a queue"" rather than behind the EU and Trans-Pacific Partnership is now very real. For good measure, Nigel Farage may even get a job with President Trump. Whereas Hillary Clinton would have almost certainly made a beeline for Berlin and Chancellor Angela Merkel as her first visit as President, Mr Trump may well focus on London. He has expressed scepticism about the European Union, and described his own electoral earthquake as ""Brexit times five, Brexit times ten"". However, it is impossible to escape his wider plans which involve ripping up some of the international trading architecture. He is a critic of the World Trade Organisation, in particular China's membership terms. He wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement deal with Canada and Mexico. He wants to build a wall on the US southern border with Mexico. He repeatedly told voters that China and Mexico were stealing US jobs and ""stealing US prosperity"". During the campaign he actively threatened tariffs against China. His team believes that Germany and China manipulate their currencies in order to boost their exports. He has threatened to use trade tariffs to ""end trade wars"" that are already in existence, by what seems to many as starting trade wars. It is very difficult not to see his election as part of a backlash against globalisation, which could fundamentally alter the architecture of the world economy. On security, the relationship with an increasingly assertive Russia will be key. Baltic states will need reassuring about Mr Trump's lukewarm approach to NATO and warm words about President Putin. Theresa May is leading the charge on Russian sanctions, it is unclear whether Mr Trump will back them. So yes, Britain stands to be at the front of the queue of Trump trade deals. But does that queue lead anywhere quickly? A closer special relationship is plausible, but where President Trump takes the world more generally is far more of a mystery. :: Watch every twist and turn of the US election fallout live on Sky News Read more::: Donald Trump wins: US election results in full:: Markets take Trump win in stride after wobble:: Inequality, globalisation and why Donald Trump won:: Donald Trump: US President number 45 stand up:: So what does Donald Trump mean for Brexit?:: Melania Trump: From model to US First Lady:: Who is Vice President-elect Mike Pence?"

Some of the families of those killed will be at the club's Premier League game against Manchester City on Saturday. Speaking ahead of the match, Mr Pardew said the accident has had a ""massive impact"" on the area, which is home to Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park stadium. He said: ""It has had a massive impact on us, not just the club but the areas around it... shocking really. ""We will do everything we can for the families that will be at the game on Saturday. We are holding a minute's silence, it is such a difficult thing. ""We are going to do the best we can. Some of the injured people were connected and two of the people who died were fans. ""We as a club are fully behind them and want to help them as best we can. We have an important role to help the fans."" The family of 19-year-old Dane Chinnery, who was a Crystal Palace fan, have asked supporters to join them in a minutes applause at the match at Selhurst Park on Saturday. The data recorder on the tram showed that it was travelling at three-and-a-half times the speed limit when it entered a sharp bend before the crash on 9 November, according to an interim report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB). Investigators have found no evidence of track defects or a malfunction on the tram's braking system. Transport for London said that the Croydon tram will fully reopen on Friday afternoon after repairs and testing are completed. Six men and one woman were killed in the accident, and another 51 people were injured - eight seriously. Those killed have been identified as Mr Chinnery; Philip Logan, 52; Philip Seary, 57; Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35; Robert Huxley, 63; Mark Smith, 35 and Donald Collett, 62. The driver of the tram, Alfred Dorris, 42, from Beckenham, southeast London, was arrested at the scene and questioned on suspicion of manslaughter. He has been bailed until May."

The firm said: ""Like all chocolate manufacturers, we have seen the cost of raw materials rise and, while we try to absorb these pressures as much as possible, sometimes we have to make the difficult decision to reduce the size of some of our products so our consumers can continue to enjoy an affordable treat."" Also looks like #countersgate with a pack reduction here too - 126g down to 112g. pic.twitter.com/WaaVP5DnhU Retailers' websites now list packets of Maltesers and Galaxy Counters in their reduced formats, with the exception of Tesco which says the latter product is not available. Mars added: ""Our focus is always on offering consumers our great tasting, high quality chocolate brands at the best value for money."" In recent years the firm has come under fire for reducing the size of Mars and Snickers bars. Earlier this month, Walkers crisps and Birds Eye announced price increases which were blamed on the falling strength of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union. The pound has fallen about 16% against the US dollar since the Brexit vote, making imported goods more expensive. The drop has prompted Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis to call on suppliers not to hike prices just so that profits look good to investors."

Valery Spiridonov, a Russian man with a genetic muscle-wasting disease, has volunteered to be the first patient. But putting someone's head onto someone else's body could lead to ""unexpected psychological reactions"" so US firm Inventum Bioengineering Technologies has created a virtual reality world that it says will help train patients such as Mr Spiridonov. Inventum chief executive Alexander Pavlovcik said the virtual reality system would be used before the surgery to prevent these unexpected reactions. He added: ""We are combining the latest advancements in virtual reality to develop the world's first protocol for preparing the patient for bodily freedom after the transplantation procedure."" When Professor Canavero revealed the system during a conference at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow on Friday, he described it as ""prepar(ing) the patient in the best possible way for a new world that he will be facing with his new body - a world in which he will be able to walk again"". Mr Spiridonov said it was ""extremely important"" in helping patients ""get involved into action and (to) learn fast and efficiently"". Professor Canavero also displayed the knife that will be used for the head transplant - a custom-made blade that can control cuts to a micrometre (one millionth of a metre) to allow the precision required to cut the spinal cord. He said that the knife, developed by an American professor, will allow a ""clear cut of the spinal cord with a minimal impact on the nerves"". He told Sky News that he was looking to take the procedure global, saying that ""Asia is moving, so expect more news coming out over the next few months"" and ""the UK is very well poised to do this"". He showed little concern for the views of his critics, some of whom have described his work as Frankenstein surgery. He said: ""To all the critics I say go and see what happens when you're affected by a wasting disorder...trade places with (Mr Spiridonov) and then you tell me. ""That's my counter criticism for the critics."" In January, Mr Canavero worked with Chinese researchers to do a head transplant on a monkey, connecting the animal's blood supply after the operation to prove it could survive without brain injuries. The monkey was only kept alive for 20 hours, as the team did not join its spinal cords, meaning it would have been paralysed."

Dr Richard Shepherd, the coroner who carried out the post-mortem on Mrs Cox, has been giving evidence at the trial of Thomas Mair - the man accused of murdering her. The eight men and four women were shown computer generated images of the MP's body. Dr Shepherd told jurors: ""I concluded that Jo Cox died as a result of multiple stab and gunshot wounds."" These included stab wounds to her chest cavity, stomach and hand. One stab wound passed right through her arm and into her right side. One gunshot wound was found to her right forehead. Another bullet wound was to the chest. A ""through and through"" entry and exit bullet hole was on her left hand. Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC suggested: ""It could be consistent with the hand being raised to the face and the bullet going through?"" Dr Shepherd replied: ""Indeed. It could be with any of the injuries but I think it makes more sense that the hands were up covering the face and the bullet has gone through the right hand and ... into the head. ""The stab wounds had penetrated her heart, left lung, stomach and liver."" Some stab wounds were inflicted with between ""moderate and severe force"", he added. Forensics expert Andre Horne later told the jury Mair was armed with British-made hollowpoint rifle bullets. He said these were commonly used to kill vermin like squirrels and rabbits. Jurors were shown the modified .22 calibre Weihrauch rifle found in a hold-all following Mair's arrest.  The barrel of the hunting rifle had been completely sawn off enabling single handed use instead of two. The jury was also shown the dagger used in the attack. It was described by Mr Horne as a military style handled blade similar to the type used by special forces.  But Mr Horne said he was uncertain of the 17cm weapon's provenance concluding it was probably a replica or fake. The trial is expected to run for another two weeks."

The timetable for leaving the EU could also be delayed by a legal decision that the PM must get parliamentary approval before triggering Brexit. ""I want to see this as a smooth process, an orderly process, working towards a solution that is in the interests of both the United Kingdom but also in the interests of our European partners too,"" Mrs May said. But the potential difficulties Mrs May will face as she tries to secure a Brexit deal were earlier underlined by Germany's finance minister, who said the UK faces paying into the EU for more than a decade after it leaves. Wolfgang Schauble also said there would be no special deal to curb freedom of movement if the UK wants to stay in the common market. :: Scotland and Wales can intervene in Brexit case The Prime Minister updated Mrs Merkel on the Brexit process, even though Mrs Merkel said it was not on the agenda. Mrs Merkel said it would not be possible to discuss Britain's exit from the EU in detail on Friday as the UK had yet to trigger Article 50. She said: ""We will not discuss any further today the British wish to leave the Union. ""That will not be on the agenda because the Prime Minister has already assured us at the very latest that Britain will invoke Article 50 by the end of March."" The pair were speaking after a meeting with US President Barack Obama and the leaders of France, Italy and Spain in Berlin. Mr Obama, who leaves office in January, used the meeting to urge them to work with his successor, President-elect Donald Trump. He implored them to work on common challenges with Mr Trump's administration on the ""basis of the core values that define the United States and Europe as open democracies"". The meeting comes amid concerns about the President-elect's attitude to Russia and commitment to the NATO alliance. The six leaders also discussed steps to resolve conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine, the White House said. Mrs May warned Russia it may face further sanctions if international humanitarian law is breached in Syria. ""On Syria, looking at Aleppo, we are united in our condemnation of the atrocities that are taking place there,"" she said. ""We agree on the need to keep up the pressure on Russia, including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law."""

According to the Guide Dogs charity, there is an ongoing issue with guide dog owners being illegally turned away by drivers who do not want to carry their dog.  New research by the charity shows 42% of blind or visually impaired people were significantly more likely to be turned away by drivers because of their dog, while 38% of guide dog owners have been illegally asked to pay an extra fare for carrying their dog. The charity said being discriminated against in this way is not only distressing, it can also stop people who are living with sight-loss do everyday things that most people take for granted. Rosemary Howell, 28, is visually impaired and lives in rural Cambridgeshire.  She told Sky News she had been refused by three different taxi drivers because they did not want to take her dog, Una, who she has had for about two years.  The drivers had been given disability training but she said the experience left her feeling vulnerable and she would like there to be tougher penalties.  She said: ""Even when I got in a taxi they didn't seem that bothered and I felt very unwanted.  ""Why should I have to be different from everyone else just because I have a disability and I have something that will help me?  ""Taxi drivers need educating because then they might have a bit more empathy with service users who have guide dogs or assistance dogs because they understand that dog needs to go with the owner in the front. ""A lot of taxi companies say you have to have the dog in the boot, and you can't have that because it has to go with the owner. ""If education is there to teach these people this is the law and this is what service dogs are, I think life for a disabled person will be a lot easier."" Both the Licensed Private Hire Car Association and the National Taxi Association are backing the bill while Transport for London, which looks after 35% of England & Wales' licensed vehicles, is introducing mandatory disability equality training for drivers.  Uber says any driver who refuses to take a guide dog will permanently lose access to its app and risks losing their licence."

""Miles of ageing cables, lead piping, electrical wiring and boilers will be replaced, many for the first time in 60 years.

The Sovereign Grant is the allowance provided by the Government every year to fund the Queen in her official duties. The money comes through the crown estate, a portfolio of land and buildings which belong to the monarchy but cannot be sold by them, and the profits go to the Treasury. The Queen was previously given back 15% of those profits but under the new agreement this will increase to 25%. Last year, that amounted to £40.1m, or 62p for every person in the UK. The change in arrangements follows a review by the three Royal trustees: the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the keeper of the privy purse. It had been proposed that the Queen may have to move out of Buckingham Palace while work takes place, but she will now stay for the duration. Major events such as garden parties, state visits, investitures and changing the guard will not be affected. Deputy Keeper of the Privy Purse and accounting officer to the programme Mike Stevens described the plan as the ""most cost-effective way"" to fund the project, ""by synchronising the release of funds with the phased approach to carrying out the physical works"". Master of The Queen's Household Tony Johnstone-Burt said the refurbishment would ensure the palace is ""fit for purpose"" until 2067. The upgrade will lead to longer summer opening hours and more private tours, which could help generate an extra £3.4m a year."
2016-11-18,Cryonics involves using extremely low temperatures to preserve bodies in the hope that scientists will one day be able to revive them.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161118215016/http://news.sky.com/story/how-cryonics-works-process-of-freezing-bodies-explained-10661239,"After a High Court ruling involving a 14-year-old girl who was granted the right to undergo the controversial procedure, we look at how it works - and what the critics say.  :: What is the difference between cryonics and cryogenics? Cryogenics is a branch of science that looks at preserving materials through very low temperatures. The word comes from the Greek ""kryos"" meaning ""frost"" and ""genic"" meaning ""to produce"".  Cryonics refers to the technique used after a person's death to store the body at a very low temperature in the hope that they can be revived when a cure is found for their illness. In reality, in layman's terms, the understanding of the words has been blurred so that we usually refer to people being cryogenically - rather than cryonically - frozen as a means of preservation after death. :: What is the process? When a person is declared legally dead, the first thing the response team has to do is ensure that the person's blood is kept pumping around the body.  Speed is of the essence. The response team will be at the hospital so that, at the point of death, it can move in immediately. After that, the body is packed in ice and injected with various chemicals to reduce the risk of blood clotting and damage to the brain. The body is then cooled to just above water's freezing point and the blood is removed. The body's blood vessels are injected with a ""cryoprotectant"" solution to try to stop ice crystal formation in the organs and tissues and the corpse is cooled to -130C.  :: What happens to the body? Once the team is satisfied with its work, the body is placed in a container which is lowered into a tank of liquid nitrogen, kept at -196C. The body is then transferred to the storage facility - in the case of the British girl, in Michigan in the US. :: How much does it cost? It is expensive. The process for the teenage girl in this case cost £37,000 but it can go up to more than £100,000.  :: Where did the idea come from? The concept was developed in the early 20th century. The first person on whom the process was performed after his legal death was Dr James Bedford, who died of cancer on 12 January 1967. His body has been moved several times and is now at Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona.  The day of Dr Bedford's death and cryopreservation is marked within the community as Bedford Day.  :: What are the criticisms? This is a highly contentious area. Alcor's co-founder Linda Chamberlain says the company is providing a realistic service that gives hope. Others are dismissive. Many scientists and doctors argue that it is unlikely that revival in such a way can be achieved because organs such as the heart and kidneys cannot be successfully frozen and thawed. They suggest cells will be damaged during freezing and cannot be returned to living tissue. Ethics experts say it poses greater problems as a whole for society, as it would appear to be a way of delaying the acceptance of the death of a loved one."
2016-11-18,Princess Beatrice has won a fight with MailOnline regarding photos published of her on a yacht wearing a bikini.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161118215016/http://news.sky.com/story/princess-beatrice-wins-bikini-photo-privacy-battle-against-daily-mail-website-mailonline-10662121,"The princess, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation about a story published by the website on 27 June. The headline was ""Beatrice makes a splash on yet ANOTHER day off! Princess dives into the sea in a very skimpy bikini as she enjoys a sunshine break on a yacht in Monaco"". The report said that the princess was ""spotted"" on a ""luxury yacht"" with her boyfriend, and was accompanied by what IPSO described as ""grainy"" photos of her on the yacht and swimming alongside it. Princess Beatrice, 28, said the pictures were taken surreptitiously with a long lens in a situation where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy. She also complained that the article commented on her appearance and that comments on the same subject made by readers were ""abusive"", although the latter were judged by IPSO to be outside its remit. MailOnline said the article was not intrusive and that its only reference to her appearance was a comment about her ""hourglass curves"". It said it did not accept the princess had a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"", as the photos had been taken while the boat was anchored around 200m offshore and that the princess could be seen by the naked eye at that distance. It said it had removed the reader comments and offered to remove the photographs but would not publish an apology. IPSO upheld the complaint as a breach of privacy, saying that the photos did not show the princess engaged in official duties and that her activities ""formed part of her private life"". ""The taking and publishing of these photographs of the complainant, wearing a bikini, which the committee noted placed a gratuitous and invasive focus on parts of the complainant's body which would not ordinarily be subject to public scrutiny, represented a serious intrusion into her privacy,"" it said. Mail Online was ordered to publish the ruling on their home page, leaving it visible for 24 hours. The news comes just days after Prince Harry urged the media to stop what he called intrusive coverage of his relationship with actress Meghan Markle."
2016-11-18,"As part of Sky's ongoing Brexit coverage, I'm on a white fish trawler in the North Sea talking to fishermen about the EU.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161118215016/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-trawler-uk-fishermen-have-high-hopes-for-future-10652880,"The big questions, which we hope to answer on this seven-day trip, are: What do trawlermen want from the renegotiations, and are they likely to get what they were promised? :: Day 7: Communities left behind are united for Leave The life of a deep-sea trawlerman can be tough on the family. The six men from the Orkney area of Scotland all have wives or girlfriends and kids waiting for them back home. Ship cool Ryan is the youngest on board (hence why he is cook - they call him the ""Passionate Chef"", ironically). He says ""leaving the house is the hardest part of the job"".  But it's a job he can't imagine ever leaving. This despite personal experience of disaster and tragedy at sea. He and his brother sank their boat after hitting rocks in 2008 and their father drowned at sea in 2011. ""Fishing is just in my blood,"" says Ryan. ""It's a feeling echoed around dozens of fishing communities in the UK devoted through generations to the industry."" Since the 1970s it's an industry in decline with the landings of fish halving since then and the number of fishermen now standing at around 12,000. Brexit, many hope, will restore the industry to its former glory. But there's much the UK Government must deliver in terms of negotiations with Brussels before then.  :: Day 6: Plenty of fish in the sea? Down in the gutting room it is loud, bloody and slippery. Colin Mackay has been in the business long enough to remember the days of gutting everything by hand on the deck of the boat with waves crashing all around. Now it's much safer and far more efficient in the factory production-line in the belly of the boat. ""It can get a wee bit smelly in the summer,"" he tells me, glasses and baseball cap splattered with fish guts. ""I don't mind it though; it's just a part of the job."" We're just over halfway through the fishing trip and already the hold where the boxed-up fish are kept is becoming cramped. You won't find much concern about fish stocks here. Trawlerman Alex Nicholson says it's never been better in his 38 years. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy, although derided by many fishermen who voted to leave, can be credited with improving the status of many fish stocks. In most cases, fishing levels are sustainable, but strong regional differences exist. The Mediterranean and Black Sea remain poorly assessed, but important signs of improvement have been recorded in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. Effectively there's a North/South divide across the EU-managed areas.  For the crew onboard the Aalskere, there's a lot of frustration with misconceptions. Just because one area is overfished, doesn't mean we're doing it, they say. Haddock in the North Seas where we are fishing is certified sustainable. Once the UK takes over management of its waters, it'll be the responsibility of the British Government and the British fishing fleet to keep the good stocks healthy and help improve the species still recovering from the bad days of the 1990s. :: Day 5: Exposed to the elements       Today was an unusually calm day at sea and it affected the atmosphere on board. In the afternoon a mist rolled in ahead of the Supermoon at night.  The crew carried on their work but it was a much calmer energy. It got me thinking about how exposed the men are out here - every change in weather makes their job harder or easier or more dangerous.  It's also true to say that the men are perhaps more exposed because of Brexit. We know that most of the industry wanted to leave and voted as such, but now their livelihoods are open to some quite drastic changes. Whether or not the renegotiations bring sunshine or rain for them, remains to be seen. :: Day 4: The reason fishermen voted to leave Speaking to people in the fishing community, I'm constantly told ""99% voted to leave the EU"". Perhaps no other industry was so staunchly against staying in the European Union. And now I see why. Today I asked skipper Iain to show me how the quotas he is given by Brussels affect his day-to-day job. ""Look where we are now!"" he says, pointing to a map (we're about 60 miles from Norway, 200 miles from Scotland). ""It's 100% because of the quota system. I'd love to fish near my home in Orkney where I'm certain of healthy stocks of fish but then I may accidentally catch a species I don't have quota for and that's just a waste as I'd have to discard them. Out here I'm more confident that I'll get a cleaner haul of Haddock... it's stressful,"" he adds. It's a surprise break in the usually relaxed captain. Like many, he sees the situation as unfair and watches foreign vessels helping themselves to British fish where he is forbidden. It's a simple argument when you see it in practise but the renegotiation is going to get messy. After all, any bargaining power we have, could be softened by the fact that we export 80% of fish caught by British boats, with most going to EU countries who'd like to see things stay as they are. :: Day 3: Rough night for a land lubber I was warned it could get a bit choppy in the North Sea in November. Everyone offered advice on how to cope with sea sickness and I prepared accordingly. However, sea sickness has (so far) not been an issue, sleeping has. In gale force winds, the boat's movement is frightening. For the crew onboard the Aalskere, they're used to the unusual movements and the unusual rhythms of life at sea. They fish around the clock, day or night, hauling in the nets after five hours of towing. They then process the fish, throw the nets back in and rest for a few hours before starting it all over again. The men work extremely hard in scary conditions and they do it all with a wonderful array of euphemisms; ""it's a bit rollie,"" they say or ""aye, it can be a bit uncomfortable at times"". On watch last night in the wheelhouse was Keith Flynn, a young father of four who clearly loves the job. He's hopeful that, although it can't change the weather, leaving the EU will make his working life easier. ""Hopefully things will be easier. We'll claim a bit more of our waters back quota-wise that's the main thing."" Soon after our chat, Keith presses the bleeper tannoy and everyone's up and out on deck within minutes. The cycle starts once more. :: Day 2: Fishing begins It's taken the skipper more than 24 hours to steam to the ideal spot to fish for haddock. We're 200 miles from Peterhead in northeast Scotland and only 60 miles from Norway. Trawling is a truly international industry with boats dipping in and out of international waters. Skipper Iain Harcus says the rules here are different from EU waters but the quota he has been set by Brussels applies. This makes his job tricky as he must manage and count every fish he hauls onboard. Tonight, plenty have been caught. The crew work by moonlight on the deck hauling the nets, emptying them into the hold and then setting the nets again.  The experienced crew mainly from Orkney work incredibly fast and efficiently. Thousands of fish are gutted, cleaned and boxed up in minutes. Then they rest for a few hours and it all starts again.  :: Day 1 Brexit - what comes next? We're currently heading out towards Norway to fish for haddock. Skipper Iain Harcus has been a trawlerman for 30 years. Like most fishermen he voted to leave the EU because of the ""unfair quota system that sees foreign vessels taking the lion's share of UK fish.""   He hopes the future renegotiation will help his industry, which has seen a major decline in the last 40 years. There used to be around 21,000 fishermen, now there are only around 12,500. Before we set sail from Peterhead, I heard from many other fishermen or people reliant on the trade from boats in the harbour who echoed Iain's view.   One fisherman told me he thought 99.5% of people linked to the industry would have voted to leave."

The MoJ document, published on its website, has now given the cause, saying the 24-year-old died as a result of a firearms accident at the ""range waiting point"". L/Cpl Spencer, from Hampshire, joined the Army in 2011 and had completed a tour of Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick 16. Around 30 detectives were said to have been involved in the investigation into his death. The MoD publication gives details of 139 armed forces training and exercise deaths in the UK since 1 January, 2000. In another incident this year, Private Conor McPherson, 24, suffered a serious head wound after being shot while taking part in a night-time exercise at a training facility in Northumberland. His death in August was also described as a live fire accident in the report. Corporal Josh Hoole, of The Rifles, who died after collapsing while on pre-course training for the Platoon Sergeants' Battle Course in Brecon, Mid Wales, was said to have died of ""natural cause"". His death had been linked by some to training on what was the hottest day of the year on July 19. Tributes were paid to all three soldiers after their deaths. L/Cpl Spencer was described as a ""good soldier and a good lad"", with political leaders including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Prime Minister Theresa May sending their condolences to his loved ones."
2016-11-18,A terminally ill girl won a historic legal fight to have her body cryogenically frozen in the hope of being brought back to life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161118215016/http://news.sky.com/story/teenage-girl-won-right-to-be-frozen-after-dying-from-cancer-10661147,"The 14-year-old, described as a ""bright, intelligent young person"", had her wish granted shortly before she died. The schoolgirl, who had a rare form of cancer and was too young to make a will, asked the High Court to intervene because her divorced parents were divided over her request. They had become embroiled in a dispute relating to whether her remains should be taken to a specialist facility in the United States. Mr Justice Peter Jackson made the ruling in October after a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. :: How cryonics works: Process of freezing bodies explained He had visited the girl in hospital and agreed her mother, who supported her decision, could have sole control over decisions about the disposal of her body. He said he had been moved by the ""valiant way"" in which she had faced her ""predicament"" and there was no doubt she had the mental capacity to launch legal action. He added she had spent months researching how she could be frozen and ""she died peacefully in the knowledge her body would be preserved in the way she wished"". The teenager, from the London area, had written to Mr Justice Jackson explaining she wanted a chance to ""live longer"".  He recorded what she had said in his ruling on the case. The girl had written: ""I have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done. ""I am only 14-years-old and I don't want to die but I know I am going to die. ""I think being cryo-preserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up - even in hundreds of years' time. ""I don't want to be buried underground. I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they may find a cure for my cancer and wake me up. ""I want to have this chance. This is my wish."" Her remains have now been taken to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan and frozen at around -193C (-315F). The facility houses more than 100 people. Mr Justice Jackson had said nothing about the case could be reported while she was alive because the media coverage would distress her. He also ruled no-one involved could be identified - again in line with the girl's wishes. He said the girl had lived with her mother for most of her life and had not had ""face-to-face"" contact with her father for eight years when she died. Her father had been concerned about the consequences of his daughter being cryogenically preserved, and the costs involved. He told Mr Justice Jackson: ""Even if the treatment is successful and she is brought back to life in, let's say, 200 years, she may not find any relative and she might not remember things. ""She may be left in a desperate situation, given that she is still only 14-years-old, and will be in the United States of America."" But during the legal battle his position changed and he later added: ""I respect the decisions she is making.  ""This is the last and only thing she has asked from me."" Mr Justice Jackson said the girl's arrangement cost around £37,000, and while the family are not well-off, the mother's parents had raised the money.  He said there had been problems on the day she died and hospital bosses had expressed misgivings.  ""On (her) last day, her mother is said to have been pre-occupied with the post-mortem arrangements at the expense of being fully available to (her),"" he said. He added: ""The voluntary organisation is said to have been under-equipped and disorganised, resulting in pressure being placed on the hospital to allow procedures that had not been agreed. ""Although the preparation of (her) body for cryogenic preservation was completed, the way in which the process was handled caused real concern to the medical and mortuary staff."" He admitted the technology is controversial but he made decisions relating to a dispute between parents, not about the rights and wrongs of cryogenic preservation. He also said this case is an example of new questions science posed to lawyers and ministers might consider ""proper regulation"" of cryonic preservation. The girl's application is said to be the only one of its kind to have come before a court in England and Wales, and probably anywhere else.  Cryonic preservation was introduced in the 1960s and there are three commercial organisations, one in Russia and two in the US, that perform the process."

It's understood the hackers used the information to arrange for eight customer upgrades before intercepting them. On Wednesday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested a 48-year-old from Orpington, Kent, and a 39-year old from Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester, on suspicion of computer misuse offences. A 35-year old from Moston, Manchester, has also been arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice. The NCA said all three have been released on bail pending further enquiries. Three, which has nine million customers, is investigating how many accounts were accessed, but said financial information was not stored on the system affected. According to The Daily Telegraph, the security breach could put two-thirds of customers at risk. A spokesman for the firm said: ""Over the last four weeks Three has seen an increasing level of attempted handset fraud. ""This has been visible through higher levels of burglaries of retail stores and attempts to unlawfully intercept upgrade devices. ""We've been working closely with the police and relevant authorities. ""To date, we have confirmed approximately 400 high-value handsets have been stolen through burglaries and eight devices have been illegally obtained through the upgrade activity. ""The investigation is ongoing and we have taken a number of steps to further strengthen our controls. ""In order to commit this type of upgrade handset fraud, the perpetrators used authorised logins to Three's upgrade system. ""This upgrade system does not include any customer payment, card information or bank account information."" The eight handset fraud victims had been contacted, the spokesman added. Telecoms giant TalkTalk fell victim to a cyber attack on its website in October last year which led to the personal data of nearly 160,000 people being accessed. The firm was fined £400,000 last month by Britain's data protection regulator for security failings it said had allowed customers' data to be accessed ""with ease""."

Theresa May has said she will invoke Article 50 - the formal process for leaving the EU - by the end of March, which will then begin a two-year negotiation process. If this goes according to plan, Britain will officially quit the EU sometime in 2019. :: Brexit: Has Britain left the EU yet? But Mr Schauble said it was possible the UK could continue paying money to Brussels after that. He told the Financial Times: ""Until the UK's exit is complete, Britain will certainly have to fulfil its commitments. ""Possibly there will be some commitments that last beyond the exit ... even, in part, to 2030 ... Also we cannot grant any generous rebates."" Mr Schauble also insisted there will be no special deal to curb freedom of movement if the UK wants to stay in the common market. He said freedom of movement was a core part of the single market and changing one of the EU's key principles of the bloc would damage financial services companies. ""There is no a la carte menu,"" Mr Schauble said. ""There is only the whole menu or none. ""Without membership of the internal market, without acceptance of the four basic freedoms of the internal market there can, of course, be no passporting, no free access for financial products or for financial actors."" Responding to Mr Schauble's remarks, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""We have always set out that as long as we remain members of the EU, we will fulfil the commitments and obligations to the EU. ""What happens once we have left the EU is a matter for the negotiation process."" Meanwhile, a campaign group has also claimed Britain faces paying nearly an extra £850m into EU coffers if it stays in the single market. Change Britain said Brussels has ""secretly"" raised spending limits by £1bn on the long-term budget that had been curbed after demands by ex-PM David Cameron in 2013. The group, which campaigns on the terms of Britain's departure, said the UK could be left with a total additional bill of £845m as a result. It says the UK must leave the single market to avoid being landed with extra bills, and argues staying would ""almost certainly"" mean we would have to pay into the budget in the same way we do now. Conservative Dominic Raab, one of Change Britain's founding supporters, said: ""EU politicians promised David Cameron that the EU would cut its budget. ""These figures show that eurocrats are now going back on their word and will ask for even more money from UK taxpayers if we stay in the EU's single market."" The mood music from Brussels is getting increasingly hardline, with French President Francois Hollande saying last month that Britain must pay a price for Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May is currently in Berlin to meet international leaders. Although Brexit is not on the agenda, Mrs May is likely to discuss the issue with her European counterparts."

Meanwhile, over at Number 10 they were only ninth in the queue for a phone call. The photo opportunity has driven calls from a few Conservatives that Britain, seeking friends and trade deals outside the EU, should make use of Mr Farage to build bridges with the new administration. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth told newspapers: ""Farage clearly struck a chord with Trump and Trump struck a chord with him. I just do not think in the current climate you should forego any opportunity - if Farage can access parts that we can't reach then fine."" :: Government 'doesn't need' Farage's help with Trump Tory peer and former trade envoy Lord Marland remarked that ""any manufacturer would use its best salesman to try and get a market for them"" and if Number 10 decides that is Mr Farage ""then so be it"".

Mrs May has now spoken to the President-elect, who assured her the relationship was still ""very, very special"" and even invoked the Thatcher-Reagan days to make his point. The stakes to win a trade deal with the US are high. Those suggesting we may as well engage with the UKIP MEP want to throw everything at ensuring Britain is not at the back of the queue. But any role for Mr Farage would cause havoc in the Conservative party - and more widely. Tory MP Stephen Phillips has already resigned, triggering a by-election, because he thought the Tories were becoming ""UKIP-lite"". Mr Farage is seen as toxic not just among the party's Remainers, but those who wanted to distance their Vote Leave campaign from his outfit. And any role for the ex-UKIP leader would go down like a lead balloon in Brussels - where Britain needs to make alliances.  One senior Leaver told me: ""On professional or political grounds, it would convey weakness straight out of the gate (to work with him). In fact, fundamentally Theresa May has played this right. ""She's not trying to be Donald Trump's best buddy, she's not his political soulmate, Nigel can play that role if he wants. ""We want our relationship with the US to be quiet, steady and grow over time."" Brexiteer Dominic Raab told Sky News: ""Nigel is taking a curtain call, he may be looking for a new role, but I certainly don't believe we should be contracting our foreign policy out to him."" Just to be discussing that possibility is a sign of the new reality. For Mr Farage, it's a photo which puts two fingers up to critics who say he and UKIP no longer have a role following the referendum. For a man who isn't even an MP and whose party is in disarray, that's a coup in itself."

Flurries have already been seen as far south as Exeter. The wintry weather, which follows an unseasonably warm autumn, is being brought in by a cold northwesterly airstream with clear spells allowing temperatures to plunge below freezing. Yellow ""be aware"" warnings of ice have been issued  by the Met Office for the Midlands, the North of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The area of low pressure is expected to move across southern Britain on Sunday bringing heavy rain and southwesterly gales. Gusts of up to 55mph could be seen in inland areas, particularly over Sussex and Kent, while wind speeds of 65mph are possible on exposed south coastal locations. These gales are expected to be accompanied by torrential rain - up to 30mm within less than 12 hours. Motorists have been warned over the risk of difficult driving conditions due to localised flooding and the threat of fallen trees. :: The latest Sky News weather forecast Weather conditions are expected to improve from the southwest later on Sunday. Sky News weather presenter and producer Kirsty McCabe said: ""Usually the Autumn months are marked by spells of wet and windy weather, but it's been very quiet this year.  ""That may change this weekend as an area of low pressure could bring stormy conditions to southern parts of the UK.  ""However, there is a lot of uncertainty with the forecast track of this low pressure and the situation may change.

Counsel for the Scottish Government will be invited by the Supreme Court - which will hear the Government's appeal - to address the court on the relevance of points of Scots law, so far as they do not form part of the law of England and Wales. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which describes itself as ""fighting for the rights and welfare of some of the most vulnerable and under-represented workers in the UK"", has also been allowed to make submissions. The Attorney General for Northern Ireland has made a reference to the court on devolution issues and did not need permission to intervene. The legal challenge over Brexit was bought by investment fund manager and philanthropist Gina Miller and Dier Dos Santos, a hairdresser, with other ""concerned citizens"". Three senior High Court judges ruled that the PM does not have power to use the royal prerogative to trigger Article 50 - the formal process for leaving the EU - without the authority of Parliament. The Government's appeal will be heard by 11 judges between 5 and 8 December, with a judgement expected in the new year. Counsel General for Wales Mick Antoniw welcomed the court's decision. He said the Welsh Government would be seeking to ""reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law"". Mike Russell, the Scottish government's Brexit minister, urged the UK Government to ""drop the appeal and to accept that Parliament has the right to determine the triggering of Article 50"".

Dubai's public prosecutor's office said it had reached the decision after ""careful"" examination of the evidence, including footage from one of the suspects' mobile phones. The woman had been arrested after she reported the alleged attack by two men from Birmingham while on holiday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in October. She was bailed but had her passport confiscated and could have faced jail if found guilty following a trial. Her family had launched an online appeal, urging the public and the UK government to help negotiate her release. Both men, who were arrested and questioned but not charged, also had their passports taken away. All three are now in the process of getting them back and are free to leave Dubai, officials have said. A public prosecutor statement said: ""The office has decided not to proceed with legal proceedings. ""The public prosecutor's office clarified that a thorough review of statements given by the British woman and the two suspects... showed that the act happened with the consent of the three parties in question. ""A video obtained from the mobile phone of one of the suspects detailing the act was a key evidence that supported this conclusion."" It added: ""Dubai's legal system takes reports of all crimes very seriously, including and especially violence against women, and conducts thorough investigations of all incidents."" Campaign group Detained in Dubai said it welcomed the prosecutor's decision. It said: ""It is pleasing that the UAE government has chosen to drop charges for consensual sex outside of marriage against a British national who reported that she was raped by two British men in Dubai. ""We expect that the international outrage that this case deserved influenced authorities to drop the charges in order to spare the UAE of such negative press.

2016-11-22,Number 10 is planning to create a new specialist armed police unit to better protect Britain's critical infrastructure against terror attacks. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/new-armed-police-to-protect-uks-infrastructure-proposed-10666999,"The plans, originated in the Home Office, will see different forces brought under one central command to establish a 4,000-strong armed unit protecting the UK's nuclear power stations, critical road points, ports and airports.  The force will also double up as a rapid deployment unit in the event that the UK becomes victim to the kind of terror attacks endured by France and Belgium in recent months. The new unit would combine three main forces - the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, the British Transport Police and the Ministry of Defence Police - to form the new Armed Infrastructure Constabulary force.  Theresa May identified the need for a central unit when Home Secretary and one senior government figure told Sky News the plans were progressing and were now being looked at by the Cabinet Office.  However, another government figure stressed that the changes were more about ""governance"" of the different forces rather than a huge overhaul, adding that ""no decisions had been made"".  The Prime Minister is expected to take a final decision in the New Year. The Highways England Traffic Officer Service and the roads and airport policing of the Home Office police forces' strategic road network could also be folded into the new unit - although no decisions have yet been made about the final structure. The review was launched a year ago as part of the Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review. The Home Office has described the infrastructure policing project as having ""the potential to significantly change the current landscape of policing: increasing the effectiveness of our infrastructure policing while driving out inefficiencies"".  It comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a new cybersecurity strategy last month, warning that hostile ""foreign actors"" were developing techniques that threatened the country's electrical grid and airports. The Cameron government assigned £1.9bn in the five years to 2021 to invest in cybersecurity in last year's Defence and Security Review - a sum that the May administration is sticking with.  The announcement came after MI5 Director General Andrew Parker warned of increasing Russian aggression - in particular cyberattacks. The claims have been dismissed as baseless by the Kremlin.  The proposals for the new national armed police unit is separate to plans laid down by David Cameron following the Paris terror attack to protect the public from terrorism.  The then prime minister announced plans for 1,500 extra firearms officers, with many to be deployed in rapid-reaction teams, which will be on patrol and ready to react around the clock. The Civil Nuclear Constabulary consists of about 1,200 officers who patrol 11 nuclear sites and nuclear materials in transit.  The British Transport Police has about 4,000 staff, while the Ministry of Defence Police has approximately 2,700 officers."

Mr Trump said: ""Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!"" Speaking to Sky News after Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Farage said he was ""flattered"", and when asked if he was suited to the ambassadorial role replied: ""The world has changed.""

The suggestion of the UKIP leader acting as a ""go between"" was rejected by Downing Street, who said he would not be the third person in the relationship between Mrs May and Mr Trump. Mr Farage travelled to the US to campaign alongside Mr Trump in Mississippi ahead of the presidential election and became the first British politician to meet the billionaire after his victory. The two met in New York just days after Mr Trump became President-elect. In an interview with Sky News after the meeting, Mr Farage rounded on the Government for rejecting suggestions he could help cement US/UK relations.

The President-elect's announcement comes days after his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Trump Tower in New York. Barely an hour before Mr Trump confirmed his intent to withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr Abe had said TPP would be ""meaningless"" without the US. Mr Trump's declaration is also likely to disappoint Barack Obama, who has been calling for the US to reaffirm its support for the trade deal. The outgoing President had warned that abandoning TPP would cause the US to lose an opportunity to shape the rules of global trade ""in a way that reflects our values"".  Mr Trump also said during his Facebook address that his White House transition team was working ""very smoothly, efficiently and effectively"" ahead of the handover of power on 20 January.  A number of major roles remain up for grabs in Mr Trump's administration, but he has dismissed reports in recent days that his cabinet selection process is in disarray.  Mr Trump has also reacted angrily to a Saturday Night Live skit which depicted him as overwhelmed and bumbling as he goes about choosing his top team and following up campaign promises.

The remainder did not know or did not express a preference. But nearly half of the 1,001 people surveyed oppose the legalisation of cannabis for recreational purposes. Sky Data found 46% were opposed, with just 37% in favour. The remaining 17% did not express a preference or did not know. People between 18 and 34 were the most likely to support legalisation, with 51% backing the change. Among the over-55s support was lowest, with just 24% supporting full legalisation. The research follows calls from senior Liberal Democrats, and other Labour and Tory figures, that the UK should follow the lead of the US and legalise the drug. Eight US states have changed the law, four deciding to do so in this month's election, and several more allow its use for medical reasons. Monday's report, by the Adam Smith Institute and Volteface, claims legalisation could net the Treasury more than £1bn a year in tax revenue. It also says the number of prisoners in jail for drugs offences would drop, saving the taxpayer millions. The primary reason, the MPs say, is that UK drugs laws have failed. Former deputy PM Nick Clegg said: ""British politicians need to open their eyes to what is happening in the rest of the world. ""Cannabis prohibition is being swept away on a tide of popular opinion and replaced with responsible legal regulation. ""Now is the time for ministers to start writing the rules."" Former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Lilley said: ""It is time we legalised cannabis. Currently cannabis can only be obtained from illegal gangs who also push hard drugs. ""So we are driving soft drugs users into the arms of hard drugs pushers."" Labour MP Paul Flynn added: ""The UK's 45 years of harsh prohibition has multiplied use and harm. ""A legal market would destroy the drug's attraction as forbidden fruit and encourage users to ingest cannabis, of known strength and quality, in ways that will the avoid deadly dangers of smoking."" Germany is also getting ready to legalise cannabis for medical purposes and Canada is preparing for all-out decriminalisation.

It comes after an audit compiled for the European Parliament Bureau alleged UKIP misspent nearly £400,000 to fund its own electioneering and to help boost the Brexit campaign - essentially using EU money against the EU. The money was provided to the European political grouping, the ADDE, which is dominated by Mr Farage's party and was created by UKIP leader Nigel Farage two years ago. :: Trump: Farage would do a 'great job' as ambassador It was apparently used on polling ""conducted in the interest of UKIP"" that was ""essential for reaching a significant representation in the House of Commons from the 2015 General Election or for a positive result for the 'Leave Campaign'"". The Electoral Commission said representatives had met with people from the European Parliament and ""inspected material that it gathered as part of its audit"".

Mr Farage has denied using EU cash to try to win the South Thanet seat at the General Election and claims he is being victimised. He told Sky News the party did not use EU ""money in Thanet or anywhere during the General Election"".  When the news broke last week, he said: ""I've understood absolutely the rules. This is pure victimisation. I am the most investigated MEP in history. Look at what the pro-EU groups were spending."" The money, according to the audit, was used to fund polling in Great Grimsby and Thurrock, Rochester and Strood and Cardiff South and Penarth - all UKIP target seats at the last election.   Polling was also paid for ahead of the General Election in Thanet South, where Mr Farage unsuccessfully ran to become an MP. Funds were also spent on polling around the EU referendum. A Ukip spokesman said: ""We are confident we have abided by all electoral rules."""
2016-11-22,"Patients could soon have to take their passport to hospital to prove they are eligible for free treatment, under new rules to stop so-called health tourism.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-patients-could-have-to-show-passport-for-treatment-10667080,"The Department of Health's top civil servant, permanent secretary Chris Wormald, told MPs that he was looking at making hospitals check whether patients should be paying. Mr Wormald admitted the proposal was controversial, but it would mean anyone, including British citizens, might have to prove their identity before tests or an operation. He told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that passport checks were already taking place at one hospital in Peterborough which serves a high immigrant population. ""On the general question of are we looking at whether trusts should proactively ask people to prove their identity - yes we are looking at that,"" Mr Wormald said. ""Individual trusts like Peterborough are doing that and it is making a big difference. ""It is quite a controversial thing to do, to say to the entire population you've got to prove your identity."" Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust covers an area that has received a high number of eastern European immigrants in recent years. Mr Wormald said he accepted it was not part of ""health service culture"" but that it may be necessary to crack down on use of the NHS by visitors from abroad who do not have an automatic right to free care. A National Audit Office report last month said the Government paid out £674m to other European countries for the treatment of Britons abroad, but received only £49m in return for the NHS treatment of European citizens. Mr Wormald said he could not guarantee that ministers would meet their target to increase the amount the Government claws back from European countries from the current £49m to £200m. Other parts of the NHS have been experimenting with tougher identity checks. It was disclosed earlier this year that at least one hospital in south London piloted a scheme to cut what has been described as ""maternity tourism"". Expectant mothers going to St George's in Tooting will have to provide papers showing they are eligible for free NHS care when they arrive for scans. Those unable to do so will be referred to the Home Office and could face deportation. Mr Wormald said NHS trusts need to do far more to identify foreign people with no eligibility for NHS treatment if the target is to be met. ""We are not here to criticise NHS frontline staff, but what we want is a culture of everybody who works in it to understand financial rigour,"" he added. ""We need a culture where we are more careful with the tax pound."" Asked whether the NHS will ever meet the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's target of clawing back £200m a year from European countries, he said: ""I'm not going to guarantee whether we will meet it."" A source close to Mr Hunt confirmed that the idea of passport identification had been floated and piloted and that plans for a nationwide scheme have not been ruled out. A spokeswoman for Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ""In response to a national requirement, our trust devised a process for recovering money for the NHS from the treatment of non-EU citizens. ""This was looked at by the Cabinet Office and we understand our system may be used as a basis for other trusts to follow. We are delighted to have been identified as an exemplar of good practice."""
2016-11-22,"Back in the dark ages, oh, a decade or two ago, Autumn Statements were dull affairs - the Government's opportunity to update the economic and fiscal numbers six months or so after the Budget.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/autumn-statement-2016-the-five-big-things-to-look-out-for-10667712,"If Philip Hammond has his way, the Autumn Statement might go back to being a bit like that in future - but this year's event promises to be a major one. In large part that's because this is the first fiscal event since the Brexit vote in June. Having eschewed the opportunity of holding an emergency Budget in the summer, Mr Hammond has a lot to cover. On that basis, and the basis that events like this are stuffed with an overwhelming amount of detail (some important, some extraneous), here are the five most important things to look out for. 1. What are the new growth forecasts? While all the papers seem most obsessed with the question of how much the Chancellor will be giving away (spoiler: not much), this question - how strong and resilient the economy is - is probably the most important one of the entire event. After all, if the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the official government growth numbers, thinks the economy is heading for the sink, that will mean much less tax revenue, and much less money for the Chancellor to give away in future. Back in the Budget, the OBR expected GDP growth of 2.2% next year and 2.1% the following years. Those numbers will probably be cut to 1.5% or below in the coming years. That is part of the explanation for why the Government will have to borrow more - potentially £100bn more - over the coming five years. And that's before you consider whether it wants to spend a bit more, which brings us to question two. :: Boost for Hammond as public finances in better shape than expected 2. How much of the extra borrowing is down to Brexit? Because the chances are the majority of the increase in borrowing will not be down to any Government-planned splurge. Yes, there are likely to be some small measures designed to help struggling families. But add them up and they are likely to look piddling in comparison with the likely increase in the deficit caused by those OBR forecast changes. True, there's a significant chance the OBR is wrong and is too pessimistic, but there are few forecasters who expect stronger growth in the coming years, such is the concern over those Brexit negotiations. :: Hammond will act in event of Brexit downturn 3. What are the new fiscal rules? As you probably know, George Osborne's three fiscal rules (1. Get a surplus, 2. Cut the national debt, 3. Cap benefits payments) are all now kaput. Mr Hammond is expected to replace these rules with a new set. The chances are his framework will look a little like the one Mr Osborne had in his first parliamentary term - a goal of eliminating the budget deficit, but allowing for extra spending on investment. That would give the Chancellor room to spend on new roads/railways/broadband without busting his rule. There will also be a time-limited rule on getting the national debt down, and perhaps some other little bells and whistles. But the one thing we know for sure is that, sooner or later, the rules will be broken. They almost always are. :: Hammond plans to spend £1.3bn on road improvements 4. How vague will the OBR be about the costs/benefits of Brexit? Actually, the OBR's job is not just the most important but arguably the trickiest in the run-up to this Autumn Statement. After all, it has to make all sorts of judgements about how those Brexit negotiations will affect the UK economy while remaining as much in the dark as the rest of us about what will actually happen in those negotiations. So keep a close eye on the provisos it adds to its forecasts about how sure it can be. The chances are it will say the level of uncertainty over the forecasts is greater than ever. It might also have to be vague, too, about what happens to the UK's EU contributions in the future. While you might have assumed that once Britain is out of the EU it won't have to pay the £10bn or so it contributes (in net terms) to the EU budget, the reality may well be that, depending on the eventual deal, the UK does eventually have to contribute at least something. :: UK is in Brexit vote lull before economic storm, warns Alistair Darling 5. What about all those manifesto pledges? Remember the Conservatives committed themselves to a lot of quite expensive policies in their manifesto - policies many in the Treasury would rather like to wriggle free of. So keep an eye on the following promises: do they get fulfilled, forgotten or even reversed? :: The ""triple lock"" under which the basic state pension is increased by either inflation, earnings or 2.5% - whichever is highest. :: To increase the tax free allowance to £12,500 for basic rate earners and to £50k for higher rate taxpayers :: To spend 0.7% of GDP on international development :: To freeze commuter rail fares for the entire Parliament These questions should help you navigate the day - as will one big overarching question, the one I always ask myself whenever the Chancellor announces something very exciting-sounding: is this really new, or is it yet another reannouncement? :: Watch full coverage of the Autumn Statement on Sky News on Wednesday from 10am."

""US citizens should exercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets,"" it added. The advisory comes a day after France said it had arrested seven terror suspects in Strasbourg and Marseilles who had been plotting an attack for months.  Officials did not reveal the potential targets, but the arrests rattled nerves in Strasbourg, where a famed Christmas market opens in a few days. The market, which attracts tourists from across the world, was the target of a failed extremist plot in 2000 by Algerian and French militants who had trained in Afghanistan. In its advisory, the State Department pointed out that extremists had carried out attacks in Belgium, France, Germany and Turkey during the past year, and said it was still concerned about the potential for more attacks throughout Europe.  It said ""extremist sympathisers or self-radicalised extremists"" might try to carry out attacks. It added: ""US citizens should exercise vigilance when attending large holiday events, visiting tourist sites, using public transportation, and frequenting places of worship, restaurants, hotels, etc.""  The alert will stay in place until 20 February next year."
2016-11-22,"In her first speech at the CBI annual conference, Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the announcement of new jobs from ""the Facebook"". ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-should-concentrate-on-the-economy-of-tomorrow-10666125,"It was rather a granny-like way to refer to the social network. And a lot of the ""modern industrial strategy"" she unveiled in her speech also felt old-fashioned.   Her diagnosis is correct, though. The UK remains a world leader in research, both at universities and within start-ups.  :: Facebook to increase UK staff by 50% in 2017 But we do a pretty bad job at turning those breakthroughs into big businesses. As the PM said: ""While the UK ranks third in the OECD for the number of start-ups we create, we are only 13th for the number that go on to become scale-up businesses."" Take graphene, which scientists at Manchester University discovered how to extract. Now it's a fast-growing industry, but only 1% of patents worldwide are from the UK.  Or Artificial Intelligence, one of the sectors mentioned by Mrs May in her speech. The UK produced two breakthrough companies here, DeepMind and Magic Pony Technology. Both were bought by US technology giants, Google and Twitter respectively. That knowledge, developed in Britain, now contributes to Silicon Valley's bottom line.  So when the PM pointed to Softbank, it raised an eyebrow. She described ""a record £24bn investment from Softbank in Britain's future"".  That was a reference to ARM, a chip designer that was hitherto the UK's biggest tech success story, being bought by a Japanese conglomerate.  That's not an investment - it's a crown jewel being picked off.  Mrs May said that investment - in particular a £2bn research and development fund - would help commercialise research.  She added that the Government would look at investment flows to turn ""our bright start-ups into successful scale-ups"". That's fine, but it's probably not enough. We need a lot more talent in UK technology and that means starting at schools and universities.  Brexit only makes it harder in the short term for UK start-ups to attract talent from the rest of the continent. But even this is rather short term.  Mrs May also said: ""We are leaders in global professional services from architecture to accountancy, from law to consulting."" Services are vital to the UK economy. But the coming age of AI will see many of these jobs automated, whether it's in accountancy, architecture or journalism. We see these as quintessentially human jobs, but robots will take more and more of them over. According to one study, 47% of all jobs are at risks of automation.  That's a risk to the UK economy, one that requires a radical rethink of the skills we want from our workforce.  Mrs May's speech was looking at the economy of today and with the uncertainty of Brexit, that's fair enough. But it's the economy of 2040 we need to worry about."
2016-11-22,An extra £1bn of Government investment in fast broadband is going to be announced by the Chancellor in his Autumn Statement.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/hammond-to-pledge-1631bn-for-rolling-out-full-fibre-broadband-10667096,"Philip Hammond will claim his latest infrastructure cash handout will mean at least two million more homes and businesses could get access to gold standard ""full-fibre"" broadband. It will have the capacity to reach speeds of more than 1Gbps, which it is claimed could allow users to download an entire Game Of Thrones series in less than a minute.  Mr Hammond is expected to promise £400m for a new Digital Infrastructure Investment Fund to boost commercial finance for emerging fibre broadband providers looking to scale up.  The Government says that while the UK is already a world leader in superfast broadband coverage, it is falling behind on the rollout of full-fibre and only 2% of premises have access to it.  This new fund will be matched by private finance to encourage the delivery of full-fibre broadband, with the aim of bringing better connections to more homes and businesses than ever before. The Chancellor is also expected to announce funding for more fibre broadband networks, in partnership with local areas across the UK, which the Government says will prioritise faster connections for businesses and help build a more productive economy. And to help the next wave of mobile technology, the Government will also fund a new programme of fibre and 5G trials, with the aim of transforming communications using mobile phones. Making his announcement, Mr Hammond is expected to claim full-fibre is the future of broadband, since it helps people to share ever-more digital content faster with friends and family. It also enables TV viewers to watch Ultra-HD content more easily and is more reliable and secure than traditional copper internet cables, so consumers should get internet access when they need it. The investment is likely to be welcomed by communities in rural areas, which have long complained that their businesses have been badly damaged by poor internet connections. A European Commission survey this year revealed that rural communities in Britain get worse superfast broadband coverage than their counterparts in Slovenia, Lithuania and Cyprus. In its report, the Commission rebuked the British Government for doing too little to grant people living in the countryside access to high-speed networks. The survey found that only just under half of Britain's rural households had access to superfast broadband at 30Mbps, a level that allows users to watch films online. Andrew Griffith, Sky's Group Chief Operating Officer, said: ""We welcome the Government's announcement on broadband investment, which chimes with our view that the future is full fibre. ""Government has played its part through this package of measures, which should help kick start the investment needed to push the UK up the league table. ""But we won't achieve the necessary step change in driving full fibre investment across the country unless Ofcom also takes bold and decisive action on the future of BT Openreach.""    :: Watch live coverage of the Autumn Statement on Sky News from 10am on Wednesday."

The officials warned him that the way forward will be ""tough"" and ""intense"", stressing that the UK will not be able to remain in the single market without accepting free movement of people. Some vented frustration at what they said was the lack of clear information coming from the Government. German MEP Manfred Weber, chairman of the centre-right European People's Party, said he had not heard anything new, and suggested the UK wanted to remain in the single market.

But Mr Davis described it as a ""good start"". ""Our view is that we can get an outcome which will be in the interests of the European Union and in the interests of Britain and which will meet the requirements of the referendum,"" he said. Mr Verhofstadt said the exit process would have to be concluded 14 or 15 months after triggering Article 50, the official notification of Britain's intention to leave the EU, which is expected in March.

Agreement needs to be found ahead of the new 2019 European elections pic.twitter.com/Bzsb4x7HRt Mr Verhofstadt said it would be a ""tough period, very intense"". He added that Britain could not expect to get the benefits of EU membership and still impose curbs on immigration. ""It is impossible to find solutions where we destroy the so-called four freedoms,"" he said. :: Brexit: May convinced of 'strong' case to overturn ruling ""These four freedoms are key, they are a basic element of the European Union - the freedom of movement of goods, of services, of capital and of people."" No deal would be accepted that put those freedoms at risk, he said. Mr Davis and Mr Verhofstadt laughed off an exchange before the meeting where Mr Davis had been reported as referring to Mr Verhofstadt as Satan. It prompted Mr Verhofstadt to say today's encounter would be a ""hell of a conversation"", but Mr Davis said it was a misunderstanding. Mr Verhofstadt said Mr Davis confirmed that the UK government still expected to trigger Article 50 before the end of March. British MPs will have a say on triggering Article 50 if the Government loses a Supreme Court appeal on whether Prime Minister Theresa May can decide alone when to start the Brexit process. The Supreme Court ruling is expected in the new year."
2016-11-22,The whole point of ambassadors is that they are OUR men (or women) in the country to which they are sent. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-not-one-for-usual-diplomatic-protocols-10667320,"They are meant to represent UK interests to their host government. So Donald Trump's tweet that Nigel Farage would do ""a great job"" representing Great Britain is pretty unusual. It is yet another example of this insurgent President-elect breaking with the usual conventions and protocol. Presidents don't usually choose who is sent to keep an eye on them.  :: Trump: Farage would do 'a great job' as ambassador Downing Street has been quick to respond that there is no vacancy, but Trump's action puts the present incumbent Sir Kim Darroch in an extremely uncomfortable position.  Sir Kim's problem is that British governments place great store on the so-called ""Special Relationship"" and that the Ambassador to Washington is seen as the UK's sucker-up-in-chief. When Tony Blair appointed him US ambassador, Sir Christopher Meyer recalls that his instructions were ""to crawl up the a*** of the Bush administration and stay there"". Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! Many in Whitehall still treasure the memory of Lord Harlech as the ideal ambassador. Dashing and aristocratic, he managed to become a close personal friend of the equally dashing and posh President John F Kennedy. Prime Minister Jim Callaghan tried to repeat the trick with rather less success when he sent his son-in-law Peter Jay to fill the post. Like most British ambassadors, Sir Kim is a career diplomat. Somewhat unfairly, he has already come under fire because Mrs May was not the first on the phone to congratulate Trump and because Mr Farage managed to be the first British, and international, politician to get an audience with him after his victory.  UK ambo in DC exists to defend UK interests in US, not US interests in UK. Can't have foreign presidents deciding who our ambo should be. It doesn't help that Sir Kim, like most of his predecessors, is a member of the Europhile political elite. He served Mr Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron in senior positions and has even been UK ambassador to the EU.  It seems most unlikely that Mrs May would sack and replace him with the interim leader of UKIP. But stranger things have happened. Now that Britain is turning its back on the EU, close ties with the US are absolutely vital.  Number 10 is already trying to seduce the incoming president with the promise of an early state visit to the UK, complete with a sleepover at Windsor Castle for Mr Trump and his wife Melania.  As we have seen throughout his 70 years, Mr Trump has a habit of getting what he wants."
2016-11-22,A tsunami warning has been lifted after a strong earthquake hit northeastern Japan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/tsunami-warning-for-fukushima-after-strong-earthquake-hits-japan-10666944,"The 6.9-magnitude quake struck the region of Fukushima - the same area left devastated in 2011 when a 9.0-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and a nuclear disaster which killed 18,000 people. Thousands of people fled to higher ground after the tremors were felt. There were fears that 3m high tsunami waves could hit the region after the early morning earthquake, but the highest wave measured 1.4m. After the latest quake, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said the cooling system for spent nuclear fuel at its Daini nuclear plant had been briefly halted. No damage has been reported at the company's other plants, although there have been some blackouts, a spokeswoman said. TV pictures showed ships moving out to sea as tsunami sirens wailed. The quake struck off the Japanese coast, 67km northeast of Iwaki city, at a depth of 11.4km, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. An Iwaki fire department official said there was smoke or a fire at a petrochemical research centre, but that it had been extinguished. Tokyo, 150 miles south, also felt tremors from the earthquake - which struck at 6am local time (9pm GMT). There have been no reports of serious damage, but at least 14 people were injured. The country's meteorological agency put the earthquake at 7.3 magnitude, but the reading by the USGS was later downgraded to 6.9. Japanese broadcaster NHK said the East Japan Railway Company had suspended some of its bullet train services. Japan accounts for 20% of the world's earthquakes greater than 6.0 magnitude.

2016-11-22,Philip Hammond has received a boost ahead of his Autumn Statement as official figures showed public sector borrowing last month was lower than expected.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/boost-for-hammond-as-public-finances-in-better-shape-than-expected-10667264,"But economists warned that the improvement was unlikely to be enough for the Chancellor to give much help to the so-called ""JAMs"" - those ""just about managing"". Borrowing excluding the effect of bank bail-outs came to £4.8bn, down from £6.4bn in the same month a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That beat economists' expectations that borrowing would fall less dramatically, to £6bn. It marks an improved performance since earlier in the year when borrowing was falling much too slowly to meet Government targets - even before any impact from the EU referendum. Borrowing - which represents the shortfall between public sector spending and revenues - narrowed partly thanks to a surge in corporation tax receipts, which were up by nearly a quarter to £9bn. For the seven months of the financial year to date, borrowing has narrowed compared to last year, to £48.6bn.  But that is already close to the £55.5bn deficit target for the whole of the fiscal year, with five months left to go until it ends in March next year. A Treasury spokesman said: ""As the Chancellor has made clear, the Government is committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows space to support the economy as needed."" The latest figures from the ONS come a day ahead of Mr Hammond's Autumn Statement, which will see him unveil updated official forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). A report from PwC last week predicted that the Chancellor faced an extra £100bn of borrowing for the next five years compared with what was planned in March. He has acknowledged that there are now expectations of slower growth in the wake of the Brexit vote. The Chancellor had previously talked of a ""reset"" of fiscal policy, raising the prospect that he would loosen the Treasury's purse strings after George Osborne's era of austerity.  But Mr Hammond has now played down expectations of a tax and spending giveaway with a warning that the UK faces an ""eye-wateringly large"" debt pile. The latest ONS figures showed underlying debt in October was £50.9bn higher than the same month last year, at £1.64tn. That represents 83.8% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) - though in these terms it is 0.5 percentage points lower than a year ago, since the economy has been growing at a faster pace than the debt. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest figures represented ""a decent boost for the Chancellor ahead of the Autumn Statement"" but there was ""limited scope"" for post-referendum stimulus measures. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""October's better than expected borrowing figures do little to compensate for overshoots in the first half of the fiscal year. ""The Chancellor's warning at the weekend that he is 'highly constrained' suggests that there will be few sweeteners for the 'JAMs' - people 'just about managing' - in tomorrow's Autumn Statement."""

The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed it responded to a report of disturbance but the incident was deemed a ""medical emergency"".

The court has heard Mair shouted ""Britain first"" during the attack, had a stash of neo-Nazi material at his home in the West Yorkshire town and had collected a dossier on his 41-year-old Remain campaigning MP. At the conclusion of the prosecution case, his lawyer Simon Russell Flint QC, told the Old Bailey jury that Mair, who denies murder, would not be going into the witness box. He added that he would not be calling any evidence on behalf of Mair.Trial judge Mr Justice Wilkie told the jury that they could draw inferences from the defendant's silence. In his closing speech, Richard Whittam QC, for the prosecution, told of the ""sheer barbarity"" of Mrs Cox's death. He said: ""At 13.48 on the 16th of June in Market Street outside the public library in Birstall, the democratically elected MP for Batley and Spen, Jo Cox, was murdered as she carried out her duties on behalf of her electorate. ""Constituents were waiting to speak to her in the library. ""The sheer barbarity of her murder and the utter cowardice of her murder bring the two extremities of humanity face to face."" Mr Whittam said her attack ""brought out the best of the people who were with her"" - the two members of staff and Birstall residents who came to her aid. He said they came from all walks of life, including a taxi driver and a 77-year-old man who was wounded as he tried to intervene. Despite having the ""element of surprise"", Mair failed in his first attempt and came back to shoot and stab Mrs Cox once more, Mr Whittam said. ""Perhaps he underestimated Jo Cox's tenacity and courage."" He said all the evidence ""compellingly establishes Thomas Mair was her murderer"". Mr Whittam said it was fitting the case had been held before another woman - whose statue holding the scales of justice adorns the Old Bailey. At the conclusion of the evidence, the scales were ""weighted only one way"", he added. Defending Mair, Simon Russell Flint QC said the killing of Mrs Cox as she carried out her ""public duties"" had been ""truly shocking and appalling"". He told the court: ""She was brutally and callously murdered and there is no issue or dispute about that."" Addressing the jury, he continued: ""It is you, and you alone, who have been charged with the responsibility of determining what are the true verdicts on each of the counts on the indictment."" He added: ""You and you alone will determine whether Thomas Mair can return to his quiet and solitary existence or will be forever remembered as the man who assassinated Jo Cox."" Mair denies the murder, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a dagger. He has also pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to pensioner Bernard Kenny, who tried to stop the attack on Mrs Cox. The trial continues."

The court was told how the teenagers, now 15, had sex, shared a bath and watched four Twilight vampire films as they ""revelled"" in the murders. Now the case has been referred under the ""unduly lenient sentence"" scheme, and law officers have 28 days to decide if any action should be taken. A statement from the Attorney General's office offered no details of who referred the case. ""The threshold to refer cases to the Court of Appeal is very high,"" it noted. ""A sentence can only be regarded as unduly lenient if there has been a gross error and it is significantly below the level that any judge could have reasonably imposed after considering the facts of the case."" On sentencing earlier this month at Nottingham Crown Court, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the pair had a ""toxic"" relationship and acted in a ""grotesque"" way as he said the case had ""few parallels in modern criminal history"". He told the teenagers: ""There was remarkable premeditation and planning - it was, on any view, substantial, meticulous and repeated. ""The killings were brutal in the form of executions and both victims, particularly Elizabeth Edwards, must have suffered terribly in the last minutes of their lives.

It also confirmed 360 more positions at the company hang in the balance as the future of the remainder of the company is assessed. The announcement comes days after Sky News reported that Hewden was teetering on the brink of collapse. It had employed around 750 people. There had been a frantic search for new financial backers in recent weeks. Joint administrator Sam Woodward said managers had been trying to reshape the business but that this had ""proven challenging within the group's capital structure and the recent trading environment"". Last month, Hewden - which was founded in 1961 - said it had been ""impacted by market uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU"". Hewden rents machinery such as cranes, excavators and power generation tools to construction sites across the UK. Among the brands it supplies to customers is machinery made by JCB, which has been a vocal supporter of the UK's departure from the European Union. Hewden was bought by the investment firm Sun Capital Partners in 2010, and has close to £200m of outstanding borrowings. It lost more than £16m in 2014 - the last year for which accounts are available at Companies House. Unite national officer Bernard McAulay said on Tuesday: ""This is a sickening blow for workers in the run-up to Christmas and is the result of a succession of venture capitalists hawking Hewden around the market over a number of years to make a quick buck. ""Unite will be fighting to secure the futures of Hewden workers and supporting them in any way we can through this difficult time. ""Unite will also be working closely with the administrators to ensure workers aren't short-changed out of their pensions and that a future for the company's workers can be secured."""

It is the first near-perfect skeleton of the extinct bird to come up for sale in almost 100 years and is one of just a handful in existence across the world. Errol Fuller, natural history curator at Summers Place Auctions, said the piece was an ""amazingly rare"" example of ""one of the great icons of extinction"". It fetched a hammer price of £280,000, or £346,300 with buyer's premium to cover administration fees, at the auction house's fourth Evolution sale in Billingshurst, West Sussex. A spokeswoman said the buyer was a private collector who successfully bid over the phone. ""The dodo bones had been collected by a dodo enthusiast for 40 years until he realised he had enough bones to create an almost complete skeleton of this extinct bird,"" she said. ""There are only about 12 similarly complete skeletons in existence and they are all in museums around the world."" First seen by Dutch sailors in 1598, dodos were flightless birds which grew to 3ft (1m) tall and lived on the island of Mauritius. They became extinct around 70 years after their discovery, and pigeons are their closest living relatives. Experts believe it highly unlikely that another composite skeleton will come up for sale again as the Mauritian government has banned exports of dodo bones. Summers Place has a track record of selling unique skeletons. The auction house started its Evolution Sales in November 2013 and sold a diplodocus dinosaur skeleton to the Danish Natural History Museum for £500,000."

2016-11-22,"Administrators to BHS have lodged a furious protest against a move to force them to begin liquidating the collapsed retailer within days, accusing its biggest creditor of jeopardising efforts to complete an orderly wind-down.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161122212607/http://news.sky.com/story/bhs-administrator-locked-in-tug-of-war-with-chain8217s-top-creditor-10667561,"Sky News has obtained a copy of a progress report produced by Duff & Phelps, BHS's joint administrator, which lays bare the scale of its dispute with the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the lifeboat now responsible for paying retirement funds to thousands of former BHS employees. In the report, which was finalised last Friday and is expected to be made public in the coming days, Duff & Phelps argues that transferring SHB Realisations Limited - previously BHS Limited - from administration to liquidation would reduce overall returns to creditors. It also reveals that unsecured creditors can expect to receive a maximum of just 8p in the pound following the biggest British high street collapse since Woolworths nearly a decade ago. The PPF has asked for liquidation to begin by November 24, although the move could yet slip into next week, with FRP Advisory - the other joint administrator - then taking over as the sole liquidator. BHS collapsed in April, triggering roughly 11,000 job losses and a bitter political battle aimed at securing a pension bailout likely to cost Sir Philip Green, its former owner, well over £300m. The billionaire has been embroiled in a battle with administrators over a £35m charge held by his Arcadia Group over BHS. Duff & Phelps' update refers to confirmation by DLA, a law firm, of the validity of that charge, but warns: ""We understand that the Concurrent Administrators are investigating additional matters which they say may impact on the validity."" Dated November 18, the report said the ""substantial knowledge and relationships since the appointment date which would result in better realisations and/or lower costs when finalising matters"" meant liquidating SHB was not yet appropriate.  It cited the collection of debts, ongoing claims against Visa and Mastercard over interchange fees and ""concession trust monies"" as reasons to delay the liquidation. ""The Joint Administrators have had success in achieving surrenders in full and final settlement resulting in the saving of many millions of £'s in both expenditure and unsecured claims.  ""CVL (Creditors Voluntary Liquidation) might be necessary to finalise certain property issues but it is not imperative at this stage,"" the report said. Duff & Phelps also argued that handing to a liquidator a number of ""complicated and unresolved trading issues"" where the Joint Administrators were acting for the counterparty would ""increase the settlement risk and increases costs"". In addition, it said its investigations into Retail Acquisitions Limited, the vehicle of Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from Sir Philip for £1 last year, were far enough advanced that replacing it with a new liquidator ""makes no sense"". Sources said that an attempt to secure a fee increase for the administrators from £4.2m to just under £5.3m, led by Duff & Phelps, had been blocked by creditors. The PPF disputed the argument that its efforts to force BHS into liquidation would diminish creditors' returns. In a statement issued to Sky News, Malcolm Weir, the PPF's head of restructuring and insolvency, said: ""We are intent on securing the best possible recovery on behalf of the pension schemes from the insolvent company.  ""Given that the company has not traded since August, we believe a liquidator will be able to progress all remaining issues at least as quickly as the current administrators, including the remaining leases and the ongoing investigatory work.  ""This will expedite the investigations and reduce costs, and it is therefore in the interests of pension scheme members and our levy-payers to do this promptly."" An excoriating report by two committees of MPs concluded during the summer that Sir Philip bore much of the responsibility for BHS's travails after opting to sell it to a ""manifestly unsuitable"" buyer in the shape of Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt. A subsequent non-binding vote in the House of Commons suggested that he should be stripped of his knighthood, while The Pensions Regulator recently issued formal warning notices to Sir Philip, the parent company of his Arcadia Group, and to Mr Chappell. The tycoon, who owns TopShop and other leading high street names, has responded furiously to criticism led by the Labour MP Frank Field, whose Work and Pensions Committee will take evidence on Wednesday from Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of The Pensions Regulator. In a letter to Ms Titcomb, Mr Field sought clarification over the watchdog's powers to acquire ""assets other than cash from a person or company from which payment is being sought"". The PPF estimated in May that the cost to it of meeting BHS pensioners' retirement payments at the discounted level it provides would be at least £275m, although that figure is thought to have since risen to somewhere in the region of £320m."

Under the scheme, Britons would pay an annual fee to benefit from free movement around the EU, the right to reside in other European countries under existing rules and the right to vote in EU elections. ""Many say 'we don't want to cut our links',"" Mr Verhofstadt told The Times.  ""I like the idea that people who are European citizens and saying they want to keep it have the possibility of doing so. As a principle I like it."" Charles Goerens, an MEP from Luxembourg who put forward the idea, says the scheme could even be free for Britons. He said: ""If it is adopted, it must be a voluntary request made by each UK citizen. ""It was thought at the very beginning that they should have to pay a fee but that is a detail. Paying a fee or not is not the essence.""  He added: ""Between 15 and 30 million British citizens deeply regret Brexit.  ""My amendment was tabled in order to get European citizenship for those British citizens who want to keep their citizenship."" MEPs will vote on the proposals by the end of the year, but any Brexit deal with the UK would have to have the agreement of the leaders of the other 27 EU nations as well as the European Parliament. On the chances of the proposal being voted through, Mr Verhofstadt admitted: ""I don't know if it will fly or not."" He added: ""There are big differences of view here in the parliament."" Brexit-backing Tory MP Andrew Bridgen claimed the plan is ""an attempt to create two classes of UK citizen and to subvert the referendum vote."" He told The Times: ""The truth is that Brussels will try every trick in the book to stop us leaving."" It comes as former prime minister Tony Blair suggested Britons could stop the process of leaving the EU if they disagree with the terms. He said voting to leave was ""like agreeing to a house swap without having seen the other house"". Meanwhile, Ireland's prime minister has told Sky News it will be ""impossible"" for the UK to agree a full Brexit deal within the two years set out in Article 50. Enda Kenny said a Brexit transition deal between the UK and EU was ""inevitable""."

But JLR said the ambition was ""dependent on overcoming infrastructure and capacity issues"". The company currently employs 40,000 people in the UK and the potential expansion set out by Dr Speth could add a reported 10,000 to the workforce. Dr Speth told an industry meeting it wants to build electric vehicles in the West Midlands. His comments came after the Government this week pledged £390m to fund greener technologies. Any new production would come as a further boost to the car-making sector following the Brexit vote, after Japan's Nissan said it would build two new models at its plant in Sunderland. JLR said in a statement that Dr Speth had ""confirmed his vision to double the production output of the business, make EVs (electric vehicles) in the UK and the desire to make the UK a global centre of excellence for battery research and development"". It said it could not comment on job numbers or the timeframe. JLR, owned by India's Tata Motors, showcased its first electric car, the Jaguar I-PACE, at the Los Angeles motor show last week. It has said it wants half its cars to be available in an electric version by the end of the decade. The I-PACE car will be produced in Austria but Dr Speth's remarks spell out the wish for some of JLR's electric vehicle production to take place in the UK. Last week, he told Sky News that JLR's future in Britain could be jeopardised by a hard Brexit meaning additional tax and tariff barriers. He said it would have to ""see the facts"" before deciding whether to continue manufacturing in the UK."

It pointed to an assumption in the Department for Transport's business case in favour of the expansion that it would mean they are 15% higher by that date. That would result in other industries having to cut their own emissions output more sharply in order to meet wider emissions reduction plans. The committee said it had ""limited confidence"" in the ability of other sectors to go beyond the reductions already planned. Lord Debden, chairman of the committee, set out the concerns in a letter to Greg Clark, Secretary for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. It comes after the Government backed plans for the new runway at Heathrow - ahead of an alternative expansion put forward by Gatwick. The proposals have come under fire over the potential to hit air quality for millions of people living near Britain's biggest airport. Lord Debden's letter said: ""The committee is now concerned that there is scope for misunderstanding of DfT's position based on the business case for a third runway at Heathrow published in October 2016."""

Meanwhile, 59% said they would ask a driver to stop using a mobile phone. The poll of 23,141 motorists was commissioned by the AA Charitable Trust to mark the launch of a campaign aimed at changing attitudes towards driver distraction. The campaign begins with the launch of a short film, Cadence, which was written and produced by filmmaker Emmeline Kellie, after she became a nervous passenger because her friends were often using their phones while driving. Between April and June there were 200 fatal accidents on built-up roads in Britain, a year-on-year increase of 35%. :: A34 crash lorry driver jailed for killing family while on phone According to AA Charitable Trust director Edmund King, the spike ""may be due to driver inattention from excessive use of mobile phones at the wheel"". Mr King said: ""Despite horrific and tragic deaths caused by drivers distracted by phones, the problem is still rife. ""Our campaign aims to change attitudes but it must be supported by tougher penalties and more cops in cars."" Some 16,900 drivers in England and Wales were handed fixed penalty notices for using mobile phones behind the wheel last year, compared with 123,100 in 2011. Motoring groups believe the decline is due to a 27% fall in the number of full-time dedicated road policing officers in England (excluding London) and Wales between 2010 and 2015. The Government is planning to introduce legislation to toughen the punishment for those caught, with the fine going up from £100 to £200 and penalty points rising from three to six."

That way they could get through passport control more quickly. They next day, Ms Cafferkey was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with Ebola. While an NMC panel could not prove Ms Wood had written the incorrect temperature on Ms Cafferkey's forms, it found that she was aware that the nurse's temperature had been measured at 38.2C and 38.3C (101F). It said Ms Wood had suggested that 37.2C (99F) be recorded so that the group of medics could exit the ""uncomfortable"" and ""chaotic"" area more quickly. A temperature above 37.5C (100F) required doctors' consideration in the Public Health England screening room. Panel chairman Najrul Khasru told Ms Wood: ""You put Ms Cafferkey and anyone coming into contact with her at unwarranted risk of harm."" He added that the ""seriousness"" of Ms Wood's ""misconduct"" could have ""contributed to the risk of Ebola - a very serious and dangerous illness - spreading into this country"". Before becoming one of the first NHS medics to travel to West Africa, Ms Wood had been a senior sister at Haywood Hospital in Staffordshire. She faced three charges of misconduct, and could have been struck off. But Mr Khasru said there was a ""public interest in retaining and allowing a highly-skilled and well-regarded nurse to return to practice"". He described Ms Wood's conduct as ""an isolated incident in an otherwise long and unblemished career"". Ms Cafferkey was cleared at a hearing in September of allowing an incorrect temperature to be recorded. An NMC panel found that her developing illness had impaired her judgment. While it found three charges against her proven by admission, it said her fitness to practise had not been affected. She tested negative for Ebola last month."

Ackerman was arrested after search warrants were carried out at addresses linked to him in Essex and Hertfordshire. Judge David Radford described him as an ""utterly deceitful and dishonest man who has consistently, premeditatedly and shamelessly defrauded others"". He said: ""Your endemic dishonesty is plainly unremitting. You earn no credit for your remorse, nor any credit for any pleas of guilt."" The judge said many of his victims were Premier League footballers, and added that ""significant planning"" had gone into the scam. Prosecutor Samuel Trefgarne told the court Ackerman had ""numerous previous convictions for fraud"", the most recent in 2013. Charles Royle, defending, said Ackerman had ""regrets"" about having the trial and would have pleaded guilty if he had been instructed differently. Ackerman remained composed as he was sentenced and blew a kiss to a woman in the public gallery as he left the dock."
2016-11-26,MPs may receive digital training to make them more tech-savvy.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/digital-training-for-mps-to-be-more-tech-savvy-10671710,"Doteveryone, a charity which focuses on digital issues, has run a pilot scheme in which four MPs received lessons from ""digitally-savvy mentors"". It is now working with the Parliamentary Digital Service to scale the project up to the whole House of Commons. Between May and June, Doteveryone worked with Labour MP Yvette Cooper, SNP MP Calum Kerr, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, and Conservative MP Matt Warman. They looked at how digital training might benefit engagement, collaboration, security and the delivery of parliamentary work.  The project was funded by the charity, which claims the pilot scheme led to an increase in engagement.  It said one of the MPs saw his Facebook posts go from a reach of 3,000 to 10,000 views after including a video for the first time, while another had more than 2,700 responses when he tried online polling. Mr Lamb said: ""I think it's essential. ""It's a work in progress. I'm not suddenly tech-savvy now after having a mentor with us for a couple of months but I've absolutely seen the necessity of MPs upping their skills substantially together with their staff so we can be more effective representatives."" Rachel Coldicutt, chief executive of Doteveryone, said: ""The ultimate aim is to help MPs be more efficient, to help them communicate better, to spend more time having quality interaction with their constituents rather than having to cope with lots of emails, admin, and to help them to be safe and secure."" However, The Taxpayers' Alliance described it as ""quite a silly idea"". Harry Davies, from the organisation, said: ""MPs expenses were upwards of £150 million last year and we need to be looking for savings, and this really needs to be justified if they're going to spend so much money on it."""

2016-11-26,Vladimir Putin has expressed his hopes for improving relations between Moscow and Washington as he personally granted a Russian passport to Hollywood star Steven Seagal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/vladimir-putin-grants-action-hero-steven-seagal-russian-passport-10671880,"""I want to congratulate you and express the hope that this is another, albeit small, gesture and it might be a sign of the gradual normalisation of relations between our countries,"" the Russia president said to the US actor and director as the document was handed over. ""Spasibo bolshoye,"" replied Seagal (thank you very much). The Kremlin released a transcript of their conversation, with Mr Putin saying they had been discussing citizenship for ""quite a while"". Seagal, 64, who has Russian heritage and is a regular visitor to the country, has been a vocal supporter of Mr Putin, who earlier this month signed an order granting his Russian citizenship. In the 1990s the star opened a branch of the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood in Moscow, and has since participated in a number of publicity campaigns for Russian companies. Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reports the actor could acquire a stake in Russian IT company Galaxy. Seagal's fame peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s with films such as Under Siege and Above the Law, but he remains hugely popular in eastern Europe and was granted Serbian citizenship in January. He is not the first celebrity to be awarded citizenship by the Kremlin. French actor Gerard Depardieu got his in 2013, saying at the time he was leaving France to avoid proposed tax increases. US boxer Roy Jones Jr got his Russian passport in 2015, writing on his website later: ""This is the happiest day of my life."" US relations with Russia have been increasingly under the spotlight since Donald Trump was elected. Mr Putin has had a strained relationship with President Barack Obama, but Mr Trump issued warm remarks about the Russian leader during his campaign. After his election, the President-elect and Mr Putin agreed in a phone call to work on what the Kremlin called ""the extremely unsatisfactory state of Russian-US relations at present"". Russian MPs applauded Mr Trump's victory and Mr Putin is reported to be hoping for a deal to relieve Western sanctions on Russia as a result of the annexation of Crimea, which are crippling the economy."
2016-11-26,A radio presenter who says she was raped by British photographer David Hamilton has said his death “will never erase the sleepless nights”. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/british-photographer-david-hamilton-found-dead-says-police-source-10672216,"Hamilton, 83, was found dead in his Paris apartment and is said to have taken his own life. The photographer, who was particularly known for his nude images of teenage girls, had been facing accusations he raped four of his young models. Last week, French radio presenter Flavie Flament said Hamilton had raped her during a photo shoot when she was 13. Reacting to the photographer's death, Ms Flament said: ""The horror of this news will never erase the sleepless nights."" Her book editor, Karina Hocine, added: ""Naturally, we feel horrified and, at the same time, really disgusted that there was not enough time for justice to run its course."" Ms Flament, 42, claimed Hamilton raped her after spotting her at a nudist resort in Cap d'Agde, southwest France, while she was on holiday with her parents in the 1980s. She later told French media that three other women had contacted her with similar allegations. Hamilton denied the claims and announced he intended to file a defamation complaint. Three days before his death, he said: ""I have done nothing improper. ""Clearly the instigator of this media lynching is looking for her 15 minutes of fame by defaming me in her novel."" Hamilton was reportedly in cardiac arrest when he was found by emergency workers at his home in southern Paris on Friday night. Medication was found near his body, a source told the AFP agency."

Last year, after more than a million migrants made their way into Europe, mostly through Turkey, a landmark deal was reached between Ankara and Brussels in March. Turkey would stem the flow of migrants travelling by sea in exchange for a number of incentives, including fast-tracked membership talks, aid for refugees in the country and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. But Turkey's ""disproportionate"" response to the uprising has led the Strasbourg assembly to press for negotiations to be suspended. It has led Mr Erdogan to accuse the bloc of dishonesty and not keeping its side of the bargain. Speaking in the wake of the vote, the Turkish leader said: ""If you go any further, these border gates will be opened. Neither me nor my people will be affected by these empty threats."" He also made specific reference to Turkey's main border crossing with EU member Bulgaria. Mr Erdogan also said money promised had yet to be delivered. Since the thwarted coup, blamed on a network of followers of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, Turkey has engaged in an unprecedented crackdown. Tens of thousands of people have been jailed and 120,000 people suspected of links to the cleric have been dismissed or suspended. Turkey has also shut down more than 170 media outlets, detained more than 140 journalists and sacked elected Kurdish mayors and replaced them with government-appointed trustees."

Authorities were alerted when the 34-year-old was able to flag down a motorist on interstate 5 in Yolo County - about 100 miles from her home. The mother of two, from Redding, was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and then reunited with her husband, Keith. Officials said she was ""emotional and quite upset, but elated to be freed"" and they have managed to obtain some information from her but are hoping to get more in the coming days. They said they were searching for two Hispanic women in connection with the abduction. The pair were last seen driving a dark SUV and were believed to be armed with a handgun. ""This investigation is far from over,"" said Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko. Officials said they were not aware of a motive for the kidnapping and Sheriff Bosenko said it was not clear if Mrs Papini knew her abductors. Her husband reported she was missing when he came back from work and discovered she had not picked up their children from daycare. Her mobile phone and headphones were found close to where she was last seen, about a mile from her home. A $100,000 (£80,000) reward had been offered by her family and others for information leading to her being freed. Sheriff Bosenko said police had received more than 400 calls, but added her release was not down to the money."

The Wisconsin Elections Commission said it is ""preparing to move forward with a statewide recount of votes for President of the United States"". The Green Party has been raising money to pay for votes to be recounted in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania; crucial swing states during the election and all won by Donald Trump. Although there is no evidence of election tampering in those states, Ms Stein, who stood as the party's candidate in the election, has cited ""anomalies"" as grounds to mount a challenge in the three so-called Rust Belt states. The deadlines for filing in Pennsylvania and Michigan are Monday and Wednesday of next week. Green Party spokesman George Martin said: ""There's no smoking gun here, but we're saying the American public needs to have it investigated to make sure our votes count. ""We're doing this to ensure the integrity of our system."" Donald Trump won Wisconsin, which was worth 10 electoral college votes, with 1,409,467 popular votes (47.9% of the total). Hillary Clinton came second with 1,382,210 votes (46.9%) and Ms Stein polled 30,980 votes (1.1%). Wisconsin is legally required to recount votes at a candidate's request providing he or she can meet the costs, which election officials estimate to be up to $1m (£800,735). The Green Party has so far raised $5.2m (£4,163,820)."

The serial killer sought his victims on dating websites including Grindr and dumped their bodies within 500m of his flat in Barking, East London. Relatives of the victims cheered and applauded as Mr Justice Openshaw told Port he would never be released. One woman in the public gallery of the courtroom at the Old Bailey in central London called Port a ""scumbag"", while a man shouted: ""I hope you die a long slow death you piece of s***."" Jurors heard Port disposed of his victims' mobile phones, repeatedly lied to police and planted a fake suicide note in the hand of one of his victims that accepted blame for the death of another. The deaths of the four men - over a period of 15 months - bore striking similarities but police failed to make the link until relatives of his final victim demanded answers. Two of the victims' bodies were discovered near a churchyard - by the same dog walker. :: Police officers investigated over failings in Stephen Port case Port used GHB, a sedative known as a date rape drug, spiking their drinks or injecting it into his victims before they realised what he was doing. They died of a fatal overdose. Eight others survived. The judge told Port he had carried out the killings to ""satisfy his lust"" and described his attempts to cover up two of his murders as ""wicked and monstrous"". He was found guilty of the killings following a trial, and also convicted of a string of sex offences including rape and sexual assault. In mitigation, David Etheridge QC said his client's life ""descended into a vortex"" of drug taking and sexual fulfillment. ""He graduated from a fetish to a fixation, from a fixation to a compulsion,"" he said. In statements ahead of the sentencing, relatives of the victims told of their ""devastated and broken"" families and how their lives had been turned ""upside down"" by Port's murderous sexual obsession. Outside court, Mr Taylor's sister, Donna, said the family ""finally have justice for Jack"", adding that ""sick and twisted"" Port ""will never be able to hurt or destroy any other family's life"". Detective Chief Inspector Tim Duffield said Port was ""one of the most dangerous individuals"" he had encountered in almost 28 years of policing, and the whole life term was ""the only appropriate punishment"". A total of 17 police officers are being investigated over their handling of the case, seven of whom could face the sack if found to be guilty of gross misconduct. The Met is also re-examining 58 unexplained deaths in recent years involving the drug GHB."
2016-11-26,At least four police forces are now looking into allegations of historical sexual abuse in football.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/multiple-football-sex-abusers-reported-to-police-10671417,"Cheshire Police said claims had been made against ""more than one individual"" and it was receiving a growing number of disclosures, some via the NSPCC. Officers are contacting individuals who have come forward with claims. Hampshire Police released a statement saying it was ""investigating allegations of non-recent child abuse within the football community"". Northumbria Police is investigating a claim that a former Newcastle United player was abused while in the club's youth training scheme. And the Metropolitan Police said it will assess information it received relating to non-recent alleged sexual abuse in football clubs in London. The national inquiry into child sexual abuse said it was closely monitoring the allegations and ""its terms of reference are broad enough to include failures by sports clubs in due course"". The Premier League said in a statement: ""The Premier League is very concerned by allegations of historic abuse at football clubs and offers sympathy and support to the brave individuals who have come forward. ""Should anyone have information which can assist with these or other allegations we would urge them to contact the relevant authorities. The FA has introduced a dedicated hotline, staffed by NSPCC professionals, which is available 24 hours a day on 0800 023 2642."" Former Tottenham and England midfielder Paul Stewart told Sky News he was convinced he had to put up with sexual abuse as a young boy if he wanted to achieve his dream of becoming a pro. The 52-year-old revealed this week he had been assaulted by a coach for four years between the ages of 11 and 15. Speaking to Sky News, he revealed his attacker threatened to kill his parents and two brothers if he spoke about the abuse. He said: ""I knew it wasn't right, and it's such a long time ago to remember everything and obviously I'm struggling now to remember everything that happened. ""But from then on he systematically groomed me, and befriended my parents with a view to eventually the abuse getting worse and worse and him manoeuvring his way to see me every day almost. ""When you're young and you want to become a footballer, which is all I ever wanted to do, and you are told that these are the things you need to do, and that if you say anything (the abuser) will kill your parents and your two brothers, then it's very difficult not to believe at that age that that will be carried through. ""That's when it becomes difficult because they ingratiate themselves to your family, whilst behind the scenes they are abusing you sexually."" Mr Stewart, who also played for Liverpool, Blackpool and Manchester City, said he knew of two others who were abused by the same coach. And he said the impact of the abuse has had a lasting effect on his life. He said: ""I got into drugs and became addicted to drugs, I turned to drink on many occasions, and I'd been unable to show any sort of emotion to my children, to my wife, in the form of saying 'I love you' or putting my arms around them. ""It's been very difficult over the 41 years, but they seem to have accepted that's Dad and that's the way Dad is. I feel so guilty for them having to suffer and endure my problems over the years that we've been together."" It comes as a number of former players or youth trainees have come forward to report they were the victims of sexual abuse. Andy Woodward, Steve Walters and David White have said they were assaulted by former youth coach and scout Barry Bennell, who was jailed on three separate occasions for abusing young boys. England captain Wayne Rooney has urged players who have been sexually abused to call a new helpline so they no longer ""suffer in silence"". Praising the bravery of those who have come forward, he said: ""It's awful that some of my colleagues have suffered this way while playing the sport that I and they love. ""Andy (Woodward) has been really brave to come forward and I would encourage anyone who has or is suffering from abuse to call the NSPCC's new football helpline."" In the first two hours after the NSPCC helpline was set up, more than 50 calls were received. On Friday, two more men spoke about the abuse they suffered at the hands of Bennell while playing for youth teams in the North West. Chris Unsworth, 44, said he was raped ""between 50 and 100 times"" by the coach while a youth player at Manchester City and then Crewe when he was about 12. He told the BBC: ""I knew where I wanted to get and I thought this was obviously what I had to go through. ""I think members of the club, they knew what was going on, maybe just swept it under the carpet ... senior players, senior management."" Jason Dunford also waived his right to anonymity and said he was abused by Bennell at a Butlins holiday camp. He said the coach attempted to touch him while he was in bed, and said that Bennell subjected him to mind games after he told him to ""get off"", eventually driving him out of the game. He told the BBC: ""That stare was one I can never, ever forget. From that day on I knew my life was going to be very, very difficult with that guy. ""I had a dream of being a footballer, every child who has a dream should be able to try and achieve that dream without being the victim of sexual abuse or being around sexual predators."" In 1998, Bennell received a nine-year sentence after admitting 23 charges of sexual offences, including buggery, against six boys aged nine to 15. He had been arrested when he was deported following a four-year prison sentence in Florida for raping and indecently assaulting a 13-year-old British boy on a football tour. Bennell was convicted for a third time for sexual abuse in 2015 and received a two-year sentence. He is reported to have been released on licence."

""They (the abusers) just seem to be faceless cowards and they should be answerable to legislation."" Dr Carneiro was publicly scorned by Mourinho, the then Chelsea manager, over her intervention in a match on the opening day of the 2015 Premier League season. Soon after the incident, Dr Carneiro left Stamford Bridge and launched legal action at a tribunal, accusing her former boss of victimisation and discrimination. In July she settled with the club and Mourinho out of court, and Chelsea apologised ""unreservedly"" for the distress caused. The medic, who now works at her own clinic on Harley Street in London, also told the newspaper she believes the issue of sexism in football is going unchecked. ""I think sexism is the least challenged form of discrimination. Anti-Semitic and other racist comments are widely condemned and I don't think that is the case (with sexism) and it begs the question what that leaves room for behind the scenes. ""It is widely accepted that football has a discrimination problem. I really do feel that way, but I think it is the least challenged form of discrimination."""
2016-11-26,Every Premier League football team will display a giant rainbow flag at the start of their games this weekend in a show of support for gay fans and players.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/premier-league-backs-lgbt-rainbow-laces-campaign-10672310,"The 'Rainbow Laces' campaign was launched by Stonewall, the LGBT equality charity, and this year they have seen the biggest show of support yet, with the Premier League, Football Association, English Football League, Premiership Rugby and Rugby Football Union all helping to raise awareness. It follows research by Stonewall that found the majority of football fans had witnessed homophobic chanting at a match. The charity's chief executive, Ruth Hall, told Sky News: ""We know that seven in 10 fans hear homophobia on the terraces but reassuringly two-thirds want it gone, so that's a big boost for us.  ""I think if we thought that seven in 10 were hearing it and that it was ok then we'd have a bigger challenge, but people are beginning to understand that this is not ok. ""It's not an ok part of football culture."" This year, several clubs have faced investigations after alleged homophobic abuse from fans against other supporters or players. It is thought that intolerance is one of the main reasons why professional footballers have felt unable to come out as gay. In 1990, Justin Fashanu became the first openly gay professional player.  Eight years later he committed suicide and since then no other male footballer has come out while playing in England.  Amal Fashanu, Justin's niece, now campaigns on the issue and doesn't believe a footballer will come out in her lifetime.  She said: ""To get to that normality there have to be so many different stages. ""It's going to take a while and unfortunately I'm not sure that I would be alive to see [a gay player] and no news about it."" FA chairman Greg Clarke recently told MPs on the Home Affairs select committee he felt ashamed that players don't feel safe to talk openly about their sexuality.  Asked what would happen if a Premier League player came out, Mr Clarke said: ""There would be significant abuse because we haven't cracked the problem."""

Mr Kenny said: ""I think it will be impossible to do the negotiations within the contemplated two-year period.

He suggested some ministers might be in the process of discovering that ""it's more detailed and [includes more] unforeseen issues than people might have imagined"". :: Tony Blair says Britain's EU exit can be stopped Devolved leaders at the summit also challenged Theresa May about why she stayed away from the gathering. Top of the agenda was how the UK could retain access to the European Single Market if it denies freedom of movement to EU citizens. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness agreed that the PM should have attended.

2016-11-26,"David Cameron's triple-lock guarantee to pensioners has ""served its purpose"" and should be scrapped or at least modified, Tory MP Stephen Crabb has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/stephen-crabb-time-to-scrap-triple-lock-pension-pledge-10672278,"The former work and pensions secretary, who withdrew from the Tory leadership race earlier this year, told Sky News he felt there was both a moral and fiscal case to look again at the former prime minister's promise to raise the state pension by at least 2.5% each year. ""It is morally the right thing now to look at whether we can achieve a fairer spread of welfare spending so that working-age families, younger people, also get a fair crack at society,"" he said. Mr Crabb says one option would be to lower the floor on the triple-lock to 1.5% in order to shave billions off the welfare budget. Any attempts to change pensioner benefits will be met with fierce resistance in the House of Commons as well as with politically powerful ""grey vote"", which is why Mr Cameron protected pensioners from the austerity cuts. But the spike in pension costs over the next decade is forcing a re-think. :: Sky Views: Got a pension? Save while you can Philip Hammond last week raised the prospect of the triple-lock being axed after 2020 on the back of a predicted £20bn increase in the pension bill over the next parliament as the number of pensioners soars. Mr Crabb acknowledged there were ""political challenges around changing anything to do with the triple-lock"" but said it should be debated due to the ""spending challenge"" arising from the pension time bomb. ::Scrap the triple-lock on state pensions, say MPs The triple-lock on the state pensions is a guarantee to annually increase the amount paid to pensioners by 2.5%, or in line with inflation or wage growth - whichever is the highest. Last year the policy cost £6bn, according to the Government Actuary's Department. Mr Crabb said: ""What we need to spend the next three years doing is explaining very carefully what the fiscal impacts, the spending challenge will be arising from continuing with the triple lock throughout the next parliament and seeing whether actually we can achieve some kind of consensus in society about changing it. ""You can keep a triple-lock, perhaps changing that 2.5% to perhaps 1.5% that would achieve some fairer savings."" David Finch, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, told Sky News that such a change could deliver significant savings in the long-term. He said: ""The triple-lock is expected to cost an extra 1% of GDP by 2060, which today would be an extra £20bn of spend [per year]. ""A 1.5% floor in the triple-lock has been estimated to reduce the long run cost by around a third - which today would be a £7bn saving."" :: Sky Views: Pensioner perks have no place in Theresa May's Britain Other prominent figures calling for the triple-lock to be scrapped include Iain Duncan Smith, another former welfare secretary, and Lord Willetts, who said the pain of cuts should be shared out ""fairly and evenly"". He told Sky News: ""We've got to offer a fair deal to younger people and we shouldn't be seeing increases in pensions so generous that they have a knock on effect on what can be afforded for younger people. ""I hope older people themselves will want to see a better deal for their children and grandchildren and will want to see an equitable increase in wages for all people regardless their ages. ""[We] can't have an indefinite situation where pensioners' incomes are shooting up and younger peoples' are falling."" Since 2008, the real median income for the over-60s has risen by 11% while 22 to 30-year-olds are 7% worse off, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. The total cost of the state pension will rise from £101bn in 2015/16 to £128bn in 2025/6."

A number of roads in the city centre were blocked by the fleet of fire engines sent to tackle the flames. Due to falling debris, firefighters were initially forced to keep back from the multi-storey commercial building, which was left severely damaged. Crews and dogs searched the building once the fire was under control, amid fears homeless people were sleeping inside. The blaze was contained by around 6am. But Portland Street, Princess Street and Faulkner Street remained closed. Speaking from the scene, fire service spokesman Paul Etches said: ""It is very, very unsafe in there at the moment and very difficult for crews to get in and work in and around. ""We have still got pockets of fire and quite a large area of the building has suffered quite a serious partial collapse. ""The roof has burnt through and it is very, very difficult to search the second and third floors of the building."" He said it was too early to determine the age or sex of the victims. Asked to comment on rumours that the bodies were those of rough sleepers, he said: ""We have heard the same but at this time there is nothing, no intelligence, we have found. It is too early to tell."" Chief Inspector Gareth Parkin said: ""These are tragic circumstances and we working to identify the people who were found in the building.  ""A joint investigation with the fire service is in its early stages and we will be carrying out a number of enquiries to establish how this fire started.  ""I would appeal to anyone with any information about this incident to please call us.""  Information can be passed on to police by calling 101 and quoting incident number 146 of 25 November 2016 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

2016-11-26,"Not just unlikely, nor merely undesirable, but ""impossible"" says Britain's closest ally about the desire to negotiate a full exit deal from the EU within the two-year time frame.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/irish-pms-tough-talk-reveals-candid-realities-of-brexit-10671954,"It was an unexpectedly strong intervention from Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, speaking to me on Sky News on the margins of the British Irish Council near Cardiff. But it goes to the heart of the current shadow boxing over Article 50 between the UK Government and officials of the EU and its member states. ""It will be impossible to do all the negotiations in the contemplated two-year period, that is why there is a growing feeling in Europe that there should be a transition period,"" the Taoiseach told me. Sky News revealed on Thursday that a transition period is currently central to the European Union's strategy for Brexit talks. It is the second of three tiers, including firstly the so-called ""divorce deal"", and lastly a final status trade deal. EU officials believe the first two pillars need to be finished before the final deal, refusing UK officials' position that the final deal can be negotiated in parallel with the Article 50 process. Mr Kenny would not be drawn on the timescale for a transition deal, but privately Irish ministers have suggested three to five years to sort out the libraries of EU laws and trade arrangements into a new UK-EU deal. :: The steps ahead on the road to Brexit Asked about a transition deal, Mr Kenny replied: ""I think there's Inevitability abut this to be honest. In 50 years nobody has left the EU, this is the first time. ""It's more detailed and [includes more] unforeseen issues than people might have imagined. ""So I would expect to see the 'divorce', as it's called, take place and there be a transition period and a new relationship founded between the UK and the EU - and that transition might take longer than people expect."" Some EU capitals do not rule out a transition of up to a decade. Ireland's situation is recognised as unique, with the importance to the Republic of its land border and Common Travel Area shared with the UK. The Irish PM and Theresa May have already agreed that there should be no return to a ""hard border"". It seems difficult to reconcile how this will work with a UK immediately leaving the EU customs union. Mr Kenny said he did not want the UK to leave: ""The customs union is a matter for the British Government ... I don't want to see a situation where the Brexit discussions become even more complicated by Britain leaving the customs union and having imposition of tariffs at ports on goods, which will mean inconvenience, delays and time wasting, extra costs and job losses."" Mr Kenny said the EU 27 were negotiating as one behind ""no notification [of Article 50], no negotiation"", and that full access to the single market must mean the operation of the ""four freedoms"", including movement. ""That's a very red line issue,"" said the Taoiseach. Mr Kenny said there would be a meeting of the EU 27 on the sidelines of next month's EU summit to ""focus on the structure and strategy of any negotiations"" that might follow in the new year. Ireland will do everything to protect trade, the peace process and the common travel area, he said. He also confirmed there has been a ""spike"" in Britons applying for Irish citizenship. ""It doesn't surprise me that people reflecting on the as yet unknown outcome from Brexit will say, 'I'm entitled to apply for an Irish passport and that's what I'm going to do'."" The uncertainty remains. But some of the contours of the Brexit process are now being revealed thanks to some candid realities from Britain's closest neighbours."
2016-11-26,"The Metropolitan Police is putting children at risk because of ""serious errors"" in its response to child sex abuse, inspectors have found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/met-police-failings-put-children-at-risk-of-sex-abuse-report-finds-10670963,"HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) found that 75% of the 374 cases it reviewed were handled ""inadequately"" or ""required improvement"". It said the Met's handling of child abuse and sex exploitation cases were inconsistent and lacked leadership. The report comes two weeks after an independent review found Scotland Yard made ""numerous errors"" in the investigation into high-profile paedophiles. HM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said: ""We found serious errors of judgement, inconsistency, unacceptable delays and a lack of leadership which meant that children are not being protected properly."" In one case, a 14-year-old girl told the force she had been given alcohol and cigarettes before being sexually assaulted by a 30-year-old man she met online. An officer was not assigned to the investigation until 17 days later, during which time the man continued to message the teenager. HMIC said this put her at risk, while the Met rated its handling as ""good"". The report found there was a backlog of visits to registered sex offenders and that the Met's IT systems for storing information on those at risk of abuse was ""fragmentary"". HMIC said the force was the first it had inspected that did not have a dedicated chief officer responsible for child protection. Mr Parr added: ""This absence of oversight of this crucial area is unacceptable and exacerbates the inconsistency we found in dealing with child protection. ""Far too many of the cases we looked at fell well short of expected standards and meant that victims weren't protected, evidence was lost and offenders continued to pose a risk to children."" HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Thomas Winsor, said the report brought to light ""inexcusably poor practice"". The Met said it aims to provide the best possible protection to children but was ""sorry that this has not always been the case, especially to the children involved in the examples highlighted in this report"". It added that since the inspection it has revisited all the cases examined and ""identified no further harm to children"". HMIC has made a series of recommendations, including London-wide oversight of child protection. Answering an urgent question about the findings in the Commons, policing minister Brandon Lewis said: ""We have to be unequivocally clear about this - this is the most damning report the HMIC has ever written about any inspection it has done on any police force in the country."" He described the findings of the inspection as ""extremely concerning"". Mr Lewis added: ""It is simply shocking to hear that the Metropolitan Police had to be prompted to take action on cases even after serious issues had been identified, which meant that a child could be at risk."""
2016-11-26,Tony Blair has suggested the public could stop the process of leaving the European Union if they disagree with the terms.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161126143429/http://news.sky.com/story/former-pm-tony-blair-says-britains-eu-exit-can-be-stopped-10670991,"Sir John Major has also backed the idea of a second referendum before Britain leaves, in order to give the public a say on the deal struck by the Government and EU countries. Both former prime ministers campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, and fear Theresa May's Government will withdraw Britain from much of the single market in a so-called ""hard Brexit"". In a magazine interview, Mr Blair said: ""It can be stopped if the British people decide that, having seen what it means, the pain-gain cost-benefit analysis doesn't stack up... :: Brexit: Has Britain left the EU yet? ""When I say, 'Well, let's just keep our options open', it's condemned as treason. Why wouldn't you keep your options open? ""Why wouldn't you say, 'We took this decision, we took it before we saw what its consequences are; now we see its consequences, we're not so sure?'"" Mr Blair, speaking to the New Statesman, said the single market would be the key issue in the negotiations, and that securing maximum access would mean accepting fewer restrictions on immigration, paying into the EU budget and accepting the jurisdiction of European judges. But he claimed voters - including those who backed Leave on 23 June - may opt for that if ""the economic pain may be very great"" for up to a decade. Voting to leave was ""like agreeing to a house swap without having seen the other house"", he said. ""In the end for a larger number of the people, even those who voted Leave, they will look at this in a practical way, not an ideological way … I think, in the end, it's going to be about Parliament and the country scrutinising the deal."" Sir John, who was speaking at an event at the National Liberal Club on Wednesday night, risked a backlash from eurosceptic Tories by expressing concerns that Brexit terms were being dictated by the ""tyranny of the majority"" - and that the 48% of people who voted to stay were getting ""no say"". The former Conservative leader said he accepted the UK would no longer remain a full member of the EU, but hoped the Brexit deal would enable the country to stay as close as possible to the other 27 members and the single market, The Times reported. He also said Parliament must have a say on the final deal and decide whether the public will have a second referendum, but said he thought there was a ""perfectly credible case"" for holding one. Ministers are hoping to overturn a High Court decision that MPs must vote before Britain can trigger the process for leaving the EU, which Mrs May hopes to do at the end of March. The Government's appeal will be heard at the Supreme Court in two weeks. Mr Blair and Sir John joined forces during the referendum campaign, visiting Belfast to warn that a vote to leave the EU would ""jeopardise the unity"" of the UK by reopening the Scottish independence question and undermining stability in Northern Ireland. The former Labour prime minister is winding up his private companies and is reported to be looking to set up an institute in Westminster. He suggested in the interview that he was looking to re-enter public life to mobilise ""millions of politically homeless people"" in the ""progressive centre"" not supporting the Conservatives or Labour. Leave.EU spokesman Tom Brooke said: ""It was undeniably clear to voters at the time of the referendum that a vote to leave was a vote to leave the single market and for greater control over immigration. ""This is what the people voted for and must be a red line in any negotiation. ""Major talks about the tyranny of the majority, but we cannot envisage anything more tyrannical than our out-of-touch political elite delaying and blocking Brexit before eventually watering down the deal to look nothing like the deal Britain voted for."""
