2016-07-03,Michael Gove has made a pitch for the Conservative party leadership outlining why he could not recommend his fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720186/no-charisma-gove-makes-leadership-pitch,"Michael Gove has made a pitch for the Conservative party leadership outlining why he could not recommend his fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson. Mr Gove said he admired the former London Mayor, but had come to the conclusion that he was ""not the right person"" for the job. Shortly before he made the speech, Mr Johnson hit back at hecklers who called him a ""disgrace"" outside his home. One demonstrator walked alongside him telling him: ""You don't have the guts to sort it out."" Mr Johnson replied: ""Rubbish - nonsense."" The Brexiteer was then asked by a journalist: ""Do you feel betrayed by Mr Gove?"" He replied: ""I can't get on with what I wanted to do, so it will have to be someone else."" Mr Gove by the Leave bus with a slogan pledging millions to the NHS Mr Gove's leadership bid sent shockwaves through the Tory party as it came shortly after he was appointed Mr Johnson's campaign manager. This morning, he officially launched his campaign in Westminster, acknowledging he lacked charisma, but was still passionate. He said: ""In the wake of the referendum, the Prime Minister chose to stand down and we have had to think about who is best placed to lead us now. ""I knew we needed a leader who both believed in this new path and who could build and lead a united team to guide us through the challenges ahead. ""I believed that Boris Johnson - who had campaigned alongside me with such energy and enthusiasm - could build and lead that team. ""I wanted that plan to work. I worked night and day for it. ""But I came to realise this week that, for all Boris's formidable talents, he was not the right person for the task. ""I am running in this leadership contest for one reason - and one reason alone. ""I want this country I love - and which has given me so much - to embrace this opportunity for change with optimism and conviction. ""I never thought I'd ever be in this position. ""I did not want it, indeed I did almost everything not be a candidate for the leadership of this party. ""I was so very reluctant because I know my limitations. ""Whatever charisma is I don't have it, whatever glamour may be I don't think anyone could ever associate me with it."" He made a clear attempt to draw contrasts with his main rival Theresa May, who has portrayed herself as someone who could ""get the job done"". Mr Gove said the challenges facing Britain required ""not just a cool head, but a heart burning with the desire for change"". The Justice Secretary said he stood by all of the promises made by Vote Leave during the referendum contest. ""I will ensure we honour the instructions the British people have given us,"" he said. ""I argued for specific changes in the referendum campaign, I believe in them, I will deliver them. ""The promise to leave the European Union, end the supremacy of EU law and take back control of our democracy. ""With my leadership, it will be delivered. ""The promise to take back control of our borders. ""I will end free movement, introduce an Australian-style points-based system for immigration, and bring numbers down. ""With my leadership, it will be delivered. ""The promise to use the money we currently send to Brussels and invest it instead on the priorities of the British people - principally in the NHS - and to cut VAT on domestic fuel. ""With my leadership, it will be delivered."" He said he was committed to giving the NHS at least another £100m per week by 2020.   That figure falls some way short of the £350m pledge on some Leave posters ahead of the referendum. The poster slogan read: ""Let's give our NHS the £350 million the EU takes every week."" A similar message was emblazoned on the camp's bus: ""We send the EU £350 million a week - let's fund our NHS instead."" Elsewhere, Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to French president Francois Hollande in the wake of the referendum vote. A Downing Street spokesman said the pair agreed to ""continue working closely together to protect our shared border in Calais"". Mr Cameron also expressed his wish to have the closest possible relations with the EU, post Brexit."
2016-07-03,"Of all George Osborne's economic policies, few have been as symbolic, as controversial and as firmly-held as the promise that formed the centrepiece of the 2015 Conservative manifesto.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720322/after-the-brexit-vote-what-next-for-austerity,"Of all George Osborne's economic policies, few have been as symbolic, as controversial and as firmly-held as the promise that formed the centrepiece of the 2015 Conservative manifesto. The Chancellor pledged that by the end of the Parliament, perhaps earlier, he would eliminate the deficits which have become a perennial part of the public finances since the turn of the millennium. The surplus rule was as divisive as it was eye-catching. Economists questioned whether it was either realistic or sensible. They questioned whether imposing extra austerity on an economy which was still recovering from the post-crisis squeeze really made any sense. They questioned whether a future economic shock might render it pointless. Well, in the event the last of those has come to pass. On Friday the Chancellor admitted that one of the economic consequences of Brexit is that hitting a surplus by 2019/20 or even 2020/21 looks unlikely. A brief look at the economic outlook might help explain why: growth is likely to slow in the coming months and years; weaker growth means weaker tax revenues and those in turn make it even more difficult for the Chancellor to hit the target. Frankly, according to most economists, the Chancellor would have been lucky to hit the surplus target anyway. The economy was already weakening before Brexit; the structural deficit (in other words, the deficit adjusted for the state of economic growth) is still high, and already the Office for Budget Responsibility's most recent forecasts are looking quite unrealistic. While it is tempting to conclude that this moment marks yet another set of fiscal rules being ditched, that's not quite right. When you look at the small print, there is a get-out clause in the Chancellor's surplus target, that allows him to suspend it while the economy is weak (which means growth rates of 1% or lower). If the Treasury and the Bank are to be believed, weak growth is now a near certainty, so that clause will probably be activated. Then again, it is quite plausible, perhaps probable, that the rules may be ditched altogether within a few months. After all, there will soon be a new Conservative leader, who is quite likely to want a new Chancellor. Theresa May has already mooted ditching the surplus target. Does this mean the end of austerity? Yes and no. On the one hand, the government may have to borrow more in the coming years. On the other, the borrowing is in part a function of the weakness of the economy, rather than being a sign of a sudden discretionary splurge."
2016-07-03,A former landscape gardener who raped and murdered 15-year-old Kayleigh Haywood after holding her prisoner has been jailed for life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720353/kayleigh-haywood-killer-sentenced-to-life,"A former landscape gardener who raped and murdered 15-year-old Kayleigh Haywood after holding her prisoner has been jailed for life. Stephen Beadman killed Kayleigh after she was groomed online and lured to the home of his neighbour Luke Harlow. Beadman will serve a minimum of 35 years for rape, false imprisonment and murder. Mrs Justice Cox, sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court, told Beadman: ""The pain, terror and anguish that would have been suffered by this young girl is truly horrifying to contemplate."" Harlow, 28, was sentenced to 12 years for falsely imprisoning and grooming Kayleigh. Beadman admitted murder and rape but denied holding Kayleigh prisoner He sexually abused Kayleigh after tricking her into going to his house without her parents' knowledge. He then invited in Beadman, the judge said, and they kept her captive for over five hours. They were both found guilty earlier this week of falsely imprisoning the 15-year-old in the hours before she was killed on 15 November. Mrs Justice Cox told the pair: ""The case has shown once again the dangers to which young users of social media are exposed, to the grief and bewilderment of unsuspecting parents."" Harlow, who labelled himself a ""professional serial killer"" on Twitter, pleaded guilty to grooming and engaging in sexual activity with Kayleigh. He also admitted attempting to meet two other teenagers after grooming them online, sending messages the judge described as ""chilling"". Beadman, 29, admitted murder and rape but denied holding the schoolgirl prisoner before attacking her after she fled Harlow's house. Kayleigh was seen pinned to the ground by Beadman in the early hours of 15 November outside Harlow's house in Ibstock, Leicestershire. Harlow also admitted attempting to meet two other teenagers She was then marched barefoot to a forest park. Beadman told police he had used a brick as a weapon, and searched online for ""lime pit"" after killing Kayleigh, from Measham. Her body was found three days later, hidden in a hedge near a stream, after an extensive police search. There were so many serious injuries to Kayleigh's face that she had to be identified through dental records, the judge told the court. Kayleigh's parents said: ""We cannot begin to find the words to describe how we feel or how we continue to get through each minute of every day."" In a statement released after Beadman and Harlow were found guilty of false imprisonment, Kayleigh's mother said: ""We are all heartbroken and devastated, our hearts have been torn apart. ""We ask ourselves every day, why? Why Kayleigh? Why did this happen to our beautiful daughter?"""
2016-07-03,"Jeremy Corbyn is likely to face a leadership challenge in ""the next few days"", shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720178/corbyn-faces-challenge-in-next-few-days,"Jeremy Corbyn is likely to face a leadership challenge in ""the next few days"", shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. Mr McDonnell, a staunch ally, appealed to Labour MPs to ""calm down"" and settle the party's differences through a democratic process. Answering questions in London, he said Mr Corbyn is ""staying as the leader of the Labour Party"" and if there was a contest he could win. Mr McDonnell was speaking after setting out the party's economic response to the Brexit vote. He said: ""The internal difficulties within both parties will be resolved, hopefully by democratic means, and on that basis, amicably, the Labour Party will come back together. ""If there is to be a leadership challenge to Jeremy Corbyn, let's bring that forward, use the democratic process and then our party members will decide who is the leader and the future direction of our party."" He continued: ""At the moment, Jeremy is leader of the Labour Party, elected with the largest mandate any political leader had from his political party only nine months ago. ""If there is to be a challenge to Jeremy Corbyn, in terms of a leadership contest, that will emerge, I suspect, over the next few days. ""If that is the case, my message to all Labour MPs now is just 'calm down', let's do our job. It isn't just our party members who need us to do our job, it is the country that need us to do our job."" :: Tears And Shock On Labour's Day Of Farce Mr Corbyn, who has been accused of not campaigning hard enough to stay in the EU, has vowed to stay on despite a mass revolt by his MPs. Former shadow business secretary Angela Eagle is expected to mount a challenge to him, with ex-shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith also reported to be considering a bid. In the last week around 60,000 people have joined Labour with the prospect of taking part in a leadership election. However, it is not clear if this will benefit Mr Corbyn, who was swept into the leader's office on the back of a grassroots movement last year. Scores of frontbenchers have quit in recent days and he has struggled to fill the vacancies after 172 of his MPs backed a no confidence motion in his leadership. :: Blair: Nation In Peril Must Show Statesmanship Angela Rayner MP, who was on Monday appointed shadow minister for women and equalities, has now been promoted to shadow education secretary, replacing Pat Glass who resigned earlier this week. Mr McDonnell called on the rebels to return to the fold, adding: ""Wouldn't it all be better if people... worked with us?""   Earlier, it emerged Labour has apologised to the Israeli ambassador for any offence caused by comments made by Mr Corbyn at the launch of a report into anti-Semitism in the party. Mr Corbyn was forced to deny drawing a parallel between Israel and Islamic State after saying that Jews were ""no more responsible for the actions of Israel"" than Muslims were for the ""various self-styled Islamic states or organisations"". A spokesman for ambassador Mark Regev said shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry had made an ""unequivocal apology"" for the remark, which he denounced as ""unacceptable"". The launch was overshadowed by a row involving Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who stormed out after one of Mr Corbyn's grassroots supporters launched a verbal assault on her during a question and answer session."
2016-07-03,"Detectives are appealing for the public's help to trace a violent registered sex offender over a series of alleged attacks ranging from assaults to indecent exposure, and racist abuse.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720516/hunt-for-sex-offender-after-spray-paint-attack,"Detectives are appealing for the public's help to trace a violent registered sex offender over a series of alleged attacks ranging from assaults to indecent exposure, and racist abuse. Vitalij Kovaliov, 35, escaped a mental health unit in Hammersmith, west London, while on escorted leave. He was last seen heading towards the Chiswick area on 24 June at around 4.30pm. Police said they are trying to track down Kovaliov in connection with eight alleged attacks over a four-day period. On 28 June at 12.20pm, a 25-year-old woman in west London was waiting for a parcel delivery when a man spray-painted her hair red before fleeing. Police were alerted about a man who had wandered into the middle of Cranbrook Road, Chiswick, and exposed himself at 12.39pm on the same day. A 19-year-old man reported that he was punched in the face in the same street at 1pm by a man who then fled. Then a 32-year-old man told police at 1.30pm that he was punched in the back in Chiswick High Road by a male suspect who then ran off. A 27-year-old black woman said she had been racially abused by a man in Essex Place at 2pm who then threw a plastic bottle in her face before fleeing.  Just 30 minutes later officers were told of a suspect who had sprayed graffiti on a van in Chiswick High Road. On 29 June, an eight-year-old boy was assaulted after his mother opened the door to a man she thought was a delivery driver at around 6am. He received minor cuts to his face and was treated in hospital. Later at 7.40pm, a man was walking out of Brentford Fountain Leisure Centre when a man knocked a box of fruit he was carrying out of his hand. The suspect then picked the fruit up and threw it at the victim before fleeing. The offences have been linked by locality, nature of the incident and description of the individual involved by detectives from Hammersmith and Fulham and Hounslow who are working together on the spate of attacks. Police said Kovaliov should not be approached if seen - but members of the public should immediately contact police via 999. Anyone with information as to the whereabouts of Vitalij is asked to contact police via 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.  Kovaliov is described as white, between 5ft 11ins and 6ft 1in tall and of a medium build."
2016-07-03,Twenty people have been killed after gunmen took dozens of hostages during a 10-hour siege at a restaurant in Bangladesh's capital.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720416/dhaka-restaurant-siege-20-people-killed,"Twenty people have been killed after gunmen took dozens of hostages during a 10-hour siege at a restaurant in Bangladesh's capital. ""Most of (the hostages) were killed mercilessly by sharp weapons,"" Army Brigadier General Nayeem Ashfaq Chowdhury said.  Another army officer, Lieutenant Shahab Uddin, told the AFP news agency: ""All 20 of the hostages who were killed were foreigners."" Among the dead were nine Italians, seven Japanese, three Bangladeshis, one American and one Indian national. It is thought that eight or nine attackers stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka's diplomatic zone late on Friday.   The cafe is located in the Gulshan area of Dhaka One kitchen staffer said the attackers were armed with guns and bombs, entering the building at around 9.20pm local time as foreigners and locals dined out during the Ramadan holy month. Initially firing blanks, they ordered staff to switch off the lights before draping black cloths over security cameras, according to a survivor who spoke with local news channel ATN. Gallery: Dhaka Restaurant Siege: 20 People Killed The Holey Artisan Bakery is in Dhaka's diplomatic quarter and was the subject of a 10-hour hostage crisis after gunmen stormed the building He and others managed to escape by running to the rooftop or out of the back door. For those remaining inside, however, their fate depended on whether they could prove themselves to be Muslims, according to the father of a Bangladeshi who was rescued with his family. Rezaul Karim said: ""The gunmen asked everyone inside to recite from the Koran. ""Those who recited were spared. The gunmen even gave them meals last night."" The others, he said, ""were tortured"". A massive firefight erupted outside the cafe, in the Gulshan area of the capital, which saw six gunmen killed. Two police officers also died. Thirteen hostages were rescued, including an Argentinian, two Sri Lankans and two Bangladeshis. Japanese officials have said that one of their citizens was also rescued with a gunshot wound. Of the 26 people injured in the siege, 10 are in critical condition in hospital and six are on life support. Most are police officers but one is a civilian, according to hospital staff. Deputy chief cabinet secretary Koichi Hagiuda said seven other Japanese citizens had been eating together at the restaurant, but officials had been unable to contact them.   Italian media has reported that seven Italians were in the restaurant when the attack began.  Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said one of the militants had been arrested. ""Because of the effort of the joint force, the terrorists could not flee,"" she said.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.   The Amaq news agency, which is affiliated to IS, posted pictures said to show hostages' bodies, but the images' authenticity could not be confirmed.  The restaurant is located near a small hospital as well as the Nordic Club, a private members' club popular with expats. There has been a string of recent attacks on religious minorities and secular activists by suspected Islamist militants in Bangladesh, although that country's government has previously denied IS has a presence there. Earlier on Friday, a Hindu temple worker was hacked to death in southwest Bangladesh by three assailants."
2016-07-03,A minister has responded to an alleged threat to Heathrow Airport on a Twitter feed linked to Islamic State by calling for vigilance.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720514/caution-urged-after-is-threaten-heathrow-attack,"A minister has responded to an alleged threat to Heathrow Airport on a Twitter feed linked to Islamic State by calling for vigilance. Transport minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said that all steps necessary would be taken ""to keep the public safe"". It followed non-governmental counter-terrorism organisation SITE Intelligence Group warning it had become aware of a threat involving ""a device placed in either Heathrow, LAX or JFK airports"". Lord Ahmad said: ""We all need to be vigilant to the global threat of terrorism - in the UK we keep all aspects of aviation security under constant review and work closely with our international partners to mitigate risks. ""We will continue to take all steps necessary to keep the public safe, but for security reasons we do not comment in detail on specific measures or operational matters."" SITE on Friday described the threat as coming from a ""pro-Islamic State Twitter account"". It is reported to have threatened attacks on planes ""flying from Heathrow to the US"" during the 4 July US Independence Day holiday weekend. Heathrow Airport has so far declined to comment on the apparent threat and has referred inquiries to the Department for Transport. Islamic State has claimed it carried out an assault by several attackers on a bakery in Dhaka, Bangladesh, taking a number of foreigners hostage. There are suggestions it is increasingly attempting to strike at targets outside its heartlands of Syria and Iraq as it is under pressure. A convoy of nearly 800 IS vehicles was destroyed from the air on Wednesday and Thursday as it attempted to flee the Iraqi city of Fallujah. Iraqi forces retook full control of Fallujah, 30 miles west of Baghdad, after a vast operation that was launched in May. The strikes further shrink the size of the ""caliphate"" the group proclaimed over large parts of Iraq and Syria two years ago. Iraqi forces are now training their sights on Mosul, IS's de facto Iraqi capital. Meanwhile, on Thursday, the director of the CIA said an attack on Istanbul's main international airport that left dozens of people dead ""bears all the hallmarks"" of IS."

But haven’t we been predicting this for days? Yes. Yes we have. So what is the hold up? :: Corbyn Faces Challenge In 'Next Few Days' Two things are at play. Firstly, with two-thirds of the shadow cabinet resigning, 80% of Labour MPs calling for party leader Mr Corbyn to go and hundreds of councillors doing the same, the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) hope the pressure will simply be too great. They hope that Mr Corbyn will conclude that the game is up, that an effective opposition is impossible and resign of his accord. But secondly the coup plotters need to get the right person to challenge. Should it be Angela Eagle, maybe Owen Smith or even an outsider like Dan Jarvis, they need to win. Those Labour MPs behind the attempts to shift Mr Corbyn know that if they fail, if he wins again, the party may have to spilt because it will be impossible to unite. The stakes are that high. :: Tears And Shock On Labour's Day Of Farce So the majority of the party at Westminster need someone who everyone can back but one who will win over the Labour membership. A membership which is growing, 60,000 in the past week alone and remain, according to recent polls, loyal to the current Labour leader. :: Blair: Nation In Peril Must Show Statesmanship We are expecting an announcement on Monday, possibly after a meeting of the PLP, though things remain fluid I’m told. And rumours still abound that Mr Corbyn may still go, that he privately wants to go, but will wait to react to the long-awaited report by Sir John Chilcot into the 2003 Iraq War and its aftermath. If true, that would mean a wide-ranging campaign with lots of candidates, almost certainly including Mr McDonnell. It has been the most chaotic, divisive and damaging week in Labour’s history and the problem for the party is, it shows no sign of ending."

The 29-year-old pro-Remain American actress was taken to task by the Northamptonshire town's Conservative MP after she ""slagged off"" areas that voted Brexit, as she live tweeted the results. He was particularly upset that in one Twitter post she indicated she had never heard of the town, writing: ""Sorry #Kettering but where are you?"" This was despite it being home to Weetabix breakfast cereal, record FA Cup goalscoring Kettering Town FC and upmarket shoemakers Cheaney and Loake. Philip Hollobone was supported in his call for Lohan to switch on the festive lights in reparation by Tory Commons Leader and fellow Brexit campaigner Chris Grayling. Speaking in Parliament, Mr Grayling joked: ""As those of us who have children will know, over the years Lindsay Lohan - as a star of child and teen movies, a very entertaining actress at the time - hasn't necessarily fulfilled her professional potential and perhaps now we know the reason why. ""Had she visited Kettering she might have seen her career turn around and I think the invitation that you have made to her today is one she should accept, she should visit the fine town of Kettering and find herself returned to stardom."" In response on Twitter, Lohan said: ""Direct message me about your offer. Would be happy to light the Christmas tree in #Kettering."""
2016-07-03,"EasyJet has opened talks with EU member states' aviation regulators about relocating its headquarters from the UK, underlining how the decision to leave the European Union is impacting corporate Britain.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720169/easyjet-opens-talks-over-post-brexit-hq-move,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor EasyJet has opened talks with EU member states' aviation regulators about relocating its headquarters from the UK, underlining how the decision to leave the European Union is impacting corporate Britain. Sky News has learnt that easyJet's chief executive Carolyn McCall has signalled in private meetings this week that moving its legal HQ from the UK is almost inevitable in the wake of last week's referendum result. Details of the move are expected to take months to be ironed out, but sources close to the company said it had already held preliminary talks with a handful of unidentified EU member states about issuing easyJet with an air operator's certificate (AOC) that would enable it to base its HQ there. Some of those member states are said by City sources to be keen on airlines seeking relocation to move the bulk of their operational HQs, which in easyJet's case Ms McCall and her executives would be unwilling to do. :: LIVE: All Aboard The Post-Brexit Rollercoaster One insider said moving the HQ could entail relocating just a handful of staff, depending on the regime operated by the individual country's aviation regulator. It would involve up-ending easyJet's current corporate structure by making its existing UK AOC entity a subsidiary of its newly incorporated legal headquarters. British Airways' parent, International Airlines Group, already operates using a similar structure, while Ryanair could adopt such a model in future. A source said that easyJet had received advice that ""the most workable structure would be to be an EU-registered entity with a UK subsidiary"". EasyJet employs roughly 1,000 people at its Luton base, in functions such as finance, IT and marketing - separate to the staff who work on its operations at the Bedfordshire airport. While those staff would not be relocated, the prospect of easyJet moving its legal HQ reinforces the fact that leaving the EU will have an impact on the corporate structures of some of Britain's biggest companies. Vodafone said last Friday that it was ""too soon"" to determine whether the referendum result would trigger the relocation of its headquarters. Existing rules in the EU mean that there is a single aviation agreement across the bloc, but the UK's continued membership of that is uncertain. Ms McCall told Channel 4 News earlier this week that it ""remains to be seen"" whether the company's HQ would be shifted following Brexit. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the company said: ""EasyJet has been preparing for this eventuality in the lead up to the referendum vote and has been working on a number of options that will allow it to continue flying in all of its markets."" Ms McCall added that she had ""written to the UK Government and the European Commission to ask them to prioritise the UK remaining part of the single EU aviation market"".  In private discussions including with her fellow members of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group, however, Ms McCall has gone significantly further. One person who had been told of her stance said she had concluded that it was ""likely"" that easyJet's HQ would move to the EU. The airline is now expected to review all 27 of the remaining member states before holding further discussions with a number of them about the possible terms of an AOC. A decision is likely later this year. EasyJet declined to comment on Friday."

As dawn broke on 1 July, 1916, there was a momentary silence before the whistles blew and thousands of British and French rose from their secure muddy trenches and climbed over the top to walk slowly towards the enemy's front line. As they stepped into no man's land - riddled with barbed wire and land mines - the peace was broken by the sound of machine guns as the Germans started their deadly slaughter. The battle would last 141 days and see both sides lose 1.2 million brave souls. Senior royals and politicians remember the fallen at the Thiepval Memorial Around 20,000 British troops were killed on the first day of the bloody battle alone, while tens of thousands more were maimed or wounded. It came to symbolise the horror of trench warfare, with the front line barely shifting despite the slaughter of troops on both sides. Gallery: Sacrifice Of Somme Remembered War graves at Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme during Centenary commemorations in Thiepval, France The Prince of Wales and Prime Minister David Cameron joined French president Francois Hollande in remembering those who sacrificed their lives for their country during a ceremony at the Thiepval Memorial on the former battlefield in the Picardy region of France. They were joined by other senior royals including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cornwall. Kate told schoolchildren taking part in the event she was found her visit ""emotional"" and ""very moving"". The Battle of the Somme, a lament, was played by bagpipes as British children laid wreaths at French graves and vice versa. Some 10,000 people were invited and watched the ceremony which included Army personnel and music from military bands. The Duchess of Cornwall later visited the grave of her great uncle, Captain Harry Cubitt, who was the eldest of three sons killed and the only one whose body was found. Has anyone seen WW1 soldiers on their commute this mornin?! #wearehere pic.twitter.com/0zdxc7SLko She said it was an emotional visit and added: ""It is such a long time ago and it made me suddenly realise what it must have been like for my great grandparents, to have three sons within 18 months of one another being killed."" Among the guests in Thiepval was Marianne Palmer-Smith, whose grandfather, George Clifford Sullivan Hayes OBE, was a Surgeon-Major on the Somme and suffered from post-traumatic stress (shell shock) during his remaining years. ""My grandfather had a living death until he died,"" she told Sky News. ""Straight after he went to South Africa and took a post in a hospital, but he lasted a year and then had to come back."" She said of her first visit to Thiepval: ""It is so impressive, so emotional. ""It is a beautiful place to commemorate such a bloody war where so many men showed such bravery and courage. ""We are here to remember them. History must never be repeated."" Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, also attended and said: ""There is too much sorrow, too much loss. ""You have to ask what else can you do but weep? It is just a cause of the deepest possible sorrow. ""In the loss of the individuals there is grief and tragedy in the utmost scale. ""There is a sense that human evil is so great at times, and in certain places, that not only do we find ourselves killing each other but sometimes causes arise where you have to resist evil with force."" At the Lochnagar Crater at La Boiselle - a lasting remnant of the battle - The Last Post was played and people linked hands and scattered poppy petals into its centre. Hundreds of young men in period costume could be seen across the UK handing out cards with the details of a different soldier who died on this day 100 years ago as part of a living memorial project in tribute to victims of the Somme. In Manchester, wreaths were laid at the Cenotaph in St Peter's Square, while images were beamed on to the White Cliffs of Dover to mark the anniversary. Earlier, as the nation fell silent for two minutes at 7.28am, a night-long vigil at Westminster Abbey to remember the deadliest battle in British history came to an end with a gun salute in Parliament Square. During the service, which was also attended by the Queen, prayers were said for the First World War dead and hymns were sung by the congregation which included descendants of the men who fought at the Somme. The World War I battle was seen as a military tragedy for Britain and Commonwealth countries. Mr Cameron has said the 100-year commemoration allows people to ""reflect on the sacrifice not just of the thousands of British and Commonwealth troops who gave their lives, but of the men on all sides who did not return home."""

2016-07-03,Wales have reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016 after coming from behind to beat Belgium 3-1.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720469/wales-in-euro-2016-semi-finals-after-stunning-win,"By Paul Kelso, Sports Correspondent, in Lille Wales have reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016 after coming from behind to beat Belgium 3-1. Goals from Ashley Williams, a sublime effort from Hal Robson-Kanu - a striker who doesn't even have a club after being released by Reading two weeks ago - and substitute Sam Vokes saw them beat the team ranked second in the world. A performance of resolve, quality and composure sets up a semi-final against Portugal in Lyon on Wednesday. The result was greeted with delight among the 10,000 or so Welsh fans inside the stadium, heavily outnumbered by Belgian supporters. Wales were already the only surviving home nation, having outlasted England and eliminating Northern Ireland in the last 16.  Wales had not lost to Belgium in their last three meetings and won their last game, in qualifying for this tournament, so there was little danger of them being intimidated. Belgium's starting 11 had an average age of just 24 but contained a number of familiar and established Premier League players including Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne of Manchester City. Within minutes, Belgium led courtesy of a goal from Radja Nainggolan, and Wales were briefly rocked. Gallery: Euro 2016: Wales Reach Semi-Finals Wales are through the semis of the Euro 2016 after beating Belgium at Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille But they responded by dominating the rest of the half, exploiting indecision in the Belgian defence. Then, on the half-hour, captain Ashley Williams was left unmarked at a corner to head into the net. He raced to the bench to celebrate with the entire squad, scenes that were matched in the corner of the ground containing Wales' supporters. Belgium threatened briefly after half-time, Hazard bending a shot just wide, but on 55 minutes Wales took the lead with a superbly worked goal. Gareth Bale released Aaron Ramsey on the right flank and after drawing two defenders squared to Robson-Kanu, who turned two defenders and placed the ball past Courtois. The game was put beyond reach for Belgium by Vokes' bullet header. My team ❤️ pic.twitter.com/2bwyRS6pmI What a performance, to a man absolute quality. We have the best staff and fans in the world.

2016-07-03,A coroner has told a jury that evidence does not show that the actions of the police or Home Office contributed to the death of schoolgirl Alice Gross.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720412/police-not-at-fault-for-alice-death-coroner,"A coroner has told a jury that evidence does not show that the actions of the police or Home Office contributed to the death of schoolgirl Alice Gross. Dr Fiona Wilcox announced her legal ruling on the fifth day of the hearing into the circumstances surrounding the 14-year-old's death in 2014. She told the jury: ""As a matter of law - and this is extremely important - I am instructing you that the evidence in this case does not support any final conclusions that would imply that any actions or inactions of the Home Office or police caused or contributed to Alice's death, and therefore no such findings may be reached."" Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns - who had served a prison sentence for murdering his wife in his home country - is believed to have killed Alice in a sexually motivated attack. The schoolgirl disappeared after leaving her home in Hanwell, west London, on 28 August 2014. The police search operation was the biggest since the 7/7 attacks Her body was found on 30 September in the River Brent after Scotland Yard conducted its biggest search since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Zalkalns was found hanged in a park on 4 October and police said the 41-year-old would have been charged with Alice's murder if he had been found alive. The girl's father Jose, her sister Nina, and mother Ros Hodgkiss, was in court on Friday as the coroner announced her legal ruling. On the first day of the inquest on Monday, Ms Hodgkiss read a statement to the jury saying the family ""remain stunned"" that Zalkalns was ""not monitored or even known about in any way"" after he came to the UK. Dr Wilcox told the jurors on Friday they had a ""considerable amount of work to do"". After completing her summing up of the evidence, the coroner sent the jury out to begin its deliberations. The jury, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, will continue its deliberations on Monday morning."
2016-07-03,Andrea Leadsom has claimed the Tory leadership front runner Theresa May should not become Prime Minister because she does not believe in leaving the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160703030509/http://news.sky.com/story/1720505/leadsom-attacks-may-over-eu-as-support-grows,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Andrea Leadsom has claimed the Tory leadership front runner Theresa May should not become Prime Minister because she does not believe in leaving the EU. The Energy Minister and former banker hit out as she takes on Michael Gove and Liam Fox to be the anti-EU challenger to the Home Secretary. Mrs Leadsom's latest high-profile backer is the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, who says she is the right person to lead the UK through Brexit negotiations with the EU. :: Who Will Replace Cameron? Runners And Riders In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Mrs Leadsom - widely credited with performing strongly in EU referendum debates - was asked whether the next Conservative leader ""must be a Leave supporter"". She replied: ""I certainly think [so] because I've been absolutely closely involved and very passionate about the opportunities from Brexit."" And although she did not refer directly to Mrs May, who backed Remain in the referendum, she added: ""I think it's very difficult for somebody who doesn't agree with that, who is reluctantly following the wishes of the people. ""I think it's quite hard for them to really see the opportunities. I genuinely believe that if we want to make a go of it then we need somebody who believes in it."" Mrs Leadsom, who will formally launch her leadership bid on Monday, also said that key Government positions and roles in the Brexit negotiating team will have to go to people who backed the Leave campaign. ""Key negotiating people would certainly need to believe that our future is much better outside of the EU,"" she said. ""Obviously in Government you need highly competent people to do the job. ""But certainly in actually negotiating our future arrangements with the EU, it's got to be someone who really believes we can do it and a team who believes we can do it."" Her tough stance on leaving the EU has won her the support of hardline Eurosceptic MPs including the former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson, chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee Bernard Jenkin and now Mr Duncan Smith. In a powerful endorsement, Mr Duncan Smith said: ""Having known Andrea for some considerable time, I have huge confidence in her strength, her experience, her wide range of capabilities, her calm manner and her ability to achieve objectives even against considerable odds. ""She has warmth, a genuinely human touch and a great sense of humour. And her enormous depth of business experience speaks volumes for her ability to handle pressure."" And on leaving the EU, Mr Duncan Smith said: ""Working very closely with Andrea as we both campaigned for the UK to leave the EU, I know that she is just right person to lead our country through the negotiations to create the UK's new relationship with the rest of the world. ""I believe that Andrea's strong family background, business experience, compassion, commitment to social justice and dedication will make her a great Prime Minister for the UK."" Asked in her Telegraph interview about Mr Gove's decision to run as leader, described by allies of Boris Johnson as ""an act of betrayal"", Mrs Leadsom said: ""I got to know Michael and Boris during the campaign and I think both of them were absolutely committed to Leave. ""And I just think it's a real tragedy. I feel really sad about what’s happened. Particularly that Boris isn't standing."" She added: ""I'm really sorry about what’s happened. I don't really understand it but I'm really surprised and sorry about it."" Mrs Leadsom did not rule out the possibility of either man taking a job in her Government if she wins the Tory leadership contest. ""It would be important to have key people who were able to be competent and also believe in the project,"" she said. ""But I'm definitely not thinking that far ahead right now."""

He replied: ""Well in terms of numbers it's not an issue. ""I mean the only people who have coloured skin, if you like, are people who run takeaways. Mr David posted a tweet apologising for his remarks ""There are some workers who are migrant workers from the rest of the European Union but the numbers are relatively small. ""But nevertheless people are concerned about it."" On Friday, he tweeted an apology for his comments, which were made during the BBC Radio Wales discussion. He wrote: ""I apologise for any offence I may have caused for remarks on radio yesterday. ""Ethnic minorities play a vitally important role in our society. ""Now more than ever, it is vitally important to combat racism in Caerphilly Borough and elsewhere."" There is heightened concern over racism in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the European Union. The Leave campaign focused on immigration. Since the vote, the number of hate crime incidents reported to a national crime reporting website has been five times the typical weekly level."

Royal Troon - which will host this year's Open Championship - was one of only two Open venues to be male only. The other, Muirfield, has been banned from hosting golf's oldest major tournament after its members rejected allowing women to join earlier this year. Organisers of the vote on Friday evening said Troon's members ""overwhelmingly"" agreed to welcome women to the club. A review of membership policy was announced by Troon at the start of 2015 and was not initially due to be concluded until later this year. But the South Ayrshire club brought the vote forward to before this year's Open, which takes place between 14 and 17 July. Club captain Martin Cheyne said: ""We have said a number of times recently that it is important for golf clubs to reflect the society in which we exist and the modern world that looks to us. ""Therefore, I am delighted with the decision taken by Members of Royal Troon this evening and look forward to welcoming women to our great club. ""It is the right decision for the club today, and for the generations of golfers that will follow."" Two of the other 14 venues that have hosted the Open, Royal St George's in Kent and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, voted to end their male only policies in the last two years. Troon had previously regarded itself a special case because it shares facilities with the Ladies Golf Club, Troon. Muirfield is planning to hold another vote on female membership. A spokesman for The Royal and Ancient, which organises the Open, said: ""We welcome this decision by the membership at Royal Troon and recognise its significance for the club."""

The National Theatre project was described as a ""modern memorial"" marking the centenary of the Battle of the Somme. Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller came up with the idea, which saw around 1,500 participants dress up in First World War uniform. They appeared unannounced in locations across the UK, including train stations and shopping centres. The men walking the streets today were a reminder of the nearly 20,000 who were killed on 1 July 1916 - the first day of the Battle of the Somme. A London Underground carriage is filled with men in war outfits :: Grandsons Of Somme Heroes Meet 100 Years On Each participant represented an individual soldier who was killed that day. The idea was partly inspired by stories of sightings during and after the war by people who believed they had seen a dead loved one. The participants wore historically accurate uniforms, representing 15 of the regiments that suffered losses in the first day of the battle. Some of the volunteers stand in a line ready to cross the street They did not speak, but throughout the day broke into the song We're Here Because We're Here - to the tune of Auld Lang Syne. :: 'Legendary' Irish Troops At Somme Remembered They handed out cards to members of the public with the name and regiment of the soldier they represented, and the age of the soldier when he died on 1 July 1916. The volunteers were men aged between 16-52, reflecting the men who would have fought in the Somme. Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre, said: ""This ... is a truly national piece of theatre and is a powerful way to remember the men who went off to fight 100 years ago."""
