2016-02-12,Forcing junior doctors to accept a work contract with which they profoundly disagree carries a huge political risk for the Government.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1640160/hunts-decision-carries-huge-political-risk,"Forcing junior doctors to accept a work contract with which they profoundly disagree carries a huge political risk for the Government. Despite two days of industrial action and nearly 7,000 medical procedures cancelled, the gap between the NHS and the British Medical Association appears to be unbridgeable. The public worries that tired junior doctors will damage their health But the doctors have public support, with polls suggesting between two-thirds and three-quarters of people back their stance to defend the current pay structure which gives a bonus to those working on Saturday. :: Hunt Under Pressure Over Junior Doctors The NHS argues it needs ""certainty"" while battling large budget deficits and staff shortages, and new contracts would have to be in place in August. The Government's calculation is that any escalation of industrial action by junior doctors - which now seems likely - would test the goodwill of patients. The BMA's nuclear option of a ""full withdrawal of labour"" - including emergency services - would draw comparisons with the damaging industrial disputes of the 1970s. As one senior NHS source told the Huffington Post: ""Jeremy Hunt thinks he is Maggie Thatcher taking on the miners. ""But the problem is he doesn't have six months' worth of coal."" Some query whether the Government has the appetite to continue a clash with sons and daughters of many middle-class Tory voters, who appear to be winning the social media publicity war. Remember also that Mr Hunt was brought in to replace Andrew Lansley in 2012 after relations between the Government and NHS staff were sorely tested. And this could just be the start of a bumpy episode. The BMA believes that to deliver the Government's stated aim of a ""truly seven day a week institution"", contracts would have to be changed with other health professionals - including consultants. That could spell a lengthy clash between the Department of Health and those who work for the country's biggest employer."
2016-02-12,"Drug giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has been fined £37.6m for ""illegal behaviour designed to stifle competition at the expense of the NHS and taxpayers"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1640720/gsk-fined-38m-for-stifling-drug-competition,"Drug giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has been fined £37.6m for ""illegal behaviour designed to stifle competition at the expense of the NHS and taxpayers"". The decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) relates to £50m of payments made to rivals for them to effectively delay the release of the anti-depressant paroxetine drug. GSK's branded version of the drug, Seroxat, was then able to continue its monopoly over the market for this ""blockbuster"" product. The CMA say that these ""pay-for-delay"" agreements ""deferred the competition that the threat of independent generic entry could offer, and potentially deprived the National Health Service of the significant price falls that generally result from generic competition"". According to the CMA when the rivals were eventually able to enter the market at the end of 2003, average paroxetine prices dropped by more than 70% in two years. It is the largest fine since the CMA began operating nearly two years ago, and among the biggest in the UK competition law history. The ruling centres on a product - Seroxat - for which 4.2 million UK prescriptions were issued in 2000. Sales exceeded £90m in 2001. In that year, two smaller rivals - including Generics (UK) Limited (GUK) and Alphapharma - were taking steps to enter the UK market for the first time but GSK began legal proceedings against them alleging they would infringe its patent. The CMA said that before the litigation went to trial, GUK and Alphapharma made agreements with the larger firm which included terms banning their independent entry into the UK paroxetine market. It found that these agreements infringed competition law. It has fined the companies involved a total of £45m - £37.6m for GSK and £7.4m in relation to the other two companies. Michael Grenfell, head of enforcement at the CMA, said: ""Today’s decision sends out a strong message that we will tackle illegal behaviour that is designed to stifle competition at the expense of customers - in this case, the NHS and, ultimately, taxpayers. ""This investigation shows our determination to take enforcement action against illegal anti-competitive practices in sectors big and small. ""Cracking down on these practices is essential to protect consumers, to encourage legitimate business activity that such practices stifle, and to stimulate innovation and growth."" GSK disagrees with the ruling, is considering a possible appeal, and says it entered into the agreements at the time in order to settle costly, complex and uncertain patent disputes. The firm, based in Brentford, west London, said: ""The agreements allowed the generics companies to enter the market early with a paroxetine product and ultimately enabled a saving of over £15m to the NHS."""

Tarik Hassane, 22, from west London, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to conspiracy to murder and preparation of terrorist acts.  He planned to kill soldiers, police officers and civilians on the streets of the capital. The charges state that he conspired with co-defendants and others to murder ""a person or persons unknown"" between 8 July and 25 September 2014. And between 8 July 2014 and 7 October 2014, they are said to have researched, planned and sourced a weapon and ammunition with a ""view to committing an attack or attacks on a person or persons within the United Kingdom"". Three other co-accused, all from west London, deny the charges. They are Nyall Hamlett, 25, Nathan Cuffy, 26, and Suhaib Majeed, 21. Some of them are also charged with firearms offences. Trial judge Mr Justice Wilkie adjourned the case until Monday. :: In a separate case, a taxi driver who planned to leave his heavily-pregnant wife and young son in the UK and head off for a new life in Syria with a jihadi bride has been found guilty of terror offences. Naseer Taj, 26, was ""caught red-handed"" in late December 2014 as he finalised his preparations to join Islamic State and achieve martyrdom. He made no reaction when he was found guilty of preparation of terrorists acts and two counts of possessing terrorist information following a trial at the Old Bailey."
2016-02-12,"More than 120,000 people have signed petitions backing junior doctors after Jeremy Hunt announced he would impose a new contract on them.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1640769/120000-sign-petitions-backing-junior-doctors,"More than 120,000 people have signed petitions backing junior doctors after Jeremy Hunt announced he would impose a new contract on them. The health secretary faces a battle over his decision after the British Medical Association (BMA) vowed to fight on against ""a contract that is bad for the future of patient care, the profession and the NHS"". Meanwhile, a number of NHS trust chief executives who had supported the new contract and urged an end to the uncertainty, insisted they did not back its imposition. One petition set up on the government website on Thursday calling on Mr Hunt to restart ""meaningful negotiations"" with the BMA had attracted almost 60,000 signatures by Friday morning. A second petition calling for a vote of no confidence in the health secretary had been signed by more than 60,000 people. The Government responds to all petitions that get 10,000 signatures and reaching 100,000 supporters means a debate in Parliament would be considered. Around half the NHS bosses whose support was cited when Mr Hunt announced he would force through changes to pay and conditions have said they did not agree with the contract being forced on medics. They include at least one who said she was unaware that her name was on the letter until it was actually published. Claire Murdoch, chief executive of the Central and North West London NHS FT, said: ""I became aware that my name was on the letter at the point at which it was published. ""When I contacted Sir David Dalton he had it removed immediately, which is reflective of the straightforward way he has sought to deal with a very challenging negotiation."" Andrew Foster, chief executive of the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust (FT), said the letter he and 19 other NHS leaders backed was not the one that advised the Government to do ""whatever it deems necessary"" to break the deadlock. Mr Foster said he had ""not supported contract imposition. I have supported the view that the offer made is reasonable"". Sir David denied that the chief executives listed on the letter had been asked to give their support to imposed contracts. The BMA has already staged two walkouts and further strikes and legal actions are possibilities, while some junior doctors may refuse to sign new contracts which are due to be implemented from August. One medic's emotional rebuke of Mr Hunt in a Facebook post has been shared almost 30,000 times. Rich Bowman said ""screw you"" to the health secretary as he described being the only doctor looking after 100 cancer patients during a night shift in Birmingham. He wrote on Thursday: ""If I made a mistake because I was tired, any one of these patients could've died. ""Apparently I lack vocation, I'm overpaid and I need to work harder. ""Screw you Jeremy Hunt. We never asked for thanks. All we do is for our patients, how dare you try and turn them against us. All of this is your government's fault. Well you've picked a fight with the wrong crowd. ""Go on, announce imposition, and just see what the most resilient, driven, passionate, intelligent group of people in Britain do next. Bring it on."""
2016-02-12,An 18-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a business owner who was shot dead in Birmingham last week.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1640816/arrest-after-company-boss-shot-dead-in-digbeth,"An 18-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a business owner who was shot dead in Birmingham last week. Married father-of-four Akhtar Javeed died in hospital after suffering a gunshot wound to the neck during an attempted robbery at his warehouse. Police believe two men were involved in a ""targeted"" raid at the premises in Rea Street South, Digbeth, on 3 February. Three of Mr Javeed's colleagues were reportedly tied up by robbers who demanded keys to a safe. Forensics officers at the scene of the shooting West Midlands Police made the arrest in Derby on Thursday night. Mr Javeed has been described by his family as a loving grandfather and ""honest man"". The 56-year-old lived in east London and helped run the Birmingham-based food and drink firm. His family said in a statement last week: ""He was very hard-working, loved by many, always treated everyone kindly, and was a good man who avoided conflict. ""He was cruelly taken away from us and his young children who will now have to grow up without their father."" Mr Javeed moved to Birmingham to run the business so he could provide for his family and was planning to move back to London very soon."
2016-02-12,Liam Fox is the man Conservative members would most like to see as their party's next leader.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1640301/who-do-tory-grassroots-want-as-next-leader,"By Sophy Ridge, Senior Political Correspondent Liam Fox is the man Conservative members would most like to see as their party's next leader. The Conservative Home poll of members was greeted with incredulity by some in Westminster. But, in many ways, it's not surprising at all that Dr Fox is emerging as the dark horse in the race to succeed David Cameron. It's no secret the former Defence Secretary is one of the most ambitious men in politics. He's one of his party's biggest networkers and is building up a  support base among MPs, particularly the new intake who defeated the Lib Dems in the South West. Most importantly, he's driving the campaign to leave the EU. :: Putin Would 'Shed No Tears' Over Brexit The referendum battle could be decisive in the fight to succeed David Cameron. Theresa May, Boris Johnson and George Osborne are the most popular candidates for the leadership after Dr Fox, according to Conservative Home. Mr Osborne and Mrs May are understood to be leaning towards the In camp. That leaves a huge opportunity for an ambitious candidate to mop up support from the Eurosceptic wing. What Boris Johnson decides to do is key, and many Westminster insiders believe he will either lean In or refuse to declare for either side. Priti Patel could be a roadblock if Liam Fox does pitch to be the preferred candidate of the Tory right. The Eurosceptic employment minister is being tipped as a potential leader of the Brexit campaign, and she's being heavily courted by the Out camp. If she becomes the face of Brexit, it will be a high risk strategy - but one that could pay off. Tory MPs are split when it comes to Dr Fox's chances for the leadership. One Conservative minister told me: ""Liam is a charismatic speaker and extremely charming. ""He has done countless local fundraisers and supported dozens of new MPs to win their seats. ""With the EU Brexit campaign as a platform, his message is clearly cutting through. ""Given his popularity with the grassroots and the large body of Eurosceptic MPs who will want to back one of their own, his stock is definitely on the rise."" But when I asked one Conservative MP about Dr Fox's leadership odds, he replied: ""Not a chance. ""The side of the party he represents is led entirely by egos and they would not coalesce around one person. Liam just doesn’t cut it."" Dr Fox didn't make it to the final two in the 2005 leadership race. But rumours persist that David Cameron's backers tactically voted for David Davis in order to keep Dr Fox - who they thought was the stronger candidate - out of the final run off. The jury is still out. But don't make the mistake of thinking the referendum campaign is just about the European Union. The race to be the next Conservative Party leader has already started."

He spoke to Sky at the premiere of Hail, Caesar! at the Berlin film festival on Thursday, before meeting Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, to discuss what more can be done by both the US and Hollywood. ""The US needs to do more as we know, taking 10,000 refugees a year is not enough, that's clear,"" he said. Clooney, and his wife Amal, met Ms Merkel on Friday morning where their discussions focused on ""refugee policies and their involvement in the"" aid group International Rescue Committee. Former British foreign secretary David Miliband, who now heads the IRC, said afterwards that they had discussed what countries around the world could do to solve ""what is a global problem, not just a Syrian problem or a German issue"". America has committed to accepting 10,000 Syrians this year and 85,000 refugees in total. Clooney was at the Berlin festival with wife Amal Refugees play a central role on and off screen at this year's festival, in a city which has seen 80,000 refugees arrive in the last year and more than a million in Germany as a whole. When the festival was set up in 1951 there were millions of refugees and displaced people across Europe, and so from the beginning its aim was to contribute to a better understanding between nations and cultures. Dieter Kosslick, the festival's director, said Germany felt a responsibility to do more because of its history. ""The red carpet is not just about glitz and shine, it also has something to do with responsibility .... We are in Berlin, a very specific city in history, it has to be much more acceptable in Germany to have refugees because we have a bad history."" There are more than a dozen films in the festival programme which focus on people fleeing from war and oppression. Berlin's biggest refugee camp is at the former Templhof airport. Built by Hitler as the gateway to Nazi Germany, more than 2,000 people are now living in its huge aircraft carriers. Many have travelled for weeks with young children from Syria, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. This year's festival will organise donations to charities working with refugees, as well as supplying some with tickets to film screenings. Angela Meyenburg, from charity KulturLeben, said she hoped refugees would enjoy the festival ""to forget for some two or three hours the things you're always thinking on, or to have fun for a little while and to relax""."

The Labour leader arrived at the coroner's court in Warrington with Liverpool MP Steve Rotheram and shadow home secretary Andy Burnham. During a break in the hearings he spoke to families of some of the fans who died in the crush at the stadium in 1989. Mr Corbyn said his visit to the hearing had nothing to do with party politics. As he left, he said: ""I've come to observe, I've come to meet the families and I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. ""It's an act of interest, an act of support for the families and recognition of the trauma they've been through, for the dreadful events that happened at Hillsborough."" Mr Corbyn also paid tribute to local MPs and campaigners for helping the families to fight for new inquests, quashing the verdicts of accidental death in the original inquests held in 1991. Mr Burnham raised the families' campaign for new inquests at Cabinet level with then-prime minister Gordon Brown, leading to the setting up of the Hillsborough Independent Panel. The inquests have been sitting for almost two years. The jury has been hearing evidence into the deaths of the 96 fans crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace of the ground in Sheffield as the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest got under way on 15 April 1989. The jury is expected to retire to consider its verdicts on 2 March."
2016-02-12,Commons Speaker John Bercow is again under pressure over his expenses after he spent thousands wining and dining colleagues with the taxpayer picking up the bill.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1641003/details-of-speaker-bercows-spending-revealed,"By Darren McCaffrey, Political Correspondent Commons Speaker John Bercow is again under pressure over his expenses after he spent thousands wining and dining colleagues with the taxpayer picking up the bill. Mr Bercow used the money to provide lunches and dinners for other MPs, including more than £2,000 on a ""standing down"" supper for his former deputy. Details have emerged that the Speaker also charged for hundreds of postcard-sized photographs of himself that are ""sent out on request,"" nearly £2,000 worth of beeswax candles, and hundreds of pounds to tune the grand piano in his apartments. The full breakdown of spending charged to the Speaker's official account was obtained by the Press Association using freedom of information laws. The request also revealed that records of spending before April 2012 had been destroyed because of parliament's ""records disposal policy"". The Speaker’s Office defended Mr Bercow's spending - pointing out that overall annual expenditure had fallen 19.4% to £504,000 since he took on the role in 2009. A spokeswoman said: ""These costs relate to nearly four years of expenditure, including, amongst other things, staff pay, office supplies, telephone calls and rental, as well as the official entertainment of foreign dignitaries and parliamentarians traditionally provided by the Speaker's Office. ""The Speaker is committed to cutting costs wherever possible, and the overall expenditure of the Speaker's Office has fallen during his tenure from £626,029 in 2009-10 to £504,737 in 2014-15, representing a reduction of 19.4% since he was elected to the role."" Last summer Mr Bercow's use of chauffeured cars in the UK also came under scrutiny. It emerged that he had been driven to a conference just 0.7 miles from the Commons at a cost of £172. The new spending figures include £1,700 for a reception for retiring MPs before last year's election and another £3,000 on an event for newly-elected members in the summer. A dinner to honour the Australian Speaker cost nearly £2,000 in May 2014. A meal with the Lithuanian Speaker in February last year cost £1,600.62. And around £30,000 has been spent on ""refreshments"" for lectures delivered by politicians at parliament."
2016-02-12,Firms with 250 or more employees will have to publish their gender pay gap under measures being announced by the Government to tackle inequality.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1640530/companies-told-to-publish-gender-pay-gap,"Firms with 250 or more employees will have to publish their gender pay gap under measures being announced by the Government to tackle inequality. The plans will also see league tables being launched giving details of companies that are failing to address the problem. However the CBI warned against a ""name and shame"" approach which it argued would only give a partial picture. Ministers are launching the policy alongside plans to ensure that thousands more girls study maths, engineering, science and technology at school. David Cameron tweeted: ""Increased transparency leaves nowhere for gender inequality to hide and underscores our pledge to end the gender pay gap in a generation."" Women and equalities minister Nicky Morgan said the Government wanted to secure ""real equality"" and reduce the gap in pay between men and women. ""In recent years we've seen the best employers make ground-breaking strides in tackling gender inequality. ""But the job won't be complete until we see the talents of women and men recognised equally and fairly in every workplace."" A £500,000 package of help was announced to help the 8,000 employers that will have to publish their average pay and bonus gap between male and female employees. The first league table will be published in 2018, making it possible for women to compare pay in different sectors. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it was a step in the right direction but a ""much bolder approach"" was needed and it was disappointing the pay gap details would not have to be published until 2018. ""It is a real shame that bosses won't be made to explain why pay gaps exist in their workplaces and what action they will take to narrow them,"" she said. The TUC said it was ""shocking"" that the gender pay gap was still over 19% for all workers and 9.4% for full-time employees, adding that at the current rate of progress it would take almost 50 years to close it. But CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""League tables should not be used to name and shame firms, as data will only be able to present a partial picture, particularly given factors such as the mix of part-time and full working and sectoral differences. ""Where reporting can be useful is as a prompt for companies to ask the right questions about how they can eradicate the gender pay gap. ""The Government should consult closely with business to ensure that this new legislation helps close the gender pay gap, rather than ending up as a box-ticking exercise."""

2016-02-12,One of Asia's biggest cinema operators has made a £1bn approach to buy the Odeon and UCI multiplex chains.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160212221855/http://news.sky.com/story/1640968/koreans-make-1bn-takeover-move-for-odeon,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor One of Asia's biggest cinema operators has made a £1bn approach to buy the Odeon and UCI multiplex chains. Sky News understands that South Korea's CGV is one of a number of suitors to have emerged for the two British cinema brands, both of which have been owned by the private equity firm Terra Firma for more than a decade. Dalian Wanda, the Chinese conglomerate, and Vue Entertainment, Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group's major UK rival, are two of the other potential bidders. Sources said that Terra Firma was working with bankers at Goldman Sachs to evaluate the timing of a formal auction process, which analysts expect to take place this year. Odeon' gross UK box office revenues grew by more than 20% last year to £321.5m, outperforming its major domestic competitors, with growth fuelled by the releases of Spectre, the latest James Bond film, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Acquiring the UK-based cinema group would be a transformational move for CGV. Odeon and UCI own nearly 250 multiplexes in seven countries, including Germany, Italy and Spain. Last November, the company reported its fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth. CGV operates a similar number of cinemas - with fewer screens than Odeon and UCI - and is concentrated in Asian markets, although it does have a presence in the US. Terra Firma, which also owns companies such as Garden Centre Group, is exploring the raising of a new fund under the stewardship of Justin King, the former J Sainsbury chief executive, who joined the buyout group last year. Such a move would mark a break with the recent past for Terra Firma, which has struggled to rebuild investors' confidence after it lost control of EMI, the music group, five years ago. Although the performance of Terra Firma’s funds has otherwise largely been respectable, the EMI debacle – which remains the subject of a legal action against Citi brought by Mr Hands – cost it billions of pounds. In recent years, it has nevertheless managed to return investors from the sale of other assets, including Germany’s largest private landlord. Its existing investments are experiencing mixed performance, with Four Seasons Health Care, the care homes operator, facing a huge financial challenge from the Government’s new Living Wage. Terra Firma and Odeon declined to comment, while CGV could not be reached."

Edgar Latulip was 21 when he went missing - but was described as having a mental age of 12. He vanished without his medication from a home in Kitchener, Ontario, in September 1986. His mother Sylvia Wilson last saw him in hospital after he had attempted suicide. He was never seen or heard from again and she feared he might have killed himself or had been abused or murdered. That was until a man with a different identity, living 75 miles away, told his social worker in January he thought his real name could be Edgar Latulip. The man had started having flashbacks and police have now announced Mr Latulip is alive and well after a DNA test confirmed it was him. Officers said he had suffered a head injury after a fall around the time he went missing. It impaired his memory so badly that he could not remember who he was, so he created a new identity. Niagara Regional Police Constable Philip Gavin told the Toronto Star and CBC: ""I've been a police officer for 18 years and this is something I've seen on TV but never been a part of. ""Absolutely, this is quite a rare one."" His 76-year-old mother, who is now waiting to be reunited with her son, has spoken of her surprise when told the news. She told The Record: ""I don't know what to think. I was just kind of blown away. I want to talk to him and help him out any way I can. I just want to see him."""

The couple's nuptials will be celebrated on 5 March at St Bride's Church, famed for its wedding-cake spire and designed by Sir Christopher Wren, who was also responsible for the nearby St Paul's Cathedral.

Lance Sergeant Matthew Lawson said his military training kicked in when he saw the chase in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London on Saturday. Footage shows Lance Sergeant Lawson, who is from Derby, casually sticking out his foot, causing the suspect to fall over. Kingston Police appealed for the mystery man, who they called a ""legend"", to come forward so they could thank him. :: Watch: Man Trips Up Suspect Running From Police The 37-year-old is a euphonium player in the Band of the Scots Guards, and will play for the Queen on her 90th birthday in June. Lance Sergeant Lawson, who is based in Wellington Barracks beside Buckingham Palace, said: ""I heard a shout: 'Stop! Police!' And immediately my military training just kicked in. ""I saw the policemen chasing a guy and I thought: 'He's a bit of a whippet, they'll never catch him.' So I reckoned I'd buy them a few seconds, and just stuck my leg out to trip him up.

PC Brendan Dexter-Beek, who is seen in the footage detaining the suspect after he tripped and fell, said he thinks he would have eventually caught up with the teenager, but added he is thankful to Lance Sergeant Lawson for his help. Laughing, he said: ""I reckon I'd have still got him, but that's my personal opinion. Opinions are varied back at the police station. ""But I'm grateful for the fact that he jumped in."" Glenn Tunstall, Borough Commander of Kingston Police, said that while they are grateful to Lance Sergeant Lawson, they would not encourage untrained members of the public to intervene in similar situations ""because the threat is unknown and the officers obviously have got the equipment and the training."" The soldier will be awarded a commendation from Kingston Police for his ""courage and bravery"", Cmdr Tunstall said. A 17-year-old boy was arrested after the incident on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and has been bailed until April."

The court heard she made it clear she was a Year 10 student but everyone thought she looked older. The pair met near a Chinese takeaway on 17 January in the footballer's black Range Rover and he signed shirts.

Miss Blackwell told the jury the pair kissed ""for some time during which the defendant unbuttoned her jeans and undid the zip"".

After the encounter Johnson messaged the girl saying ""it was class"", adding: ""Just wanted to get your jeans off, LOL."" The teenager replied: ""Next time."" The victim was a season ticket holder who rarely missed a home game and ""would hang around waiting for a glimpse"" of Johnson. ""She had one enormous crush on him. He was her absolute hero.

She reportedly tried to get the child out in time - but it plunged into the canal with both of them inside.  The emergency services were quickly on the scene, and mother and child are said to be doing well after being taken to a hospital. Firefighters have since retrieved the car from the canal and the four rescuers have been thanked for their heroic response."

Mr Bercow used the money to provide lunches and dinners for other MPs, including more than £2,000 on a ""standing down"" supper for his former deputy. Details have emerged that the Speaker also charged for hundreds of postcard-sized photographs of himself that are ""sent out on request,"" nearly £2,000 worth of beeswax candles, and hundreds of pounds to tune the grand piano in his apartments. The full breakdown of spending charged to the Speaker's official account was obtained by the Press Association using freedom of information laws. The request also revealed that records of spending before April 2012 had been destroyed because of parliament's ""records disposal policy"". The Speaker’s Office defended Mr Bercow's spending - pointing out that overall annual expenditure had fallen 19.4% to £504,000 since he took on the role in 2009. A spokeswoman said: ""These costs relate to nearly four years of expenditure, including, amongst other things, staff pay, office supplies, telephone calls and rental, as well as the official entertainment of foreign dignitaries and parliamentarians traditionally provided by the Speaker's Office. ""The Speaker is committed to cutting costs wherever possible, and the overall expenditure of the Speaker's Office has fallen during his tenure from £626,029 in 2009-10 to £504,737 in 2014-15, representing a reduction of 19.4% since he was elected to the role."" Last summer Mr Bercow's use of chauffeured cars in the UK also came under scrutiny. It emerged that he had been driven to a conference just 0.7 miles from the Commons at a cost of £172.

A dinner to honour the Australian Speaker cost nearly £2,000 in May 2014. A meal with the Lithuanian Speaker in February last year cost £1,600.62. And around £30,000 has been spent on ""refreshments"" for lectures delivered by politicians at parliament."

As he left, he said: ""I've come to observe, I've come to meet the families and I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

The public worries that tired junior doctors will damage their health But the doctors have public support, with polls suggesting between two-thirds and three-quarters of people back their stance to defend the current pay structure which gives a bonus to those working on Saturday. :: Hunt Under Pressure Over Junior Doctors The NHS argues it needs ""certainty"" while battling large budget deficits and staff shortages, and new contracts would have to be in place in August. The Government's calculation is that any escalation of industrial action by junior doctors - which now seems likely - would test the goodwill of patients. The BMA's nuclear option of a ""full withdrawal of labour"" - including emergency services - would draw comparisons with the damaging industrial disputes of the 1970s. As one senior NHS source told the Huffington Post: ""Jeremy Hunt thinks he is Maggie Thatcher taking on the miners. ""But the problem is he doesn't have six months' worth of coal."" Some query whether the Government has the appetite to continue a clash with sons and daughters of many middle-class Tory voters, who appear to be winning the social media publicity war. Remember also that Mr Hunt was brought in to replace Andrew Lansley in 2012 after relations between the Government and NHS staff were sorely tested. And this could just be the start of a bumpy episode. The BMA believes that to deliver the Government's stated aim of a ""truly seven day a week institution"", contracts would have to be changed with other health professionals - including consultants. That could spell a lengthy clash between the Department of Health and those who work for the country's biggest employer."

Edgar Latulip was 21 when he went missing - but was described as having a mental age of 12. He vanished without his medication from a home in Kitchener, Ontario, in September 1986. His mother Sylvia Wilson last saw him in hospital after he had attempted suicide. He was never seen or heard from again and she feared he might have killed himself or had been abused or murdered. That was until a man with a different identity, living 75 miles away, told his social worker in January he thought his real name could be Edgar Latulip. The man had started having flashbacks and police have now announced Mr Latulip is alive and well after a DNA test confirmed it was him. Officers said he had suffered a head injury after a fall around the time he went missing. It impaired his memory so badly that he could not remember who he was, so he created a new identity. Niagara Regional Police Constable Philip Gavin told the Toronto Star and CBC: ""I've been a police officer for 18 years and this is something I've seen on TV but never been a part of. ""Absolutely, this is quite a rare one."" His 76-year-old mother, who is now waiting to be reunited with her son, has spoken of her surprise when told the news. She told The Record: ""I don't know what to think. I was just kind of blown away. I want to talk to him and help him out any way I can. I just want to see him."""

The Hollywood actor was at the Vesuvio lounge in the upmarket seaside town of Carmel on Thursday night when the fracas occurred. Murray apparently became irate because star-struck patrons were taking his photo. Carmel police commander Paul Tomasi told Sky News: ""At approximately 10.30pm last night police were called to a disturbance at Vesuvio restaurant. The Italian restaurant is a known celebrity hangout ""When we got there we had three people who were reporting that the subject, identified as Mr Murray, had taken their cell phones and thrown them. ""Two of the phones went off the top of the building and were lost. ""One of them landed on a cushion. This morning our officers contacted representatives of Mr Murray. Justin Timberlake was hosting a party at the venue that evening ""He acknowledged that he was there and said he is willing to replace the property that was damaged."" The police commander said no further action will be taken since the owners of the phones do not wish to press charges. He said they denied they were taking Murray's photo. Mr Tomasi said singer Justin Timberlake was hosting a party at the venue that evening. He also said it is not clear how the phones that Murray threw off the top of the single-storey building went missing. The owners ran down to the street level but were told by witnesses that someone had pulled up in a car and taken the handsets, said Mr Tomasi."

Tarik Hassane, 22, from west London, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to conspiracy to murder and preparation of terrorist acts.  He planned to kill soldiers, police officers and civilians on the streets of the capital. The charges state that he conspired with co-defendants and others to murder ""a person or persons unknown"" between 8 July and 25 September 2014. And between 8 July 2014 and 7 October 2014, they are said to have researched, planned and sourced a weapon and ammunition with a ""view to committing an attack or attacks on a person or persons within the United Kingdom"". Three other co-accused, all from west London, deny the charges. They are Nyall Hamlett, 25, Nathan Cuffy, 26, and Suhaib Majeed, 21. Some of them are also charged with firearms offences. Trial judge Mr Justice Wilkie adjourned the case until Monday. :: In a separate case, a taxi driver who planned to leave his heavily-pregnant wife and young son in the UK and head off for a new life in Syria with a jihadi bride has been found guilty of terror offences. Naseer Taj, 26, was ""caught red-handed"" in late December 2014 as he finalised his preparations to join Islamic State and achieve martyrdom. He made no reaction when he was found guilty of preparation of terrorists acts and two counts of possessing terrorist information following a trial at the Old Bailey."

The 84-year-old media mogul and the former supermodel, 59, announced their engagement last month in an advert in The Times newspaper, which Mr Murdoch owns. The couple's nuptials will be celebrated on 5 March at St Bride's Church, famed for its wedding-cake spire and designed by Sir Christopher Wren, who was also responsible for the nearby St Paul's Cathedral. ""He will be having a service to celebrate the marriage,"" Claire Seaton from St Bride's told Reuters. She said the actual wedding ceremony will take place elsewhere. Mr Murdoch with his former wife Wendi Deng The three-times-married media tycoon and Ms Hall, the former partner of Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick Jagger, got engaged in Los Angeles, where they had been attending the Golden Globes awards ceremony. He divorced his third wife, Wendi Deng, a former executive at Murdoch-owned Star TV in China, in 2013 after 14 years, saying their marriage had irretrievably broken down. Ms Hall was married to Sir Mick for more than 20 years but in divorce proceedings in 1999 the musician claimed they were never legally married. Among the 150 or so guests are likely to be Robert Thomson, News Corp's chief executive, and Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News UK.

The 37-year-old, who was a striker for clubs including Everton, Charlton and Ipswich, had been in a ""delusional"" state after taking cocaine on 13 September. Bent had called 999 reporting that he had heard intruders in his flat in Claremont Lane, Esher. But after police arrived at the property, backed up by armed officers, they were confronted by a bare-chested Bent who was ""eyes wide, jaw clenched, his body rigid"". Lee Harris, prosecuting, said the ex-England U21 star was ""wild with rage"". An officer Tasered Bent before his flat was searched. No intruders were found but there was a small amount of cocaine. He was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence, 200 hours of community service and a two-month night-time curfew after admitting affray and possession at previous hearings. Bent also has to pay each of the officers £500 in compensation and cover £1,500 court fees. His lawyer Andrew Henley said his client no longer used cocaine and had self-medicated with the drug."

2016-02-13,One of Asia's biggest cinema operators has made a £1bn approach to buy the Odeon and UCI multiplex chains.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160213172306/http://news.sky.com/story/1640968/koreans-make-1bn-takeover-move-for-odeon,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor One of Asia's biggest cinema operators has made a £1bn approach to buy the Odeon and UCI multiplex chains. Sky News understands that South Korea's CGV is one of a number of suitors to have emerged for the two British cinema brands, both of which have been owned by the private equity firm Terra Firma for more than a decade. Dalian Wanda, the Chinese conglomerate, and Vue Entertainment, Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group's major UK rival, are two of the other potential bidders. Sources said that Terra Firma was working with bankers at Goldman Sachs to evaluate the timing of a formal auction process, which analysts expect to take place this year. Odeon' gross UK box office revenues grew by more than 20% last year to £321.5m, outperforming its major domestic competitors, with growth fuelled by the releases of Spectre, the latest James Bond film, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Acquiring the UK-based cinema group would be a transformational move for CGV. Odeon and UCI own nearly 250 multiplexes in seven countries, including Germany, Italy and Spain. Last November, the company reported its fourth consecutive quarter of market share growth. CGV operates a similar number of cinemas - with fewer screens than Odeon and UCI - and is concentrated in Asian markets, although it does have a presence in the US. Terra Firma, which also owns companies such as Garden Centre Group, is exploring the raising of a new fund under the stewardship of Justin King, the former J Sainsbury chief executive, who joined the buyout group last year. Such a move would mark a break with the recent past for Terra Firma, which has struggled to rebuild investors' confidence after it lost control of EMI, the music group, five years ago. Although the performance of Terra Firma’s funds has otherwise largely been respectable, the EMI debacle – which remains the subject of a legal action against Citi brought by Mr Hands – cost it billions of pounds. In recent years, it has nevertheless managed to return investors from the sale of other assets, including Germany’s largest private landlord. Its existing investments are experiencing mixed performance, with Four Seasons Health Care, the care homes operator, facing a huge financial challenge from the Government’s new Living Wage. Terra Firma and Odeon declined to comment, while CGV could not be reached."
2016-02-13,Firms with 250 or more employees will have to publish their gender pay gap under measures being announced by the Government to tackle inequality.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160213172306/http://news.sky.com/story/1640530/companies-told-to-publish-gender-pay-gap,"Firms with 250 or more employees will have to publish their gender pay gap under measures being announced by the Government to tackle inequality. The plans will also see league tables being launched giving details of companies that are failing to address the problem. However the CBI warned against a ""name and shame"" approach which it argued would only give a partial picture. Ministers are launching the policy alongside plans to ensure that thousands more girls study maths, engineering, science and technology at school. David Cameron tweeted: ""Increased transparency leaves nowhere for gender inequality to hide and underscores our pledge to end the gender pay gap in a generation."" Women and equalities minister Nicky Morgan said the Government wanted to secure ""real equality"" and reduce the gap in pay between men and women. ""In recent years we've seen the best employers make ground-breaking strides in tackling gender inequality. ""But the job won't be complete until we see the talents of women and men recognised equally and fairly in every workplace."" A £500,000 package of help was announced to help the 8,000 employers that will have to publish their average pay and bonus gap between male and female employees. The first league table will be published in 2018, making it possible for women to compare pay in different sectors. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it was a step in the right direction but a ""much bolder approach"" was needed and it was disappointing the pay gap details would not have to be published until 2018. ""It is a real shame that bosses won't be made to explain why pay gaps exist in their workplaces and what action they will take to narrow them,"" she said. The TUC said it was ""shocking"" that the gender pay gap was still over 19% for all workers and 9.4% for full-time employees, adding that at the current rate of progress it would take almost 50 years to close it. But CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""League tables should not be used to name and shame firms, as data will only be able to present a partial picture, particularly given factors such as the mix of part-time and full working and sectoral differences. ""Where reporting can be useful is as a prompt for companies to ask the right questions about how they can eradicate the gender pay gap. ""The Government should consult closely with business to ensure that this new legislation helps close the gender pay gap, rather than ending up as a box-ticking exercise."""

Peter Eyre, 44, and sons Anthony, 22, and Simon, 24, will serve a minimum of 81 years between them. The fire, at Langley Mill in Derbyshire, was started in revenge after a dispute over a stolen moped. The judge at Nottingham Crown Court told the men they had carried out a ""truly terrifying"" crime in which the victims died ""in the most dreadful circumstances"". Mrs Justice Carr QC said: ""I am sure, on the jury's verdict and evidence in court, your intention was to kill."" Amy Smith died along with her daughter and friend Edward Green Amy Smith, 17, died in the blaze along with her baby daughter, Ruby-Grace Gaunt, and her friend Edward Green, who was also 17. Her partner and the baby's father, 18-year-old Shaun Gaunt, and another man were rescued from the flat. Mr Gaunt had been the target following a dispute with the Eyres over a stolen moped. Peter Eyre had waited in a car while his sons poured petrol against the flat's only exit on 21 June last year. CCTV had shown the three men driving to the property. Mr Eyre - who was described in court as controlling - will serve a minimum of 32 years. The judge told him: ""I am satisfied you were, as has been said already, the driver behind the events of that night both literally and metaphorically."" She said he had tried to bully his way out of criminal responsibility, seeking to blame his sons.  Anthony and Simon Eyre will serve a minimum of 23 and 26 years respectively. Simon Eyre's representative, Peter Joyce, asked the judge to take account of Peter Eyre's powerful influence over his sons. But Mrs Justice Carr told Simon Eyre: ""You … had the opportunity not to engage in or participate in the plan as you did."" Addressing Anthony Eyre - who had admitted manslaughter before the trial - she said: ""You, unlike them, chose to tell the truth as to your criminal involvement, at least in part."" There was no reaction from the three men as they were sentenced. Amy Smith's mother, Melanie Hawkins, said afterwards their sentences were ""nothing compared to what our girls will have suffered that morning"", adding: ""We are the ones living the life-long sentence, not them."""

The 28-year-old is accused of two counts of sexual activity with a child - a girl who ""idolised"" her favourite Sunderland player - between December 2014 and February last year. Opening the prosecution case, Kate Blackwell QC said: ""What has brought the defendant to this courtroom is a sexual desire for (the girl), an excessive arrogance and an unwarranted level of expectation."" Jurors at Bradford Crown Court heard the girl contacted Johnson on Facebook. The ex-Sunderland winger has been sacked by the club He asked for her mobile phone number, gave her his and asked her to contact him. The girl was 15 in December 2014, a time when Johnson lived with his partner, Stacey Flounders, who was then pregnant with their daughter, in Castle Eden, County Durham. The pair exchanged messages on WhatsApp which he later asked her to delete, but she did not. Johnson arranged to meet the teenager so he could sign a football shirt. The court heard she made it clear she was a Year 10 student but everyone thought she looked older. The pair met near a Chinese takeaway on 17 January in the footballer's black Range Rover and he signed shirts. Afterwards, they exchanged further messages talking about whether Johnson deserved a ""thank you kiss"" for the shirt-signing ""or more"". They met again on 30 January when they had sexual contact in the footballer's car at the same location. Miss Blackwell told the jury the pair kissed ""for some time during which the defendant unbuttoned her jeans and undid the zip"". He then drove them to ""a more secluded place"" where there was further sexual contact between the pair. After the encounter Johnson messaged the girl saying ""it was class"", adding: ""Just wanted to get your jeans off, LOL."" The teenager replied: ""Next time."" The victim was a season ticket holder who rarely missed a home game and ""would hang around waiting for a glimpse"" of Johnson. ""She had one enormous crush on him. He was her absolute hero. She idolised him,"" the prosecutor said. Rumours about their relationship got out and the teenager told her parents who went to the police and they arrested Johnson on 2 March last year. Johnson, who was sacked by Sunderland AFC on Thursday, denies the charges."
2016-02-13,Liam Fox is the man Conservative members would most like to see as their party's next leader.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160213172306/http://news.sky.com/story/1640301/who-do-tory-grassroots-want-as-next-leader,"By Sophy Ridge, Senior Political Correspondent Liam Fox is the man Conservative members would most like to see as their party's next leader. The Conservative Home poll of members was greeted with incredulity by some in Westminster. But, in many ways, it's not surprising at all that Dr Fox is emerging as the dark horse in the race to succeed David Cameron. It's no secret the former Defence Secretary is one of the most ambitious men in politics. He's one of his party's biggest networkers and is building up a  support base among MPs, particularly the new intake who defeated the Lib Dems in the South West. Most importantly, he's driving the campaign to leave the EU. :: Putin Would 'Shed No Tears' Over Brexit The referendum battle could be decisive in the fight to succeed David Cameron. Theresa May, Boris Johnson and George Osborne are the most popular candidates for the leadership after Dr Fox, according to Conservative Home. Mr Osborne and Mrs May are understood to be leaning towards the In camp. That leaves a huge opportunity for an ambitious candidate to mop up support from the Eurosceptic wing. What Boris Johnson decides to do is key, and many Westminster insiders believe he will either lean In or refuse to declare for either side. Priti Patel could be a roadblock if Liam Fox does pitch to be the preferred candidate of the Tory right. The Eurosceptic employment minister is being tipped as a potential leader of the Brexit campaign, and she's being heavily courted by the Out camp. If she becomes the face of Brexit, it will be a high risk strategy - but one that could pay off. Tory MPs are split when it comes to Dr Fox's chances for the leadership. One Conservative minister told me: ""Liam is a charismatic speaker and extremely charming. ""He has done countless local fundraisers and supported dozens of new MPs to win their seats. ""With the EU Brexit campaign as a platform, his message is clearly cutting through. ""Given his popularity with the grassroots and the large body of Eurosceptic MPs who will want to back one of their own, his stock is definitely on the rise."" But when I asked one Conservative MP about Dr Fox's leadership odds, he replied: ""Not a chance. ""The side of the party he represents is led entirely by egos and they would not coalesce around one person. Liam just doesn’t cut it."" Dr Fox didn't make it to the final two in the 2005 leadership race. But rumours persist that David Cameron's backers tactically voted for David Davis in order to keep Dr Fox - who they thought was the stronger candidate - out of the final run off. The jury is still out. But don't make the mistake of thinking the referendum campaign is just about the European Union. The race to be the next Conservative Party leader has already started."

He is seeking $10m worth of damages in a case which revolves around a single offending tweet. Mr Woods, who has appeared in movies including Casino and Nixon, filed the original complaint against the Twitter user who goes by the name Abe List. The user has been sending a lawyer to court on their behalf, and has so far resisted attempts to unmask them. But Judge Mel Red Recana of the Superior Court has now denied a motion filed by Abe List’s lawyers this week to strike the case. This could open the door to the user's identity being revealed. The original complaint was filed in July, and calls Abe List a ""cowardly individual"" who conducted a ""malicious online campaign"" to discredit the actor. It added: “Woods intends to unmask and reveal AL for the liar he is. ""AL's reckless and malicious behaviour, through the worldwide reach of the internet, has now jeopardised Woods's good name and reputation on an international scale."" The spat began when Mr Woods posted on Twitter about a row between Bruce Jenner and Planned Parenthood. He wrote: ""USATODAY app features Bruce Jenner's latest dress selection but makes zero mention of Planned Parenthood baby parts market."" Abe List replied: ""Cocaine addict James Woods still sniffing and spouting."" He also referred to Mr Woods as a ""joke"" and ""a ridiculous scum clown-boy"". Abe List’s account is now protected, which means the general public cannot see the tweets. Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing Abe List, said ""suggestions that Mr Woods was on drugs was not meant to be taken literally""."

2016-02-15,Thousands of pounds have been raised for a homeless woman who confronted a shop burglar in the middle of the night and bravely took back the stolen goods.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160215150500/http://news.sky.com/story/1642087/burgled-shop-raises-money-for-homeless-heroine,"Thousands of pounds have been raised for a homeless woman who confronted a shop burglar in the middle of the night and bravely took back the stolen goods. Lottie - who regularly sleeps outside the Lush store in Oxford with her dog Marley and knows the staff - leapt into action after she saw a strange man emerge from the shop at 4am. Barely a day after last Wednesday's break-in, staff were stunned when she marched in with the stolen goods - a box of cosmetics worth £1,000 and a laptop. To thank Lottie, the branch began an online appeal and hundreds of well-wishers have so far raised nearly £5,000. Manager James Atherton said: ""We were amazed and just so joyful. It was fantastic. We weren't expecting to get the stolen goods back at all. ""She confronted him as he walked out. She said 'I know you are not from Lush' and took the stuff back. This was around 4am."" It is hoped the funds raised will help Lottie achieve her dream of owning a caravan. Any surplus cash will be offered to charities which assist vulnerable homeless people in the city."

Police say the 56-year-old was killed when masked men attempted to rob the warehouse in Rea Street South in the Digbeth area of the city. He died in hospital after suffering a gunshot wound to the neck. Businessman Surjat Mistry, 26, of Laundon Way in Leicester and 18-year-old student Lemar Wali of Osmaston Park Road, Derby, were charged with murder, possession of a firearm and conspiracy to commit robbery. They will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court later on Monday. A 19-year-old woman from Leicester who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has been released on bail pending further enquiries. Mr Javeed was described by his family as a loving grandfather and an ""honest man"". He lived in east London and helped run the Birmingham-based food and drink company. In a statement after the 3 February killing, his family said: ""He was very hard-working, loved by many, always treated everyone kindly, and was a good man who avoided conflict. ""He was cruelly taken away from us and his young children who will now have to grow up without their father."" Mr Javeed moved to Birmingham to run the business so he could provide for his family and was planning to move back to London very soon. Police are still urging anyone with information to contact them. Detective Chief Inspector Martin Slevin, who is leading the investigation, said: ""I continue to appeal to people to come forward, I firmly believe that someone out there may still have information that could help our investigation and I am urging them to call me or one of my team."" :: Anyone with information can call West Midlands Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

He revealed on Twitter on Sunday that he is $53m in debt, writing: ""Please pray we overcome. This is my true heart."" He followed up by appealing directly to one of the world's richest technology entrepreneurs - Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. ""Mark Zuckerberg invest 1 billion dollars into Kanye West ideas,"" he wrote. ""Mark Zuckerberg  I know it’s your birthday but can you please call me by tomorrow?  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg ""You love hip hop, you love my art … I am your favourite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house."" He also asked for help from one of Google's co-founders, adding: ""Hey Larry Page I'm down for your help too."" West later explained that he was not only asking for money for himself. He tweeted: ""I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity. ""Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family. ""But I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world."" He added: If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artists end up. ""Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money."" West is not the first successful rapper to have money troubles. 50 Cent - the stage name of Curtis Jackson - filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year."
2016-02-15,A six-year-old girl has died after being bitten by a brown snake in Australia.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160215150500/http://news.sky.com/story/1642178/six-year-old-girl-dies-from-brown-snake-bite,"A six-year-old girl has died after being bitten by a brown snake in Australia. The youngster and her family were reportedly unaware she had been bitten until it was too late to save her life. She was bitten on Friday near Walgett, around 400 miles (650km) northwest of Sydney, and was rushed to a local hospital when she was almost comatose. Doctors gave her anti-venom before she was flown to Sydney Children's Hospital on life support. However, her condition deteriorated and she was transferred back to Walgett Hospital where she died on Saturday. It is understood the youngster trod on the snake at the family home when she was bitten. Walgett Shire deputy mayor Jane Keir, who is a registered nurse, told the Sydney Morning Herald: ""I believe the family didn't know she'd been bitten and, by the time they'd realised, she was comatose. ""The little girl could have been on the edge of Sydney and the result would have been the same."" Fatalities as a result of snakebites in Australia are extremely rare - despite it being home to 20 of the world's 25 most venomous snakes. There are about 3,000 snakebite cases in the country each year, with 300 to 500 needing anti-venom treatment. Only an average of two a year prove fatal, official figures show. The eastern brown snake causes more deaths than any other species, according to the Australian Museum."

He says he was contacted by someone claiming to represent Kanye West, who offered to sell him rights to his new album The Life Of Pablo for the huge sum. Mr Shkreli says he paid the fee using 37,000 Bitcoin, a virtual currency which is 'mined' by high-powered computers. In a series of angry and panicked tweets, he wrote: ""Who the f*** has my fifteen million dollars?? I need my money back this isn't a f****** joke."" ""This is the worst day of my life. My mom said don't deal with these kinds of people. Nothing good comes from rap music."" I hope you all enjoy this stupid music SO much and the fact it has brought me so much pain and suffering. I quit rap. Also, idiots, I've gotten in touch with Sitoshi (Bitcoin's creator) and he's agreed to help me get my money back. I always win. And second of all I can make the money back faster than anyone so the joke is on YOU if you think I even care. Mr Shkreli has form when it comes to spending big money on hip hop releases. He purchased the only copy of a limited edition Wu-Tang Clan album last year for $2m. It came amid a public shaming for raising the price of a vital drug owned by the company by 5,000%. He rounded off his rant by saying: ""I hope you all enjoy this stupid music SO much and the fact it has brought me so much pain and suffering. I quit rap.

2016-02-15,"As a commercial jet is forced to abandon its course after a laser beam is shone into its cockpit, Sky News looks at high intensity lasers and the dangers they pose to aircraft if used recklessly.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160215150500/http://news.sky.com/story/1642294/how-dangerous-are-laser-beams-to-planes,"As a commercial jet is forced to abandon its course after a laser beam is shone into its cockpit, Sky News looks at high intensity lasers and the dangers they pose to aircraft if used recklessly. The Virgin Atlantic flight was on its way to New York on Sunday night but had to return to London after one of the pilots had a ""medical issue"" following the incident. :: How common are laser incidents in the UK? Between 2009 and June 2015, more than 8,998 laser incidents across the UK were reported to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). There were 414 laser incidents in the first six months of 2015 alone, CAA figures show. The vast majority - 48 - were reported at London's Heathrow Airport, which is not surprising as it has the most planes and is situated in a densely populated area. Some 32 incidents were reported at Birmingham International, 24 at Leeds Bradford Airport, 23 at Manchester Airport and 22 at London City and London Gatwick airports. The data shows a dramatic increase from a total of 746 incidents in 2009, rising to 1,500 in 2010, peaking at 1,912 in 2011. In 2012 some 1,571 laser incidents were reported to the CAA, falling to 1,394 in 2013, rising again to 1,440 in 2014, with 168 incidents at Heathrow, followed by 107 at Manchester. :: How dangerous are they? A laser can result in temporary vision loss associated with flash blindness, according to the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA). BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ""Aircraft are attacked with lasers at an alarming rate and with lasers with ever-increasing strength. ""It is an incredibly dangerous thing to do. Shining a laser at an aircraft puts that aircraft, its crew and all the passengers on board at completely unnecessary risk. ""Modern lasers have the power to blind, and certainly to act as a huge distraction and to dazzle the pilots during critical phases of flight."" The union wants ministers to classify lasers as offensive weapons which would give the police more power to arrest people for possessing them if they had no good reason to have them. A British Airways co-pilot reportedly suffered a burned retina in his right eye after a ""military strength"" laser beam was shone into the cockpit of his plane landing at Heathrow in November 2015. He has reportedly been unable to return to work since. :: How powerful are these lasers? One British retailer, Megalaser UK, warns on its website: ""These are not toys! The light can burst balloons, melt plastic, light matches and have a range of up to 100 miles. ""Our lasers are so powerful, you not only see the dot, but can clearly see the entire beam stretching through the sky."" :: Is it legal to point lasers at planes? No. A law was passed in Britain in 2010 which allows offenders to be charged with ""shining a light at an aircraft in flight so as to dazzle or distract the pilot"". A person may be found guilty of ""reckless endangerment"" and sent to prison if the distraction or dazzle is serious,  One man who was prosecuted for dazzling a police helicopter crew with a laser pen did so during a late night garden party in Birmingham. Thermal imaging cameras picked out Chris Vowles, 23, from Sandwell, as he laughed and toasted the prank with friends. The group could be seen gesturing toward the helicopter and raising their beer bottles. He was given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted endangering an aircraft. :: Who uses laser pointers and pens? It is not illegal to buy a laser and they are easy to get hold of. They are often used in business presentations, in industry to show specific distances, by revellers at nightclubs and by the military to mark targets at night."
2016-02-15,The FTSE 100 has opened higher following strong gains in Asian stock markets including the Japanese Nikkei which climbed 7.2% - its eleventh biggest daily gain ever.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160215150500/http://news.sky.com/story/1642142/ftse-opens-higher-as-asian-stocks-soar,"The FTSE 100 has opened higher following strong gains in Asian stock markets including the Japanese Nikkei which climbed 7.2% - its eleventh biggest daily gain ever. The positive momentum has spilled over into Europe with all of the major European markets opening around 2% higher. The strong gains to the Nikkei came despite weaker than expected GDP numbers. The Japanese economy shrank at the seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.4% in the final quarter of last year - worse than the expected 0.8% contraction - and down from a 1.3% expansion in the previous quarter. The Japanese currency - the yen - has performed exceptionally strongly up 6% against the US dollar in February alone despite a 0.6% weakening following Monday's data.  A strong yen makes Japanese exports less completive on the global markets and this was cited as one of the key reason for the sharp sell-offs in Japanese shares last week.  Elsewhere in Asia the People's Bank of China set the reference rate - around which the yuan is allowed to trade - 0.3% stronger.  This prompted the currency's biggest one-day appreciation since the peg to the US dollar was abandoned in July 2005. The yuan is now in positive territory for 2016. In the first trading session since the Lunar New Year holiday the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.6%. The modest fall came despite weaker than expected trade numbers. Chinese exports fell 11% to £122bn in January while imports slipped 19% to £79bn. The South Korean market closed 1.5% higher, whilst the main Australian market climbed 1.6%."

Kate McCann, 47, is among several high-profile figures taking part in a two-week campaign to promote Child Rescue Alerts.  The nationwide service, also backed by Bob Geldof and actor Stephen Fry, sends out free alerts to registered members of the public when a child goes missing or their life is thought to be at risk. Kate McCann and her husband with an age-progressed image of Madeleine Mrs McCann said that if a similar system had been in place when three-year-old Madeleine went missing from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2007, it is possible she may have been found. ""If enough people had been mobilised and galvanised early then who knows what the outcome would have been,"" she told The Sun. She said that her research over the years had led her to believe that her daughter's kidnapper did not take her far from the Algarve. ""That's where she last was and I don't think she's been taken a million miles from there. I've always said Praia da Luz is the place where I feel closest to her. ""The urge to look for Madeleine absolutely hasn't changed at all. You hear all the time about people who have been missing for years being found. There have been so many cases like that. ""We will never give up. You couldn't settle if you thought about giving up. I want an end, an answer. Whatever that it is."" Fry is the face of the Child Rescue Alerts, appearing in adverts and posters as a comic book version of himself.  As part of the two-week campaign, adverts will appear in shopping centres, the London Underground and railway stations across the UK. The system, which first became available to the public in 2014, is run by the National Crime Agency, the charity Missing People and the education technology company Groupcall, which was co-founded by Geldof.   Promoting the alerts earlier this year, Geldof said they were a ""no-brainer"". ""If your child went missing and their life was in immediate danger you would want to get the message out in minutes,"" he said. ""If you care about children's safety please sign up today at childrescuealert.org.uk."" To receive the alerts, which are funded by the Royal Mail and People's Postcode Lottery, members of the public can register for geographically-targeted texts, emails or app notifications. :: To register and receive text alerts, text HERO and your postcode to 85080, sign up online at childrescuealert.org.uk or download the app."

Laser incidents reported to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in 2014 Virgin confirmed Flight VS025 to JFK - which had 252 passengers and 15 crew on board - had been abandoned as a ""precautionary measure"" after the plane's First Officer reported ""feeling unwell"". All the passengers on the flight - which took off just before 8pm - are safe, but they will have to wait until 1pm on Monday to continue their journey because of ""limited availability"". Passenger Bethany McHutchinson told Sky News: ""I think it's really scary, whether it was by accident or on purpose. ""If anything had happened, if it had been really serious, it could have put everyone's lives on the plane in danger."" A spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic USA said: ""The safety of our crew and customers is our top priority and we apologise for any inconvenience to those onboard."" The airline said it is working with authorities to identify the source of the ""laser beam incident"". Metropolitan Police said they had been contacted at around 9.35pm but were still trying to establish where the offence took place. Police have previously warned over high-powered lasers being aimed at aircraft, saying there could be ""disastrous consequences"" through disorientation or momentary loss of control. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson said: ""Shining a laser at an aircraft in flight could pose a serious safety risk and it is a criminal offence to do so."" A laser can result in temporary vision loss associated with flash blindness, according to the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), which wants ministers to classify lasers as offensive weapons Balpa general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ""This is not an isolated incident.

The company, which employs about 5,000 people at its London base, launched a review in April on where it should be based in response to sweeping reforms in the banking sector. It said the decision to remain was unanimous, adding in a statement: ""London is one of the world's leading international financial centres and home to a large pool of highly skilled, international talent. ""It remains therefore ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC."" HSBC had been concerned about tax changes, implemented since the financial crisis, which were costing banks hundreds of millions of pounds a year. However, a move by Chancellor George Osborne to make reforms to the banking taxation system - reducing HSBC's long-term bills - will also have incentivised the bank to stay put. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said it welcomed HSBC's decision, and claimed it amounted to ""a vote of confidence in the Government's economic plan"". HSBC was based in Hong Kong until 1993 - but the recent market and economic turmoil in China is likely to have been a factor in the decision not to return. Analysts had predicted that such a move would have cost HSBC between $1.5bn and $2.5bn (£1.03bn and £1.72bn). The bank has stressed that Asia ""remains at the heart of the Group's strategy"" - and plans to invest more into southeast Asia and China's Pearl River Delta are intact. ""Having our headquarters in the UK and our significant business in Asia Pacific delivers the best of both worlds to our stakeholders,"" HSBC Group's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, added. Mr Gulliver expects the world economy to pivot towards Asia - forecasting that 80% of HSBC profit will soon be derived from the region up from a little over 60% today.  On Saturday, Sky's City Editor Mark Kleinman reported that HSBC will stop reviewing the location of its headquarters every three years - in part because of the resources, cost and management time involved in each exercise. In its statement confirming plans to remain in London, the bank confirmed it will ""only revisit the matter if there is a material change in circumstances"". HSBC is due to announce its annual results on 22 February. Shares in the group have fallen 18% since the start of 2016 - and are down more than 30% compared to April 2015, when the HQ review began. The bank is currently in the process of cutting 50,000 jobs - or about a fifth of its global workforce - by the end of 2017."

2016-02-15,Liam Fox is the man Conservative members would most like to see as their party's next leader.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160215150500/http://news.sky.com/story/1640301/who-do-tory-grassroots-want-as-next-leader,"By Sophy Ridge, Senior Political Correspondent Liam Fox is the man Conservative members would most like to see as their party's next leader. The Conservative Home poll of members was greeted with incredulity by some in Westminster. But, in many ways, it's not surprising at all that Dr Fox is emerging as the dark horse in the race to succeed David Cameron. It's no secret the former Defence Secretary is one of the most ambitious men in politics. He's one of his party's biggest networkers and is building up a  support base among MPs, particularly the new intake who defeated the Lib Dems in the South West. Most importantly, he's driving the campaign to leave the EU. :: Putin Would 'Shed No Tears' Over Brexit The referendum battle could be decisive in the fight to succeed David Cameron. Theresa May, Boris Johnson and George Osborne are the most popular candidates for the leadership after Dr Fox, according to Conservative Home. Mr Osborne and Mrs May are understood to be leaning towards the In camp. That leaves a huge opportunity for an ambitious candidate to mop up support from the Eurosceptic wing. What Boris Johnson decides to do is key, and many Westminster insiders believe he will either lean In or refuse to declare for either side. Priti Patel could be a roadblock if Liam Fox does pitch to be the preferred candidate of the Tory right. The Eurosceptic employment minister is being tipped as a potential leader of the Brexit campaign, and she's being heavily courted by the Out camp. If she becomes the face of Brexit, it will be a high risk strategy - but one that could pay off. Tory MPs are split when it comes to Dr Fox's chances for the leadership. One Conservative minister told me: ""Liam is a charismatic speaker and extremely charming. ""He has done countless local fundraisers and supported dozens of new MPs to win their seats. ""With the EU Brexit campaign as a platform, his message is clearly cutting through. ""Given his popularity with the grassroots and the large body of Eurosceptic MPs who will want to back one of their own, his stock is definitely on the rise."" But when I asked one Conservative MP about Dr Fox's leadership odds, he replied: ""Not a chance. ""The side of the party he represents is led entirely by egos and they would not coalesce around one person. Liam just doesn’t cut it."" Dr Fox didn't make it to the final two in the 2005 leadership race. But rumours persist that David Cameron's backers tactically voted for David Davis in order to keep Dr Fox - who they thought was the stronger candidate - out of the final run off. The jury is still out. But don't make the mistake of thinking the referendum campaign is just about the European Union. The race to be the next Conservative Party leader has already started."

Despite two days of industrial action and nearly 7,000 medical procedures cancelled, the gap between the NHS and the British Medical Association appears to be unbridgeable. The public worries that tired junior doctors will damage their health But the doctors have public support, with polls suggesting between two-thirds and three-quarters of people back their stance to defend the current pay structure which gives a bonus to those working on Saturday. :: Hunt Under Pressure Over Junior Doctors The NHS argues it needs ""certainty"" while battling large budget deficits and staff shortages, and new contracts would have to be in place in August. The Government's calculation is that any escalation of industrial action by junior doctors - which now seems likely - would test the goodwill of patients. The BMA's nuclear option of a ""full withdrawal of labour"" - including emergency services - would draw comparisons with the damaging industrial disputes of the 1970s. As one senior NHS source told the Huffington Post: ""Jeremy Hunt thinks he is Maggie Thatcher taking on the miners. ""But the problem is he doesn't have six months' worth of coal."" Some query whether the Government has the appetite to continue a clash with sons and daughters of many middle-class Tory voters, who appear to be winning the social media publicity war. Remember also that Mr Hunt was brought in to replace Andrew Lansley in 2012 after relations between the Government and NHS staff were sorely tested. And this could just be the start of a bumpy episode. The BMA believes that to deliver the Government's stated aim of a ""truly seven day a week institution"", contracts would have to be changed with other health professionals - including consultants. That could spell a lengthy clash between the Department of Health and those who work for the country's biggest employer."

A song on West's new album - The Life Of Pablo - includes lyrics that claim he propelled her to stardom when he upstaged her at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009 to declare that Beyonce should have won her prize. After her record 1989 was named album of the year at the 58th Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, Swift took to the stage with her many collaborators and said: ""As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to all the young women out there: there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. West interrupts Swift's speech in 2009 ""But if you just focus on the work and don't let those people sidetrack you, some day when you get where you're going you will look around and know it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world."" Swift also won Grammys for best pop vocal album for 1989 and best music video for Bad Blood, her collaboration with rapper Kendrick Lamar. Swift, who scored seven nominations, opened the ceremony with the first TV performance of Out Of The Woods from 1989. The singer, 26, sported a new blonde bob while wearing a skintight black beaded body suit with sheer panels down the sides. Meanwhile, Adele has explained why her performance at the ceremony may not have been as flawless as fans are used to. The singer sang her All I Ask from her album 25 but the sound seemed to disappear early on. She tweeted after the ceremony explaining the technical hitch: ""The piano mics fell on to the piano strings, that's what the guitar sound was. It made it sound out of tune. S**t happens.""

Accompanied by just a pianist for her performance, despite the sound issues early on she remained unfazed and ended it with a tribute to Kendrick Lamar, who won five awards on the night, shouting: ""I love you Kendrick, you're amazing."" Adele later tweeted that she had consoled herself by going for an In-N-Out burger."

He says he was contacted by someone claiming to represent Kanye West, who offered to sell him rights to his new album The Life Of Pablo for the huge sum. Mr Shkreli says he paid the fee using 37,000 Bitcoin, a virtual currency which is 'mined' by high-powered computers. In a series of angry and panicked tweets, he wrote: ""Who the f*** has my fifteen million dollars?? I need my money back this isn't a f****** joke."" ""This is the worst day of my life. My mom said don't deal with these kinds of people. Nothing good comes from rap music."" I hope you all enjoy this stupid music SO much and the fact it has brought me so much pain and suffering. I quit rap. Also, idiots, I've gotten in touch with Sitoshi (Bitcoin's creator) and he's agreed to help me get my money back. I always win. And second of all I can make the money back faster than anyone so the joke is on YOU if you think I even care. Mr Shkreli has form when it comes to spending big money on hip hop releases. He purchased the only copy of a limited edition Wu-Tang Clan album last year for $2m. It came amid a public shaming for raising the price of a vital drug owned by the company by 5,000%. He rounded off his rant by saying: ""I hope you all enjoy this stupid music SO much and the fact it has brought me so much pain and suffering. I quit rap.

The eight-time world boxing champion turned Bible-verse-reciting politician told local broadcaster TV5: ""It's common sense. ""Do you see animals mating with the same sex? Animals are better because they can distinguish male from female. ""If men mate with men and women mate with women, they are worse than animals."" Pacquiao's comments were criticised by the country's most well-known gay comedian Vice Ganda, who tweeted to his 6.7m Twitter followers: ""Some people think they can judge people like God just because they've attended a prayer meeting and read the bible. ""The Senate needs experts on politics and law, not blind prophets."" Pacquiao is known to be more interested in boxing than legislation Kakay Pamaran, a pastor at one of Manila gay churches, told AFP that she pitied Pacquiao. She added: ""Outside the boxing ring, I don't think Manny Pacquiao should be taken seriously."" The boxer later apologised, saying although he still stands by his beliefs he was sorry for hurting people. Gay marriage is illegal in the Philippines, a country where 80% of the 100m population is Catholic. There are gay marriages at some small churches but they are not recognised by the church or the state. Pacquiao, 37, is running for one of 12 seats in the national senate in May and recent polls suggest he is likely to win. This is despite his current record representing his wife's home province of Sarangani in the House of Representatives, where he is known for regular absences and being more interested in his boxing training. Once a womanising gambler, Pacquiao says religion helped him transform his life and, in one of the few times he attended the House, he spoke opposing a law giving free condoms to the poor. The law has since been passed."
2016-02-17,David Cameron's delicate diplomacy arrived back in Brussels - at the European Parliament.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160217004124/http://news.sky.com/story/1643136/angst-and-vexation-hinder-eu-reform-negotiations,"David Cameron's delicate diplomacy arrived back in Brussels - at the European Parliament. As Sky News reported earlier in the month, the European Parliament has been the subject of a prolonged charm offensive, involving royalty, dating back to the very start of Mr Cameron's renegotiation. At the end of this process the need for the approval of MEPs was abundantly clear, even if an unusually shy Prime Minister did not want to talk about his visit and cancelled a consultation with the parliament's ""Conference of Presidents"", including Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage, and arrived late for a meeting with European Parliament president Martin Schulz. The UKIP leader called the PM ""gutless"" and said he was only willing to speak to ""federalist MEPs who want an EU Army"". Mr Cameron does needs the Euro MPs to fast-track legislation underpinning the emergency brake, the child benefit restrictions, and the measures to curtail freedom of movement abuse. This is the principle of ""co-decision"". This should not be a problem for the deal, Mr Schulz told me that an agreement at the EU summit would provide a ""frame"" for the immediate discussion of European Parliament legislation. Another leading Euro MP told Sky News that the Parliament would not ""veto"" the EU deal, but would shape it. This process can only really get going after a referendum victory, however. I understand that the European leaders will issue a declaration of support alongside any EU summit deal in the early hours of Friday morning. However the mere prospect of 751 MEPs being able to unpick any part of the EU deal is rather difficult for David Cameron domestically. It rather reinforces for mild sceptics the idea that the UK is not fully sovereign. It also gives rise to questions about the PM's assertion that this deal will be ""legally binding and irreversible"". Some of his sceptic Cabinet ministers just might have been won back by ""proper full-on"" treaty change. It was never going to happen, given the pan-European revolt against political establishments. But the deal is not done at the EU summit level either. Twenty-eight leaders cannot create a stage-managed row. Angst in Paris about Britain getting a de facto financial services veto, and slowing down eurozone integration is very real. The vexation of the Visegrad Four nations is focused on the export of child benefit. Mr Cameron's manifesto commitment of no export of child benefit is already watered down to no export of child benefit at British rates. Now as Romania's Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos told me in Brussels, regarding child benefit: ""Yes... only start the moment we take this decision... for new applicants."" This argument will run into Wednesday as EU and UK officials have their last round of 'sherpa' talks on what could be some significant last minute changes to the draft deal. And then into the early hours of Friday morning and debates about leaders, and calculations that the PM wants to announce this referendum on Friday."

Rain, with gale force winds of between 50 and 70mph, is expected to hit northwest Scotland, moving southeast into England, turning into snow by Wednesday. Cold, wet and windy conditions including a ""risk of snow"" - possibly no more than 0.8in (2cm) - could reach the Midlands, north east England and north of London, according to the Met Office. It has issued a yellow - be aware - warning for Wednesday into Thursday, and warned there could be freezing temperatures if it snows and therefore ""a risk of ice as well"". The Met Office said: ""Please be aware of the potential for some difficult driving conditions overnight and into the Wednesday morning rush hour. A yellow severe weather warning for #snow has been issued:https://t.co/h9QdjP67GG Stay #weatheraware @metofficeuk pic.twitter.com/PRKnTI6Hil ""Rain seems likely to turn to sleet and snow in places during Wednesday night across parts of central and southern England, before gradually easing and clearing away southeastwards on Thursday morning. ""Please be aware of the possibility of localised disruption to travel."" Some sleety wet snow could hit East Anglia, the East and West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, with temperatures of around 2C-4C - and 6C-7C in parts of Scotland. However, the wintry conditions will become much milder by Saturday, reaching around 10C-12C. Sky News weather producer, Joanna Robinson, said: ""Wednesday will see rain spreading across more of England and Wales, but it probably won't reach the far South East. ""As it turns colder through the evening and overnight, there'll be a greater chance of snow. ""There is a lot of uncertainty, but North East England, the Midlands and later East Anglia could see some wet snow on Wednesday, even to low levels. ""The London area could see a little snow too, but it's unlikely to settle. Wednesday and Thursday night will be frosty, but from Friday it will turn milder from the south."""

The teenager, who broke down several times during the second day of her evidence in his trial on sex charges, said: ""I didn't know what sort of person he was. ""For someone to be texting a 15-year-old girl, they're not completely normal."" The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared on a live video link and was cross-examined by Johnson's barrister Orlando Pownall QC. He asked her whether she ""absolutely hated"" Johnson now. Johnson used to play for Sunderland She replied: ""Yes, I do, after everything he's put us through. ""He told everyone he was innocent and he made people call me a liar. ""He let people cheer him on in matches and he let people call me all the names under the sun."" Mr Pownall accused her of lying over various things, but particularly exaggerating the level of sexual activity that happened in the player's Range Rover. He said she had not mentioned the most serious behaviour, a particular sex act, when she first went to the police. She told the jury at Bradford Crown Court: ""I knew what was going on was wrong, but I didn't realise the extent of how wrong it was. It's been explained now that he took advantage of me. ""I knew it was wrong, but I thought I was at fault because I should have said no."" Mr Pownall said she was lying when she claimed she hadn't originally mentioned the most serious allegations ""to protect Adam Johnson"". She said: ""I am not trying to protect him now. He did nothing to protect me and he made me out to be a liar."" Mr Pownall suggested she had made much of the running in her relationship with Johnson, with her own mother warning her not to stalk the former Sunderland player. The girl said: ""I thought as soon as I told him my age he would back off, but he didn't. I thought he was a bit creepy because of the messages he was sending me. ""Who asks for a random fan's number? Why would Adam Johnson just message me out of the blue? I thought 'why me?'"" The girl admitted telling friends about her meeting with Johnson and ""doing things"". She said: ""I was trying to big myself up, as any 15-year-old girl would, because I knew a lot of people who've done the same. ""When you idolise someone you are not thinking at the time."" The girl was also questioned about why she tried to contact another Sunderland player, striker Connor Wickham, through social media after the incident with Johnson. She told the jury she did not remember doing this. Johnson, 28, denies two charges of sexual activity with a child under 16. He has admitted a similar charge and a charge of grooming. The trial continues."

Heysham 1 and Hartlepool will continue to generate power for additional five years - up until 2024, while Heysham 2 and Torness will see their life extended by seven years to 2030. The protected jobs comprise 2,000 full time employees together with 1,000 contractors.   In October EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) signed a strategic investment agreement for joint investment in the construction of two EPR (European Pressurized Reactor) nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. However since this questions regarding the feasibility of the project have arisen. A final investment decision was expected to have already been taken. EDF chairman Jean Bernard Levy told a news conference in Paris today: ""We intend to proceed quickly with the final investment decision on Hinkley Point but there is a little work to complete, particularly because we could not finalise the discussions with our Chinese partners before their own break, before the Chinese New Year. ""There is still a little work to complete but, today, we believe that the final investment decision is very close."" Despite that they're not likely to be live until at least 2025 the Hinkley reactors are forecast to provide 7% if the UK electricity requirements which means the UK's energy security would be called into question should the project be delayed or even scrapped.  Newport MP Paul Flynn tweeted ""All EPR reactors are late and billions over budget, EDF is in crisis. Time to abandon Hinkley farce, unworkable as subsidy bill soars"". Given that have EDF already spent more than £1bn preparing the site in Somerset on which Hinkley C may be built any decision to abort would be an expensive one. The company's share price has fallen 56% in the 12 last months - meaning that - somewhat perversely - the cost of Hinkley (€30bn) is 50% bigger than the company's market value. EDF are financing two thirds of the Hinkley project with the Chinese stumping up the rest of the cash. EDF had initially wanted to own less than 50% of the plant so that the investment could be recognised off balance sheet but it was forced to increase its stake following the crisis at it's rival firm Areva. The  will in due course consider bringing other investors into the project. Today's announcement comes alongside the Paris-based firm's annual results which show that its losses for 2015 have worsened by 1.5% to £2bn. Meanwhile the company's UK arm, EDF energy,  has seen underlying operating profit slip 15% to £664m which the firm attributes to the ongoing cost of its investment programme."

2016-02-17,"Tests of a potentially revolutionary cancer therapy have had ""extraordinary"" results on terminally ill patients, scientists have revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160217004124/http://news.sky.com/story/1642626/extraordinary-cancer-breakthrough-revealed,"Tests of a potentially revolutionary cancer therapy have had ""extraordinary"" results on terminally ill patients, scientists have revealed. In one study, more than nine out of ten participants with a severe form of leukaemia saw their symptoms completely vanish. Four out of five patients with some other blood cancers responded positively to the treatment and more than half ended up symptom free. Lead scientist Professor Stanley Riddell, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, US, said the results were among patients who were projected to have two to five months to live. He said: ""This is extraordinary. This is unprecedented in medicine to be honest, to get response rates in this range in these very advanced patients."" The technique involves removing immune cells called T-cells from patients, tagging them with ""receptor"" molecules that target cancer, and putting them back into the body in an infusion. The targeting molecules, known as chimeric antigen receptors or Cars, came from specially bred genetically engineered mice. Once attached to the T-cells, they reduce the ability of the cancer to shield itself from the body's natural immune system. Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in Washington DC, Prof Riddell described the results as a ""potential paradigm shift"" in cancer treatment. Much more work was required, he said, adding that it was not clear how long the symptom-free patients would remain in remission. Prof Riddell hopes to try the therapy on patients suffering from cancers with solid tumours, but said they would present challenges. Although the body's natural immune system is geared to tackle cancer, it is often unable to. Sometimes, the body's defences cannot recognise cancer cells or they find ingenious ways to mask their identity.  In the most promising of Prof Riddell's studies, around 35 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were treated with the modified cells. Almost all - 94% - went into complete remission. Being in remission is not the same as saying they are cured, because the symptoms can return.  Here, medics are urging caution. Dr Yvonne Doyle, from Public Health England, said: ""It's an important breakthrough, in that it's a new technology that seems to have developed something innovative. ""However, it is on 30 patients who are at a very advanced stage of a particular cancer. So what we need to know is does this work in a wider situation?""  The treatment is similar to a technique used with success last year on Layla Richards, a one-year-old girl with ALL, by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital, who described the results as ""staggering"". A consultant immunologist who treated Layla, Professor Waseem Qasim, told Sky News it was still early days: ""We will have to wait and see how these type of treatments play out for solid cancers such as cancers of the lung or the bowel or the breast and so on… ""The first tranche of investigations and successes I think will be in the blood-type cancers."""

The state-run Herald newspaper said that millions of rands and a body were discovered on the jet which was flying from Germany to South Africa. David Chawota, general manager of the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe, confirmed that a plane registered with Western Global Airlines - which is based in Estero, Florida - was impounded in Harare on Sunday. ""The case is now in the hands of the state. It involves nationals and property of other countries ... but yes we impounded the plane on Sunday,"" he said. ""The crew requested to land for refuelling but our ground-handling personnel discovered blood leaks and became suspicious."" The crew included two Americans, a South African and a Pakistani, according to The Herald."

The German-owned company currently employs around 28,000 workers in more than 600 stores across the country. By the end of the year, it expects to have 700 outlets. Aldi regional managing director Ruth Doyle said: ""To support our continued expansion and the ongoing performance of our existing stores, it's important that we attract the right candidates across all of our roles. ""We're looking for individuals with a real passion for retail who are seeking a long-term career with a growing and ambitious business. ""Aldi provides all staff with extensive training and development opportunities to ensure they have the necessary skills to make a real success of their career."" Aldi said it had invested heavily in its academy, which is based in Bolton and has recruitment specialists who train staff. Established supermarket chains in Britain have faced pressure to cut prices since after the recession when the discount chains began their assault on the shopping habits of consumers. In November the combined market share of Aldi and Lidl, another German chain, surpassed 10% in the UK for the first time, according to the research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Aldi and Lidl have doubled their market share in just three years, expanding their offerings to more locations at a time when inflation has already been weak because of the collapse in world oil prices. The most recent figures from Kantar show that Aldi's growth rate continues to accelerate. In the 12 weeks to the end of January, till receipts increased nearly 14% versus the same period last year."
2016-02-17,"UK inflation rose in line with expectations to 0.3% in the year to January, according to official figures from the ONS.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160217004124/http://news.sky.com/story/1642820/uk-inflation-climbs-to-0-3-percent-in-january,"UK inflation rose in line with expectations to 0.3% in the year to January, according to official figures from the ONS. This is the third consecutive month of small increases to price levels, with the growth rate in January 2016 being the same as it was in January 2015. A rate of 0.3% means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in January 2015 would have cost £100.30 in January 2016. Petrol prices dropped by 1.9%, compared with a larger fall of 7.3% between the same two months a year ago. A similar, though less pronounced, effect was seen for diesel, with prices falling by 4%, compared with a fall of 6% a year ago. Clothing, food and alcohol prices all helped push up the cost of the basket. The Bank of England is under little pressure to raise interest rates It  would have risen further had it not been for the offsetting impact of lower priced air fares, which have benefited from a 42% fall in jet fuel prices. Air fair prices, overall, fell 36% compared with a smaller fall of 17% a year ago according to the ONS.  Commenting on the figures, Sky News economics editor, Ed Conway,  said: ""The rate of inflation is still perilously close to what some economists call deflation. ""The Bank of England will look at this and say to itself there is no immediate pressure to raise interest rates"". Drinkers will be disappointed to hear that the price of alcoholic beverages increased by 5.2% between December 2015 and January 2016, compared with an increase of 3.2% between the same two months a year ago. The UK's core inflation measure which strips out volatile energy costs slowed to 1.2% - lower than the expectations of analysts who had pencilled in a 1.3% rise. Last year saw very low inflation throughout - with the rate being at or close to zero for most of the year. Prices for transport costs, food and non-alcoholic beverages were either static or falling, with only restaurant and hotel bills seeing significant increases."

Companies that fail to put safeguards in place will face civil sanctions under a new legal framework announced by the Government. A public consultation will determine the best way to protect underage children from viewing X-rated material. Although figures are hard to verify, Comscore statistics from last year show that one in 10 UK visitors to adult websites were children. Internet Safety and Security Minister Baroness Shields said: “The internet is a tremendous resource for learning and creativity but it is important to make sure that children are able to make the most of all it has to offer in a safe way. ""Keeping children safe online is one of government's greatest priorities. ""Just as we do offline, we want to make sure children are prevented from accessing pornographic content online which should only be viewed by adults.” ""So we are delivering on our manifesto promise by launching this consultation today, which proposes we require companies providing this pornographic content to ensure they have safeguards in place to ensure those accessing their websites are over 18."" A public consultation on the new regulatory framework will run until 12 April. Under the plans, payment providers and advertisers will be able to withdraw services from pornography websites that disobey the law. Peter Wanless, Chief Executive of the NSPCC, said: ""Every day ChildLine receives calls and messages from young people who feel they are being badly affected by the way they and their friends can view unlimited online pornography. ""As a matter of urgency we must prevent children having ready access to content rated over 18 as it can give them a warped view of sexual relationships."""

Lyndsay Turner, 34, was behind the wheel of the car for the first time when she hit her son Liam in June last year, Norwich Coroner's Court heard. In a statement she said she was pulling the car into a parking area near their home in Adland Road, Watton, Norfolk, after asking her husband to teach her to drive. Liam was playing with his older sister nearby when Mrs Turner's foot slipped and the car ""jolted suddenly forward"", she told police. Her husband Stephen Turner, 37, who was supervising his wife from outside the vehicle, picked Liam up from underneath the car and drove him towards a hospital before flagging down an ambulance. He was airlifted to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, but died a short time later. He had suffered a serious head injury and irreversible brain damage. Deputy Coroner Nicholas Holroyd recorded a conclusion of accidental death. He told the couple: ""This was an appalling tragedy and you both have my profound sympathy for this loss. ""There are very few parents who when looking back haven't said to themselves 'that was a near thing', tragically this ended as disastrously as it did."" The couple chose not to comment after the hearing, but shortly after Liam's death they issued a statement saying there were ""devastated by the loss of our darling little man"". ""Liam was a happy, content little boy who was always smiling and laughing,"" they said. ""He had a wonderful sense of humour and brought joy to the lives of everyone who knew him. He was deeply loved. ""Life will not be the same without him."" Although Mrs Turner was driving on a public road without a driving licence and no insurance, PC Forbes Scott told the court the Crown Prosecution Service had decided it was not in the public interest to bring charges against her."

Kate McCann and her husband with an age-progressed image of Madeleine Mrs McCann said that if a similar system had been in place when three-year-old Madeleine went missing from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2007, it is possible she may have been found. ""If enough people had been mobilised and galvanised early then who knows what the outcome would have been,"" she told The Sun. She said that her research over the years had led her to believe that her daughter's kidnapper did not take her far from the Algarve. ""That's where she last was and I don't think she's been taken a million miles from there. I've always said Praia da Luz is the place where I feel closest to her. ""The urge to look for Madeleine absolutely hasn't changed at all. You hear all the time about people who have been missing for years being found. There have been so many cases like that. ""We will never give up. You couldn't settle if you thought about giving up. I want an end, an answer. Whatever that it is."" Fry is the face of the Child Rescue Alerts, appearing in adverts and posters as a comic book version of himself.  As part of the two-week campaign, adverts will appear in shopping centres, the London Underground and railway stations across the UK. The system, which first became available to the public in 2014, is run by the National Crime Agency, the charity Missing People and the education technology company Groupcall, which was co-founded by Geldof.   Promoting the alerts earlier this year, Geldof said they were a ""no-brainer"". ""If your child went missing and their life was in immediate danger you would want to get the message out in minutes,"" he said.

The move followed the North's recent long-range rocket launch and apparent nuclear test. South Korean President Park Geun-hye Those actions and threats to carry out more ""extreme acts of provocation"" show North Korea has no interest in peace, she said in a speech to parliament. She told members: ""The suspension of the Kaesong industrial zone is only the start of a series of actions we will be taking together with the international community. ""The government will take strong and effective measures for the North to come to the bone-numbing realisation that nuclear development will not help its survival but rather it will only speed up the collapse of the regime."" Seoul and the United States say the rocket launch was in fact a test of a long-range missile that violated UN Security Council resolutions.

This is where some of the key European players stand on the UK's demands. :: FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French President The UK and French leaders agree there is a 'firm basis to reach agreement' Main area of disagreement is on the future interaction of the Eurozone with non-Eurozone members, notably on whether too much protection will be provided to the City of London. Number 10 now insist after talks in Paris there is ""a firm basis to reach agreement at this week's summit"". :: ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor David Cameron and Angela Merkel are close political friends Has been pivotal in the process of getting other EU leaders on-board with David Cameron's reform agenda. Close political friends, she supports the PM's deal. In Hamburg on Friday she said: ""These concerns that David Cameron has raised with the European Union are not only understandable - but we even support them."" :: BOHUSLAV SOBOTKA, Czech Prime Minister The Czech Prime Minister has warned over discrimination It was the Czech Prime Minister who initially suggested the idea of a so-called emergency brake on in-work benefits after he objected to an outright ban. He told David Cameron last month: ""It is very important for us that any solution that is adopted on a European level does not discriminate."" :: VIKTOR ORBAN, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said his citizen's should not be seen as 'parasites' A political ally of David Cameron, the nationalist Hungarian PM has been widely supportive of his reform plan but insisted his citizens should not be viewed as ""parasites"". He told the Prime Minister: ""We do not want to go to the UK and take away something from them. We don't want to be parasites. We want to work there. And I see that Hungarians are working very well. ""Those Hungarians that are working well and contributing to the UK economy, they should get respect and they should not suffer discrimination."" :: LARS LOKKE RASMUSSEN, Danish Prime Minister The Danes are fully on board with Britain's reform plan These two men are close political friends, so it will come as no surprise that the Danes are fully on board with Britain’s reform plan. On the most controversial bit, curbing migrants welfare, Mr Rasmussen said: ""The package also contains an emergency brake which is specifically designed to handle the particular problems faced by the UK in regard to in-work benefits. ""That is perfectly understandable and acceptable to us."" :: BEATA SZYDLO, Polish Prime Minister The Polish PM argues her citizen's are helping support the UK economy Poland has been a difficult country for David Cameron to win over. Around one million Poles work in the UK and so the prospect of new welfare curbs on EU workers has been particularly contentious in Warsaw. Recently the Prime Minister said: ""There are always topics that need to be ironed out. ""Over a million Poles live and work in Britain. ""Their work is growing Britain's GDP and we want them to enjoy the same kind of opportunities for development as Britons."" :: DACIAN CIOLOS, Romanian Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos has concerns over benefit curbs There are similar concerns in Bucharest, with 175,000 Romanians now living in Britain. Mr Ciolos recently told reporters: ""I have said it several times, that Romania wants to find a solution for Great Britain to remain in the EU."" But concerns about benefits curbs persist.  :: CHARLES MICHEL, Belgian Prime Minister Belgium could be the biggest stumbling block to the UK demands Potentially the most potent opposition may come from the heart of the EU. It may be subject to veto by up to six separate Belgian parliaments, including one in French-speaking Wallonia and the assembly of the 76,000-strong German-speaking community. Yes, really. And their concerns range from migrant benefits curbs, objection to Britain opting out of ""ever closer union"" to concerns over binding future EU treaty change triggering complex internal problems."

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the Government managed to raise £11.2bn more than it spent in January - partly due to a £200m increase in self-assessment income tax receipts. It meant, the ONS said, that the cumulative deficit for the year to date stood at £66.5bn - giving the Chancellor only £7bn to play with in February and March in order to meet  his £73.5bn full year deficit target in the year to April. Mr Osborne said while the figures showed the deficit was falling, there was still more work to do. He added: ""We've learned there is no shortcut to fixing the public finances and when confronted with global economic turbulence, we can't let up in taking the action necessary to build a resilient economy and deliver economic security for working people. ""With warnings of a weaker outlook for the economy and the challenges for future tax receipts this could bring, we cannot be complacent in thinking the job is done."" UK economist at Capital Economics, Paul Hollingsworth, said the surplus was welcome for the Chancellor ahead of his Budget next month. ""Admittedly, there is nearly always a surplus in January, thanks to payments of corporation and income tax receipts. ""Nonetheless, this still leaves the Chancellor with some work to do over the next few months if he still wants to meet this forecast. ""After all, he is left with around £7bn left to borrow in February and March - last year he borrowed almost £15bn."""

2016-02-19,A specialist team of police officers is adopting old-fashioned methods to boost arrests of persistent criminals.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160219192449/http://news.sky.com/story/1644493/how-police-super-recognisers-hunt-criminals,"By Martin Brunt, Crime Correspondent A specialist team of police officers is adopting old-fashioned methods to boost arrests of persistent criminals. Scotland Yard's Super Recognisers use nothing more than their remarkable memory to match images of suspects caught on CCTV. Often they need only a fleeting glimpse of a suspect to link a series of crimes committed by the same offender. They trawl the force database of 90,000 CCTV images of suspects from unsolved crimes. Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville, head of the unit, said: ""We've found that certain officers were just very good at looking at faces, or bits of faces, an ear or a nose, a suspect's gait, and recognising the same characteristics in other footage of unsolved crimes. ""What it means is that instead of a criminal getting charged for one offence from one bit of CCTV evidence, we can link their crimes and charge them with 10, 20, 30 or even 40 crimes. ""That means they are more likely to plead guilty and more likely to go to prison."" The squad was created after success in identifying many suspects during the London riots in 2011. In 2014 it helped track the last-known movements of schoolgirl murder victim Alice Gross in West London. The Super Recognisers were called in by police this year to help trace gangs involved in sexual assaults during New Year's Eve celebrations in Cologne. :: Cologne NYE Attacks: Cases Rise To 516 The squad's latest target was a robber Craig Adams, 33, who was sentenced to seven years in jail on Friday at the Inner London Crown Court. Super Recogniser PC Kenny Long was given a CCTV image of a suspect wielding a machete to rob a fast food store. It didn't take him long to link that attack with a string of others in which shop staff were threatened into handing over cash from tills. PC Long said: ""I managed to see part of his face from several angles, so it wasn't as difficult as some."" The officer found enough evidence of Adams's crimes to persuade him to plead guilty to 13 robberies in which he stole £4,300, and three burglaries."

The aircraft, with five people on board, came down near Pearl Harbor. A 16-year-old boy is in a critical condition, while a 45-year-old woman and 50-year-old man are stable. Information was not available about two others on board, including the pilot. One of the passengers was reported to be in a critical condition In the footage, a man on the shore was heard to say ""Oh, c***"" as the private helicopter smashed into the water just off shore. Members of the public were reported to have jumped in to pull the victims to safety. One of them was Max Burner who said the helicopter started ""sputtering"" at about 500ft before crashing. He was quoted by the website Hawaii News Now as saying: ""As soon as it hit the water, some people popped out."" Witness Roy Gano said: ""My initial reaction was 'This helicopter is kinda low flying'. ""It then hovered for a second and then started to descend. It was not spinning out of control, but it was dropping at a good rate. ""It narrowly missed the rocky edge and turned to its side. I saw people dive into the water to help."" Other witnesses described seeing smoke coming from the helicopter's tail shortly before it crashed. Two of the victims were taken to Pali Momi Medical Center and the others were being treated at The Queen's Medical Center. US Navy spokeswoman Agnes Tauyan said the private helicopter went down near the Arizona Memorial visitor centre and then sank."

The Supreme Court has ruled that judges have been wrongly interpreting part of a law which allows individuals to be convicted of murder even if that person did not participate directly in the killing. It ruled that judges had ""taken a wrong turn in the 80s"" in the way they direct juries in the law of joint enterprise. The ruling follows the case of Ameen Jogee (l) and Mohammed Hirsi (r) :: Who Has Been Jailed Under Joint Enterprise? It overturned two cases of murder where it was claimed the defendants should have had 'foresight' that a murder was likely to occur. One was the fatal stabbing of former Leicestershire police officer Paul Fyfe, who was stabbed to death in 2011. Mohammed Hirsi was convicted of the murder, while Ameen Jogee was convicted under joint enterprise. His widow, Tracey Fyfe, said she was ""shocked "" and ""devastated"". ""I think they have made a very wrong decision. It is opening up a can of worms,"" she said. ""It is literally meaning that criminals like Ameen Jogee will be getting literally away with murder. ""I think Ameen Jogee is just as guilty as Hirsi ... He was there at the doorway, where it happened, egging him on."" Jogee claimed he was not in the room when the victim was murdered and did not see the knife, so could not have had knowledge that a murder would be committed. The Supreme Court has agreed, ruling that foresight is simple evidence of intent to assist or encourage, rather than proof someone knew a murder would result. The law was also used in the killing of Stephen Lawrence and the murder of Garry Newlove, killed after confronting a group outside his Warrington home."
2016-02-19,EU referendum campaigning starts here. But just who are the Brexiteers and the Remainistas?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160219192449/http://news.sky.com/story/1643638/eu-vote-who-are-team-in-and-team-out,"EU referendum campaigning starts here. But just who are the Brexiteers and the Remainistas? Officially there can only be two campaign groups - one for leave and one for remain - and they will be designated by the Electoral Commission. They get a £600,000 grant and campaign broadcasts, free mailshots and a spending limits of £7m. Other groups get no financial help and are limited to a spend of just £700,000. To win, backing groups need to prove they are cross-party, have broad appeal, are well-organised and can raise the cash to run a decent campaign. It's fairly simple on the ""In"" side of things where there is only one group in the running. On the ""Out"" side of things, it's all gone a bit ""People's Front of Judea"" as Monty Python would put it. There are three groups, two of which have been involved in some fairly unseemly scrapping, and there can be only one. Here's what you need to know about team in and team out. TEAM IN :: Group: Britain Stronger In Europe :: Launched: October 2015 :: Campaign message: The group will hit hard on the economy and the jobs that depend on being in the EU. It will also be strong on the threat to national security if Britain goes it alone and claim Britain will lose influence on global affairs. :: Strategy: The groups will look to target the unconvinced third who have not decided which way to vote (it is accepted research that a third have already decided to vote in and a third to vote out). Britain Stronger In Europe is building teams of thousands of activists across the country with field operations in each of the 12 regions. It also has social media and digital campaigns and a phone bank operation. :: Fire power: Initially funded by key Blair backer Lord Sainsbury, it has now attracted donations from the big Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. :: Leadership: The chairman is former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose. Clearly once the renegotiation deal is done it is hoped David Cameron will front the campaign. :: Other names: June Sarpong - the television presenter, Lord Mandelson, Lady Brady, Sir Danny Alexander and former TUC boss Sir Brendan Barber. Expect interventions from the triumvirate of former prime ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. :: Official designation? Almost certainly. :: Liabilities: In an interview on Sky News Sir Stuart forgot the name of the group. Not good. In fairness it's not the most catchy of names and it does have an unfortunate acronym. TEAM OUT :: GROUP: LEAVE.EU :: Launched: August 2014 :: Campaign message: Immigration is bad for the country, bad for business and we need to regain control of our borders. :: Strategy: To make sure the third who have already decided to vote to leave turn out to vote and to hit lower earners who are more likely to vote out. They have hired an expert in ""the issues that matter to people on lower incomes"". One of the key issues they have identified is that unskilled migrant labour is pushing down wages. Leave.EU has the not inconsiderable machinery of the Bristol call centre of the group's founder and funder, Aaron Banks, at its disposal. Firepower: The insurance magnate and former Conservative turned UKIP donor Mr Banks and fund manager and entrepreneur Jim Mellon. Leadership: The group had been criticised for being too UKIP - party leader Nigel Farage launched the group at the party's 2014 conference. Mr Banks has been the main voice of the party and is the one who has been involved in the spat with rival group Vote Leave. He attempted a merger earlier this year, but failed. :: Other names: For a while Farage but he's since split and gone with Grassroots Out. :: Official designation? Looking unlikely, especially now UKIP has moved to Grassroots Out. Mr Banks has suggested he would be happy to join forces with Grassroots Out and slide in under their campaign, which, incidentally, he is also providing financial assistance to. :: Liabilities: There is a danger it is a little one-man-band, the man being Aaron Banks. :: GROUP: VOTE LEAVE :: Launched: October 2015 :: Campaign Message: Regain UK power over law-making and brokering free trade agreements. Spend the millions given to Brussels on UK services. :: Strategy: Like Britain Stronger In Europe, Vote Leave will target the third in the middle, safe in the knowledge that Nigel Farage will already be doing his bit for the third that have already decided to vote out. Vote Leave is also expected to bag the big Cabinet Brexiteers. :: Firepower: Backing from Tory donor Peter Cruddas, Labour donor John Mills and UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler. Cross-party funding. :: Leadership: Lord Lawson has recently - and controversially - been announced as leader but a ""big name"" is promised. :: Other names: Clearly landing Boris to lead the out campaign would be a coup but it is looking less likely. Theresa May had been another name in the frame but it is becoming clear she will stick by the PM. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director, is Michael Gove's former spad and the two remain close, but whether he can deliver Mr Gove is unclear. Chris Grayling could be up for grabs - he has already indicated he will campaign to leave the EU. Iain Duncan Smith may campaign for out but is very unlikely to sign up to Vote Leave - Mr Cummings once called him ""incompetent"". They also have the support of UKIP's only MP Douglas Carswell. While the group freely admits Mr Farage will be involved in the out campaign they do not want to see him front and centre. :: Official designation? It's the Westminster group and will win some of the big political hitters. :: Liabilities: Dominic Cummings is a polarising figure. He and chief executive Matthew Elliott have also been criticised for their part in the spat with Leave.EU. :: GROUP: GRASSROOTS OUT :: Launched: January 2016 :: Campaign message: We have a single aim: ""Get the UK out of the EU."" :: Strategy: A grassroots movement to bring all anti-EU groups under one big umbrella and take the campaign ""door-by-door, vote-by-vote"". GO promises taskforces of Brexiteers  to take its message across the country claiming it is not another ""leave group"" but a unifying force. Think of the Jeremy Corbyn anti-austerity effect but in an anti-EU way. It has been set up in response to the bickering between the other two groups who have been accused of being too concerned with party politics and not leaving London. :: Firepower: Aaron Banks, the Leave.EU leader, has been providing financial assistance and suggested he would be happy to fall under the GO umbrella. There have even been suggestions GO is a front to gain Farage and UKIP control of the Brexit campaign.. :: Leadership: Names attracted include Dr Liam Fox, Tory MPs Tom Purslove and Peter Bone and Labour MP Kate Hoey who had a big fall out with Vote Leave. :: Other names: It has now also attracted the backing of Nigel Farage and UKIP, which says it's fed up with the sniping between other parties and feels GO truly represents the people. :: Official designation? There have been suggestions GO is not the favourite to win designation. :: Liabilities: It is the new kid on the block and may need to go some to prove to the Electoral Commission it has the organisation and cash to succeed."

James Nichols, 44, and Luis Valenzuela, 43, are accused of carrying out the attacks over a three-year period, beginning in 2008. The two officers, who have been on unpaid leave since 2013, were arrested and formally charged on Wednesday. Prosecutors said the victims had been arrested by the officers at various times on drug-related charges. A criminal complaint alleged the officers threatened the women with arrest if they did not comply with their demands. At least some of the alleged sexual assaults took place in the back of the officers' police cruiser, the complaint said. Both face multiple counts of sexual assault, including forcible rape and rape under colour of authority. The charges carry potential life sentences. Nichols and Valenzuela are being held on $3.5m (£2.45m) bail and are scheduled to appear in court later on Thursday. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said: ""These two officers have disgraced themselves, they've disgraced this badge, they've disgraced their oath of office. ""I am extremely troubled by what they've done."" The officers became partners in 2008 when they joined the department's Hollywood Division."

Four attacks have resulted in IS casualties since David Cameron won parliamentary support to extend airstrikes in December, the MoD revealed. The Prime Minister had cited the high-precision Brimstone missile as a UK asset that could make a ""meaningful difference"" to the international efforts in Syria. But the figures - accurate to the end of January - show none of the RAF strikes have so far used the Brimstone. The UK has focused on targeting IS infrastructure such as oil fields which provide revenue for the fighters. An MoD spokesman said: ""We are playing a crucial role in a campaign that will take time and patience. ""Using the right weapon for each scenario, RAF jets have struck Daesh (IS) almost 600 times. ""In Iraq we have helped to drive them out of Sinjar and Ramadi. In Syria, we have severely weakened them by targeting their key infrastructure."" On Christmas Day, one militant was killed or injured at a checkpoint south of Raqqa, IS' de facto capital in Syria, after an RAF Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile. Two more fighters from IS were hit on the same day in Tabqa, also with a Hellfire. On 11 January, two fighters were killed or injured in a Hellfire strike in Al Busayrah, the figures showed, while two more were hit by a Paveway IV guided bomb on 15 January. The figures were released following a Freedom of Information request by the Huffington Post."

Tristan's aunt and uncle shut down the chairlift and he kicked off his skis as he dangled for between six and seven minutes, which he said felt like an eternity, as lift operators moved into position to catch him. ""My aunt and uncle were hanging on to me and I was trying to grab something but it was too far,"" he said. ""I didn't look down, but I dunno."" Eventually, he had to let go and was caught by a group of rescuers and passers-by using a tarpaulin. He added: ""It was kind of scary… but it was kinda fun,"" he said."

This is the 19th consecutive month of year-on-year price falls. Despite prices falling, the number of goods purchased grew sufficiently to allow the total amount spent to increase by 2.4% in January compared to January 2015. Meanwhile, prices were also falling month-on-month with January prices 2.3% lower than those of December last year.  Shoppers seem to be doing more of their buying online with the value of online sales increasing by 10.4% in January 2016 compared with January 2015 and increasing by 2.7% on December 2015. The amount spent online in January 2016 with department stores increased by 28% compared with January 2015 - the largest year-on-year growth since December 2013. This compares to in-store department store sales growth of 6.6% over the same period."
2016-02-19,"Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, is to cut some 580 jobs this year and 500 next year at its factory in east Belfast.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160219192449/http://news.sky.com/story/1643673/bombardier-cuts-deal-blow-to-belfast-economy,"Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, is to cut some 580 jobs this year and 500 next year at its factory in east Belfast. That equates to getting on for one in five of the site’s 5,500 workforce. It’s another hammer blow for manufacturing in Northern Ireland, already the poorest-performing economy of the UK’s 12 regions.  Bombardier, based in Montreal, is a major player in the province’s manufacturing sector. Its operations account, on their own, for around 10% of Northern Ireland’s manufactured exports. The job losses follow a tough few years for the company, which also makes trains in Derby, where it employs more than 2,000 people and which recently won a contract to build carriages for Crossrail. Bombardier’s Belfast site makes wings for the C-Series aircraft designed, ambitiously, by the Canadian group to challenge the dominance of Boeing and Airbus in the narrow-bodied jet market. Plans to build a new narrow-bodied aircraft were first announced by Bombardier as long ago as 2004. The C-Series, carrying between 100-160 passengers, is smaller than the larger Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 that serve the market and are typically used by short-haul carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet. It was also marketed as being quieter and more fuel-efficient. Unfortunately, the programme has been dogged by cost and time overruns that, in February last year, cost the former chief executive Pierre Beaudoin, a grandson of the company’s founder, his job. It has fallen to his successor Alain Bellemare, recruited from the aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney, to pick up the pieces. By the time the jet was showcased at the Paris Air Show, in June last year, it was more than two years late and had over-run its budget by C$2bn (£1.25bn). Total costs, by the time the project launches, are likely to have exceeded C$5.5bn. The Northern Ireland government has contributed to the launch, pumping in more than £130m in grants and aid, while, more significantly, the taxpayers of Quebec have also chipped in. In an extraordinary move last October, the government of Quebec paid C$1bn for a 49.5% stake in the C-Series project to see it through to completion, sparking outrage in the Canadian media about lame ducks being propped up and a major headache for the new Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, whose father, Pierre, was himself dogged by a Quebecois secessionist movement when he was prime minister in the 1970s and early 1980s. Contributing to the malaise is that orders for the C-Series have proved hard to come by. Swissair was the first major airline to place a firm order, with the jets it has bought due to begin service by the middle of this year, but a previous order, from Qatar Airways, fell through after the latter walked away in March last year, its chief executive, Akbar Al Baker saying at the time that he had grown tired of waiting. It is to this backdrop that the job cuts in Belfast announced today must be seen. Bombardier has sunk some £500m into building a new 600,000 square foot plant in east Belfast to support the C-Series project, opened by David Cameron in 2013, as well as its existing operations elsewhere in Northern Ireland. The company’s operations in Ulster date back to 1948 when the British aircraft builder Short Brothers, famous for its flying boats, relocated its manufacturing operations there from London. The business was bought by Bombardier back in 1989 but, to many in Belfast, the business is still referred to as ‘Shorts’. The latest job losses at Bombardier, following several hundred in May last year, come after a bleak 18 months for manufacturing in Northern Ireland. Some 800 job losses were announced at the end of 2014 when Japan Tobacco, whose UK brands include Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges, announced it was shutting the old Gallaher factory. Last year saw Ballymena suffer another blow with news that the French tyre manufacturer Michelin is closing its operations in the town, while Bombardier itself shed more than 300 jobs early last year. The digger maker Caterpillar also announced plans to cut 100 positions from its Northern Ireland workforce late last year. All is not lost for Bombardier’s Belfast workforce. The company also announced today that it had won an order for 75 of the new jets from Air Canada. However, the market remains highly competitive, with the two giants that dominate the sector, Airbus and Boeing, in no mood to make life easier for their smaller rival."

The video was shown to a jury deciding on claims Johnson had a sexual encounter with the teenager.

He had said 'Oh well, when are you going to be 16?' And he said: 'Oh, that's ages away'."" A second friend of the girl also gave evidence. She described how a third encounter between the pair was arranged but Johnson did not turn up, texting the girl to say he did not have an excuse he could give his girlfriend. The witness said: ""She had come over, she was mad at the fact that he had messed her about. She had come over to see Adam and then he did not show up ... That was the same night she told her mam and dad."" Johnson has admitted grooming the girl and to sexual activity involving kissing, but denies two further counts of sexual activity with a child under 16. The trial continues."

""Despite being under no legal obligation to discuss any aspects of the events and allegations, ... and despite being expressly prohibited from disclosing such information to anyone, Andrea Constand volunteered to participate and disclosed such information to the district attorney and others,"" the lawsuit filed on Thursday said. Andrea Constand It also accuses Ms Constand, 43, and her mother of inviting media coverage and making public statements about the case. Ms Constand's lawyers previously said the 2006 settlement included a provision that allowed them to speak to law enforcement about the case, and that any such prohibition would amount to obstruction. Cosby's lawsuit seeks repayment of the still-undisclosed settlement, plus interest, as well as damages. The suit claims the 78-year-old comedian has suffered ""serious and irreparable harm"" and should be compensated by damages ""to be proven at trial"". Cosby failed earlier this month to have the criminal case thrown out after his lawyers tried to convince a suburban Philadelphia judge that a former district attorney granted him immunity from prosecution in 2005.

2016-02-19,Facebook is introducing a new feature in the UK to help users who may be suicidal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160219192449/http://news.sky.com/story/1644698/facebook-rolls-out-anti-suicide-tool-in-uk,"Facebook is introducing a new feature in the UK to help users who may be suicidal. The Suicide Prevention tool offers advice and support for people who are struggling to cope, as well as for their loved ones. While people who see explicit threats of suicide are urged to call 999, those who see other troubling content from friends can flag it to Facebook. Facebook worked with Samaritans on the system, which sees flagged posts passed on to a team at the social network for review. Help options are sent to those which the team assesses as struggling to cope. For example they could be urged to contact Samaritans, or ask if they want to connect with a friend. A message appears the next time they log in, saying: ""Hi, a friend thinks you might be going through something difficult and asked us to look at your recent post."" They also have the option of ignoring offers of support altogether. Julie de Bailliencourt, safety policy manager for Facebook, said: ""Keeping the Facebook community safe is our most important responsibility. ""We worked with organisations including Samaritans to develop these tools, and one of the first things they told us was how much connecting with people who care can help those who are struggling to cope - whether offline or online. ""People use Facebook to connect with friends and family, and that’s why we’re evolving the support, resources and advice available to people who are in distress and their concerned friends and family members."" A similar tool has already been rolled out in the US and Australia. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK. In the US call the Samaritans branch in your area or 1 (800) 273-TALK."
