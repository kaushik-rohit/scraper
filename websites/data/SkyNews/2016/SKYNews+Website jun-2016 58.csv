2016-06-01,A Chinese boy sneaked on board an Emirates passenger jet and flew to Dubai because he thought he could earn his fortune begging in the commercial hub.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1704951/boy-sneaks-on-jet-and-gets-all-way-to-dubai,"A Chinese boy sneaked on board an Emirates passenger jet and flew to Dubai because he thought he could earn his fortune begging in the commercial hub. The 16-year-old, named only as Xu, was found in the cargo hold of flight EK303 from Shanghai when it landed at Dubai airport.  He is said to have jumped over an airport fence and climbed into the cargo hold while a security guard was not paying attention. Xu reportedly tried to make the dangerous journey because he had heard that beggars in Dubai could earn hundreds of thousands of yuan a year (equivalent to tens of thousands of pounds). Emirates did not provide any details on the full identity or condition of the stowaway.  It said in a statement: ""We are cooperating fully with authorities in Dubai and as this is a police matter we are unable to comment further at this time."" EK303 is usually served by Emirates' largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, and the flight lasts well over eight hours."
2016-06-01,"The big supermarket chains are continuing to lose market share, although troubled Tesco is showing signs of stabilising, according to new analysis.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1705114/big-supermarkets-still-losing-market-share,"The big supermarket chains are continuing to lose market share, although troubled Tesco is showing signs of stabilising, according to new analysis. The market as a whole grew by just 0.1% in the 12 weeks ending 22 May, according to figures from research group Kantar Worldpanel. The big four - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - each saw their sales decline, but Tesco's outlook has improved slightly after two bad years. Sales are down by 1% - the smallest decline of the group. Edward Garner, director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that while the big four were ""struggling"" to keep their market share, this did not mean that consumers were leaving their stores in droves. Their combined shopper numbers have dropped just 0.2% in the 12-week period - and 94% of Aldi and Lidl shoppers still visit at least one of the big four retailers every four weeks. Mr Garner added: ""However, consumers' spend is increasingly being shared with other growing outlets which also include Waitrose, the Co-operative and Iceland and average household spend for the big four has dropped by 2.9%. ""Sainsbury's 1.2% sales decline - which has led to a drop in its market share to 16.2% - has been driven by a decline in pack sales, which is the short-term result of shifting its promotional emphasis from multi-pack deals to straightforward price cuts. ""Asda's low-price positioning continues to feel the targeted effect of Aldi and Lidl's growth - sales fell 5.1% on last year giving it a 15.8% share of the market, while Morrisons continues to be affected by store disposals."" Waitrose registered a 5.3% share of the grocery market - up by 2.1%, while the Co-operative's sales grew by 3.3% for the second consecutive period to achieve a market share of 6.2%. But Lidl and Aldi are the fastest-growing chains - up by 14.2% and 11.4% respectively. This growth is helped by the success of their own premium labels: sales of Aldi's Specially Selected has grown by 15% and Lidl's Deluxe range by 65% in the 12-week period. There is also good news for shoppers, as the price of groceries fell for the 22nd consecutive period, with grocery inflation at -1.5%. Mr Garner said this was due to deflation in major categories such as pork, poultry, butter, eggs and vegetables."

David Cameron's team has been routinely tipped off on the questions the Labour leader has prepared for their weekly showdowns, Mr Corbyn's chief spokesman Seumas Milne has claimed. He said the leaks came after the weekly meetings to discuss how the Labour leader would tackle the head-to-head. :: Corbyn And Cameron: Your Mum Politics At PMQs In a documentary on Mr Corbyn by Vice News, Mr Milne says after one PMQs session: ""This time they did (know the questions) because it leaked. It leaked from that meeting. ""It's very annoying because it only happens about a third of the time, but it obviously gives them a little bit of extra time. ""Whenever there is a leak it gives them that advantage - it gives them the advantage on TV as well."" In the documentary Mr Corbyn also launched a scathing attack on the press, accusing a number of journalists of being ""obsessed"" with him. And he voiced his anger over the coverage of the anti-Semitism row within the party. :: Corbyn Tackles PMQs With Crowd-Sourced Questions But he reserved most of his criticism for the BBC, saying: ""There is not one story on any election anywhere in the UK that the BBC will not spin into a problem for me. ""It is obsessive beyond belief, that they are obsessed with trying to damage the leadership of the Labour Party and unfortunately there are people in the Labour Party who play into that."" Since Mr Corbyn was selected as Labour leader the party has been riven by in-fighting and bitter public exchanges. However, the Labour leader's support among the membership has grown, making a coup unlikely, if not impossible. A number of high profile Labour MPs - including Sadiq Khan, Luciana Berger and Andy Burnham - have decided to focus their attentions on becoming city mayors instead, leading to claims of a party brain drain."

Three former judges are returning to the talent show – Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh. Host Dermot O'Leary has also been rehired after a brief absence. In a further nod to the past, the intimate ""room auditions"" have been revived too.   Show creator Simon Cowell will again head the judging panel. Last year’s presenters, Caroline Flack and Olly Murs, plus judges Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Rita Ora and Nick Grimshaw have all left.  They're back! Osbourne, who recently announced her split from husband Ozzy, was one of the original judges, appearing from 2004 to 2007, and again in 2013. She said: ""I'm overjoyed about going back to The X Factor, sitting with Lou, Lou, gorgeous Nicole and naughty Simon.   ""But most of all, I can't wait to meet (Simon’s) baby Eric.""  Scherzinger, who appeared in 2012 and 2013, securing victory in her first series with James Arthur, said: ""I'm excited about discovering, mentoring and winning with an exciting new act this year. ""And having had winning contestants in the past, Simon knows I will do it."" Discussing what will be his 12th series on the judging panel, Walsh joked: ""He’d say otherwise but I knew Simon missed me last year! I’m delighted to be back on the panel especially beside my two favourite female judges Sharon and Nicole."" Louisa Johnson became the show's youngest winner at the age of 17 Cowell said simply: ""Be careful what you wish for!"" The show, which drew huge audiences in the past, has considerable ground to make up. An average of 8.4 million viewers watched Louisa Johnson's victory in last year's final. Just over 17 million saw Matt Cardle triumph in 2010. Auditions begin on Friday 10 June at the home of the Premier League champions, the King Power Stadium in Leicester."

A statement from Heard's legal team on Tuesday claimed she suffered ""years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Johnny"", who they said ""desperately"" needed help. Lily-Rose Depp has defended her father on Instagram It comes a day after Depp's daughter, Lily-Rose, 17, defended her father by posting a childhood picture of the pair of them together on Instagram and described the actor as ""the sweetest most loving person I know"". Depp, 52, has denied allegations he abused his wife.  My dad is the sweetest most loving person I know, he's been nothing but a wonderful father to my little brother and I, and everyone who knows him would say the same ❤️ A photo posted by Lily-Rose Depp (@lilyrose_depp) on May 29, 2016 at 4:57am PDT In a statement, Samantha F Spector and her co-counsel Joseph P Koenig hailed Heard a ""hero"" for breaking her silence and a ""brave and financially independent woman"" whose actions were not motivated by money. ""Amber did not provide a statement to the LAPD in an attempt to protect her privacy and Johnny's career,"" they said. ""Johnny's team has forced Amber to give a statement to the LAPD to set the record straight as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media."" Depp last week was ordered to stay at least 100 yards from his estranged wife after she accused him of throwing a mobile phone at her face during a fight on 21 May. The Texas-born 30-year-old actress filed for divorce two days later, blaming irreconcilable differences and said the pair, who have been married for 15 months, had separated a day earlier. The alleged confrontation would have taken place after Depp's 81-year-old mother, Betty Sue Palmer, died in Los Angeles following a long illness. Papers filed with the Los Angeles Superior County Court showed that in another incident in April, Depp skipped her birthday party and showed up later high and drunk and pushed her to the floor. Heard claims Depp has a ""history of drug and alcohol abuse"". Her lawyers said: ""In reality, Amber acted no differently than many victims of domestic violence, who think first of the harm that might come to the abuser, rather than the abuse they have already suffered."" They added: ""Amber is the victim. Amber is a hero."" The pair, who do not have children together, met on the set of the film The Rum Diary in 2011 and tied the knot in February 2015."

The 16-year-old was attacked in a slum in Rio de Janeiro on 21 May, and two men have been arrested so far. Speaking to a local television channel she said: ""I fell asleep and woke up in a different place with a man underneath me, another one on top and two other holding my hands and several people laughing at me. Also, I was drugged and confused. ""There were many people armed and many boys laughing and talking. ""There were adults and not only boys. Now they judge me and blame me. ""They robbed me. They robbed me but not of any material property but of physical property."" The victim said that she was assaulted by 33 men in total. Police say they have no doubt the assault happened but that tests on the victim were done too late to provide conclusive evidence. Prosecutors say that one of the two men arrested – Rai de Souza, 22 and Lucas Perdomo Duarte Santos, 20 - may have been the victim's boyfriend. The assault came to light after several men joked about it on the internet – sharing photos and videos of the unconscious and naked girl on Twitter and WhatsApp. The attack shocked Brazilians, and threw the spotlight on the problem of violence against women in the country. On Sunday hundreds of women demonstrated in front of the Justice Ministry building in Brasilia. Brazil's interim president Michel Temer has announced that an institution for women's rights will be created in the aftermath of the outrage. During the city's bid to host the 2016 Olympics, Rio's mayor assured the International Olympic Committee its violent crime rate would be reduced by the time tourists and athletes arrived. In another case, a group of at least five men are reported to have drugged and raped a 17-year-old girl in the northeastern state of Piaui."
2016-06-01,"Migrants are avoiding tough new security measures in Calais by choosing quiet beaches in France to launch attempts to cross the Channel, Sky News has been told.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1704972/people-smugglers-find-new-route-into-britain,"By John Sparks, Sky News Correspondent Migrants are avoiding tough new security measures in Calais by choosing quiet beaches in France to launch attempts to cross the Channel, Sky News has been told. Local people say there is something strange happening on a stretch of coastline south of Calais. From beach houses on the shore and fishing boats at sea, people have watched migrants dragging dinghies, then putting out to sea - and mysterious boats taking on passengers in the dead of night. Desperate acts by desperate people who seem determined to get to the UK. It has come as no surprise to the man who runs the volunteer coastguard in northern France. Bernard Barron said: ""Migrants have to be as discreet as possible, so they choose beaches that are as close as possible to England but far enough from the ferries so they can't be spotted. ""This area is favoured by migrants and the smugglers - English ones and other nationalities - who come to pick them up."" Until recently, migrants flocked to Calais to find a place to stow-away. Some broke the locks on the back of trucks and scrambled inside - others clung to roofs and undercarriages of moving vehicles. But brand new fencing and beefed-up security at the port and the Channel tunnel are making life much more difficult for migrants and refugees.     As the migrants' options have shrunk, the dynamics of the crisis have changed. It is thought that hundreds are now trying their luck at other ports like Cherbourg to the west and Ostend in Belgium. What's more, criminal gangs are moving in, offering 'guaranteed delivery' to Britain for sums as much as £12,000.     Still, the smugglers have to sort out the transport - and boat owners in northern France have found themselves targeted. Sky News met a local businessmen called Olivier who said he has been approached on numerous occasions. He said: ""The smugglers talk to you nicely, asking us if we caught any fish. Then they get on to the main subject - can they hire the boat? Usually there is a group who stay further back, with bags, waiting for the signal to get on the boat."" More worrying perhaps, the smugglers have got hold of his phone number. He added: ""I got a call recently from Paris, a man speaking French in an African accent. He started talking about fishing but it was clear what he wanted. I told him I wasn't interested."" Olivier did not want to give his full name. He said the gangs are ruthless and they have left him - and other local people - feeling vulnerable. For the smugglers and their middlemen, there is a market to exploit - and the biggest pool of potential clients live in a waterlogged refugee camp near Dunkirk. It is a sorry-looking spot - stuck between a motorway and a railway line - and full of people desperate to go to Britain. ""Any way we can - we'll go there any way,"" said two Iranian brothers when asked how they planned to get across the Channel. It was clear they meant what they were saying - and it seems the longer they are stuck there, the greater the risks they may be prepared to take. Jerome Peres from the Regional Marine Surveillance Centre said the Channel crossing is more deadly than the Mediterranean. He said: ""It's not on the same scale as the Med, not yet - but if you look at the weather conditions it is dangerous and there's less chance of survival if you fall in."""
2016-06-01,Police are investigating the circumstances which led to a gorilla being shot dead at Cincinnati Zoo to protect a young boy who had entered its enclosure.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1704923/police-investigate-us-zoo-gorilla-shooting,"Police are investigating the circumstances which led to a gorilla being shot dead at Cincinnati Zoo to protect a young boy who had entered its enclosure. Officers said over the weekend no charges were planned but now it has emerged they are still gathering information and charges are possible. It comes after more than 400,000 people signed a petition calling for the parents of the four-year-old concerned to be investigated. The boy's parents Others have called for the zoo to be held responsible for the death of the Western Lowland gorilla, named Harambe, on Saturday. The 17-year-old animal, whose species is listed as endangered, was shot minutes after dragging the child through shallow water and up a rock wall. Tranquillisers were not an option because they could have a delayed effect and may have agitated the gorilla further, zoo officials said. The petition, ""Justice For Harambe"", accuses the boy's parents of ""negligence"", although they have denied this. His mother, Michelle Gregg, asked people not to judge her and her partner Deonne Dickerson because ""accidents happen"". Writing on her Facebook page, she added: ""If anyone knows me I keep a tight watch on my kids. Accidents happen but I am thankful that the right people were in the right place today."" Ms Gregg said her son was recovering from concussion and a few scrapes. A spokeswoman for the US Department of Agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service, said it has not begun an inquiry yet but would be checking for any violations of the Animal Welfare Act. Cincinatti Zoo's director, Thayne Maynard, insisted it is safe for the 1.6 million people who visit it every year but said a review is under way to see if any improvements can be made. Early in April a routine inspection found the gorilla enclosure did not breach safety regulations. But the zoo was severely reprimanded in March when two polar bears went through an open den door into a service hallway. Nobody was hurt but an inspector warned members of the public could have been ""at great risk for injury, harm or death"". Meanwhile, the decision to kill Harambe has won the backing of Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. He acknowledged it was ""a very tough call"" but said the life of the child had to come first."
2016-06-01,The mortgage business is the latest sector to slow down amid uncertainty leading up to the EU referendum.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1705252/mortgage-approvals-hit-11-month-low-in-april,"The mortgage business is the latest sector to slow down amid uncertainty leading up to the EU referendum. Mortgage approvals fell to an 11-month low in April - a drop from 70,305 the month before to 66,250 - according to the Bank of England's Money and Credit Report. The Bank of England said net mortgage lending rose just £281m in April, a fraction of the £3.8bn increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and down sharply from a £7.411bn increase in March. This was the smallest increase in lending for four years. Economists have blamed the slowdown on people rushing to buy property ahead of a 3% stamp duty rise on buy-to-let properties in April and, consequently, inflating the figure for March lending. Meanwhile, Nationwide Building Society has released a report saying that the average price of a UK house has increased by just 0.2% during May to £204,368. Year on year growth was at 4.7% - down from the 4.9% seen in April. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The adverse impact of uncertainty about the outcome of the EU referendum can be seen clearly across all the latest lending data. ""The drop in (mortgage) approvals reflects April's rise in stamp duty on buy-to-let and second home purchases, as well as the impact of Brexit risk on London's housing market."" Mr Tombs said that he expects the UK to vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum, adding that this should mean ""all types of lending likely will bounce back""."

Osvaldo Velazquez Garcia, 29, is suspected of ordering the player's kidnapping, which took place over the weekend. Pulido's car was intercepted by four armed men as he travelled home from a party in his hometown of Ciudad Victoria, in the state of Tamaulipas. He was held at gunpoint for almost 24 hours, but apparently made his escape when he was left alone with just one kidnapper and managed to overpower him. Pulido grabbed a phone and called police, who turned up within minutes. Garcia was wounded and detained during the ensuing police shootout, according to state prosecutor Ismael Quintanilla. Pulido pictured after his escape, alongside the Tamaulipas state governor He said Garcia was hit in the shoulder and wounded in the neck, but is not seriously injured. A 38-year-old accomplice said Garcia masterminded the kidnapping, in which a ransom of $325,000 was demanded. Prosecutors say he is a member of a criminal gang linked to drug trafficking, kidnappings and extortion. He was reportedly present at the party attended by Pulido - a striker with Greek club Olympiakos - before he was kidnapped on Saturday. The prosecutor said the suspect called the other kidnappers to tell them when the player had left the event, and told him what type of car he was driving. The car was intercepted by four armed men, who let his girlfriend - who was a passenger in the car - leave. Authorities say that Pulido was left alone with one kidnapper in a two-storey home, and took the opportunity to make his escape. Pulido's brother Armando - a player for Greek second division team Kissamikos - said the pair do not hire security when they visit their hometown ""because the people of Ciudad Victoria have always been very affectionate with us"". The level of apparent incompetence shown by the kidnappers has puzzled experts, leading some to question the official version of events. Former Mexican intelligence agency official Alejandro Hope said: ""If it's true, then we are talking about a monumental degree of incompetence by the kidnappers."""

That's the warping effect of a tightly fought referendum campaign when political careers are in the balance. The prime minister has observed the political calculus: he needs Labour supporters and young voters to turn out in force for the 23 June vote, and the new mayor of London speaks to both camps. But it does give opponents of Mr Cameron - both within and outside his party - another chance to question his political sincerity.  His attacks on Mr Khan in the Commons less than a month ago were delivered with focused ferocity, leading to accusations of racism. Today - if not linking arms - they certainly seemed at ease with each other, setting out Stronger In's ""unity of purpose"" - allowing the ""son of a stockbroker and the son of a bus driver"" to share a stage. Mr Khan argues the issue is too important to allow personal grudges to get in the way. So I asked him why Jeremy Corbyn couldn't be equally magnanimous and campaign with the prime minister?  He refused to answer; the mayor has a chippy relationship with the Labour leader after the mayoral tussle. The pledge card launched today contains familiar bullet points set out as guarantees: of full access to the EU's single market, workers' rights protected, keeping the European Arrest Warrant, the UK maintaining its special status in Europe, and stability. Mr Cameron tried out some other rhetorical devices, summing up Vote Leave's vision of the shape of a post-Brexit UK in a four word refrain: ""We Just Don't Know,"" and putting a figure on the number of those brought back to UK to face justice due to the EAW (1,100). Vote Leave says the pledge card ignores immigration and the power of the European Court of Justice over our lives: they'll be unveiling their own unlikely alliances over the next few days. :: Watch EU In or Out: David Cameron Live on Sky News at 8pm on Thursday.

Michael Jace, 53, admitted he shot April Jace three times in 2014 but claimed it was in the heat of passion and not premeditated. His defence had sought a conviction on the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. The prosecution, however, pushed jurors to find Jace guilty of first-degree murder. During the week-long trial in Los Angeles, Deputy District Attorney Tannaz Mokayef used statements made by Jace to argue that the killing was premeditated. She also cited testimony from the couple's 10-year-old son, who heard his father tell Mrs Jace ""if you like running, then run to heaven"". Ms Mokayef argued that the statement showed Jace planned to kill his 40-year-old wife, who was an avid runner. The prosecutor said Jace was upset that his wife wanted a divorce and believed she was having an affair. No evidence was presented during the trial to suggest Mrs Jones had cheated on her husband. Jace, who did not testify in his own defence, told investigators he planned to shoot his wife in the legs so she would feel pain. Mrs Jones was shot once in the back and twice in the legs. Her adult son, Savoy Brown, said the family was pleased with Tuesday's verdict. Jace faces between 40 years and life in prison. Outside of his TV career, Jace had small roles in films such as Planet of the Apes, Boogie Nights and Forrest Gump."

2016-06-01,"More than 4,000 steelworkers have a new employer after Tata Steel completed the sale of its European long products division to investors Greybull Capital.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1705009/steelworkers-welcome-tata-sale-to-greybull,"More than 4,000 steelworkers have a new employer after Tata Steel completed the sale of its European long products division to investors Greybull Capital. Greybull expects that its new business, operating under the revived British Steel brand, will turn a profit for the rest of the year - a contrast to the gloom surrounding the wider steel industry. Thousands of jobs have been lost as cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs squeeze the sector. The company will trade under the name of British Steel The new British Steel operation covers steelworks in Scunthorpe, mills in Teesside and other sites in Workington and York as well as a mill in northern France. It employs 4,800 people including 4,400 in the UK. But thousands of jobs elsewhere remain in the balance after Tata put the rest of its UK business - including steelworks at Port Talbot in south Wales - up for sale.  Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata Steel UK, said it was delighted at the sale of the European long products business and that he hoped under new ownership the business ""will continue the momentum of the improvement program that has been initiated in the last 12 months"". He said ""Employees and trade unions have worked closely with the Long Products Europe management team to improve the business's prospects, putting it in a more competitive position than it has been for many years."" Greybull partner Marc Meyohas said the business was expecting a profit for the rest of the year. He said: ""We have confidence in the transformation plan and in the ability of management and the workforce to implement the required changes. Much remains to be done, but the early signs are positive."" Steelworkers have welcomed the completion of the sale, with Community union general secretary Roy Rickhuss describing it as ""a new chapter in the course of the UK steel industry"". He added: ""Today marks the start of a new journey for UK steel-making and there may be more challenges ahead. ""That's why it's vital that the Government continues to take action to deliver on the promises it's made to the industry and to develop and implement an integrated industrial strategy and a long-term vision for UK steel."" Sources confirmed to Sky News last weekend that a £400m financing package required to complete the deal was in place – and that it was being provided entirely by private sector institutions, meaning that a mooted Government loan of up to £100m was not part of the deal. The sale comes as Tata continues to discuss the disposal of the rest of its British operations with prospective buyers. Several bidders remain interested in acquiring the Tata Steel UK operations, although sources suggested that reports in the Indian media that a shortlist of three suitors had been determined were wide of the mark. A proposal tabled this week by the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, to restructure the £15bn British Steel pension scheme has triggered fresh speculation that the company may decide to retain its 11 UK steel plants rather than offload them. A Tata spokesman said: ""Today is all about the completion of the sale of the Long Products Europe business. When it comes to the rest of Tata Steel UK's assets we can only say that the process to explore all possible options continues."""
2016-06-01,Sky data shows 29% of voters are still making up their minds how to vote in the EU referendum.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1704939/sky-poll-noise-leaves-eu-voters-undecided,"By Jason Farrell, Senior Political Correspondent Sky data shows 29% of voters are still making up their minds how to vote in the EU referendum. Despite numerous reports predicting various outcomes from the UK's decision, 40% of the electorate still feel they would like more information. With three weeks before the polls open on 23 June, the undecided voters are large enough to sway the decision either way - but so far neither campaign has managed to secure this elusive group. If anything, the group has become larger since the beginning of the year. A YouGov poll found that after David Cameron secured his deal in Brussels earlier this year the number of undecided voters started to rise, from 19% in February to 24% in March and April. It suggests the claims and counter claims of the campaigns - what some politicians have dubbed ""noise"" - have been leaving people even more perplexed. Political analyst Adam Faegan says this group of voters holds the key to which way the country goes. He said: ""They're absolutely critical. Turnout is critical and so are those who are undecided. We can't say with any certainty that they'll go one way or the other. It will probably be an even split."" There is a theory that undecided voters are more likely to chose the perceived safe option to remain in. However, Sky data suggests the primary concern for undecided voters is immigration, with 63% of Britons saying it has a negative impact on British culture. Our research also shows that Brexit voters are unlikely to be swayed by a reduction in immigration numbers - while those who say they are inclined to vote Remain are more likely to change their vote if they see immigration figures rising. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics last week showed net migration rising to 333,000. The economy is a key factor for those who have decided to vote to remain in. Paul Drescher, the president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), says he believes the Remain camp needs to focus on messages about jobs - and the impact on people's pockets. ""The question people need to ask is, 'Will there be more or less jobs?' In all the analysis we've done, there will be less jobs if we leave than if we remain."" But Out campaigner Iain Duncan-Smith told Sky News: ""There's no reason why anyone should lose jobs. In fact Vote Leave think economic arguments are such that we'll be able to thrive and prosper. What's more, Lord Rose, who is campaigning to Remain, said the moment we leave, salaries and wages will rise."" Despite the large numbers who are still uncertain, polls suggest that in recent days voters are beginning to make up their minds. This is a crucial time for both campaigns. :: EU In or Out: David Cameron Live, Sky News 8pm Thursday, Michael Gove Live 8pm Friday."
2016-06-01,Most British people tend not to think about Jutland as much as the big land battles of the Somme and Ypres.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160601153351/http://news.sky.com/story/1704331/did-britain-or-germany-win-battle-of-jutland,"By David Mapstone, Sky News Most British people tend not to think about Jutland as much as the big land battles of the Somme and Ypres. That is partly because there are not any well-tended cemeteries to visit, and you cannot do a walking tour of the North Sea. But it is also because the battle itself has always been a bit puzzling.  Its scale was extraordinary - a battlefield of hundreds of square miles and a full-scale clash between two of the mightiest fleets the world has ever seen.   Almost 300 vessels were in action and the loss of more than 6,000 British sailors makes it the Royal Navy's bloodiest ever day.  But who won?  It was the only time in the war the main strength of the Royal Navy and Germany's High Seas Fleet confronted each other. These were by far the most technologically advanced, and militarily powerful, institutions in the world. The Dreadnought class of battleship was the supreme marvel of the age. A modern sailor boarding one would find himself instantly at home.  These were mighty ships, infinitely closer to a modern warship than to the navy of Nelson. It is also worth remembering that submarine warfare was a vital part of the war right from the start. But despite their terrifying modernity, naval ships in this era still had fairly rudimentary communications. This is one thing that makes naval combat in WWI very similar to land combat  - the technology of killing was very advanced, but the technology of communications during battle could be primitive. Often during the Battle of Jutland, ships had to communicate using flags and lamps. So what was the strategic position? Very simply, Britain had naval supremacy and the Kaiser had one task - to smash it.  The Royal Navy was the world's policeman, as it had been since Nelson. The navy kept the hastily assembled British Army supplied and transported on the Western Front and throughout the world. And, crucially, it instituted a blockade of Germany, denying them food. Effectively, this was siege warfare. The Germans knew they had to break the British stranglehold in the North Sea.  British admirals like Jellicoe and Fisher, the First Sea Lord, were not fools. They knew not to risk a full-scale battle.  So the Germans had to seduce them into one. This they managed on 31 May 1916.  The 24 hours that followed were frankly a lesson in seamanship for the Royal Navy. Several major ships were lost and British captains were frequently outwitted by their counterparts.  German gunnery, spontaneity, and even courage all seemed superior.  At one point Admiral Beatty, a senior British officer, exclaimed in panic: ""There's something wrong with our bloody ships today!""    When news of the battle filtered through to Berlin, the Kaiser released a statement saying: ""The spell of Trafalgar is broken."" British public opinion was profoundly shocked: they had been brought up to believe the Royal Navy was invincible. Together with the Army's unprecedented casualty lists on land, it was extremely disorientating. So did Germany win? No.  Although its top brass won tactically, they completely failed to overturn Britain's strategic dominance.  The blockade on food continued. In desperation, in January 1917, Germany turned to ""unrestricted submarine warfare""  - the sinking of merchant vessels without warning. But it was to no avail.  The results of their failure at Jutland were seen in 1918, when a massive military offensive on the Western Front was initially successful but then ran out of steam when many starving troops, coming across shops full of goods, deserted to eat and drink.  Meanwhile in Germany itself, a tired and hungry workforce gave vent to their anger in a series of rebellions.  The 1918 offensive was Germany's last throw of the dice  - a brilliant and almost successful attempt to strike through the Allied lines and divide British and French forces. It succeeded in 1940 but failed in 1918, largely because the Royal Navy's blockade had brought the German people to their knees. The 100th anniversary of Jutland is an opportunity to reflect on one of the war's most tantalising might-have-beens.  And it is time to remember the human losses.  Vera Brittain, a nurse during the war and author of Testament Of Youth, wrote poignantly of Jutland: ""The one indisputable fact was that hundreds of young men, many of them midshipmen only just in their teens, had gone down without hope of rescue or understanding of the issues to a cold, anonymous grave."""

A recent reexamination of a palm print found on the killers' getaway vehicle has resulted in a potential match on the police database. The development comes just a week after a new inquest was opened to examine what happened. The IRA was widely blamed for killing the textile factory workers outside the village of Kingsmill in 1976. The workers' minibus was stopped by a man waving a red light and those on board were asked to state their religion. The only Catholic workman was ordered to run away. Alan Black survived the attack even though he was shot 18 times The killers, who had been hiding in nearby hedges, ordered the rest to line up outside the van and then opened fire. Alan Black - who was shot 18 times - was the only survivor. Speaking outside the court where the new inquest is being held, Mr Black questioned the timing of the police's revelations. ""It's nearly unbelievable that they had it all this time and now, when we're into the inquest, they suddenly find a match,"" he said. ""It's unbelievable they couldn't have done this before."" Relatives of the victims were told of the development ahead of Tuesday's court hearing. A lawyer for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) later informed coroner Brian Sherrard, who described it as a ""massive development"" in the case. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said the potential match was only found because of a ""recent forensic development"". ""A senior investigating officer has now been appointed in order to take this forward,"" he said. ""We have been liaising with the Coroner's Office in relation to this and will continue to do so."" He says the families will continue to be updated as soon as possible on any future developments."

Senior Bedfordshire and Luton coroner Tom Osborne ruled he was satisfied Mr Johnson intended to take his own life when he was hit by a train in Sandy, Bedfordshire, on 15 September. Mr Johnson, who had alleged he had been bullied by individuals in the Conservative Party, had been suffering from deep depression before he took his own life, the coroner added. He had been made redundant by pressure group Conservative Way Forward (CWF) after making the allegation, and in a note left for his parents he accused Conservative Party campaign chief Mark Clarke of bullying. Mr Johnson accused Mark Clarke of bullying him The inquest heard Mr Clarke had threatened to ""squash"" Mr Johnson like an ant. He claimed Mr Clarke had ""gone ballistic"" during a pub row over the use of a photograph on a website and threatened to ""destroy"" his career. During the confrontation last August, Mr Clarke, who led the Road Trip 2015 campaign for young activists in which Mr Elliott was involved, had allegedly threatened to sue him for breach of copyright. Mr Johnson's father Ray Johnson told the coroner he believed Mr Clarke had ""ruined"" his son's career. ""We were unaware of, at the time, a victimisation campaign by Mr Clarke towards Elliott and other members of the Conservative Way Forward, which was getting steadily worse."" After Mr Johnson killed himself police found three letters in his south London home. One addressed to his parents said: ""Overall, I failed in life in spite of your help, for which I am very thankful. Elliott Johnson's parents, Alison and Ray ""I have also been involved in a huge political issue. I have been bullied by Mark Clarke and betrayed by Andre Walker. I had to wrongly turn my back on my friends. Now all my political bridges are burnt. Where can I even go from here?"" Paul Abbott, former chief executive of the CWF, also told the inquest that other volunteers had made complaints about Mr Clarke, who had a ""vendetta"" against CWF. Mr Clarke, who has been expelled from the Conservative Party, has repeatedly denied the allegations, as has Mr Walker, a lobby journalist who encouraged Mr Johnson not to pursue his complaint. As Mr Abbott was questioned about the bullying claims, the coroner warned the Johnson family's legal team to remember the scope of the inquest.  ""I'm not going to allow this to degenerate into a trial of Mark Clarke,"" Mr Osborne said. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org"

The retailer's 163 stores are to close down after rescue bids failed, in the high street's biggest collapse since the failure of Woolworths in 2008. BHS plunged into administration in April, a year after being sold by billionaire retail mogul Sir Philip to little-known consortium Retail Acquisitions (RA). Last month, MPs investigating the collapse heard evidence that Sir Philip's Arcadia group had been informed that the head of the RA consortium, Dominic Chappell, had a history of bankruptcy and no retail experience. The retailer's collapse leaves the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) – the ""lifeboat"" funded by a levy on other retirement schemes – having to shoulder the burden of a £571m BHS pension black hole. Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors accused Sir Philip of a ""lamentable failure of behaviour"". He said that the failure of BHS ""should be a wake-up call for big companies - you cannot just ditch a problem like BHS and expect to walk away. This episode will follow Arcadia and Green"". ""Retailing clearly has changed and it’s possible BHS's days were numbered when it was sold to Chappell for £1. ""But we think companies do have a responsibility to think about how their choices reflect on the reputation of business in general. ""Sir Philip Green has courted the limelight and, for better or worse, his actions reflect on how business leaders are seen by society. ""You can't just get yourself off the hook by selling the business to someone who has been bankrupt three times and is a former racing driver with no retail experience."" Sir Philip - who is due to appear before MPs later this month - has hit back at what he calls his ""trial by media"" and calls for him to lose his knighthood. Meanwhile, BHS's 11,000 workers face the task of finding new jobs. Peter Burgess, chief executive of Retail Human Resources, the UK's biggest retail recruiter, told Sky News that BHS employees have a ""very good chance"" of getting work, especially those in London. ""The head office staff are very well trained, they've got key skills. I think most of them will go straight back into work. ""It's going to be more difficult, perhaps, in these stores in the regions where there's high unemployment but even then the managers and supervisors and things will be snapped up fairly quickly."" Mr Burgess said workers should not, however, expect much help from the Government, adding: ""I don't think the Government has a very good track record in helping people in industries like retail - sadly, I think retailers are a bit ignored. ""The help from the job centres isn't that great, to be honest."" He recommended workers head to recruitment centres, such as his own or those of his competitors. ""When Woolworths went down, which was very sad, everyone was shocked but most of those people very quickly went into work and we've forgotten about Woolworths. ""I think it's a great shame BHS has gone...but I do think that we'll move on from this fairly quickly."""

Passing sentence at the Old Bailey, Judge Michael Topolski QC told Shilling: ""I'm entirely satisfied the truth is you were the man in charge of this carefully planned, well-funded and sophisticated organisation.""

By attaching electrodes to the brain circuitry of freshwater snails that were on the hunt for food, researchers learned the molluscs used only two neurons when they found a tasty lettuce. Scientists discovered that snails used controller and motivator neurons to feed back information to each other to decide whether or not to eat.  The research could help engineers design the 'brains' of robots :: Slugs And Snails Carry Parasite That Could Be Fatal For Your Dog The first brain cell let it know it had discovered food and the second cell decided whether it was hungry. But if no food was in front of the snail this part of its brain circuitry shut down, saving energy.

""Our study reveals for the first time how just two neurons can create a mechanism in an animal's brain which drives and optimises complex decision-making tasks. ""It also shows how this system helps to manage how much energy they use once they have made a decision.

It's a point of weakness, and Mr Gove veered into conspiracy theory territory when saying all these economists were paid by the EU and not independent. Verdict 4/10 :: Immigration Tackling this question was a balancing act and Mr Gove pulled it off. He distanced himself from a dog-whistle, anti-immigration message, stressing his support for Britain's ""multicultural, multiracial, multi-faith society"", which he said is a ""great thing"". Britain also has a proud history of providing a safe haven and refuge to people fleeing persecution, he said. But he stressed that people want to see immigration controlled, and don't see why the 450 million EU citizens are at the front of the queue. The Leave side know they are on firm ground here, and it didn't dominate the debate. Verdict 9/10 :: Sovereignty Clearly Mr Gove's favourite subject. ""Can you name the five presidents of Europe?"" he asked. Of course we can't. He railed against a European bureaucracy run by ""people who we cannot name and we can't sack"" for the decisions they make although they affect Britain. An assured answer to the question about whether we are not better off making laws along with other countries. The democracy argument is compelling but maybe not going to excite those crucial undecided voters. Verdict 7/10 :: Jobs Mr Gove showed genuine emotion when recalling how his father's fish processing business went to the wall and all the staff lost their livelihoods. ""Don't belittle their pain,"" he said, powerfully, of others in the same situation. ""The EU is a job-destroying machine. Anyone in manufacturing knows that,"" he said, and promised the steel industry could be helped with state aid if we escape EU rules. Maybe, but when pushed on whether UK jobs would be safe in the event of Brexit he conceded: ""I can't guarantee every person currently in their current job will keep their job."" Some 80% of Britain's economy is in services and there are real concerns about exports to the EU - as relentlessly argued by big firms who are among Britain's largest employers. People's certainty about their jobs is the key risk for the Leave campaign and it wasn't neutralised. Verdict 5/10 :: Scotland Nicola Sturgeon has threatened a second referendum if the UK as a whole opts for Brexit - but pro-European Scots voted wanted to stay in. For those leaning towards Brexit, the prospect of losing part of the United Kingdom is a real concern. Mr Gove - who is from Aberdeen - insisted the majority of Scots are against a second referendum. True - but as we saw in the independence referendum, things can change quickly. Verdict 6/10 :: The dodgy statistics ""We send the EU £350m a week,"" screams the Out campaign's advertising, although this figure has been slammed as deeply misleading - including by some on the Brexit side. It doesn't include Britain's rebate or the money which is spent on programmes in Britain. Mr Gove defended it saying these billions could be better spent on the NHS and cutting energy bills. It seems the Leave campaign are banking on any discussion of handing over taxpayers' money to the EU - even when the figures are disputed - working in their favour.

A total of 18 Albanians and two Britons were rescued off the Kent coast last weekend when their flimsy vessel ran into difficulties. But local fishermen are adamant that many more are routinely getting through due to the numerous isolated coves and deserted beaches along the Kent coastline. ""I have been approached in the past by a man who asked if I was interested in making more money,"" said one fisherman, who asked not to be named. ""I told him I had no interest whatsoever in smuggling drink or tobacco or drugs over from France and he said 'oh not that ... people'. ""They're offering 20-25 times what any fisherman can earn in a day fishing, but everyone knows it's illegal and there's a prison sentence at the end of it."" While last weekend's rescue off Dymchurch made national headlines, few here were in any way surprised by this latest development. Retired trawler skipper Martin Jackson even wrote to the Home Office last summer expressing his concern over what he sees as ""Britain's Achilles heel"". ""I got a polite letter back telling me not to worry and that everything is fine,"" Mr Jackson told Sky News. ""This really needs to be tackled. There are so many bays and inlets and coves around Kent and it only takes a few minutes for these people to speed in and get picked up off the beach."" At its narrowest point, there are just 21 miles of water between the UK and France. It has been reported that people traffickers are offering ""guaranteed passage"" to England for up to £6,000 per person."
2016-06-05,There are calls for Tata to guarantee it is committed to a long-term future in British steel-making if it decides not to sell its UK operations.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160605103450/http://news.sky.com/story/1706453/claims-tata-could-put-sale-on-hold-for-loans,"By Siobhan Robbins, West of England Correspondent There are calls for Tata to guarantee it is committed to a long-term future in British steel-making if it decides not to sell its UK operations. The Indian firm announced its intention to sell its remaining plants in March, leaving around 11,000 jobs at risk. However, speculation has been growing that the company is considering putting the sale on hold amid reports that it is being offered multimillion pound Government loans if it stays. Neither Tata nor the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills would comment on claims that the company was being offered state loans on ""commercial terms"". But an industry source told Sky News it was no secret that ""the Government is putting massive pressure on Tata in the effort to get them to stay"". The reports have led some to question, if true, why the Government would try so hard to persuade Tata to stay when Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, has reiterated on several occasions that just two months ago the company was planning to close all its UK steel operations with immediate effect. Although at least 7 potential buyers have put forward bids for the business, numerous sources at the Port Talbot plant told Sky News they believed Tata would stop the sale if it could get the financial incentives it is looking for from the Government. Others said they were worried that the company may look to prolong the process because steel prices were rising but when conditions worsened, jobs could again be at risk. It's understood some workers walked out of a meeting with the company yesterday over anger at what they were being told. Meanwhile, Stephen Kinnock, Labour's MP for Aberavon said while in principle it would be good news if Tata decided to retain its UK strip products business it should be asked to provide the same guarantees for the future as other potential buyers. He told Sky News: ""The workforce would be forgiven for reacting with a degree of scepticism, and perhaps even an element of anger, to the news that Tata Steel had suddenly decided to recommit to its UK business."" He added: ""If Tata Steel has indeed decided to retain ownership then it is essential that they bring forward guarantees that they are recommitting for the long haul. ""The company should provide detailed, cast-iron guarantees in terms of investment in plant, machinery, technology, skills, growth, job security and pension security. A long-term commitment to the two blast furnaces in Port Talbot should also be provided."" The situation has been further complicated by the fact that a Government consultation is currently under way into proposed legal changes that would slash billions of pounds from the liabilities of the British Steel pension scheme. The idea was aimed at smoothing a potential sale after fears some prospective buyers were being put off by the £485m deficit being carried by the scheme. If passed it would mean 130,000 retired steelworkers would take a cut in their benefits. In a statement today, Tata played down suggestions it may retain the business: ""Tata Steel has consistently stated, such as in its releases of 7th and 25th May, that it is committed to running a thorough and urgent sale process for its UK business. ""That remains the case today. The sales process, supported by specialist advisors and the Governments of the UK and Wales, has involved approaches to around 200 potential investors across the world. ""In the current phase, binding bids are under evaluation and some bidders have asked for clarifications which we are in the process of providing. ""As a responsible seller Tata Steel is engaged with a range of stakeholders, including the UK Government, to give the best chances of future sustainability for the UK business, whoever the future owner of the business might be."""

The official industry body has come out in favour of maintaining ties with Brussels because of the protection afforded the popular meat and vegetable delicacy under EU law. Following the awarding of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status by the European Commission in 2011, only pasties made in Cornwall can be called Cornish. :: Prime Minister Admits EU 'Drives Me Crazy' Brexit backer Boris Johnson with a Cornish pasty during a visit to Truro The Cornish Pasty Association (CPA), which represents manufacturers of all sizes across the county, said after waging a long fight to secure PGI ""it would be wholly inappropriate for it to support anything that could potentially impact on that status"". The move is likely to come as a surprise to some with the far South West often regarded as an anti-EU heartland, given its close links with farming and fishing. :: Gove 'Nervous' Ahead Of Sky News EU Event Tory Leave campaigner Boris Johnson was recently pictured clutching a pasty when the Brexit battle bus visited Truro.  But CPA chairman Jason Jobling said: ""As an organisation that has benefited from the EU protected food names system, and no clear evidence available to demonstrate that Brexit would enable that protection to continue, the CPA supports Britain remaining in the EU and being able to participate in that system."" The pasty industry is worth more than £65m annually to the Cornish economy. Gallery: Survey Findings After David Cameron's Grilling On EU Some 60% of people thought short-term economic turmoil would be a price worth paying to curb immigration The awarding of the PGI status followed a nine-year battle for special recognition, and saw Cornish pasties elevated to the same status as Arbroath Smokies, Cornish clotted cream and Melton Mowbray pork pies. :: How Did Cameron Score In The EU Debate? Traditional Cornish pasties are made of diced or minced beef, potato, swede, onion and seasoning, and have their pastry crimped to one side rather than along the top. :: Sky News will be hosting another debate on the EU referendum at 8pm on Friday featuring Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a leading figure in the Leave campaign."

The 30-year-old actress is seeking the ""maximum possible jury award"", which she plans to donate to a domestic violence shelter in Arizona, according to her lawyer. Heard says in court documents that Doug Stanhope and 20 other unnamed defendants ""orchestrated a plot"" to write an article published on TheWrap.com which ""falsely accuses"" her of ""blackmail and other criminal behaviour towards her husband"". The article, entitled ""Johnny Depp is being blackmailed by Amber Heard - here's how I know"", was written by Stanhope two days after Heard was granted a restraining order against Depp, whom she is seeking to divorce. Stanhope and Depp are close friends. Doug Stanhope is being sued for defamation by Amber Heard In the article, he wrote that Heard was ""threatening to lie about (Depp) publicly in any and every possible duplicitous way if he didn't agree to her terms"". He also said that Depp, 52, ""got used, manipulated, set up and made to look like an a-hole"" by her. In court papers, Heard described the article as ""completely false and highly defamatory"", adding that they had ""caused and will continue to cause her tremendous harm"". She added that the accusations were part of a ""calculated publicity campaign to smear (her) for having the temerity to file for divorce"". Stanhope is yet to respond to the lawsuit.  In her restraining order application, Heard accused Depp of hitting and kicking her on numerous occasions, as well as throwing things at her. Depp has denied allegations of abusing Heard. His lawyer Laura Wasser said in court documents related to the restraining order that Heard ""is attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse"". Heard and Depp married in February 2015 and she filed for divorce on 23 May."

Information Minister Lai Mohammed said the funds include $583.5m in cash and $9.7bn in cash and assets under interim forfeiture, including sea-going vessels, buildings and land. The minister's special adviser Segun Adeyemi told Reuters: ""All these are monies recovered from individuals and entities who had either hidden, stolen, diverted or were in possession of monies belonging to the nation. ""These recovered funds include monies withheld by past government officials, monies kept in private accounts, monies diverted to private pockets and monies in possession of government officials not disclosed after leaving government."" Nigeria also expects the return of some $330m stolen from its public treasury and moved to overseas banks, most of it in Switzerland, according to Mr Mohammed. He did not name any officials, but the government has previously promised to publish their names. Last month, British Prime Minister David Cameron was recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""fantastically corrupt"" in a conversation with the Queen. Nigeria's president Muhammadu Buhari told Sky News in response that his country is corrupt and that he did not expect an apology from the PM. Speaking in London at an anti-corruption event hosted by the Commonwealth Secretariat, Mr Buhari said: ""What would I do with an apology?"" Hundreds of people have reportedly been arrested on suspicion of corruption offences in Nigeria during the past year. Current trials include that of retired Colonel Sambo Dasuki, national security advisor to former president Goodluck Jonathan. He is accused of diverting $2.1bn in funds intended to fight Boko Haram insurgents. Dasuki's financial director Shuaibu Salisu has told the court that $47m in cash was put into 11 suitcases and taken from the country's central bank to his home. But Dasuki says Mr Jonathan had told him the money should be used to bribe party officials to help him win his party's presidential nomination. Gallery: Nigeria Celebrates New President Supporters of Muhammadu Buhari and his All Progressive Congress (APC) party celebrate his election victory in Kano, Nigeria Jonathan lost the election in 2015 to current leader Mr Buhari, who says he inherited national finances severely depleted by massive corruption. Since then, the sharp drop in oil prices - crude sales make up around 70% of national income - has left the country struggling economically. The government has previously revealed plans to generate $17bn this year from non-oil sources to help fund the $30.6bn budget signed into law by Mr Buhari last month."

Carl Langdell admitted killing 23-year-old Katie Locke on their first date at a hotel in Waltham Cross, when he appeared at St. Albans Crown Court. Langdell, 26, met Ms Locke, a teacher, through the online dating site Plenty of Fish.  He had lied that he was a lawyer with his own firm. In reality over the previous two years he had increasingly suffered from mental illness and had spent time in psychiatric hospitals. Ms Locke was described by her family as a 'lovely young woman' They went on their first date on December 23, 2015. After spending the evening in London, the pair went back to the Theobalds Hotel in Cheshunt. Her body was discovered in the grounds the following day. She had been strangled. When Ms Locke failed to return home, her family identified Langdell through internet searches and contacted him through Facebook.  He had replied saying Ms Locke had left in a taxi and he did not know where she was.  The family then found his address and Ms Locke's father went there desperate to locate his daughter. When he arrived, he was told Langdell had just admitted to his mother that he had killed Ms Locke. Langdell, 26, was charged with her murder on Christmas Day, and will serve a minimum of 26 years. Detective Inspector Fraser Wylie, who helped lead the investigation, said: ""I want to be clear that Carl Langdell is a dangerous, evil, manipulative and controlling individual who knew exactly what he was doing that night. ""He painted a picture of being a decent person, including claiming to be a lawyer which he wasn't, and had refined his ways of dating to lure women into his trap."" Ms Locke's family said in a statement: ""Katie was a beautiful person, both inside and out, completely irreplaceable and for us, as a family, life will never, ever be the same again. ""Katie's loss has robbed so many people, the friends who loved her, the workmates who relied upon her, the children she taught and those she would have gone on to teach in what promised to be a successful career. ""We will never forget Katie. She was a bright, funny, loving young woman. She was also trusting, caring and always tried to see the best in everyone which, sadly, has been her downfall. ""Today's result changes nothing, Katie is never coming home. All we can do is warn other young women to be careful in the hope that no other family ever has to go through the pain and trauma we have suffered. Ms Locke's mother said: ""I'm grieving for my beautiful daughter. For the happy child she was. For the lively, beautiful noisy teenager. For the lovely young adult and mostly for the woman I'll never know."" Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: ""Langdell is clearly an extremely ruthless, calculated and violent man."" Police have released video of Langdell being questioned after his arrest. He says little, but it does reveal details of how he denied knowing where Ms Locke was after he had killed her, when he was questioned on social media. And it also reveals his exchanges with his mother after he had told her he had killed Ms Locke."

The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills committee wants to quiz Mr Ashley over the treatment of workers at the sportswear business and have previously said he could be in contempt of Parliament if he fails to attend. In a letter dated 2 June, however, Mr Ashley told the committee he was unable to attend because his lawyer Richard Gordon QC is ""unavailable"" and ""cannot change that obligation"". He added: ""Obviously he should be present if I was to attend. That means I will not be able to attend to give evidence on 7 June, even if my remaining questions are answered by then."" Sports Direct has been the subject of sustained criticism over the use of controversial ""zero hours"" contracts. But the firm says all staff and agency workers were being paid the national minimum wage ""at a cost of around £10m"", and that it would pay over 25s at least £7.40 an hour - the national living wage plus 20p - as pledged by Mr Ashley in December. It says there are currently no workers on ""zero hours"" contracts at its Derbyshire warehouse - but said such agreements were in place at its stores. Mr Ashley's June letter comes just a few weeks after he told Sky News that he intended to challenge the formal order to appear before MPs, which he slammed as an ""abuse of the Parliamentary process"". Referring to the summons by MPs, he said they should be visiting the firm's factory in Shirebrook: ""They would make a lot more informed decision if they were able to see it for themselves and then I don't think they would actually need to want to see me and carry on the media circus. ""They clearly don't care about the people at Sports Direct. In my opinion they are just showboating. In my opinion they are actually a joke."" The chair of the committee, Iain Wright MP, said a decision would be made on the next step when the group meets next week. Mr Wright said: ""Mr Ashley says he has nothing to hide but - following a Parliamentary summons issued back in March for Mr Ashley to attend on 7 June - and when he stated that he was available on that date, he has only now indicated he will not be able to attend next week. ""We are very disappointed by this eleventh-hour notification, having given him a notice period of three months to make the necessary arrangements. ""As democratically elected MPs, we are responding to serious allegations of exploitative employment practices and mistreatment of workers at Sports Direct. Mr Ashley announced in December he would personally oversee a review of working practices at the Shirebrook warehouse. ""It is entirely reasonable for the Select Committee to ask Mr Ashley to respond to those allegations and comment on how his review – announced over six months ago – is progressing. ""Business leaders regularly come before the Committee and answer our questions. Sir Philip Green, for example, has agreed to attend as part of our joint inquiry into BHS. ""Does Mr Ashley, owning and operating a business in a parliamentary democracy, see himself as being beyond such public scrutiny? What has he got to be frightened of?"""

Ahead of the Queen's official 90th birthday celebrations next weekend, Alexandra Shulman praised Her Majesty's very British style, and said calling the monarch a fashion icon undervalues the impact she has on society. ""The Queen is iconic for very many things but not her clothes,"" she said. ""She represents a kind of stability, a kind of integrity and the monarchy, and those are what make her iconic. ""Her clothes are something completely different. We're all interested in what she wears - I feel her clothes are very much to do with costume, they're not a personal wardrobe."" Gallery: Queen Elizabeth II: Life In Pictures 1926: The Queen Mother (then the Duchess of York) with her husband, King George VI (then the Duke of York), and their daughter Elizabeth at her christening Drusilla Beyfus is a similar age to the Queen and, as a young journalist, she watched as Princess Elizabeth grew up to be monarch. ""She certainly didn't wear miniskirts, she didn't wear bomber jackets, and she didn't wear a lot of things that all of us from her generation certainly wouldn't have lived without,"" Mrs Beyfus said. ""I think she has always managed just to absorb enough of what's in fashion not to be dowdy, and that's a sort of art."" All of the Queen's clothes for public occasions are meticulously planned months in advance with nothing left to chance. Weights are sewn into the hems of her skirts to protect her modesty and notes are kept on what is worn and when. Elizabeth Emanuel has designed clothes for other members of the royal family, including Princess Diana's wedding dress. She said: ""They have to consider might it rain, might it be windy, will she have to sit for hours, will she be standing a lot ... all of those kinds of things, so yes, there is a formula. ""And they do appreciate that they need to stand out, which is why colours are so important and details."" From umbrellas that match the colour of her clothes, to handbags, her trademark shoes and traditional hats, accessorising is an art in itself - and jewellery from the Queen's extensive collection is often chosen for specific events for symbolic reasons. Vivien Sheriff is a milliner who has created headpieces for younger members of the family, including the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. She told Sky News: ""The Queen knows how to wear her hats; always down on the right, you can be seen, you can be photographed as you smile."" With little sign of the Queen slowing down, her in-house team of dressers and designers continue to have their work cut out producing outfits for hundreds of engagements, including the three days of 90th birthday events starting on Friday."

No 10 confirmed relatives will not have to shell out £767 for the Chilcot report when it is published in July after they expressed outrage at the idea they would be made to pay for a hard copy. Bereaved relatives called on former prime minister Tony Blair to foot the cost, given they had ""already paid with our children's lives"". The 2.6-million-word, 12-volume report is due to be published on 6 July. The families have been invited to attend the public statement to be made by inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot on that date, prior to which they will be able to read an embargoed copy.

Roger Bacon, whose son Major Matthew Bacon was killed in Iraq in 2005, had said: ""If they find that they cannot afford to give us a copy for free why don't they say to Tony Blair that with all his millions perhaps he might be able to make a gesture and pay for it out of his coffers, bearing in mind we have already paid with our children's lives."" The inquiry was set up by then-prime minister Gordon Brown after the withdrawal of the main UK force from Iraq in 2009 and has so far cost the taxpayer £2.2m. It examined the lead-up to the 2003 invasion, and the years up to the pull-out of troops. The publication of the report follows 130 sessions of oral evidence and the testimony of more than 150 witnesses. The inquiry has analysed more than 150,000 government documents as well as other material related to the invasion."

Will he ever reach this goal? ""I won't put a date on it,"" the PM said. This promise is his weak spot and where the Leave campaign have gained ground by promising an Australian-style points system. But he neatly swerved this question back to the economy by saying: ""Immigration is a challenge and it's a particular challenge when people come to work here because our economy is strong ... It would be to madness to (cut immigration) by leaving the single market and trashing our economy."" Verdict: 4/10 :: Single Market This is the PM and Remain campaign's strongest card - that the single market is key to Britain's economic success - and the Leave campaign have no credible economic alternative. He told questioner Jacqueline Smith he would even join the EU today if we weren't in already, because of the economic opportunities on offer.  ""We're in a single market of 500 million people, it's vital to the success of our businesses. If we leave there will be fewer jobs and more expensive prices. That affects everyone."" Exports hit, the prospect of tariffs from other countries, and a blow to small firms would all be part of this ""act of economic self-harm"" - backed by major economic bodies. Verdict 10/10 :: World War Three The PM was under fire for claiming leaving the EU would cause World War Three. Ok, he didn't say those words, but he did use a speech last month to invoke rows of white crosses in war cemeteries and whether we wanted ""peace and stability on our continent"" to be put at risk. In the Sky News debate, he didn't let up, saying: ""Never forget that 70 years ago these countries were fighting each other. We must never take that for granted. ""Twice in a century Europe went to war and on both occasions Britain paid a very heavy price."" Strong stuff, but many will find it overblown. Verdict: 6/10 Gallery: David Cameron's EU Sky News Grilling In Pictures David Cameron tweeted before the event that he was ""looking forward"" to making his case for EU membership on Sky News :: Turkey and scaremongering Mr Cameron took a battering about his ""scaremongering"" campaign to stay in the EU from Soraya Bouazzaoui - who said Turkey joining the EU was the real threat to Britain's safety. The Prime Minister tried to talk about the single market again - do we see a pattern here? But she retorted: ""I'm an English literature student: I know waffling when I see it."" A sheepish Mr Cameron insisted there was no prospect of Turkey joining the EU in the near future, and that working with the country on the migration crisis was not the same as membership. But many retain concerns about the country's border with the turmoil in Syria, and the specifics of the EU deal with the country, allowing visa-free travel for it citizens. Some of the most uncomfortable moments of the night. Verdict 6/10 :: Terrorism and security A police officer of 30 years' service probed Mr Cameron's claim that it is in our country's interests to cooperate with other EU countries on the issues of crime and terrorism. He asked: ""Are you really trying to say other countries wouldn't warn us of a bomb threat or terrorist plot if we leave the EU?"" Mr Cameron insisted the European Arrest Warrant helps to keep us safe and allows us to track down murderers and rapists to stand trial. Security is a powerful argument, but the Leave side say there would be greater security with tougher control of our borders. Verdict 8/10 :: Sky News will be hosting another debate on the EU referendum at 8pm on Friday featuring Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a leading figure in the Leave campaign."

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed the decision following an investigation into alleged comments made by the former footballer at his show ""An Evening With Gazza"" which took place at Wolverhampton Civic Hall last November. Gascoigne, 49, allegedly made a ""joke"" about struggling to see whether a black security guard was enjoying the show because they were in a dimly lit hall. The Express and Star newspaper reported that the were ""gasps"" in the audience at the remark. Sky News understands that the formal complaint to the police was not made by the security guard. The Wolverhampton based firm that he still works for were unable to comment. An investigation by West Midlands Police led to a file being passed to the CPS where prosecutors deliberated for several months as to whether or not to charge the troubled star. The CPS have now confirmed that Gascoigne has been summoned to appear before Wolverhampton Magistrates court on 17 June to be formally charged. Gascoigne's agent Terry Baker told Sky News that they had not had official confirmation from the CPS and could not discuss the details of the case. The spokesman added though: ""Paul is many things but he is 100% not a racist"". The former Newcastle United, Spurs, Lazio and Rangers star has struggled with addiction for decades but earlier this year promised on TV that he was sober again and ""back to his best""."

Muhiddin Mire attacked 56-year-old musician Lyle Zimmerman with a rusty knife and threatened four other travellers as he ran amok in the east London ticket hall.  The whole incident was caught on CCTV - and on mobile phone footage taken by a passer-by who bravely carried on filming even as Mire lunged at him with the blade.  An onlooker shouted ""You ain't no Muslim, bruv"" after Mire claimed he was doing it for ""my Syrian brothers"". Police eventually stopped him with Taser stun guns.  Muhiddin Mire had a history of mental illness Mire, who was born in Somalia, had apparently been inspired by the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He had images of the soldier and the Islamic State executioner Mohammed Emwazi on his phone, as well as material linked to IS.  The Old Bailey heard the minicab driver, who lived alone on benefits, had a history of mental illness. Psychosis had led him to believe he was being persecuted for his religion, and stalked by MI5 and MI6.  He had been referred to mental health services by his GP a month before the attack.    A jury found Mire, from Sansom Road in Leytonstone, guilty of attempted murder.  He had already admitted four counts of attempted wounding, and an alternative count of wounding with intent to cause Mr Zimmerman grievous bodily harm.  He was remanded in custody at Broadmoor secure psychiatric hospital, ahead of sentencing next month.   Police eventually subdued Mire with Tasers Mire targeted Mr Zimmerman as they travelled on the same train from Stratford to Leytonstone on 5 December.  He followed the musician off the carriage, producing a black-handled knife with a serrated edge from his pocket. As Mr Zimmerman approached the barriers, Mire grabbed him from behind, swung him round and on to the floor, and began to kick him repeatedly around the head and body.   In front of shocked passengers, Mire then crouched down and began to ""saw"" at Mr Zimmerman's neck with the serrated blade. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the victim told the jury: ""At the time my subjective impression was that I was being attacked by a crazy person, a mentally unwell person.""  As Mire went up to street level, a junior doctor on his way home began to stem the flow of blood from Mr Zimmerman's neck. Mire then threatened several other people, including Andrius Sabaliauskas, who tried to talk to him.  Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC praised the ""public spiritedness"" of those who rushed in to help.   He said: ""It would have been very easy to continue one's journey on, but that did not happen."""

Sky News understands that M&S will say that Mr Bolland received the payment - worth roughly one-third of the maximum bonus to which he was entitled - as part of a multimillion-pound package in his final year at the company. Mr Bolland announced in January that he was stepping down in April to be replaced by Steve Rowe, an M&S 'lifer' who began his career in its Croydon store at the age of 15. The bonus payment to the former chief will be slightly higher than last year's award of £596,000, according to people close to the company. Under the terms of Mr Bolland's contract, he is entitled to a bonus of up to twice his £975,000 basic salary, with a large element of the award based on M&S's profitability. The company announced last month underlying profits of £689.6m for the year to the start of April. However, its pre-tax profits fell 18.5% to £488.8m after one-off costs of £200m, including £100m in charges relating to its struggling international business and a £50m insurance mis-selling bill related to M&S Bank. Mr Rowe's brief will be to rebuild M&S's appeal among millions of clothing customers who complain that its products are frequently ill-fitting, unfashionable or unavailable. Speaking last month on the day of the company's results, Mr Rowe said: ""Mrs M&S is the average shopper in Marks And Spencer – obviously she’s female, just over 50, and she’s shopping with us around 18 times a year. ""She’s a working mum, maybe a grandmother, maybe just about to retire. You find Mrs M&S all over Britain. ""She has a passion for great quality and great product, and she understands value – she’s very value savvy.” M&S declined to comment."
2016-06-09,Sainsbury's sales have gone back into decline after it reported a 0.8% fall in like-for-like sales for the first quarter to 4 June.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160609035423/http://news.sky.com/story/1708668/sainsburys-sales-slip-back-into-reverse,"Sainsbury's sales have gone back into decline after it reported a 0.8% fall in like-for-like sales for the first quarter to 4 June. Chief executive Mike Coupe said the business had seen a ""solid start to the year"" with the number of transactions increasing but warned that it continued to be squeezed by tough market conditions as prices fall amid the supermarket price war. The sales fall means Britain's second biggest supermarket has gone back into reverse after sales inched 0.1% higher in the fourth quarter - its first increase in more than two years. But the City shrugged off the setback, with the decline not as bad as expected. Shares rose 3% in early trading. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said the sales performance was ""marginally disappointing but far from a car crash"". Sainsbury's latest update covers a period when it removed its ""brand match"" which offered money off vouchers if a shop cost more than it would have with rivals. It says it now has a simpler strategy to offer lower regular prices. It is also phasing out multi-buy promotions with the ""vast majority"" expected to disappear by 23 August. Mr Coupe said: ""Market conditions remain challenging. Food price deflation continues to impact our sales and pressures on pricing mean the market will remain competitive for the foreseeable future. ""However, we are confident that our strategy to be a trusted multi-channel, multi-product and services retailer is delivering and will enable us to continue to outperform our major peers."" Sainsbury's pointed to strong growth in its clothing with a football-inspired range proving popular ahead of the European football championship this month. Elsewhere, vinyl records were reintroduced after 25 years making the store the biggest vinyl retailer on the high street, it said. Sainsbury's network of smaller convenience stores saw growth of more than 6% while online sales grew 8%, with a new app introduced during the quarter. The update comes as the supermarket's £1.4bn takeover of Argos owner Home Retail Group faces scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is set to announced by 25 July whether to launch an inquiry into the deal."

Killian Gonzalez and his mother, Brandy, were driving home to Nevada last month after celebrating his fourth birthday when they were caught in a hail storm in Idaho. The scene of the accident. Pic: Leah Woodward Ms Gonzalez's car skidded out of control on ice and she crashed head-on into another car. The crash was witnessed by a policeman and his wife who were driving down the hill back from a trip with their two children. Leah and Joel Woodward heard the little boy screaming from inside the car as they rushed to help. The car doors were still locked and they were initially unable to reach Killian, but the policeman eventually managed to smash out the back window with the aid of a metal hitch. It was then that they discovered the seriousness of Killian's injuries. Mrs Woodward was instructed by her husband to hold the little boy's head perfectly still until the emergency services arrived. ""I'm trying to stay calm but inside I'm panicking,"" she told CBS-linked KBOI. ""I'm thinking I don't know what I'm doing, and it was the worst feeling I've ever had to not know how to help."" Few people survive the condition and those who do usually require surgery, but Killian is expected to make a full recovery without the need for surgery. He is being treated in hospital for a broken arm and ribs, as well as the more serious injury. His mother, meanwhile, is recovering in another hospital and has not seen her son since the accident. ""It's just so hard because I'm in the same town and I haven't been able to see him,"" Ms Gonzalez said. ""It's just hard knowing he's in so much pain and I can't be there."""
2016-06-09,"As the Chancellor warns that investors have shifted billions of pounds out of British assets ahead of the In/Out EU referendum, here are the main points to consider:",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160609035423/http://news.sky.com/story/1708865/is-money-leaving-the-uk-due-to-brexit-fears,"As the Chancellor warns that investors have shifted billions of pounds out of British assets ahead of the In/Out EU referendum, here are the main points to consider: Q: I keep hearing all this stuff about capital flight and money leaving the country. Sounds terrifying. What's actually happening here?  A: In the first two months of the EU referendum campaign (March and April), some £65bn was pulled out of UK sterling assets - in other words everything denominated in pounds, from cash to housing to equities. It was the biggest two-month outflow since 2009 - the height of the post-crisis turmoil in the UK. At its peak in March, the outflow equated to £1.3m every minute. Q: So does this mean money is leaving the country? A: Not necessarily - after all, the City of London is an international financial centre: you can very easily shift your money into what are effectively foreign investments, denominated in other currencies, without it leaving the Square Mile. That seems to be what has happened here. It is not traditional Greece-style capital flight (let's get the hell out of this country), but is another type of flight - from sterling assets (let's get the hell out of this currency).  Q: So what? Why should I care?  A: Because this is one of the first pieces of statistical evidence that worries about the EU referendum are causing investors to take drastic action to protect themselves in the event of a Brexit. So far, the vast majority of numbers that have been bandied around have been forecasts, guesses, stabs in the dark about what might happen in the event of a departure. These are figures showing something that has actually happened. Q: I heard someone say this was just ""hedging"". Doesn't sound very interesting. A: Hedging is just another word for taking emergency insurance because you're worried about something - be it a lurch in share prices or, in this case, lurches in sterling. But this is not just normal hedging. In the past six months there were £77bn of flows out of sterling. In the previous months the outflows were £2bn. Q: But aren't these numbers very volatile? A: Yes, very much so. Which is why it is best to look at cumulative totals over a period of months, as above. But whether you take the rolling six month or 12 month totals, outflows from sterling assets are at the highest level since fears over a double dip recession in the UK three years ago, and not far off their 2009 peaks. And that March figure alone was the second biggest in history. Q: Isn't it just a blip? A: Well if it is, it is the second biggest ""blip"" in history. However, it is true that the investors who shifted the money out of sterling assets could very easily shift them back in. Nor is it a given we get full-scale economic chaos in the event of a leave vote. It might be that investors are getting their hedging wrong. Indeed, the pound recovered quite quickly after some big drops in the opening weeks of the campaign.  Q: Isn't this just propaganda fed to you by the Stronger In campaign? A: No. We dug these numbers up ourselves following a deep dive into the Bank of England's statistical database. The Remain camp learnt of them in the same way as the Leave camp - when we contacted them to tell them we were running the story, and explained our findings."

Vincent Viafore died on 19 April 2015 after his boat capsized during a trip on the river with partner Angelika Graswald. The pair met in 2013 and became engaged soon after A call to the emergency services from Graswald, 36, recorded her pleas for help. She told a 911 operator: ""Oh my God. I'm in a red kayak, but he fell in, I couldn't swim to him. I couldn't paddle to him. He's getting farther and farther away from me. He's going to drown. Please call somebody."" A boat was sent out immediately but, while Graswald was rescued from the choppy waters, there was no trace of her fiance. His body was not recovered from the icy river until May 2015. Graswald, originally from Latvia who arrived in US in 2000 to work as a nanny, was not initially charged over 46-year-old Mr Viafore's death. But detectives later became suspicious after comments they allege she made to them. She was subsequently charged on 30 April 2015 with second-degree murder - she denies the charge and insists his death was accidental. After a long delay, the case is now being heard at Orange County Court and, on Monday, a local police officer told the court how Graswald had seemed calm and emotionless at the time of her rescue. State police senior investigator Aniello Moscato also told the court that Graswald had told another investigator about removing the plug and undoing the paddle. Detectives say a motive for killing him is a life insurance policy taken out some months before and in which she is named as a beneficiary. They allege she said she was relieved he was dead. The couple, who had both been married before and were living in Poughkeepsie, met in 2013. Graswald moved in with Mr Viafore soon after and the couple became engaged within months. Neither the prosecution nor the defence can comment on the court proceedings because of a gag order."

In an email to fundraisers, Mrs Clinton said her campaign had broken ""one of the highest, hardest glass ceilings"". She wrote: ""Together we secured the Democratic nomination. ""For the first time ever, a woman will be a major party's nominee to become President of the United States.""

Well I do... and as your president I will always have your back."" Mrs Clinton paid tribute to rival Mr Sanders, saying their debates on income inequality in the US were good for America and the Democratic Party. And she singled out presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump for criticism, claiming he was ""temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief"". She won primaries in California, New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico on Tuesday night. But victory in Montana and North Dakota went to Mr Sanders, who pledged to fight on. He told supporters in Santa Monica, California: ""I know the fight in front of us is a very steep fight, but we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate. ""Our mission is more than defeating Donald Trump - it is transforming our country. ""Democracy is not about billionaires buying elections. ""Thank you all. The struggle continues,"" he added. According to an AP count on Monday, Mrs Clinton had already secured the 2,383 delegates she needed to clinch the nomination before Tuesday's primaries and caucuses in six US states. She has wasted no time in turning her attention to the general election. Her campaign announced she will make stops next week in Ohio and Pennsylvania - two states that will be pivotal in November. She now also faces the task of having to win over Mr Sanders' supporters and to unify the Democratic party behind her. Superdelegates - senior party figures who can choose who they vote for at the convention - are free to switch that vote. The vast majority have pledged themselves to backing Mrs Clinton. On the Republican side, presumptive presidential nominee Mr Trump won all five primaries in New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, California and South Dakota. Speaking at a victory rally in New York, he took aim at Mrs Clinton and her husband Bill, claiming they ""had turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves"".

The child was held alone in police custody for a total of 60 hours without an appropriate adult after being arrested three times and detained under the Mental Health Act once between February and March 2012. Sussex police restrained her using a mesh ""spit hood"", handcuffs and leg straps but failed to record why they had used force, according to the police watchdog,  the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). IPCC investigators found that 11 officers had a case to answer over their contact with the girl, identified only as Child H. Her mother, known as Ms H, said in a statement through her solicitors: ""My daughter's contact with the police in 2012 was nothing short of a nightmare for both of us. ""At the time her disability meant that she could behave in very challenging ways, but what she needed was patience, respect and the support of her mother. ""Instead she was locked up in a police station without me or anyone else who knew her for support. ""I know that some of the officers were doing their best, but I cannot understand why others thought it was appropriate to put an 11-year-old girl in handcuffs and leg restraints. ""I can't accept that it will ever be appropriate for the police to hood a disabled child, regardless of how they behave. I call on Sussex Police to stop doing this to children immediately."" The girl, who was held twice overnight in police cells, has ""a neurological disability which can cause challenging behaviour"", the IPCC said. Sussex police say they have reviewed their procedures following the case Her disability had not been diagnosed at the time of the police contact, but her mother told officers she believed she had an autism spectrum disorder. The watchdog found that six custody sergeants had a case to answer for misconduct for failing to make sure that an appropriate adult was present; another for failing to make sure Child H was dealt with quickly while in custody, and two constables for using handcuffs. Forcing a ‘spithood’ on someone is likely to be upsetting for most people, but for a child with autism it would be deeply traumatic 2/3 The officers were given ""management advice"" by Sussex Police. Two more officers - a custody sergeant and an inspector - would have also had a case to answer for failing to make sure an appropriate adult was present but have since retired. Temporary deputy chief constable of Sussex Police Robin Smith said: ""As a direct result of the investigation into this case, personal safety and first aid training, which all officers have to undertake, has been updated. ""This means officers have learned communication skills to help them be more effective when helping people with mental illness. In addition all officers have refreshed their knowledge in the use of spit guards. ""As a chief officer I have a duty to protect officers and the public when we are called on for help, whether the threat comes from a child or someone who is unwell. This is very often the case and it was on several occasions that the girl's mother called for our help. ""The application of any type of restraint is considered only when the level of resistance causes concern for the safety of the detained person, the officer and other members of the public."" The NSPCC said: ""It is hard to imagine a situation where it would be absolutely necessary to use this kind of force on a vulnerable child. ""Forcing a 'spit hood' on someone is likely to be upsetting for most people, but for a child with autism it would be deeply traumatic."""

Thirteen years later her remains were discovered hidden in undergrowth near junction 14 of the M5 motorway in October 2009. Officers have taken more than 3,000 statements and calls in relation to the case but so far no one has been charged with her murder. On the eve of the 20th anniversary of her death, a £10,000 reward has been offered for anyone who may have information which will lead to her killer's capture. Detective Superintendent Andy Bevan, from Avon and Somerset Police, who is now leading the investigation, said scientific advances mean they are closing in on the person responsible. Police have reissued photos of Melanie's clothes which were never found He told Sky News: ""For the first time I'm able to confirm publicly that we do have DNA evidence which was left on an item found at the scene where Melanie's remains were discovered. ""Through new techniques, we're in the process of developing a DNA profile. There's no doubt this brings us an important step closer to finding her killer."" Melanie, who was a clerical worker at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, was last seen at 1.10am sitting on a stool at the edge of the dance floor in Cadillacs nightclub (now ClubXL) in Walcot Street, Bath, following a night out with friends. As yet, detectives are unable to prove if and when she left the club and are appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward. They have also reissued photos of some of Melanie's clothes and belongings which they are still hoping to trace including a pale blue silk dress with a round neck, black suede mule shoes with straps, a cream single-breasted, long-sleeved jacket and a black satchel-type handbag. Steve and Pat Hall, Melanie's parents, have been tireless in the search for answers and believe a number of people know what happened to their daughter. Pat Hall said she knew something serious had happened as soon as Melanie didn't return home but it wasn't until her remains were found 13 years later that they could finally lay her to rest. Melanie's remains were found near junction 14 of the M5 motorway in 2009 ""I'd come to the conclusion she was dead otherwise I was sure we'd have heard something in those years. ""It was just the fact that she had been found and left in such a public place with no dignity,"" Mrs Hall said. ""At least that allowed us to do that very last thing that a lot of us do for our loved ones, to actually be able to say goodbye in a dignified way."" Steve Hall said he and his wife felt they had a responsibility to Melanie to bring her killer to justice and called for those involved to finally come forward. ""I don't think people realise the horror that these incidents bring to whole members of family and societies and on that basis I would appeal to anyone who has any added information to come forward to help us solve this crime,"" he said. ""Am I angry? Yes I'm angry. Would I like to see the demise of the person who killed Melanie? Yes I would. Would I forgive them? No I wouldn't, but I wouldn't feel any better. ""The thing that I want and Pat wants is often lost on these occasions, I actually want Melanie back and I can't achieve that, we can't achieve that. ""So we're never going to get closure."" :: Anyone with any information linked to the investigation has been asked to call the Operation Denmark Incident Room on 0117 952 9788 or alternatively 101 and ask for the Operation Denmark team."

The once-in-a-lifetime image was taken by snapper Nathan McLaren on Tuesday afternoon at a beach just south of Newcastle, New South Wales. The 33-year-old was watching surfer Daniel Caban, aged 20, on his board about 50 metres (164ft) out to sea when the massive 3.5m (11ft) predator burst out of the water. Friends raced to the water's edge to warn Daniel and fellow surfers about the danger they were in. They believe the killer fish might have been feeding in the area for more than an hour while surfers rode the waves around it."
2016-06-09,Eighteen years ago I spent several weeks masquerading as an England fan.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160609035423/http://news.sky.com/story/1708858/high-hopes-for-northern-ireland-in-euro-2016,"Eighteen years ago I spent several weeks masquerading as an England fan. It was an occupational hazard. I was the Sky News reporter following the England team at the France '98 World Cup Finals, just as I had done two years earlier when football came home in Euro '96.  Those tournaments were wonderful rollercoaster rides as England promised so much, only to exit the tournaments by losing penalty shootouts. I genuinely wanted England to win. I liked many of the players and got on well with Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle. But I'm not English, so this was just a temporary love affair. This week I've been like a kid counting the days to Christmas. On Sunday, I'll pull on my green shirt and catch a plane to Nice where Northern Ireland open their Euro 2016 campaign against Poland.  I'll be going to the next two games against Ukraine and Germany. And I've got a guaranteed ticket for the next two rounds just in case Michael O'Neill's squad continues to confound the pundits and progress further in the tournament. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill pictured in March In a magical season in which Leicester City upset the odds to win the Premier League, this is another tale of what a team of unheralded individuals can achieve by punching above their weight. It's not just that Northern Ireland qualified for their first European Championship finals, and their first major tournament for thirty years; it's how they did it. They didn't just sneak into an expanded tournament by finishing second or third in their qualifying group. They won it, despite being seeded fifth out of six teams. Four years ago, they had slumped to 129th in the FIFA world rankings; now they are 25th.  Northern Ireland have gone 12 matches unbeaten - the best form of any of the 24 teams in the finals. And yet only Albania are less fancied by the bookmakers. Last year, after watching them beat Greece in Belfast to secure their place in the finals, I contacted the Irish Football Association to set up an interview with the manager. Michael O'Neill's route to football management has taken in Cowdenbeath, Brechin and Shamrock Rovers, but he has somehow convinced players, only a handful of whom play in the Premier League, to rise above their lowly status. I wanted to show the resources he has to play with. I asked if I could accompany him to the most unlikely setting for an international manager to watch potential players. So we went to see Peterborough play Luton Town. He had five players in action. One of them was a former postman called Conor Washington who was scoring lots of goals for Peterborough. He was handed the club's Player of the Month award just before kick-off. O'Neill had heard that Washington was qualified to play for him because he had a Northern Irish grandmother. He'd only visited Northern Ireland once, to play in a pre-season friendly for his club. Now, Conor Washington is in France as a member of the squad. He's scored twice for his adopted country in warm-up matches. He joins an ego-free squad of journeymen footballers who still can't quite believe how far they have travelled, and thousands of fans who are enjoying the ride of their life. Given Northern Ireland's turbulent history, nothing is ever straight-forward. Many Roman Catholic football fans prefer to support the Republic of Ireland, who've also qualified for the finals. But huge efforts have been made to broaden the team's support, not least by their Roman Catholic manager Michael O'Neill. When I watched Northern Ireland qualify for the 1982 and 1986 World Cup Finals, sectarian songs were often sung on the terraces. Not any more.  Even the flag recognised as Northern Ireland's official banner by UEFA, FIFA and other global sporting bodies can be seen as divisive. The red cross, crown and red hand of Ulster is seen by some nationalists as a unionist symbol. When local French fans were invited along to watch Northern Ireland train at their base near Lyon they were handed green flags with the crest of the Irish Football Association. The use of God Save The Queen as the team's national anthem still rankles with some, but is sung with pride by many players and fans. However, when Northern Ireland play, the vast majority of the country will unify in a way only sport can achieve. It happens when boxer Carl Frampton wins a world title and Rory McIlroy wins one of golf's major tournaments. There's a huge sense of pride that a country with a population of 1.8 million, Our Wee Country, as fans call it, can make an impact on a global stage. Northern Ireland won't repeat Leicester's rise to the summit, but in a way, they've already succeeded just by getting to France. Anything else is a bonus. But in a year of the underdog, who can say what is impossible."

Stephanie Inglis, 27, from Inverness in the Highlands, is said to have grabbed her father's hand as she responded to her family for the first time since last month's crash.  The Commonweath Games silver medallist suffered severe head injuries when she was thrown from a motorbike taxi when her skirt became caught in the wheel.  Doctors in Vietnam gave Ms Inglis a one percent chance of survival She has been in a medically induced coma ever since. According to a Facebook page set up by her supporters, Ms Inglis' parents arrived at the hospital on Tuesday morning to find she had one eye open.  Her mother Alison asked her to blink if she could hear them, which she did, before reaching out for her father's hand. Ms Inglis' supporters are raising money to help pay for hospital fees ""Today has been filled with extremes of emotion for Stephanie, her parents and family,"" the post on the SaveSteph Facebook page said. ""Alison told Robert to hold her hand and as he went to do so Stephanie lifted her hand for Robert to take it. ""And then Stephanie began to cry, I can't comprehend what this must of done (sic) to her parents on one hand the joy they felt was extreme, on the other they have never felt such sadness. Ms Inglis won silver in the Glasgow Commonweath Games in 2014 ""They wanted to know if she was in pain, and had so many other questions to ask but instead they just told her she was ok, she was going to make it, they were there for her and so are many other people who are fighting this fight with her."" Ms Inglis' childhood friend and judo competitor Khalid Gehlan added: ""This is incredible. A girl who was written off for dead three weeks ago has now been given hope, her doctors are starting to whisper that there's potential for a full recovery.""

2016-06-09,"A new opinion poll has found that a majority of Scots would reject Scottish independence, even if the UK votes to leave the European Union.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160609035423/http://news.sky.com/story/1708967/poll-scots-would-reject-independence-again,"By James Matthews, Scotland Correspondent A new opinion poll has found that a majority of Scots would reject Scottish independence, even if the UK votes to leave the European Union. TNS surveyed over 18s with regard to the scenario of Britain leaving the EU, prompting another referendum on Scottish independence.  The research found that 48% would vote 'No' to independence, 38% would vote 'Yes' and 14% didn't know.   If the 'don’t knows' were removed, the poll would stand at 56% 'No' against 44% 'Yes' - almost identical to the 2014 referendum which returned a result of 55% versus 45%.  Under 18s were not included in the survey.  In the Scottish independence referendum, in September 2014, 16 and 17-year-olds were able to vote. The research also found more than half of Scottish adults - 51% - back staying in the European Union, up 3% since the last similar TNS survey in April. There was no change in the number saying they will vote to leave at 21%, while 29% said they did not know (down 2%). If the ‘don’t knows’ are removed, the survey suggests 71% will vote to remain and 29% to leave. The survey found that 71% of Scots said they were ""certain to vote"".    Tom Costley, head of TNS Scotland said: ""The level of support for the EU in Scotland has shown little change over the last few months and it looks likely that Scotland will vote to remain on 23 June. ""There is still the potential for a high turnout, suggesting that the Scottish public can see the importance of this decision.  ""The SNP has said that a UK vote to leave the EU could trigger a new referendum on Independence. ""However, on the basis of this latest poll it would appear that appetite for such a move is mostly limited to those who back independence rather than being shared by the public as a whole.  ""There is also little evidence that opinion towards independence has shifted significantly since September 2014, with support for a Yes vote, even in these circumstances, well below the 60% level that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated she would be looking for before calling another vote.""  In the survey, people were also asked whether or not they thought there should be a new independence referendum in the event of a Brexit.  In these circumstances, 43% backed a new referendum, 46% did not and 10% didn’t know.  The highest support for a new referendum was among Yes voters (87%), compared to only 13% amongst No voters."
2016-06-09,The tycoon who owns the Harry Ramsden's restaurants will add to his portfolio of casual dining chains this week by snapping up Giraffe from the UK's biggest retailer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160609035423/http://news.sky.com/story/1709009/harry-ramsden-owner-snaps-up-tescos-giraffe,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The tycoon who owns the Harry Ramsden's restaurants will add to his portfolio of casual dining chains this week by snapping up Giraffe from the UK's biggest retailer. Sky News understands that Boparan Ventures, the private investment vehicle of Ranjit Boparan, a wealthy entrepreneur, is the mystery buyer who has agreed to acquire Giraffe from Tesco. The deal is expected to be announced on Thursday. Boparan Ventures, which also owns Fishworks, a London-based chain, is understood to be paying Tesco a modest sum for Giraffe, which was loss-making last year. Boparan also owns the upmarket Indian restaurant in London's Westminster, The Cinnamon Club. Mr Boparan is best-known as the controlling shareholder of 2 Sisters Food Group, which is Britain's biggest chicken supplier and the owner of Goodfella's Pizzas. The announcement of Boparan Ventures' takeover of Giraffe is understood to be planned alongside the sale of Tesco's interests in Turkey, revealed by Sky News on Tuesday. The grocer's disposal of Kipa will mark a further stage in its international retrenchment following the sale or closure of its operations in China, South Korea and the US. Migros, another Turkish-owned retailer, is said to be the buyer of Kipa, which Tesco acquired in 2003. While they will represent another important step in Mr Lewis's efforts to tidy up Tesco's sprawling portfolio of businesses, they will not be material from a financial perspective, insiders said. Tesco is likely to sell the Turkish business for ""a couple of hundred million pounds"", one analyst suggested on Tuesday night, while Giraffe would be ""all but given away"". Many of the assets being sold by Dave Lewis, Tesco's chief executive, were acquired by his two most recent predecessors: Sir Terry Leahy and Philip Clarke, who wanted to diversify the retailer's appeal and geographical reach in an attempt to emulate global peers such as Wal-Mart. Tesco's other international operations, in markets such as Hungary, Poland and Thailand, are not on the auction block. Giraffe was bought by Tesco from a private equity firm headed by Luke Johnson, arguably Britain's most successful restaurant investor. Mr Lewis also wants to sell peripheral businesses including Harris + Hoole, the chain of coffee shops, and Dobbies, the garden centres business. Spokesmen for Tesco and Boparan Ventures declined to comment."

The single man, in his 40s, admitted to previously having an interest in sado-masochistic sex and used to visit a Fifty Shades Of Grey-style fetish club with an ex-partner. He also said he used to go on Tinder and ""played around"". But the man, a father, denied having any criminal convictions, ""not even a parking ticket"", when he spoke to reporters following an adjourned hearing at York Magistrates' Court. He accused North Yorkshire Police of ""sour grapes"" in applying for a Sexual Risk Order (SRO) after he was acquitted of rape. He was cleared at a retrial, having spent 14 months on remand. The terms of the SRO, currently an interim order which the police will apply to be made permanent at a hearing in August, has a list of conditions attached. Among them is the requirement for him to inform police 24 hours before he has sex with a new partner. The effect has been to devastate his personal life, he said, and contravened his human rights. He said: ""It puts an end to your life. I had more freedom in prison. ""The severity of the restrictions exceed what convicted criminals would get on a Sexual Offence Prevention Order."" He said there was ""no prospect"" of a relationship at the moment. ""Can you imagine, 24 hours before sex? Come on,"" he said. He gave the example of chatting to a woman and saying: ""There's a nice French restaurant I'd like to take you to, but first the police are just going to come around for a little chat."" The man, who cannot be identified by the media, said the SRO was made after he was cleared of raping a woman - different from the one with whom he visited the fetish club. He said the jury at the retrial took an hour and six minutes to unanimously clear him. His history of sado-masochistic sex was brought up at the trial, including evidence from a doctor with whom he had discussed his past. ""The police, if they lose in court, are using these Sexual Risk Orders as a tool, by stealth. ""The standards of proof are so much lower. You don't even have to break the law."" The terms of his SRO mean he cannot use any internet-enabled device that cannot be later checked by police. He said: ""I'm in a state of shock, I cannot believe this is how the justice system works. ""I thought the police were interested in finding out the truth, the only thing the police are interested in is securing convictions."" He added: ""It's so unjust, there is not a conviction to my name - one allegation, acquitted and they can still shut you down. ""They can create this virtual prison."" The case will be back before York Magistrates on 14 July before a full hearing on 19 August. SROs can be applied to any individual who the police believe poses a risk of sexual harm, even if they have never been convicted of a crime.  They are civil orders imposed by magistrates at the request of police. North Yorkshire Police declined to comment."

The long jumper's girlfriend Susie Verrill, who will not be travelling to Brazil, revealed the couple's decision in an article for Standard Issue magazine. ""The Zika news has caused no end of concern if we're totally honest,"" she wrote. ""We're not ones to worry unnecessarily, but after more than 100 medical experts stressed the Games should be moved to prevent the disease from spreading, this was a huge factor in us choosing to stay put. ""We've also made the decision to have Greg's sperm frozen. ""We'd love to have more children and with research in its infancy, I wouldn't want to put myself in a situation which could have been prevented."" The couple already have a son, one-year-old Milo. Last month, 150 global experts signed an open letter to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) urging the Games to be moved or delayed because of the virus. Zika is known to cause birth defects if contracted by pregnant women. Cyclist Tejay van Garderen, as well as golfers Vijay Singh and Marc Leishman, have already pulled out of the Games due to risks associated with the virus. American television presenter Savannah Guthrie also announced on Tuesday she is pregnant and consequently would not be going to report on the Games on doctors' advice. However, Rio 2016 organisers insist there is no public health justification for the event being postponed or moved, saying there is ""very low or no risk"" to athletes and fans."

The new portrait was taken at Windsor Castle. Pic: 2016 Annie Leibovitz He also praised her ""dutiful commitment, loving leadership, gentle constancy, royal dignity and kindly humanity"".

As the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived at St Paul's, a crowd of well-wishers sang Happy Birthday. They both stood for a moment on the steps of St Paul's and waved to the crowds before going in. Following the service of thanksgiving, a lunch for the Governors General of all Commonwealth Realms was held at Buckingham Palace. The Queen was born on 21 April, but public celebrations for her birthday traditionally happen in June. The weekend promises to be a busy one for the Queen, although Prince Harry said the best birthday present she could get would be a ""day off so she could lie about and do nothing"". On Saturday nearly 1,500 service personnel, together with 200 horses and over 400 musicians will perform the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony on Horseguards Parade in Whitehall. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family will travel to and from Buckingham Palace in carriages. The monarch will then appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace at 1pm to watch a fly-past. And on Sunday, the Mall will be transformed into a giant street party called The Patron's Lunch to celebrate Her Majesty's patronage of more than 600 organisations. The majority of the 10,000 tickets - costing £150 - were offered to guests from those organisations, but 1,000 tickets were allocated in a public ballot. There are plans for street parties across the country, similar to those which took place for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Pubs across the UK are being allowed to stay open much later this weekend, having had their opening hours officially extended by the Government because of the Queen's birthday. Earlier a new picture was released, taken by Annie Leibovitz at Windsor Castle after Easter and shows the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who have been married for 68 years, sitting side by side. As a couple they have marked many milestones together, with the Queen often taking centre stage and the Duke of Edinburgh supporting her as Britain's longest serving consort. His friend Martin Palmer told Sky News that Prince Philip is probably more than happy that the attention will be on his wife's birthday, but expects the family will still make a fuss. He said: ""The great thing about Philip is he's not pompous. So I think he will enjoy the informality ... He'll just have a good time with his family and close friends and carry on as usual.""

On the pitch, the hosts take on Romania tonight in the same national stadium attacked by three suicide bombers last November, and with the nation under an extended state of emergency. The Stade de France attack was the beginning of the 13 November atrocity and though the least deadly - a Portuguese bus driver was the only person among 130 killed that day to die at the stadium - it has shaped preparations. Jacques Lambert, president of the organising committee, admitted as much this week. ""We want to lift ourselves out of the negative spiral around security that was imposed on us,"" he said. :: No 'Specific Threat' To British Fans At Euros No previous edition of the European football championship, and perhaps no other major sporting event, has had to contend with the security challenges that provide the inescapable backdrop to what was supposed to be a month of football en fete. Security is a staple narrative of sport in the modern era of mega events, from the World Cup to the Olympics, but it has never been more relevant or real than at Euro 2016. The crowds of young, carefree supporters who gather at stadiums and fanzones are what give tournaments their colour. They are also a security nightmare, a soft target for terrorists who have demonstrated their capacity more than once in Europe in the last 18 months. So preparations are in place. The police and army personnel deployed this month would not fit inside the Stade de France. There are 90,000 on duty but they are exhausted, with millions of hours of unclaimed overtime after more than a year on high terror alert and after a spring of civil discontent in France. Supporters expecting a blind eye to be turned to minor indiscretions and altercations might bear in mind that patience among a force not known for its light touch may be in short supply. Former police commando chief Frederic Gallois told Sky News: ""The problem is not numbers. There are enough of them, but they are tired and stressed. ""They have been operating at the highest level for 18 months. The problem may not be the big event, but how they react to the small event."" The police are not the only ones who are weary. Parisians have done their best to return to normal and in the early summer sun this week they and their city has looked their refined best. But they are ready for an excuse to celebrate as they did when France won the World Cup here 18 years ago. For this, they will look to the players preparing at the heart of the security bubble. :: High Hopes For Northern Ireland In Euro 2016 For the first time, 24 teams will contest the Henri Delauny trophy and it looks the most open as well as the largest tournament. The hosts have a high-class squad capable of emulating Les Bleus 1998 vintage. World Champions Germany, holders Spain, and a Belgian side full of familiar Premier League names are all also among the favourites. The Home Nations have never been better represented. Wales (58 years) and Northern Ireland (30 years) are contesting their first major finals in decades, alongside England, so often exposed in this competition. Roy Hodgson has the youngest squad of any nation, with an average age of just 25, and expectations calibrated appropriately. England, however, are only ever one bad result from a disproportionate backlash. If ever there was a tournament to ease the parochial ties this is it. Albania and Iceland are here, defying the odds and population statistics, and the list of great players missing through injury is mercifully short. France's troubles will not be solved by football. But a month of optimistic and uncynical sport, enjoyed in friendly rivalry by fans of 24 nations on a continent grappling with its own collective identity, could send a powerful message. It's only a game, but sometimes that's the point."
2016-06-11,"US vice president Joe Biden has written an open letter in support of a rape victim whose attacker at Stanford University received a ""lenient"" six-month sentence.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160611233926/http://news.sky.com/story/1709748/bidens-furious-anger-over-stanford-rape,"US vice president Joe Biden has written an open letter in support of a rape victim whose attacker at Stanford University received a ""lenient"" six-month sentence. The politician, who has been a long-time campaigner on violence against women, commended her courage in reliving the assault through a harrowing witness statement which has caused a national outcry. The 7,000-word statement gives a compelling account of the crime and its consequences and has been read online by millions of people worldwide since it was released by the district attorney. In her statement, the 23-year-old victim told her attacker: ""You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today."" Brock Turner was on a swimming scholarship at Stanford University In his letter to the victim, published by BuzzFeed, Mr Biden acknowledged the nation was ""not satisfied"" with the trial of Brock Turner, who will be eligible for release in September after receiving considerably less than the six-year sentence recommended by prosecutors for the assault of the unconscious woman. ""I am filled with furious anger - both that this happened to you and that our culture is still so broken that you were ever put in the position of defending your own worth,"" Mr Biden wrote. He also criticised the ""callous"" remarks made by the rapist's father, who said his son had paid ""a steep price … for 20 minutes of action"". The sentence handed to the 20-year-old has prompted a national outcry The vice president told the anonymous woman: ""You were failed by a culture on our college campuses where one in five women is sexually assaulted - year after year after year. A culture that promotes passivity. That encourages young men and women on campuses to turn a blind eye. ""And you were failed by anyone who dared to question this one clear and simple truth: sex without consent is rape. Period. It is a crime."" During a statement to court, addressed to her rapist, the victim had said: ""The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgement even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative."" Pressure has been growing on the judge in the case to reconsider the sentence handed to Turner, which also included three years' probation and a requirement for him to register as a convicted sex offender for the rest of his life. However, the judge is prohibited from commenting on the case as Turner is appealing the conviction. There has also been an outcry against those who stood by Turner - some of whom have apologised for penning letters of support urging a lenient sentence. Childhood friend Leslie Rasmussen said she was ""deeply sorry"" in a post on her Facebook page. ""I was not there that night. I had no right to make any assumptions about the situation,"" she wrote. ""Most importantly, I did not acknowledge strongly enough the severity of Brock's crime and the suffering and pain that his victim endured, and for that lack of acknowledgement, I am deeply sorry."" Angry members of the public have demanded her indie rock band Good English be dropped from shows. Kelly Owens , a guidance counsellor at Oakwood High School in Dayton, Ohio, which Turner attended, has expressed regret about  her letter: ""Of course he should be held accountable ... I am truly sorry for the additional pain my letter has caused."""

There have been reports of the sea lice, which are almost invisible to the naked eye, along Walton County's Santa Rosa Beach this week. According to a report by the Florida Department of Health, infestations are prevalent between March and August along around 250 miles of Florida's southern Atlantic coastline. Once the adult jellyfish die after spawning, the larvae continue to cause the outbreaks, with no mature jellyfish visible as a warning. The rash is often called ""ocean itch"" or ""sunbather's eruption"" and lasts from a couple hours to several days. Symptoms include difficulty in sleeping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache and muscle spasms. People can lower the risk of a nasty rash by removing their swimming costumes before showering and using calamine lotion or cooked oatmeal to ease the pain."

Richard Alden, 53, denies the charge. The judge, Justice Stella Mutuku ordered that he be held until Thursday when his bail application will be heard. Mr Alden was arrested on Saturday His previous lawyer, Evans Monari, said Grace Wangeci, 42, died after she shot herself when she was taking a selfie while holding Alden's gun. But his current lawyer, Cliff Ombeta, said Alden was in a different room when Ms Wangeci shot herself, and there is no proof she was taking a selfie. In his argument for bail, Mr Alden said he took Ms Wangeci to hospital after the shooting and called the police. Grace Wangeci was found dead at Mr Alden's home ""This clearly shows that I am not a flight risk and I did not escape, even when the opportunity presented itself,"" he said in court documents. Mr Alden is married with three grown-up children. His wife was abroad at the time of the incident, but has since returned to Kenya. Mr Alden is the former chief executive of Wananchi Group, an internet and multimedia service provider in Kenya. He was previously the chief executive of ONO, the largest cable television and telecommunications operator in Spain."
2016-06-11,It is a mystery why exactly the Vote Leave campaign chose to focus on a number of £350m a week being sent to Brussels.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160611233926/http://news.sky.com/story/1709387/can-wollaston-call-350m-brexit-claim-a-lie,"It is a mystery why exactly the Vote Leave campaign chose to focus on a number of £350m a week being sent to Brussels. It is demonstrably untrue. Or to put it another way, it is a lie. And it is emblazoned in metre-high letters on their campaign bus. :: Got An EU Question For Corbyn? Want To Be In Our Studio Audience? Click Here Had they chosen a different high number - £276m a week sent to Brussels - that would have been highly spun, but defensible from accusations of actual lying. I cannot imagine there are many people in Britain whose precise point of annoyance lies at the fact that the gross EU contributions are £350m a week rather than £276m. Simply put, the rebate - equivalent to £74m a week - never gets sent to Brussels, and never has done. Ever. There has never been a week in UK history where it has been true. These are facts in spreadsheets about current and past spending that are easily verifiable. The ONS says of the 2014 ""Pink Book"" statistics, on which Vote Leave base their calculations: ""This amount of money was never actually transferred to the EU."" The Leave campaign claims something might happen to the rebate in the future. The UK  actually has a veto on this. But in any event, that is a matter for the future. The £350m claim is in the present and past tenses. Of course, it is worth pointing out that the Remain campaign claims all of this money and more will be wiped out by the cost of Brexit to the economy - and has been backed by a number of independent economic organisations. :: Brexit MP Defects Over 'Untrue' NHS Claims The rebate never being sent to Brussels is not even the most misleading aspect. By saying ""WE SEND £350m TO BRUSSELS, LET'S FUND THE NHS INSTEAD"" the public is invited to believe that the money is available for spending to save the NHS. This is the basis of the presence of the NHS logo and ""Save our NHS"" placards at Leave rallies.  On top of the rebate, EU funding is returned to the UK and spent on British farmers and on UK regions such as Cornwall, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England; on UK technology and investment too. Almost all of this has been guaranteed to continue by the Vote Leave campaign. There is some scope to presume that UK repatriation of this money might cut out some bureaucratic salaries, and provide scope for efficiencies. But that is impossible to calculate. It is unlikely to be large. When you net off the money returning to UK public spending then you get to net contributions. They are still about £190m a week. Just under £10bn a year - still enough to cause concern about value for money from the public. Throw in the money paid by the EU to UK companies (which it is legitimate to argue about) and the five-year average for the net cost to the UK, and the starting point for a prudent projection of the ""windfall"" from leaving the EU is even less - between £110m and £150m a week. Then there is a separate issue of how much we would still pay into the EU given our wish for a trading relationship after Brexit. A fair chunk of our 0.7% aid spending is also routed via the EU. This is why independent experts, whose job it is to number crunch, have been very sceptical of this number. The Statistics Commission, the independent watchdog for all our national statistics, says the £350m number is ""misleading"" - an upgrade from ""potentially misleading"". :: Everything You Need To Know About The EU The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an organisation actually quoted by Michael Gove in his interview with me on Friday night, calls it ""clearly absurd"". Of the number, Aaron Banks, a businessman who has poured a fortune into the campaign to leave the EU has said ""it's not smart to lie"". UKIP's manifesto at the General Election last year made history as being independently audited by a leading set of economic forecasters. The CEBR is neutral on the EU, containing notable sceptics. Its audit of the UKIP manifesto is here. The CEBR's assessment of the weekly net benefit from withdrawing the EU membership fee was £142m per week, rising to £173m a week by 2020 (£7.5bn to £9bn). I asked Justice Secretary and Brexit campaigner Michael Gove three times in our Sky News interview if Vote Leave would get its ""core claim"" independently audited. He told me: ""I am happy to have that figure independently audited."" We have heard not very much from the Leave campaign in the past six days. They say they are looking into it."

The singer was forced to leave her family home after Alex Gray managed to get into her bedroom, stealing a handbag, jewellery, a phone, a hard drive, a set of keys , a vase and money. He had also contacted the pop star on social media, wrote her offensive letters and accused her of ""stealing"" lyrics he had written. Ms Allen did not attend the hearing at Harrow Crown Court, but in a statement said she was ""left terrified for my and my children's safety"". ""I had already been incredibly disturbed and upset by the letters Mr Gray sent, and his contact on social media, but the break-in at my home was  absolutely terrifying. ""I believe he came into my bedroom that night believing I would be alone. ""The fact that I was not alone was probably the reason why I don't think he went any further. ""I don't think this was a spur-of-the-moment decision, but rather something he thought about for some time. He thought he knew me, but he didn't,"" she added. Lily Allen perfroms at Glastonbury in 2014 Judge Martyn Barklem said Gray had told police he would ""cut her with a knife"". ""This was a terrifying experience for (Lily Allen), and it was extremely fortunate there was an adult male in the property who evicted Mr Gray from it,"" he said. He added: ""I make it clear that the (hospital) order I have made is not a punishment but is entirely for your well-being and that of the public."" Gray was found guilty in April. He had an unspecified number of previous convictions and in 2008 had been cautioned after handing her a CD of love songs and a letter. In a statement outside court, solicitor Andy Cave said Gray never intended to cause Allen any distress. ""He wishes to assure Miss Allen that he will not be pursuing her any further. ""He is aware he has significant work to do with his doctors and is looking forward to successfully achieving his release."""

Peter Bialek, 66, from Salisbury, was trying to move his car out of a parking space after it had been boxed in. He lost control and the vehicle lurched forward and surged 20 metres into the crowd inside the marquee. Bialek was immediately pulled from the car and assaulted. Bialek was leaving early because of back pain At an earlier hearing he pleaded guilty to three counts of grievous bodily harm without intent and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving. Bialek had not intended to drive that night but his partner, who had not been drinking, was unable to manoeuvre their vehicle out of their parking space at the ball at Dene Farm near Andover, Hampshire, on 3 October last year. Of the 21 people injured, a 65-year-old woman suffered a fractured ankle, her husband had three broken ribs and a 22-year-old woman had cuts to her legs. Bialek's lawyer, Charles Gabb, told the court that he had lost control of the car because he had failed to find the brake pedal. Mr Gabb said: ""From the moment the car came to a stop when he turned the keys, he was expressing shock and horror at what happened. The car went straight through the marquee and out the other end And he added: ""What happened on that night was a dreadful miscarriage of judgment. The consequences will live with all of the victims but he too will live with it for the rest of life. ""It has made the deepest impact on him possible, it will live with him until his dying day."" His stepdaughter Debbie Trant said: ""He is a shadow of his former self. It's a terrible shame to see such a great man be reduced to this."" After the incident in Hampshire In sentencing, Mr Justice Teare told Bialek: ""I have given considerable weight to your qualities as a human being, I accept that you are in every other respect a good man."" Bialek has also been banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay court costs of £750."

Energy Secretary Amber Rudd tore into the former London mayor several times during the televised event on ITV, accusing him of peddling ""misinformation"". Ms Rudd - representing the Remain campaign alongside Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Labour's Angela Eagle - went on the offensive from the start, accusing the Leave side of talking nonsense. And during an exchange on immigration numbers, she told the audience: ""I fear that the only number Boris is interested in is the one that says No 10."" :: Analysis: EU Vote: 'Get Boris' Strategy Carries Risks Mr Johnson retorted that he was backing Leave because David Cameron had failed to secure the changes which would have enabled him to meet his commitment to cut net migration to below 100,000 in his EU re-negotiation. ""That did not happen in the re-negotiation. We didn't get anything of the kind,"" he said. ""There has got to be democratic consent for the scale of the flows that we are seeing."" Ms Rudd turned on her Tory colleague again in her closing remarks, describing Mr Johnson as ""the life and soul of the party, but not the one you want driving you home at the end of the evening"". When asked on Friday if he felt he was unfairly targeted in the debate, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's very important, whatever happens - we've got two weeks to go, perhaps a little less - we've got to focus on the issues. ""This is it, it's a once in a lifetime chance for us to get the facts across about EU membership, about the advantages of being out, the great future we could have outside, the free trade deals we could do, and the advantages of being out of a system that is one-size fits all, very cumbersome, very bureaucratic and very old fashioned now."" Representing the Leave campaign, Mr Johnson, Labour's Gisela Stuart and energy minister Andrea Leadsom repeatedly hammered home their ""take back control"" campaign message during the debate. :: Got A Question On The EU You Want To Ask Corbyn Live? Ms Leadsom clashed with Ms Rudd - her departmental colleague in the Conservative Government - when she quoted a former Interpol chief who said EU membership was like ""hanging out a sign welcoming terrorists to Europe"". Ms Rudd shot back: ""This is what I call scaremongering, when people talk about immigration in that tone. It is completely unacceptable."" The Leave campaign's controversial claim that Brexit would free up £350m a week the UK sends to Brussels came under scrutiny - on the day prominent Tory Dr Sarah Wollaston switched sides to Remain in protest at its continued use. Ms Rudd said: ""What is so misleading about this is the fact that being in the European Union makes us money. ""We're going to repaint that bus and put a leprechaun on one end, a great big rainbow on one side and a pot of gold at the end. ""Because that's all it is - pure fantasy."""

The USS Porter entered the Black Sea a few days ago ""as part of a regularly scheduled deployment"", the US Navy said. The guided-missile destroyer arrived at the port of Varna in Bulgaria, a NATO member, on 8 June, the US Navy's Sixth Fleet said in a statement. ""The ship's operations in the Black Sea are meant to enhance maritime security and stability, readiness and naval capability with our allies and partners,"" it said. The USS Porter docked in Varna harbour Russian media said it was expected to continue on to Ukraine and Georgia, both countries that have been in territorial dispute with pro-Russian groups. Andrei Kelin, a senior foreign ministry official, was reported as saying by Russian state news agency RIA: ""Of course, this does not meet with our approval and will undoubtedly lead to response measures."" US officials said the US military would also have two aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean this month. The deployments are taking place ahead of a NATO summit in Warsaw in July. It comes after UK troops took part in the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War in Poland earlier this week. USS Porter's deployment to the Black Sea has raised hackles in Moscow because the ship has recently been fitted with a new missile system. The US Navy says it is maintaining its operation in the sea - which provides the Russian navy's only direct access to the Mediterranean - in accordance with international law and the various agreements that govern the passage of military ships. But Mr Kelin said the deployment of US aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean was a show of force which in his view deepened a chill in ties between Moscow and Washington. Diplomatic relations have been at a low as a result of Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria, where Russian forces are assisting the regime of Bashar al Assad. ""As regards the overall situation of course there is a definite increase and stoking of tensions in our relations,"" Mr Kelin was reported as saying. ""It is all being done on the eve of the Warsaw NATO summit. It is a show of force."" USS Porter is normally based at Rota, Spain, while the US Sixth Fleet is headquartered at Naples. On Tuesday, Russian online newspaper Pravda.ru quoted an unnamed Russian official as saying that any US ship that attacked his country ""would only have five to 10 minutes to live""."

It was the morning of Trooping the Colour in 1981 and the Army's Footguards were on parade, lining the route from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards, drawing the traditional line of scarlet tunics through London's heart of pageantry. I remember it clearly because I was one of them, commanding what is called a Half Company of Street Liners, who hold ground for a procession to pass. I was a relatively inexperienced officer aged 20 and this was my first big parade. As the Queen was deftly tweaking the reins of her favourite horse, Burmese, to turn from the Mall into Horse Guards Approach Road, cracks of gun shots ripped through the summer air. ""I looked over my shoulder and I could see this lunatic trying to kill Her Majesty,"" remembers Alec Galloway, who was then aged 37 and a Lance Corporal in the Scots Guards. In fact, Alec and I served in the same Rifle Company of the 2nd Battalion and we had only recently returned from a tour in Belfast. Alec went on: ""I felt sheer anger as I reached for him and grabbed his hair. I used all my strength to pull him over the barrier and knock the pistol to the ground."" As he recalls these few seconds of action, one peaceful Saturday morning in June, the fiery flash of iron resolve I remember inspiring me in the 1980s still glints from his eyes. One sentence from Alec's memory summed up a fight that might have gone any way. ""I apprehended him with my boot."" He did indeed. In fact the teenager, Marcus Sarjeant reportedly begged police officers, who made good this courageous detention, to get Corporal Galloway off him. The weapon was in fact a starter pistol and was entirely harmless, but it startled Burmese and footage of the event shows the skills of the equestrian queen, as she gently calmed the horse without missing a stride. Sarjeant was sentenced to several years detention under the Treason Act, which he served in Grendon Psychiatric Prison. Gallery: St Paul's Kicks Off Celebrations A service is being held at St Paul's Cathedral in central London attended by the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, other royals and politicians to mark Her Majesty's 90th birthday celebrations Alec remembers seeing the Queen riding on ""as cool as a cucumber as if nothing had happened."" So he did the same. ""I went back to my place on the Mall and to the drill position of Present Arms,"" he said. But perhaps a great opportunity was then missed. This heroic act was made without knowledge that the weapon was harmless. What Alec did was emblematic of precisely what the Guards exist to do: what all the Armed Forces are under oath to protect. Despite this, he got no decoration for bravery, although a General's Commendation is no small achievement. Commanders with imagination and a grasp of how honoured valour inspires all might have recommended more. But Alec asks for nothing and he has not stopped serving the monarch that, under more sinister circumstances, he might have saved in 1981. On Tuesday, he will be in his place wearing the time-honoured green velvet frockcoats as an Ascot Greencoat to guard the Queen. Today, when honours are retrospectively removed from the undeserving, perhaps there may yet be a chance to put right an oversight and affirm this veteran's courage."

The ""highly exciting"" therapy involves destroying the patient's immune system and regenerating a new one using stem cells taken from their bone marrow. A 13-year trial involving 24 people with a highly active, relapsing form of MS saw 70% of patients experience a complete halt in the disease's progression. In 40% of patients, symptoms such as vision loss, balance problems and muscle weakness were reversed for prolonged periods of time. :: MS: How New Treatment Combats The Disease Although doctors say the findings hold a lot of promise, experts have warned the treatment can have serious side effects and risks. It is also thought the therapy will only help a small proportion of patients in the early stages of MS - and patients who have had significant disabilities for a prolonged period of time are unlikely to benefit. One of the main dangers associated with the therapy is the threat of infection for patients while they are unprotected by an immune system. The treatment is known as IAHSCT (immunoablation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) and a similar procedure has been used for treating patients with life-threatening leukaemia for several decades. Jennifer Molson, who participated in the MS trial six years after she was diagnosed with the disease, said: ""Before my transplant, I was unable to talk or work and was living in assisted care. Now, I am able to walk independently, live in my own home and work full time. ""I was also able to get married, walk down the aisle with my dad and dance with my husband. I've even gone downhill skiing."" The MS Society in the UK has welcomed the findings, published in the Lancet journal, as it ""provided valuable information about the long-term safety and effectiveness"" of the treatment. Professor Siddharthan Chandran, from the Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said the study appeared to render some of the patients in the study ""effectively disease-free"". He added: ""However, the treatment regime has substantial risks and safety concerns that underline the need for future studies with a larger sample size, control group and ideally identification of predictive markers to allow targeting of this treatment to those MS patients at greatest risk of rapid and severe decline."""

Luke Harlow sent messages on social media to another 15-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, which read: ""I wish I could kidnap you for Christmas but I would probably be arrested and sent to prison,"" a jury was told. Another read: ""If I kidnap you, I am keeping you."" Luke Harlow (L) and Stephen Beadman Harlow, 27, admits chatting with Kayleigh online after meeting her on Facebook a fortnight before she was killed, but he denies holding her captive. A jury at Nottingham Crown Court heard that Harlow's 27-year-old's friend, Stephen Beadman, 29, has admitted murdering and raping 15-year-old Kayleigh last November; but he denies a charge of false imprisonment. Kayleigh, from Measham, Leicestershire, was found dead on farmland last November, barefoot and partially-clothed, three days after a witness saw her pinned to the ground by Beadman near Harlow's home in George Avenue, Ibstock. Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC alleged Kayleigh fled Harlow's house and was chased by Beadman, who then killed her. At the conclusion of her opening speech to the jury, Ms Moore invited jurors to consider whether Kayleigh was trying to escape from a fight or a struggle. She told the jury: ""Why have we shown you all these messages between Luke Harlow and these young ladies? ""We say it will help you to understand what was in his mind. At some point Kayleigh clearly wanted to leave that flat. ""You don't run out into the night dressed like she was unless you want to get out of there fast."" The trial continues."

Ms McClay, 24, was pounced upon while in the keepers' corridor of the tiger house at the zoo in May of that year. South Lakes, in Dalston-in-Furness, Cumbria, pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court to breaches of the law on Wednesday. At the time of the attack, it was known as South Lakes Wild Animal Park. The company was fined an additional £42,500 after pleading guilty to other breaches of health and safety law breaches, including one when a zoo keeper fell from a ladder while preparing to feed big cats on 18 July, 2014. The firm, whose sole director is 55-year-old zoo founder David Gill, was order to pay an additional £150,000 in prosecution costs. Sentencing, Mr Justice Turner said ""it should not have been possible"" for the tiger to gain access to where Ms McClay was working. He added: ""But as a substantially contributory cause as a result of a door-closing mechanism failure, it did. ""The result was as tragic as it was foreseeable. The tiger attacked and Sarah was fatally injured."" On Wednesday, the prosecution offered no evidence against Mr Gill, who faced individual charges on the same allegations, and formal not guilty verdicts were recorded against him. Ms McClay suffered deep puncture wounds to the neck, the back of her body, both arms and her left foot, a post-mortem found. Bruising and abrasions to her head and back were consistent with her being dragged along the ground, the inquest heard. Following that hearing, Ms McClay's boyfriend, David Shaw, said: ""It's a shame it took this long to come to what was a fairly obvious conclusion but I am pleased we do not have to go through a trial."" At the time, Ms McClay's family asked for Padang the Sumatran tiger not to be put down, but it was put to sleep this year because of his age."

His words were issued under the Together for England drive which aims to strengthen the relationship between the Three Lions and football fans, especially those who are young. The Duke of Cambridge, who has been FA President for the last 10 years, did not mention the other home sides in the tournament - Wales and Northern Ireland. England, managed by Roy Hodgson, play their first match on Saturday at 8pm (BST) against Russia. In his specially recorded video message to the squad, he said: ""Roy, I wanted to wish you, your staff and the England squad all the very best for the European Championship finals in France. ""I know you have done everything possible to prepare in the right way, building on the hard work that has been done at Wembley, St. George's Park and on the road. ""Like millions of fans across the country, I will be tuning into the opening game against Russia on Saturday night. ""I am definitely going to make it out there myself during the tournament. And rest assured that everyone back home will be cheering England on whenever you play. ""We are all looking forward to watching some great football over the coming weeks. ""An exciting performance from this team will inspire the next generation of England players and staff to go out and get involved in the game at the grassroots. ""I know The FA is sending the message to supporters everywhere that we are Together for England. Remember, the nation is behind you. Good luck to you all."" William's message comes as unprecedented security, terror threats and strike action cast a shadow over the start of Europe's biggest ever football tournament. The tournament opens with hosts France playing Romania in Paris. England begin their campaign in Marseille on Saturday where there were clashes as violence erupted between England fans and locals. The FA said the Duke will be attending England's final Group B match against Slovakia in Saint-Étienne on Monday 20 June. Wales will play their first match against Slovakia at 5pm on Saturday in the other opening Group B match. Northern Ireland, who are in Group C with Germany and Ukraine, will start against Poland on Sunday, also at 5pm.

No one was in the parked car that was hit by the plane, which had either just taken off or was landing at nearby Hobby Airport.

Some 238,903 voters applied to register online on Wednesday, followed by 191,508 on Thursday, and another 5,936 people who used paper forms. This means a total of nearly 1.2 million people applied over the last four days. The deadline was pushed back by MPs after thousands were prevented from registering before the original deadline of midnight on Tuesday when the website failed. :: EU In Or Out? Put Your Questions To Corbyn There was a flurry of activity on the webpage in the minutes before midnight on Thursday, according to a live monitoring site. It showed there were just under 5,000 people using the service at 11.55pm - and more than 3,000 still on the site after the deadline had passed. There was a system overload during the 24 hours leading up to the original deadline, when more than half a million people applied to register. Downing Street said 214,000 people were trying to use the www.gov.uk/register-to-vote website between 9pm and 10pm on Tuesday, but it was not known exactly how many were unable to register before the midnight deadline. Some of those attempting to register were greeted with the message: ""Sorry we are having technical problems. Please try again in a few moments."" The Government held emergency discussions with the Electoral Commission to extend the deadline to the end of Thursday. Pro-Brexit Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth criticised the move, saying voters only had themselves to blame if they missed out. He told the Commons: ""People have had months and months in which to register and ... if they left it to the last minute and all tried to register yesterday, that's their fault. ""We should not change our regulations in the middle of a very important referendum campaign simply to suit those who haven't organised their personal affairs well enough to secure their registration in good time."" Despite the large numbers of applications, not all of them will be new registrations. This is because the figures will include those who may be unaware of the fact that they were already signed up to vote, as well as those who are ineligible. Last year five million applications to register to vote in the general election were made in England and Wales between 1 January and 20 April, but the number actually registered to vote increased by only 1.35 million."

The education watchdog says it made a mistake in an earlier explanation about why it has withdrawn its report into safeguarding at the private Zakaria Muslim Girls' High School in Batley, West Yorkshire. The report, published in October 2015, included an admission from the inspector that he had not spoken to pupils or staff because they were celebrating the Islamic Eid festival, despite it finishing three weeks earlier. The flawed inspection was uncovered during investigations by Sky News into private schools run by the secretive Deobandi sect in West Yorkshire. The school is one of three now facing further action from authorities. Ofsted's national director of education, Sean Harford, wrote to Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake last month admitting it had made a mistake. Mr Harford wrote: ""The inspector clearly should have spoken to pupils ... (he) did not challenge the school when they said they were celebrating Eid and prohibited him from talking to pupils."" Mr Harford has now written to the MP again, saying it made a further mistake. Mr Harford said the school had not prohibited the inspector from speaking to anyone but that the inspector ""felt unable to talk to pupils"". Mr Harford's second letter, dated 13 June, went on: ""I can confirm that the inspector concerned is no longer contracted to work for Ofsted. ""We are in discussions with the Department for Education regarding a new commission to re-inspect this school."" Mr Hollinrake, who has raised the school's inspection with Home Secretary Theresa May, said questions still need to be answered. ""Why did the inspector accept that a religious festival is grounds for not being given access to pupils and staff?"" he said. ""We need to make sure that every government agency takes a robust approach to make sure that all education in this country promotes British values of inclusion, equality and tolerance."" When approached for comment, Zakaria Muslim Girls' High School told Sky News it has a policy of not talking to journalists."

Police say Larossi Abballa repeatedly stabbed 42-year-old policeman Jean-Baptiste Salvaing outside his home in Magnanville, about 35 miles (55km) west of Paris. He then took the policeman's partner hostage, together with the couple's three-year-old son. The woman, who worked at a local police station, was also killed, and their son was ""in shock but unharmed"", a prosecutor said.  Abballa, 25, was killed during a three-hour police operation.  Police stormed the house after failed negotiations with the attacker French officials said the attacker posted a 12-minute video of the killings on Facebook Live, the social media site's live feed. His account has been suspended. One official says that at one point during the attack, Abballa puzzled over the fate of the couple's three-year-old child. ""I don't know what to do with him,"" he says in the footage, indicating the child sitting behind him on a couch. The French prosecutor said Abballa attacker had a 'hit list' of VIPs, police and rappers. Police have made two arrests in connection with the killings. Both people are said to be ""linked"" to Abballa, who was from the nearby suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie. The attacker was killed during the operation Abballa had previously been placed under surveillance, and recently his phone was tapped but without any results, according to a police source. President Francois Hollande said: ""This is incontestably a terrorist act. ""France is not the only country concerned as we have seen in the past days in the United States in Orlando, but we also saw it in Europe and in some other countries in the world, France is facing a terror threat of a very large scale."" Witnesses told investigators that Abballa may have shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) as he launched the attack. Explosions were heard at the scene as heavily-armed police moved in following failed negotiations with the RAID elite police unit. Police man a roadblock near the scene of the double killing Abballa was jailed for three years in 2013, six months of which were suspended, for ""criminal association with the aim of preparing terrorist attacks"", in a trial with seven other defendants. A Facebook profile bearing the name Larossi Abballa - which has now vanished - showed a photo of a smiling, bearded man. Two recent posts featured videos critical of Israel and Saudi Arabia.  ""Some will say we see evil everywhere!"" he said in a message posted about 18 hours before the attack. President Hollande said it was 'incontestably a terrorist act' In another video he moaned about people not being nice or smiling at him when he delivered food to them. The Amaq News Agency, which is linked to IS, claimed the attack was carried out by an ""Islamic State fighter"". French police are worried about future attacks. ""Today every police officer is a target,"" said police union chief Yves Lefebvre, adding that attackers are ""professionalising"" and can now find police in their homes. France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve described the killing of the officer as ""an appalling terrorist attack"" - and said more than 100 people seen as potential threats have been arrested in recent weeks. The threat ""is high in France, it's high in Europe, it's high in the Western world as shown by the events that happened 48 hours ago in the United States,"" Mr Cazeneuve added."

Vote Leave has released details of ""discretionary spending"" for 2014 by Brussels bureaucrats, claiming the European Commission had attempted to keep them under wraps. They claimed the commission had buried the figures under headings such as ""communication"" in a deliberate attempt to avoid scrutiny. Employment Minister and 'Out' campaigner Priti Patel said: ""They have tried to hide this spending for years. ""Most families have been hit hard since the financial crisis, having to tighten their belts to make ends meet. :: Pound Falls Again As Markets Eye Brexit Polls ""But EU officials are using our money to fund their jollies and exorbitant expense claims."" Included in the expenses figures were: :: £348,712 to luxury private jet firm Luxaviation :: £176,729 on luxury hotels - including £43,384 at the five star Stamford Hotel in Brisbane and £17,612 at the Shangri La Hotel in Singapore. :: European Commission environment officials spent £12,339 on resorts  :: Officials from the environment and employment, social affairs and inclusion departments spent £1,611 on cruises :: Officials from the environment and research and innovation departments and the joint research centre ran up bills totalling £140,359 at top restaurants. :: Agriculture and rural development officials spent £4,654 on chateaus. A European Commissioner spokesman said: ""EU officials travel for work, the vast majority in economy class. They have to pay up front and are only reimbursed if strict rules allow it.""

Ms Patel, former London mayor Boris Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove, have signed an open letter outlining that EU funding for farming, science and culture would continue until 2020. The letter says: ""There is more than enough money to ensure that those who now get funding from the EU - including universities, scientists, family farmers, regional funds, cultural organisations and others - will continue to do so while also ensuring that we save money that can be spent on our priorities. ""If the public votes to leave on 23 June, we will continue to fund EU programmes in the UK until 2020, or up to the date when the EU is due to conclude individual programmes if that is earlier than 2020.""

Plans were being made to evacuate schools after the unnamed man, who is a retired member of the armed services, spotted the device and dialled 999, telling the operator: ""It looks like there's a viable device in my car."" West Yorkshire Police decided the man's military background identified him as a potential terror target and launched pre-planned emergency procedures, including evacuating nearby homes and preparing a reception centre. Officers set up a cordon around the man's car in Providence Avenue, Woodhouse, as council officials discussed widening it and evacuating schools and public buildings. Photographs of the suspicious-looking device were sent to the bomb squad, who identified it as a GPS tracker almost an hour after the alarm was raised at 10am on Tuesday. Sources say the police established the tracker had been unsuccessfully hidden in the car by the man's wife. West Yorkshire Police have confirmed they dealt with a suspicious package in a car, while Leeds City Council say their emergency planning team was involved in the incident. ""We were asked by the police to invoke our emergency procedures and began preparing a reception centre and made arrangements to transport evacuees,"" said a spokeswoman. No details have been released about why the woman tried to hide the device in the car."

The European Commission took the legal case against Britain to the Luxembourg court, on the grounds that it was discriminating against citizens of other EU countries attempting to claim handouts including child benefit and child tax credit. But Europe's top judges ruled foreign nationals could be treated differently to limit the burden on taxpayers.

Anthea McIntyre MEP, Conservative employment spokesman in the European Parliament, said: ""The Commission may have attempted to dictate to Britain, but it has been put in its place by the EU's own institutions."" Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder added: ""The right to travel and work abroad is a two-way street. ""Around 1.2 million Brits choose to live in the EU.

""As well as the cost to taxpayers of fighting these lengthy drawn-out cases, it's clearly an illegitimate challenge to our sovereignty. ""Although David Cameron didn't want to admit it, this case and others like it are proof positive that the unelected European Court of Justice is now supreme above our elected Parliament. ""They decide the rules and the only way to prevent this kind of intervention in future is to vote Leave on June 23."" A spokesman for HM Revenue and Customs said: ""The UK welcomes the Court of Justice of the European Union's judgment, which supports our view that we are entitled to ensure only EU migrants who have a right to be in the UK can claim our benefits."""

He said he and his wife June had forgiven the former athlete, but that he must pay for his crime.

Mr Steenkamp avoided most of the lengthy trial because of ill health suffered since losing his daughter in the shooting more than three years ago. The hearing continues."
2016-06-15,Concerns about the funding of higher education in the event of Brexit have been raised by the head of the organisation that represents Britain's leading universities.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160615004850/http://news.sky.com/story/1712003/how-brexit-may-affect-the-uk-education-sector,"By Ian King, Business Presenter Concerns about the funding of higher education in the event of Brexit have been raised by the head of the organisation that represents Britain's leading universities. Wendy Piatt, director-general of the Russell Group - whose members include Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Glasgow, Bristol, Edinburgh, Leeds, Exeter and Durham universities - warned £500m worth of education and research grants won by British establishments from the European Union would be put at risk by leaving. Dr Piatt said she did not expect that money to be replaced by funding from Whitehall were it to be lost after the referendum due to constraints on the public finances. Toby Young, an educationalist and Out supporter who founded the West London Free School, disagreed with Dr Piatt, telling me: ""Even if you deduct what we give to the EU and the EU then spends on institutions like the Russell Group, we would have £10bn left over. ""It's typical of the educated, upper middle class view point on the EU - and we've seen that attitudes towards Brexit do skew along class lines. ""There is no reason to think that as part of a post-Brexit deal with the EU that the British government couldn't arrange for EU students to come to British universities."" Britain's universities are very good at winning funding from the EU for which they have to compete. The UK leads other European nations in winning grants from the European Research Council, the EU-backed body that supports scientific and technological research, with 23% of all ERC funding going to British universities. The Russell Group's members, meanwhile, attract 18% of ERC funding - more than all of the universities in Germany or France, and more than universities in Spain and Italy combined. This helps feed into a sector of the economy that, as a whole, punches vastly above its weight on the international stage. The UK has just 1% of the world's population and just 4% of its researchers but, according to Dr Piatt's organisation, earns 12% of international citations and produces 16% of the world's most-cited research papers. That's why, as an export earner, Britain's universities are reckoned to generate some £1.86bn for the UK annually and 19,000 jobs. Winning such research funding is increasingly important in an age where more Britons than ever are going on to higher education and in which successive governments have been trying to shift the way in which universities are funded from a dependence on taxpayers to a reliance on fees. But a Leave vote could have other implications for Britain's universities. Many staff come from the EU and so do the students they teach - despite an increased drive to recruit from China, India and other emerging market economies. Those overseas students and the money they pay, in turn, help to keep down the fees paid by British students. Moreover, on graduation, a lot of them remain in the UK to make a further contribution to the UK economy - one reason why the business sector has been lobbying for more lenient treatment for students from China and elsewhere when applying for visas.

The Maroon 5 singer had mentored Christina Grimmie when she finished third on the American version of The Voice two years ago. His spokeswoman, Carleen Donovan, confirmed that Levine made the offer. Christina Grimmie was shot while she signed autographs When he heard of her death, Levine tweeted that he and his wife Behati were ""devastated"". ""Our hearts go out to her family,"" he wrote. The 22-year-old was shot while she signed autographs after a concert in the city on Friday night. She died in hospital. Police say she apparently had no personal connection to the man who shot her, 26-year-old Kevin James Loibl.  Adam Levine said he was devastated by news of Christina's death There is still no confirmed motive for the attack, but police chief John Mina said Loibl may have been a deranged fan. After a struggle with the singer's brother, Loibl shot himself dead. Family, friends and fans have staged a candlelight vigil in her New Jersey hometown. Police believe Kevin James Loibl may have been a deranged fan Hundreds paid tribute to Grimmie in Evesham Township at the town's Memorial Complex. She lived in the small community about 20 miles from Philadelphia, before moving to Los Angeles in 2012. ""She loved this town,"" her brother Marcus Grimmie told the crowd. ""She loved this state, she loved singing, she loved the Lord and she loved me."" Before appearing on The Voice, Grimmie was a star on YouTube, singing covers of other people's songs. Her manager, Brian Teefey, has created a GoFundMe page ""to assist her family in their time of need"". Teefey is also actress and singer Selena Gomez's stepfather, and both he and Gomez were very close to Grimmie."

The rise has been described as a continuation of the ""strong growth"" seen in property prices over the past two-and-a-half years. According to the ONS index, which uses data from several sources, the average UK house price is significantly lower than suggested under the old method. The ONS now says the typical value of a UK property is £209,054 - £83,000 less than what was recorded using the former index in March. London property prices have also taken a hit under the new measurement and are now back under the half a million pound mark at £470,000, considerably less than the old estimate of £552,000. A different formula is now being used to calculate prices which ""is not as sensitive to extreme valued property"", meaning results are less likely to be artificially inflated by expensive properties. As this is the first time this index has been released, it is being described by the ONS as an ""experimental official statistic"" for now. Even though average house prices have been revised down, many areas have enjoyed growth over the past 12 months - and London continues to be the fastest growing region, with prices increasing by 14.5% in the year to April. In local authority areas, it was good news for the City of London (27.3% growth) and Slough (25.2% growth), with the Berkshire town's property market buoyed by the imminent arrival of Crossrail, a new high-capacity railway route to London. Meanwhile, Merthyr Tydfil in Wales saw an 11.1% slump in house prices. Burnley in Lancashire is the cheapest place to buy a property in the UK, with the typical house costing just £73,000. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said increases in stamp duty for buy-to-let investors and the upcoming EU referendum had dampened activity on the housing market, but added that the ongoing supply shortage would ""likely provide support to house prices""."

Authorities were alerted and he was arrested on his return to the UK. Lawyer Shabir Quershi, defending, said Mr Warlow had been caught ""bang to rights"", but he added his client and other England fans had been provoked by Russia supporters who had been ""tooling up with martial arts gloves and batons"". ""He is a man of good character. He travelled, was vetted and allowed to go on his way,"" he added. ""While in Marseille he admits that he foolishly picked up a chair and threw it.

Economists had been expecting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure to rise in May following a surprise 0.2% decline to 0.3% in April - the first fall since September last year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) measured a 0.9% increase in transport costs last month, as the price of diesel stepped up 3p per litre compared to 1.5p in the same month of 2015. Petrol rose by almost the same amount. The ONS also recorded a 0.5% rise in the cost of restaurants and hotel bookings. It said these cost pressures were dented by a 0.4% decline in the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages - led by vegetables and sweets - while fashion costs also fell slightly further as chains continued to discount after a slow start to sales of spring and summer ranges. The data was released against the backdrop of a slowing economy and uncertainty over the result of the EU referendum on 23 June - with the latest opinion polls contributing to turmoil on world financial markets. :: Brexit: Your Guide To The Economic Debate The Bank of England, which has warned that a British exit could tip the country back towards recession, is under no pressure to raise interest rates at its next monetary policy committee meeting this week. Its target rate for inflation is 2%. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""While it is likely that price growth will slowly edge up through the rest of this year, we expect that inflation will remain below the 2% target until well into 2017. ""Against this background, any thought of raising interest rates will be firmly off the agenda. ""However, low rates on their own are insufficient to stimulate economic growth. ""Much more forceful measures are needed in key areas, particularly supporting exporters and increasing infrastructure investment""."

CBS News has spoken to a US official with knowledge of the investigation who says club-goers had told investigators they had seen Omar Mateen at Pulse previously. Local newspaper The Orlando Sentinel reported that Mateen was seen drinking alone at the club by at least four people before the night he opened fire. One club regular Ty Smith told the paper he had seen Mateen at least a dozen times. He said: ""Sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself. ""And other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent. ""We didn't really talk to him a lot, but I remember him saying things about his dad at times,"" Mr Smith added. ""He told us he had a wife and child."" :: Survivor - Mateen Just Missed My Head Jim Van Horn, a regular at the Pulse club, said: ""He was trying to pick up people. Men. He was a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men. ""He would walk up to them and then he would maybe put his arm around 'em or something and maybe try to get them to dance a little bit or something. ""And then go over and buy a drink or something. That's what people do at gay bars, you know?"" Another Pulse-goer Kevin West told the Los Angeles Times that Mateen had messaged him several times using a gay chat app. The communication was on and off over the space of a year, he added. WFTV9, meanwhile, interviewed a gay former classmate of Mateen's who claimed the killer had asked him out after going to several gay bars with him. When his ex-wife Sitora Yusufiy was asked by CNN on Monday if he was gay, she sat in silence for a few seconds before answering: ""I don't know."" Orlando Police have so far refused to comment. Some have suggested his familiarity with the club may explain why he chose Pulse, rather than other clubs closer to his home in Port St Lucie, about 130 miles (200km) south of Orlando. The US-born security guard, a 29-year-old son of Afghan immigrants, shot dead 49 people on Sunday night and injured another 53 before being himself shot dead by police at the end of a hostage siege. Officers had to use an armoured vehicle to smash a 2-3ft hole through a wall to rescue dozens of people who had been hiding in a toilet. The FBI have said Mateen was investigated in 2013 over ""inflammatory comments"" suggesting ""terrorist ties"" and US media reported he made a phone call before the Orlando attack declaring allegiance to Islamic State. There have been reports that Mateen showed anger at seeing two men kissing, but his father has told Sky News a normal reaction would have been to say ""it's a free country"". Seddique Mateen told the New York Daily News his son is not gay. Friends and co-workers have described Omar Mateen as homophobic and ""mentally unstable,"" while his ex-wife said he was violent and had bipolar disorder. The FBI is trying to establish whether Mateen had recently scouted Disney World as a potential target, as some reports suggested. US authorities have confirmed he was able to buy at least two guns in the days before Sunday's attack, despite confirmation from the FBI that he had been interviewed twice over possible terror links. On the West Coast of the US, a 20-year-old man who was arrested at the weekend on his way to a Los Angeles gay pride parade has been charged with three felonies and one misdemeanour. James Wesley Howell was arrested after police allegedly found firearms and explosives in his car. Authorities have not linked him to the mass shooting in Orlando."

""Why the law enforcement team was so late - they should have neutralised him quick ... This should not have happened."" He added: ""Obviously if (the club) had that kind of experience, they should have had better security and after this any club should have security. ""They should protect people that come in the club."" :: Orlando Victims Remembered In London Vigil Authorities are investigating Omar Mateen's motives in the shooting, although the FBI said he appears to be a ""homegrown extremist"" who professed support for a mixture of often-conflicting Islamic radical groups. During the attack he called 911 to proclaim his allegiance to the Islamic State group. FBI Director James Comey said Mateen was clearly ""radicalised"", at least in part via the internet. But Mr Mateen said religion had ""nothing to do with"" his son's actions. ""No religion or background teaches you to harm somebody or kill someone. ""It's a lone act: he's responsible for what he's doing - not the religion or background. ""I don't forgive what he did - it's unforgivable because we didn't teach him to do this. ""I taught him to become more educated and more service-oriented towards the community."" :: Video Of Gunfire From Inside Nightclub Massacre Mr Mateen said he ""didn't see any obvious"" signs his son held prejudices against the LGBT community. He added: ""I wish he was alive - I could ask him. I don't know at all what was his personal feeling."" When asked about an incident a few years ago, which has been widely reported, where Omar Mateen had shown anger after seeing two men kissing each other, Mr Mateen said: ""It was a normal reaction (to the kissing), but why should I get mad? ""I never got mad (at the kissing) because it's a free country, everyone has his own choice to do what the law allows him, what the country allows him."" Mr Mateen expressed sympathy for those who were in mourning following the shooting and those who had been injured, saying: ""I share their feeling ... It's not good news for the whole of America."" ""I did my part to give him education, send him to school ... he had his own responsibility. What was my job and responsibility I took care of it. ""If I knew and noticed something wrong ... I would have called the law enforcement."""

It is hoped the new text service will help encourage current donors to continue to give blood by offering them an insight into how their donation is used, as well as inspiring others to donate. Blood donation is a lifeline of the NHS and it is hoped the scheme will encourage the 200,000 new donors the NHS needs this year. There is a particular need to attract younger donors and people from South Asian and black communities. Currently, only 1% of people who have given blood in England in the last 12 months come from black communities, and only 2% come from South Asian or mixed race communities. Every three weeks, two strangers save Amit Ghelani's life. A lot of the blood in his body started in somebody else's. He has thalassaemia, a condition which means he does not produce red blood cells. It is the donations of people he has never met which keep him alive. On World Blood Donor Day, NHS Blood and Transplant is trying to highlight how donors across the country save lives such as Mr Ghelani's every day. Mr Ghelani, 30, who has relied on regular blood transfusions since he was three months old, told Sky News: ""I wouldn't be here without those donations."""

The Sun newspaper told its 1.7 million readers to ""BeLEAVE in Britain"" as it rubbished David Cameron's Remain campaign as ""deceitful"". ""It has been nasty, cynical, personally abusive and beneath the dignity of Britain,"" the paper said. The decision is hardly a surprise: The Sun is traditionally a eurosceptic newspaper and nearly three quarters of its readership are Brexiteers. Backing Remain was always going to be tricky for The Sun's editor. So the poll surge for Vote Leave is good news for Tony Gallagher. :: Pound Falls As Brexit Polls Shift Now he is in with a chance of being able to back his readers while also being in with a shot of backing the winning side: the tabloid has called it correctly on every big national electoral event since 1979. Scenting that the Leave campaign really are within grasp of victory, Mr Gallagher is out of the blocks early to ""make the full case for Leave"" in the final week of the campaign. Expect other Fleet Street editors to follow in the coming days.  This is very serious and very worrying for team Remain and Mr Cameron. Remember the panic that set in at No 10 during the Scottish referendum when one poll put the Independence campaigners ahead with just 11 days to go? Downing Street have had four such polls in as many days: YouGov today puts Leave on a seven point lead; ICM polls for the Guardian have Leave six points ahead while a Daily Telegraph polls give Vote Leave a one point lead. :: Brexit's For Rich, Chancellor Claims Senior Remainers insist Vote Leave are peddling a ""fantasy"", with one telling me now is the moment to ""take a long hard look at what we could be doing to ourselves of we leave"". But those economic warnings have been made repeatedly for the past four weeks and appear to be falling on deaf ears. As Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, observes: ""The Prime Minister must now be feeling discomfort at the thought that the outcome really could be in doubt."" The shock poll in Scotland back in 2014, that put the Independence campaigners in the lead, galvanised a change in gear for the pro-Unionists in the final 11 days of that campaign, and pro-Remainers will hope that this bout of Brexiteer polling will do the same in the EU referendum campaign. There are, after all, some crumbs of comfort for Team Remain and No 10. Vote Leave's lead in the polls is smaller than the percentage of voters who say they are still undecided: Mr Cameron has just over a week to try to bring them into his fold."

A 1-1 draw in the opening match against Russia means qualification may be fraught; sustained violence on the streets means UEFA may yet take it out of Roy Hodgson's hands and throw them out. The team and its fans have been here before. After Euro 2000 in Belgium - the last time water cannon was deployed against England fans - they were put on a final warning. It proved a watershed for the policing of England supporters at home and abroad. It ushered in the era of banning orders and official travel clubs, and extensive liaison between the British police and their foreign counterparts. Euro 2004 in Portugal and the World Cup in Germany two years later saw huge numbers of fans allowed to drink and sing themselves to stupefaction with limited police intervention, and mercifully little provocation. :: England Fans Jailed Over Euro 2016 Violence Two long-haul World Cups in South Africa and Brazil followed, perhaps lulling us into the belief that the problem had been solved. It has not, but it has changed. This was not a complete throwback to the dark days. This was not a case of bovine English fans brutalising a foreign city for the hell of it. It was a complex, toxic mix of Russian and local hooligan gangs, a rump of mainly young - largely drunk - England fans and a police force that struggled to keep up. :: Russian MP To Euro Hooligans: 'Well Done Lads' The blame game is in full cry, as is the denouncement of media trying to make sense of it. But after four days on the ground it is clear that while there was fault on all sides, by far the most malignant and dangerous element was a frighteningly well-organised Russian hooligan gang. :: Hodgson And Rooney In Peace Plea To Fans Their irresistible target were the hundreds, perhaps thousands of England fans who set up camp in the centre of the old port, spilling into the roads and pushing the boundaries of respect for their hosts. Gallery: England Fans Attacked In Stadium After Russia Match Three days of mayhem in Marseille ended with shocking scenes of violence inside the Stade Velodrome as Russian supporters attacked their English counterparts on Saturday night They were raucous and rowdy, and the more they drank the less pleasant they became. But this was not a firm intent on violence. With almost 1,500 convicted or suspected hooligans banned from travelling their bark was largely worse than their bite. Yet they were policed as if it was still the 1980s, and were the softest of targets for the Russians and French Ultras, who ran rings round the authorities and struck at will. Throughout Friday night they staged hit-and-run attacks that left their victims baffled and bruised and left the police chasing shadows and peering uncertainly down side streets through the smoke. Emboldened, on Saturday the Russians launched brazen attacks in the city and then inside the stadium. Their preparations, including gum shields and MMA gloves, were on a scale that clearly surprised police. Many of the injured English were blameless and helpless, ambushed as they ate lunch or watched matches in bars. Some of the violence was merciless. One victim, Andrew Bache, 51, is in a critical condition after reportedly being attacked with an iron bar. Police were too slow to respond and when they did, preferred to fire tear gas rather than make arrests. The failure to detain a single Russian is damning. In the stadium the authorities were absent, unable to prevent the charge and subsequent crush of mainly English fans trying to escape. That UEFA appears to be treating the offences of Russian and England fans as equivalent strikes many as unfair but the English were not blameless. Some England supporters were too young, too naive or too drunk to avoid trouble, and many were far too easily provoked, particularly when it came to the police. Gallery: Friday: England Fan Police Clashes England fans have been involved in clashes in Marseille for the second night running Friday afternoon saw some questionable tactics from the gendarmerie, as they attempted to clear roads and close bars without warning - largely using tear gas. British officers on the ground advised them not to and were ignored. We witnessed many England fans hurling bottles at lines of police and members of the public. (There was no shortage of ammunition as empty Heineken bottles pulled from six packs sold in local supermarkets piled up on the pavements.) The majority of England fans will plead innocence but it is not a good look. There should be no surprise that prison sentences have been handed down. Yet the overwhelming majority were peaceful, if not always strictly well-behaved. The same applies to the Russian supporters and the Marseillaise who, if a little bemused, were overwhelmingly friendly and tolerant. UEFA must share the blame. The scheduling of this game at 9pm on a Saturday in a city where England have form was catastrophically misjudged. This week may be even worse, with the Russians, English and Welsh bound to overlap as they congregate in Lille for games on Wednesday and Thursday. Banning booze sales may help, and the threat of a ban could focus some minds. Listening to the British police would be a start. But it is too much to expect a security force focused on terrorism to indulge more of the same. With not a single Russian hooligan arrested and a refreshed set of England fans heading to France, we must hope for restraint on all sides. And perhaps pray for rain."

Speaking exclusively to Sky News, the Chancellor said poorer communities would be ""hit first"" and ""suffer longest"". In a week where Labour is expected to dominate campaigning for Stronger In, Mr Osborne made the appeal in Porthmadog, in northwest Wales. He said: ""When there is a recession, it is the poorer communities who are first hit and who suffer the longest. ""Brexit might be for the richest in our country but I'll tell you, people on low incomes, people on insecure incomes ... they are the people who suffer when the economy fails and goes into recession. ""Let's not impose that on this country in just over a week's time."" But the Chancellor also said he wanted to make a positive case for Remain, suggesting there would be a ""bounce back"" in the economy if people vote to stay on 23 June. ""I think there will be a snap back,"" he said. ""People will see investment flooding into the country. ""We've focused a lot on the downsides of quitting but there is a huge upside for our country, which is that we remove an uncertainty that has hung over this country - and all those decisions that have been delayed over recent months suddenly get taken. ""The money starts flowing in and the jobs are created."" He also responded to an apparent Foreign Office leak reported by the Sunday Times suggesting the Government had misled the public over Turkey joining the EU. ""This is the reddest of red herrings,"" he said. ""Turkey is not joining the EU. We are not offering visas to Turkish citizens. These things are not happening. Again, let's not quit the EU on a false story."" When pressed as to whether this meant Vote Leave had lied, he added: ""I think they have totally misrepresented the truth."" Later, in a Facebook Live for Sky News, the Chancellor also claimed former prime minister David Lloyd George would have backed the Remain side. ""Lloyd George would definitely be for remaining in the EU ... yes. He's not around so we can't ask him,"" he said. ""People like him, people who went before us, they put a huge amount of effort into building up organisations like the UN, like the IMF, like NATO, like the European Union ... ""You know, we have to be careful what we wish for on our continent. ""Do we want to set in train the break-up of the institutions that hold these great Western democracies together?"" Clearly in good humour, he even went on to deny that he dyed his hair - after potential rival Boris Johnson admitted he coloured his blond locks. The Chancellor had spent the morning in Liverpool making the case for Remain at a business exhibition. There, he received the backing of Labour Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson. But he closed the day by driving a steam train that used to transport Welsh slate and is now a popular local tourist attraction in Porthmadog."

The jury was also told that a motorist and his partner saw a man with blood on the left-hand side of his face near to where her body was found. Kayleigh's body was discovered three days after a witness says she was seen being pinned down by Stephen Beadman in Ibstock, Leicestershire. Beadman, 29, has admitted charges of murder and rape while Luke Harlow has pleaded guilty to grooming Kayleigh online and two sexual offences. Both deny falsely imprisoning her in the hours before her death. Samuel Green and Amy Dearden said they heard a loud scream in the morning of 15 November. Giving evidence on the third day of the trial, Mr Green, who lives near Ibstock's Sence Valley Forest Park, said he heard the calls after he went to bed shortly after midnight. Luke Harlow and Stephen Beadman deny false imprisonment He said: ""I was lying there. I can't be 100% sure how long I lay there and then all of a sudden I heard a loud scream, someone screaming 'mummy'. ""I thought it was me dreaming. Then I felt my partner grab my arm and say: 'Did you hear that?' ""As soon as she said that to me I knew that obviously it wasn't me."" He told the jury he looked out of the window for around 10 minutes, but heard nothing else. Ms Dearden said the call sounded so close that she thought someone was in the garden. She said: ""I heard a loud scream and it was someone screaming 'mummy',"" adding: ""It was definitely a female."" ""It sounded like a young child. Sam opened the window and shouted but nobody replied,"" she said. The jury earlier heard that a motorist and his partner had seen a man with blood on the left-hand side of his face, walking along the A447 near Ibstock on the morning of 15 November. Prosecutors allege the defendants held Kayleigh against her will in Harlow's home between 9pm on 14 November and 3am on 15 November."

Great Western Railway said only half of services were expected to run at the west London station this morning following the incident on Thursday evening. Network Rail said the disruption would last ""until the end of service"" today. The empty train derailed after going through a red signal outside the station, damaging overhead line equipment. Train users vented their frustration on Twitter. Pic: @nationalrailenq No one was injured in the incident, which resulted in no trains running into or out of the station last night. Great Western Railway apologised for the disruption, saying: ""We expect to be able to run around half our normal service into and out of Paddington on Friday morning. ""We hope this will improve as further progress is made and we would ask customers to check before travelling."" Network Rail advised customers to use routes through Waterloo and Marylebone stations. ""An empty train travelled past a red signal outside Paddington station, which activated an automatic derailment,"" it said. ""Our engineers are working around the clock to repair significant damage caused by this incident. ""We are working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and to minimise the inconvenience for passengers."" Train users used Twitter to express their annoyance after the derailment. Tanbir posted: ""Stuck on the train into #londonpaddington, going to miss an event I've paid for, really annoyed."" Arabel Bailey wrote that her journey home took five hours, adding: ""2 Ubers, 4 new friends and I've finally made it home."" Heathrow Express services were also suspended following of a loss of power at the station after the derailment. Network Rail said tickets not used on Paddington services on Thursday will be valid on Friday and Saturday."

The Bradford West MP was not only Jo Cox's constituency neighbour but also joined her as a new MP in the 2015 Westminster intake.  Describing the moment she learned of her colleague's death, she told Sky News: ""I never thought you could lose the sensation in your feet and your knees could go weak like I did yesterday. ""It took me 45 minutes to get back in my car and drive - it was horrible."" Ms Shah won a bitterly fought election battle for Bradford West in 2015 Her surgery on a busy Bradford street does have security precautions - a guard at the front desk, CCTV in the lobby and a second locked door before you reach her sixth floor office. Even so, she says she may now reconsider her arrangements after the murder, although she believes Britain prides itself on its close contact democracy. Ms Shah is a controversial figure, currently suspended by the Labour Party as it investigates allegedly anti-Semitic remarks she shared on social media. She has apologised and spoken to Jewish community leaders. But Ms Shah has been contacted by her local police force as the UK's 650 MPs are urged to reassess their security arrangements. Maria Miller has had a panic button installed in her office The shocking events in Birstall may have put security issues front and centre of the national debate, but there have been other incidents in recent years. In 2010 the Labour former Cabinet minister Stephen Timms was stabbed twice in the stomach by a constituent angry at his support for the Iraq war. More recently Gavin Barwell, the conservative MP for Croydon was threatened by a man with a knife at his office. He said: ""I had a constituent who had made an appointment for a surgery - it fairly rapidly became apparent that he was very disturbed. ""We asked him to leave and he wouldn't do so, so we called the police. ""While we were waiting for them to come he became increasingly agitated, kicking the furniture, threatening to attack me, to kill me. ""It was subsequently discovered that he was carrying a knife on him.""  So some have taken action, including the Basingstoke MP Maria Miller, who has now installed a panic button at her surgery office. She said: ""We got some very good advice from Parliament about how we should conduct our surgeries, which are such an important way of talking to our constituents face to face."" Naz Shah says the best defence could be to tone down the rhetoric, which she believes has become particularly inflamed around the EU referendum. She argues that her friend's legacy should not be a constriction of democracy but an expansion. Now more than ever she says we should be focusing on bridges between MPs and their constituents - not walls"

John Anderson was killed in the underground blast at the mine in Boulby, East Cleveland, which produces potash, a key ingredient in making fertiliser. It is 1,400m deep and stretches out far under the North Sea. ICL UK, which operates the mine, said the gas ""blow-out"" took place in the early hours of Friday. Emergency services at the site in Boulby, East Cleveland All other workers were safely evacuated from the site and mine inspectors informed of the blast, the company said. The emergency services and the mine's rescue team are working at the scene and an investigation has been launched into what happened. #ICL confirm a man has died following an underground gas blowout at #Boulby Mine. Terrible news. Thoughts & prayers with workforce & family Hearing there was very serious incident at #Boulby Potash mine this morning. My thoughts and prayers are with the workforce, as always. Cleveland Police said officers were alerted to the incident at around 5.20am. The force confirmed the fatality and said officers remained at the scene. ""We are working to understand the circumstances surrounding the incident,"" it said in a statement. The mine is reportedly the area's largest private employer, with around 800 staff. TFM reporter Hannah Smith, at the scene, told Sky News: ""As far as I am aware there isn't a danger to the public around here. ""It's not a very populated area. Sprawling fields of East Cleveland surround the mine itself."" In April, seven workers were taken to hospital for checks following an underground fire at the mine. Last year the firm announced job losses in a ""significant restructuring"" of its operations, including moving from producing potash to Polysulphate fertiliser. Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop, who represents Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, said: ""We cannot allow this death to go unmarked. ""Over the last decade and a half, the mine has been a safe working environment, certainly compared to years past where accidents were more frequent. ""However, In the space of just a few months we have seen two tragic incidents. I am concerned that this must not become a pattern. Mines legislation requires a full investigation, and I need to be reassured that this will indeed happen. ""I would also want to be reassured that recent redundancies at the mine have not altered day to day working practices to the extent that risk may have been allowed to creep back in. ""In the near future I will want to meet with both the mine owners, ICL Ltd, and the mine unions on these issues,"" he added."

Tyrel Martin Marhanka, 41, was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on Thursday. He had just been handed a four-year sentence at Changhua District Court for growing opium and marijuana. Witnesses told the Taipei Times that after the judge read aloud the sentence Marhanka turned to the interpreter and said: ""Four years?"" ""I don't want to live anymore!"" Marhanka reportedly shouted. He was arrested in April 2015 after police discovered hundreds of cannabis plants and 10 opium poppies at his rented house in Changhua county, according to the Taipei Times. According to local media, Marhanka told investigators he was growing the plants as a ""hobby"" and purely for his own consumption. The American had reportedly been living in Taiwan for more than 15 years with his Taiwanese wife and two children and teaching English. The court said in a statement: ""He was co-operative during the investigation and the trial. ""His attitude was mild and he did not show any signs that he would commit suicide."" Marhanka apparently smuggled two scissor blades into the court by hiding them in a magazine. It is not clear if the magazine passed through the metal-detecting gate at the entrance. The blades and magazine were recovered by police, said the official statement. The court said it had installed two X-ray scanners to strengthen the security check. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

The Fund said that the UK economy would be comparatively weaker if it left the EU but under its ""limited"" scenario - in which Britain stayed in the European Economic Area, the group that includes Norway - growth would slip from 2.2% to 1.4% next year. The drop is significantly smaller than that forecast by the Treasury. However, the Fund said that under an ""adverse"" scenario, in which the UK left the EU and failed to seal a Norway-style deal, having to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, the UK would suffer a recession in 2017, with the economy shrinking by 0.8%. The Fund's conclusions about the economic impact of Brexit have been highly anticipated for the past month, since its managing director, Christine Lagarde said that they would range ""from pretty bad to very, very bad"". But while some expected it to produce forecasts similar to those produced by the Treasury, the Fund's final report is considerably more conservative. The Treasury has predicted a recession in both of the two scenarios it used in its modelling. It also predicted long-term damage of between 3.8% and 7.5% of gross domestic product. However, the Fund predicted that the economy would be anywhere from 1.4% to 4.5% smaller in the long-run. The vast majority of economists predict that Britain would be weaker in the event of a Brexit, however they differ considerably about the scale of the impact. The Fund originally intended to release the report on Friday, but held its release back by 24 hours following the death of MP Jo Cox."

The Energy and Climate Change Committee said there was growing evidence of ""conflicts of interest"" and the FTSE 100 firm's operation of the UK's power system should be handed to an independent body instead. The report identified several areas of concern, including the UK being dependent on one company's systems and technology. It was particularly concerned that National Grid owned stakes in electricity cable links to Europe while also managing the country's electricity network and by its role within the energy regulator, Ofgem. The Government has already done work on the possible creation of an Independent System Operator (ISO). But the committee said it also favoured regional bodies taking greater control of power flows from the growing number of local generation sites - such as wind farms and other renewable sources. It declared that capacity was currently being poorly managed. Committee chair, Angus Brendan MacNeil MP, said: ""National Grid's technical expertise in operating the national energy system must be weighed against its potential conflicts of interest. ""The ISO model has worked in the USA. It is time for it to be brought to these shores. ""Local energy is here, with astonishing growth in generation connected directly to regional networks. ""Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) remain somewhat blind to their energy flows and passive in managing them. ""DNOs must transition to a more active role as Distribution System Operators so that they can use smart technologies to manage ever-more complicated energy flows."" In response, National Grid said: ""There is little evidence that an ISO model would provide any benefits that would justify the cost to households, potential disruption to much of the energy sector, and the risks to security of supply such uncertainty could create""."

The LGA, which represents 48 fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales, is calling for all white goods to have fireproof markings on them to allow easy identification of the manufacturer, model and serial number. It warns that companies running lengthy repair programmes for potentially dangerous machines instead of recalling them are ""risking the lives of millions of customers"". Manufacturers Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda are fixing dryers across the country after parents company Whirlpool told customers about the safety defect last October. The fault can lead to fluff building up near the machine's heating element and causing a fire. Homes have been ruined and the LGA has said that some machines have even burst into flames as people were loading them with clothes. Jeremy Hilton, chairman of the LGA's fire services management committee, said: ""People using faulty tumble dryers are unwittingly playing Russian roulette. ""Leading manufacturers need to recall affected models as soon as possible to protect their customers. ""Firefighters are attending tumble dryer fires three times a day, which is alarming. These defective products are endangering lives, causing thousands of pounds of damage to homes and making people homeless. ""People's safety must be the priority. It's been months since some manufacturers issued safety warnings over their tumble dryers but they need to be recalled as these appliances are still causing fires. ""Until they do so, consumers continue to risk falling victim to a devastating and tragic house fire."" Doug McTavish, 39, and Bernard Hender, 19, died in 2014 in Llanrwst, North Wales after their Hotpoint caught fire. Lawyers for their families believe the blaze was linked to trapped fluff. Whirlpool denies this. The LGA said that people should not leave the machines on overnight or while there is nobody home. They should also clean out the compartment where fluff builds up after each load to reduce the fire risk and leave the vent or any other opening uncovered."

The President, who is on a tour of several US national parks with his family, spoke on the phone with Brendan Cox while he was travelling on Air Force One. Mrs Cox had worked on Mr Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign before she became MP for Batley and Spen. The White House said in a statement: ""President Obama offered his sincere condolences on behalf of the American people to Mr Cox and his two young children, as well as to her friends, colleagues and constituents. ""The President noted that the world is a better place because of her selfless service to others, and that there can be no justification for this heinous crime, which robbed a family, a community, and a nation of a dedicated wife, mother, and public servant."" Mrs Cox was shot and stabbed in the street outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds in West Yorkshire, on Thursday. On Friday, Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said she was ""horrified by the assassination"" of the Labour MP and called her a ""rising star"". ""It is cruel and terrible that her life was cut short by a violent act of political intolerance,"" she said. ""This is how we must honour Jo Cox - by rejecting bigotry in all its forms, and instead embracing, as she always did, everything that binds us together."

He was speaking during an emotional interview about his friend and Labour MP Jo Cox, who was killed in a street attack near her constituency surgery in West Yorkshire.  He said he was ""heartbroken"" about the politician's death on Thursday, as he pointed from his offices to the boat on the Thames where she lived. Labour mayor Mr Khan said: ""Jo was the best of politics and she inspired and energised people."" ""Some of the posters unveiled, some of the language used... that's not the best of politics"". Reflecting on both the EU referendum and his own mayoral campaign, he said: ""The way politics is conducted in this country is poisonous - and the British public is decent. ""The way we behave is not decent, and where there's hate and poison, we've got to change"". On the referendum campaign specifically, he said: ""I think we should all reflect on the way the campaign has been conducted. ""I'm not against being held to account, or the robustness of debates, challenging cases, not against evidence-based politics - I think we need to go back to that rather than not what we've got now."" The Mayor has a view from his office of the Cox family houseboat, moored on the Thames. He said: ""Jo was an amazing person - she lived just over there on the boat, she loved being an MP. ""Everyone who met her only has good things to say. She was a great politician, great campaigner, a three dimensional person full of life who loved being an MP in parliament...  in one year she achieved more than many of my colleagues in 10/15/20 years in that place."" Mr Khan recalled the supportive social media message she sent after his landslide Mayoral victory last month was met with far right protests about 'London falling'. ""One of the phrases she used in her maiden speech is that we have more in common than divides us - great tweet she did… as only Jo could after I won as Mayor - hope defeats fear, unity defeats vision, hashtag London has risen. ""She had a wicked sense of humour. I always teased her about living on a boat - wasn't it cold!? She was a lovely person, it's a tragic, we're heartbroken."" :: Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown also hit out at some Leave campaigners who he accused of trying to ""hijack"" the referendum and turn it into a vote on immigration. He wrote in the Guardian newspaper: ""Temperate language has given way to the intemperate. And where there is latent prejudice, we have seen it exploited to breed intolerance, an then too often intolerance has descended into hate."""

Ali Qazimaj was wanted in connection with the death of Peter Stuart, 75, and his missing 69-year-old wife. The 42-year-old suspect was arrested after a member of staff at a hostel in Luxembourg alerted authorities, having identified him from photographs on the internet. The couple, from Weybread, Suffolk, were reported missing on 3 June. Mr Stuart's body was found later that day in woodland near his home. A post-mortem confirmed he had died of multiple stab wounds. His wife has been missing since 29 May and police are treating her disappearance as a murder inquiry. Police concede there is ""very little hope"" of finding her alive and have widened the search area around where Mr Stuart's body was found. Speaking at Suffolk Police headquarters, Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Parkes said: ""We have expanded the search significantly away from the home in the Weybread area. ""We are concentrating our efforts south from Weybread and down to the Tilbury area and will continue to do so. ""We searched all round the area where Peter was found and we have broadened that search out significantly and we have been looking at areas that have been associated with Ali Qazimaj and we have been responding to any information that we have had during the course of the investigation."" The couple were filmed on CCTV walking into Goodies farm shop in Pulham Market at about 10.20am on 29 May. On 6 June officers issued an appeal to trace Qazimaj, from Tilbury, Essex, in connection with the murder and disappearance. He caught a ferry alone from Dover to Calais two days earlier. Qazimaj, a Kosovan immigrant who also goes by the name of Marco Costa, was living in Tilbury, Essex, and working as a forklift truck driver in Purfleet. On 5 June a 61-year-old man from Leicester was arrested in connection with the murder and bailed.  A Suffolk Police spokesman said: ""Detectives from Suffolk are now working with the National Crime Agency, the Crown Prosecution Service and authorities in Luxembourg to seek Ali Qazimaj's extradition following the granting of a European Arrest Warrant relating to the murder of Peter and Sylvia Stuart."""

One of its own MPs, indeed one of the shining young stars of the 2015 intake, was killed in broad daylight while leaving her constituency surgery. Jo Cox was someone who had relentlessly worked and campaigned on helping some of the world's most disadvantaged people. She was tireless in contacting journalists such as me to put her campaigns about child refugees in Syria higher up the news agenda. I last saw her a few days ago at the Parliamentary charity tug of war. She told me she was going to devote all her time to trying to make a Labour case for remaining in the European Union, but she was concerned about the soft Labour vote in Yorkshire. George Osborne gave one of the most notable tributes. He tore up his Mansion House speech, and paid tribute to her and how she had changed government policy on Syria. A remarkable achievement for someone who was an MP for just a year. She was smart, funny, tenacious, and a brilliant operator. I also remember her internal debate over Syria. She had helped start a Parliamentary Group on Syria, joining forces with Andrew Mitchell, the former development secretary. Gallery: Labour MP Jo Cox Killed After Being Shot And Stabbed In Birstall Labour MP Jo Cox has died after she was shot at least two times and stabbed in her West Yorkshire constituency Mr Mitchell recalls her combative appearance with the Russian ambassador on opening up humanitarian corridors in the war-torn country. She had contemplated voting for the extension of military action against IS in Syria in the fractious debate that split Labour last year. She ended up abstaining. It should be said, though, that beyond being stunned, and feeling total grief, there is a considerable amount of anger. MPs in all parties have told me they feel there is a poisonous atmosphere in British politics around the EU referendum. I have certainly seen a little of that myself travelling with the campaigns, with angry shouting matches between Remain and Leave campaigners. It is worse than the Scottish Referendum. No one knows the motives right now of the person who killed Ms Cox. But the suspension of the referendum campaign until Saturday provides an opportunity at least for a pause for thought, in a brutal and bruising campaign. Some MPs feel a recall of Parliament would be appropriate."

Dozens of Russian fans were detained by French police after violence broke out between them and English supporters in Marseille. The Russian President has described the hooligan behaviour as a ""disgrace"", but has questioned how it happened. ""The fighting between Russian fans with the English, that is a disgrace,"" he said at the country's annual economic forum in Saint Petersburg on Friday. ""But I truly don't understand how 200 of our fans could beat up several thousand English,"" he added to laughs and applause from the audience.

""I hope that there are sober-minded people among them who really love sport and understand that any violation is not supporting their favourite team but damaging to the team and to sport."" On Thursday, a French court sentenced three Russian fans for up to two years in jail. The Russian foreign ministry says a further 20 people will be expelled on Saturday. Several English fans have also been jailed. Russia has accused French authorities of trying to ignore the ""provocative actions"" of fans from other countries, including some who trampled on the Russian flag. Russia has been handed a suspended disqualification from Euro 2016 because of crowd disturbances at the game against England."

Avon Coroner's Court was told that a liaison Matthew Brittan had the previous day with a female student at his school had become common knowledge. The 14-year-old died instantaneously from multiple injuries after stepping in front of the 4.07pm Taunton to Cardiff Great Western passenger service on 1 February this year. Despite the train driver repeatedly sounding his horn and applying the emergency brakes he was not able to stop in time. A typed note was later recovered from Matthew's home, which included the unlock codes for his phone, laptop and tablet, the court heard. John Wilson, a civilian investigator for British Transport Police, told the hearing: ""A statement from a female school friend gives details of her friendship with Matthew and there is some mention of a closer friendship between another female. ""It seems that Matthew had some sort of liaison the previous day and seems to have gone viral around the school and it appears Matthew could not handle this. ""We made efforts to get an achieving best evidence statement from the friend but her parents have refused to give their consent."" Senior Avon Coroner Maria Voisin said that shortly before Matthew's death he told his mother he would see her later. Recording a narrative conclusion, she said: ""Matthew Brittan walked into the path of a moving train. ""He died from the injuries he sustained and I cannot be sure of his intention to take his own life."" Matthew's parents were at the short hearing with other members of their family."

While the carrier had taken some precautions – including not serving alcohol – staff reported that fans of opposing teams were in fact uniting to sing each other’s national tunes on board. What’s football without a little Abba? Eurostar is perhaps more concerned that a lull in business travel might be a sign of things to come in the event of a No vote on Thursday.  Chief executive Nicolas Petrovic told me Brexit could spell extra costs and uncertainty for the train operator.  ""There would be a short-term impact, we can already see that the business market is slowing down very, very steeply,"" Mr Petrovic said. ""And in the long term, once again, it's all about the uncertainty: no one knows what Brexit means, and it could take a long time to understand. For our customers... that would add costs. The growth we have been enjoyed these past years would be diminished."" How Brexit might affect the food and drink industry But he said that the impact on fares, already relatively low, might not be significant. The French government owns 55% of Eurostar; some argue that it may be in their interest to ensure border control continues to run smoothly, for example by retaining the Le Touquet Treaty which allows French border control staff to operate on UK soil. Perhaps the risks of Brexit are greater up in the air.  Low-cost airlines have thrived due to treaties which ensure a single aviation area across Europe. EasyJet claims that has allowed routes across Europe to almost double, and fares to fall by 40%. In a post-Brexit era, access to the market could be unchanged, if like Norway, the UK could secure entry to the European Common Aviation Area. How Brexit might affect the UK education sector But that’s uncertain and with the fear that some airlines might even chose to switch bases, it’s small wonder that easyjet’s Dame Carolyn Mccall has warned that the era of cheap travel could be over. A sobering thought for package holiday fans and the 1.1 million Brits who own a European holiday home – not to mention that two out of every three visitors to the UK comes from the EU. On the other hand, her rival Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways’ owner IAG, dismisses such concerns, saying airlines like his, which have a more global focus wouldn’t expect to see a material impact. Back on the road, the appetite among hauliers for remaining in the EU is mixed. The Road Hauliers’ Association says 61% of their members want out of Europe – citing red tape and competition from cheap foreign labour. That might sound surprising when the risks of Brexit to exports (and imports) and additional border controls are considered; could Brexit spell fewer goods to transport and more red tape to contend with? In actual fact, figures from Eurostat reveal that over 90% of goods on trucks in the UK are loaded AND unloaded here; only a minority are exported or imported.     The implications for our transport sector are far from clear-cut.

The pound continued to rise to just over $1.47 earlier on Tuesday, building on its biggest one-day surge against the dollar for nearly eight years on Monday, before falling back slightly in late afternoon trading. Last week, sterling was changing hands closer to $1.41, after polls appeared to indicate the Leave campaign was taking the lead. But that changed as campaigning was suspended following the killing of Labour MP Jo Cox - with Monday's recovery in the pound's value in the dollar being explained by polls suggesting Remain in front. ""Some of the recent events have been favourable for Britain to remain in the EU, but it’s still too close to call,"" Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Credit Agricole said.  ""If Remain wins, we expect sterling to rise to $1.55,"" he added. That prediction came after the billionaire currency trader George Soros predicted $1.15 to the pound if Brexit was confirmed. Stock markets also had a calmer day on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 index rose 0.4% to 6226 after gaining more than 3% on Monday - adding £47bn of value to the value of the UK’s blue chip share index. Bookmakers, in addition to polls, are being closely watched by investors. Ladbrokes had the odds for a remain vote at 74% on Tuesday while the betting odds comparison service, Oddschecker, had a 78% chance of a Remain victory. Head of trading at ETX Capital, Joe Rundle, warned the accuracy of polls cannot be relied upon - given the result of the 2015 General Election which pollsters had expected to be a hung Parliament - and said there was still ""huge uncertainty"" for markets. ""Traders betting the farm on a sterling rally happening on Friday should remember just how wrong the polls were at the last general election and just how far the pound could drop if Britain votes out"", he said. The chief strategist at CMC Markets in London, Michael Hewson said: ""Financial markets appear to be taking the view that the race may well already be run, which given the twists and turns seen already in this campaign may well be extremely far sighted, or dangerously premature"". :: Time To Decide: A special programme on the eve of the EU referendum with Dermot Murnaghan on Wednesday from 10pm :: In Or Out: Get all the results and reaction from the EU referendum from 9.30pm on Thursday"

The victim was attacked in one of Long Lartin prison's workshops at about 9am as inmates began their daily routines after breakfast. He is believed to be convicted child killer Sidonio Teixeira, who was jailed for life in 2007 for killing his three-year-old daughter and trying to kill his son, aged nine. He suffered severe head injuries during the attack at the jail near Evesham, Worcestershire. A prison source said he was attacked with a rock taken from a fish tank and hidden inside a sock. It is thought the victim was pronounced dead as prison staff awaited the arrival of paramedics. Another inmate, a man in his 60s, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in police custody. He is believed to be Victor Castigador, who is originally from the Philippines. Detective Inspector Paul Hardman, who is leading the investigation, said: ""A thorough and robust investigation has been launched. ""These enquiries are in the early stages so we are unable to provide more information at this time."" Long Lartin has 600 prisoners, many of them category A inmates who are serving sentences of at least four years. It also houses prisoners on remand awaiting trial. A prisoner was arrested by West Mercia police and was being questioned on suspicion of murder. In March this year a Long Lartin prisoner was jailed for life for murdering a fellow inmate and in 2013 two more were jailed for killing another prisoner."

""You're very aware that you’re doing absolute cutting edge technology. You may be touching six or seven experiments in one day. ""You're very aware that these experiments are the result of hundreds if not thousands of people in each of their areas of speciality, and you're the person running the experiment, so it's a hugely privileged place to work, and that is very rewarding and very satisfying.""

Referring to his trip into space, back in December, he said he was ""amazed after just 24 hours, living on board the space station, how quickly I was able to function.  ""It’s a bit slower coming the other way, I can tell you, and it’s a bit harder.

All UK operators had suspended services on security grounds in the wake of the downing of a Russian airliner last October, which killed 224 passengers and crew. A bomb is widely believed to have been responsible for the Metrojet crash though no official cause has yet been determined. The terror theory prompted widespread criticism of security procedures at Sharm el Sheikh airport - with the authorities in Cairo responding by pledging improvements to meet the demands of national governments. The resort's tourism business was estimated to have lost about half its trade by the end of the last winter season as Sharm was shunned by tourists from Europe. It had been expected that BA and other UK operators, including easyJet, Monarch and Thomson, would be in a position to resume flights in time for the coming winter holiday season at the end of October. But BA said in a statement on Tuesday: ""The safety and security of our customers will always be our top priorities and we have suspended our flights from Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh indefinitely. ""Customers who hold bookings on any cancelled services for the coming winter season can claim a full refund or can use the money to cover a new booking with us for an alternative destination."" Sky News was contacting other operators to get a progress report on their own plans. All had previously said their decisions would be based on UK Government security advice. Thomson and First Choice, in April, confirmed the cancellation of all outbound flights up to and including 28 September. Monarch said its flights would not resume until 30 October at the earliest while easyJet had said it would not change its position until the Government was happy with an improved security set-up."

England drew 0-0 with Slovakia in Saint Etienne to finish in second place in the group. Some Wales fans were seen in tears after destroying Russia in Toulouse in a match that had been designated ""high risk"" for fan violence. Thomas Roberts, 21, from Bala, said: ""This is the happiest day of my life. Seriously. ""What a night. It's just been incredible and we're off to Paris."" Gallery: Right Royal Time For Euro 2016 Fans England fans get in the mood ahead of their final Euro 2016 group match against Slovakia in Saint Etienne Mark Bleasdale, 47, added: ""It's been an incredible night, the atmosphere here had been incredible. ""The only thing which could have improved it would be having had a ticket."" Among those celebrating on the pitch was Gareth Bale, who scored the third of his side's goals. Wales's progress past the group stage comes in their first ever European Championship finals. Their first goal was scored by Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey and the second by Swansea City's Neil Taylor. The results mean that Wales will be off to the Parc des Princes in Paris to play the third place team from either Group A, C or D on Saturday, 25 June. England will travel to Nice to take on the second place team in Group F, which is currently Iceland, but could also end up being Portugal, Austria or Hungary, in a week's time. England manager Roy Hodgson said afterwards: ""I can't fault the effort that the lads put in and it's a little bit embarrassing that we've dominated three games and only won one of them."" Russia's coach Leonid Slutsky conceded that a new manager should be appointed for his team before the World Cup is held in the country in 2018. Wales manager Chris Coleman said he was delighted with his side's win and said more was to come. He said: ""I said before that there's more to come for this group. ""Even after this tournament is over, this group are on the way to something else. ""I'm just glad me and the staff are here with them. We have no fear. And after playing like that, why should we?"""
2016-06-21,"A geopolitical event isn't a geopolitical event until George Soros has opined on it - and so, with an air of inevitability, the billionaire fund manager and philanthropist has waded into the debate on the EU referendum.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160621201010/http://news.sky.com/story/1715277/soros-brexit-intervention-a-warning-or-a-bet,"A geopolitical event isn't a geopolitical event until George Soros has opined on it - and so, with an air of inevitability, the billionaire fund manager and philanthropist has waded into the debate on the EU referendum. Mr Soros, famed as ""the man who broke the Bank of England"" in 1992, has written an article in The Guardian newspaper in which he warns that a vote for Brexit would lead to a devaluation in sterling far greater than the one that enriched him and his investors to the tune of almost $1bn back in September 1992. On that occasion, the pound fell by more than 15%, but Mr Soros feels a Brexit vote would send sterling down by at least that amount and possibly by more than 20%. Such a decline would take the pound from its current level of around $1.46 to below $1.15. And he said there would be plenty of speculators - like him in 1992 - waiting to cash in on the moves. He wrote: ""Today, there are speculative forces in the markets much bigger and more powerful. And they will be eager to exploit any miscalculations by the British government or British voters. ""Brexit would make some people very rich - but most voters considerably poorer."" But are Mr Soros' views really worth heeding? Well, the UK Treasury and the Bank of England will need no reminding about what he can do. In October 1990, some six weeks before she was toppled by her own party, Margaret Thatcher took Britain into the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) - a system that sought to peg the value of a number of European currencies to that of the German deutschmark. The aim of the scheme was to bring about convergence between European currencies ahead of their eventual coming-together in the European Currency Unit which, in time, became the euro. Mrs Thatcher had never been especially keen on sterling joining the ERM and the rate at which sterling joined the scheme, at 2.95 deutschmarks to the pound, was seen as hugely overvalued. Mr Soros began selling the pound in anticipation of what he saw as an inevitable devaluation. As other speculators joined in, matters came to a head on 16 September 1992, when the Bank of England was forced to spend billions defending the pound, buying it against other foreign currencies, with the aim of preventing it from falling too far away from that crucial DM2.95 level and below DM2.778 - the bottom of its permitted trading range against the deutschmark. The then chancellor Norman Lamont, who in those days set the cost of borrowing, raised interest rates from 10% to 12% and then, later, to 15% in a desperate attempt to prop up the pound. All to no avail. Later that day, standing on the steps of the Treasury and flanked by his then special adviser - one David Cameron - Mr Lamont announced that Britain was suspending its membership of the ERM, allowing him to bring interest rates back down to 12%. They were further reduced to 10% the following day. By then, 16 September was being called Black Wednesday, while the episode destroyed the long-held record of the Conservatives for economic competence and gave Labour, after years of opposition, a route back into government. Mr Soros, who had sold something like $10bn worth of pounds, was able to close his position at a cost of just over $9bn - the $1bn difference being the profit for him and his investors. The saga catapulted Mr Soros to fame and, ever since, he has used his fame and fortune to establish himself both as a generous philanthropist and campaigner for human rights as well as something of a financial soothsayer. Yet Mr Soros, who is estimated to have a personal fortune of around $24bn, has not always got it right. During the first six months of 2011, his Quantum Fund lost 6%. Not long afterwards, he announced he was giving up managing other people's money, although he cited more onerous regulation of hedge funds - rather than his losses that year - as the prime reason for doing so. And, even before he became known as ""the man who broke the Bank of England"", Mr Soros had become well-known for winning - and losing - vast sums of money. For example, his fund lost $800m during the 1987 global stock market crash known as Black Monday. Just three weeks before the crash, when many market commentators were saying Wall Street was heading for a correction, Mr Soros had told Fortune magazine: ""Just because the market is overvalued does not mean it is not sustainable."" He also suffered a $600m loss in February 1994 after mistakenly betting that the Japanese yen would continue to fall against the US dollar. And, in September 1998, Mr Soros admitted that his fund had lost $2bn that year wrongly betting on increases in the Russian stock market and rouble. In early January 2000, in just three days, he also lost $600m following a sell-off in technology stocks. By the middle of that year the fund was down some $4bn, reflecting big falls in the Nasdaq, with Mr Soros’s losses magnified because he had borrowed to invest in tech stocks. Mr Soros has also attracted the attention of the courts on various occasions for his activities. In 1991, for example, his fund was sued in the New York courts for conspiring with a trader at the investment bank Salomon Brothers to corner the market in certain government securities. In France, he was convicted in 2002 for insider trading, for which he was fined €2.2m. The billionaire has always insisted that he had done nothing wrong but, after numerous appeals, the conviction was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2012. So, while Mr Soros is undoubtedly an investment genius, there have been times when he has got his bets wrong. And, of course, as Michael Gove of the Leave campaign has pointed out, Mr Soros famously said, in June 2002: ""Britain needs to join the euro because not joining it would disqualify Britain from attracting capital investment."" That call, of course, was utterly wrong. There is another reason why some caution needs to be applied to Mr Soros' remarks today. It would be helpful if, in writing his article for The Guardian, Mr Soros had disclosed what positions he may or may not be running on sterling or sterling-denominated assets. Past experience suggests that, when high-profile traders like Mr Soros speak out on issues like the referendum, their comments can often become a self-fulfilling prophesy. A big fall in the pound may be exactly what he is hoping will happen."

There were 3,186 internet-related sex crimes against children recorded by 38 police forces in England and Wales in 2015/16, according to the charity's report. The offences included sexual assaults, grooming victims and inciting children to take part in sexual acts. Where a victim's age was provided by police, most were 13 years old but 272 were under the age of 10 and the youngest was just one year old. Chief executive of the NSPCC Peter Wanless said the figures ""confirm our fears that the online world is playing a significant role in the sexual abuse of children in the UK"". He added: ""It's clear that a large volume of sexual assaults and rapes of children have involved the use of the internet - for example by grooming victims before abusing them offline, or live-streaming the abuse. ""We know grooming is on the rise because children are increasingly telling our ChildLine service how they are being targeted online. ""Predatory adults posing as children try to meet them or blackmail them into meeting up or performing sexual acts on webcams, which obviously terrifies them and can leave some feeling suicidal."" This is the first year that police are required to separately record sex abuse cases where the internet is used but the NSPCC says that a small number of forces said they either didn't know about - or weren't using - the Home Office scheme. Anne Longfield, Children's Commissioner for England, said the ""concerning"" figures were likely to be ""just the tip of the iceberg"". She added: ""Successful police operations show that online sexual offenders use sophisticated methods to target, trick and groom children, and may target hundreds of children at a time. ""The internet is increasingly integral to children's lives and they need to be educated about the risks, as well as how to report suspicious behaviour. ""The effect of abuse, whether it happens offline or online is devastating and we need to ensure therapy to help them recover from their ordeal is available."""

Ben Butler, 36, killed his daughter Ellie just 11 months after winning her back in a high-profile custody battle. He inflicted horrific head injuries on the youngster while looking after her and her sibling at home in October 2013. Ben Butler and Jennie Gray Butler was convicted of murder and child cruelty following a trial at the Old Bailey. :: Ellie Butler: A Child Failed By The System His partner, Jennie Gray, 36, was jailed for 42 months for child cruelty and perverting the course of justice. Butler mumbled angrily as the verdicts were returned and vowed to ""fight forever"", while Gray said: ""Big mistake, big mistake, big mistake."" Ellie had earlier been taken into care because of concerns for her safety During mitigation the court heard Gray had only just been told her mother died on 19  April. Apparently, her family wanted the news kept from her while the trial was ongoing. The Old Bailey heard that after battering Ellie to death Butler put off dialling 999 for two hours and instead summoned Gray back from work in the City of London. The pair then concocted an elaborate plot to destroy evidence and create the scene of an accidental fall before phoning the ambulance service. Ellie with Jennie Gray In the chaotic call, former EastEnders actress Gray screamed and shouted at the operator and carried out CPR, despite knowing her daughter was dead. The couple even involved Ellie's younger sibling by sending the child into her room on the pretext of fetching her for cake, jurors were told. The child can be heard on the 999 call saying Ellie ""won't wake up"". The killing came months after the children were returned to their parents following accusations that Butler violently shook Ellie when she was seven weeks old The close where the family lived in south London Unemployed Butler, of Sutton, south London, had been found guilty of assault in 2007 but the conviction was quashed on appeal. In November 2012, he was ""exonerated"" by a family court judge who declared a ""happy ending"" as she handed Ellie back. Soon after Butler became frustrated at being a stay-at-home father while Gray, a graphic designer, went out to work, the trial heard. The jury was shown a stream of expletive-ridden text messages which showed Butler as abusive and violent towards his partner and constantly on the brink of exploding at the children. Butler and Ellie with the family's pet dog Ellie's severe head injuries were compared to those of a high-speed road crash victim. Butler claimed they were suffered earlier when she was playing with their Jack Russell puppy and could have turned fatal when she fell off a stool emulating Peppa Pig on television. Gray admitted attempting to cover up for her partner but said it was only to protect an ""innocent man"". She denied ""sacrificing"" Ellie's well-being for the sake of her relationship, and putting Butler before the children. Ellie spent a lot of time being looked after by her grandparents Investigating officer Detective Inspector Dave Reid said: ""Butler and Gray set about orchestrating a set of lies to blame everyone but themselves for Ellie's murder and the events leading up to it. ""They lied throughout the investigation and continued making outlandish accusations against a variety of people and organisations throughout their trial."" He added: ""Whilst their convictions will bring little comfort to Ellie's beloved grandparents ... ""I hope they will go some little way to assuring them justice has now been achieved."" Jailing Butler, Mr Justice Wilkie said: ""You are a self-absorbed, ill-tempered, violent and domineering man who, I am satisfied, regarded your children and your partner as trophies, having no role other than to fit in with your infantile and sentimentalised fantasy of family life."" He told a sobbing Gray that she may have been ""exceptionally naive and stupid"" to believe Butler and take part in the cover-up."

Michael Steven Sandford was arrested on Saturday in Las Vegas after he allegedly tried to wrestle a gun from a police officer at the event. The 20-year-old was handed over to the US Secret Service, according to Las Vegas police. He then told a Secret Service agent he had driven to the city from California planning to shoot Mr Trump, according to court papers filed on Monday. Sandford, who is reported to have a British driving licence and claims to have been in the US for around 18 months, has been charged with committing an act of violence on restricted ground, said US Attorney's Office spokesman Natalie Collins. He appeared before Federal Magistrate Judge George Foley, who refused him bail. Donald Trump speaking at the rally in Las Vegas Sandford, who wore leg irons and reportedly appeared to tremble during his court appearance, has not entered a plea. He will reappear in court on 5 July. Court papers say: ""Sandford claimed he had been attempting to kill Trump for about a year but decided to act on this occasion because he finally felt confident about trying it."" The papers cite a Special Agent Swierkowski, according to US media, who said Sandford had arrived in New Jersey before ending up in the San Bernardino, California, area. He reportedly told the agent he had driven to Las Vegas after seeing reports that Mr Trump would be holding an event there. Sandford had arrived in Las Vegas on Friday and then went to a gun range to learn how to shoot a gun - something he told the agent he had not done before. A neighbour in Dorking, where Sandford used to live, told Sky News: ""He was a very nice boy, always said hello and was polite which is good in this day and age.""

Writing in The Guardian, Mr Soros says the British public are in danger of ""grossly underestimating"" the costs of Brexit.   He says: ""Too many believe that a vote to leave the EU will have no effect on their personal financial position. ""This is wishful thinking. It would have at least one very clear and immediate effect that will touch every household: the value of the pound would decline precipitously. “It would also have an immediate and dramatic impact on financial markets, investment, prices and jobs."" But his concerns were dismissed by the Justice Secretary and Leave campaigner Michael Gove, who told Sky News: ""George Soros was someone who thought that we should join the single currency. ""He backed the creation of the euro - thought that was a good idea, and actually as we've seen, the euro has been a job-destroying, unemployment-creating disaster."" Mr Gove added: ""The fact that we have our pound, and the fact that our pound is strong, is a consequence of a decision that was made in defiance of predictions from people like George Soros.""  :: Becks Backs In: Star Puts Cross In Remain Box In his column, Mr Soros refers to Black Wednesday, when the UK left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, arguing that a Brexit vote on Thursday could cause a ""Black Friday"".  Referring to his concerns about the pound, he says: ""I would expect this devaluation to be bigger and more disruptive than the 15% devaluation that occurred in September 1992, when I was fortunate enough to make a substantial profit for my hedge fund investors, at the expense of the Bank of England and the British government.""  He adds: ""It is reasonable to assume, given the expectations implied by the market pricing at present, that after a Brexit vote the pound would fall by at least 15% and possibly more than 20%, from its present level of $1.46 to below $1.15."" That would make £1 worth about €1 – ""a method of 'joining the euro' that nobody in Britain would want"". In response to comments made by George Soros, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Lamont said: ""The devaluation of sterling in September 1992 didn't do the UK economy any harm, far from it."" He added: ""Nor would a fall in the pound this time necessarily be a disaster.  The key difference between now and 1992 is that today the pound is floating and any devaluation could be self-correcting and temporary."" Developing his argument, Mr Soros observes that what happened in 1992 helped the economy: ""That devaluation was healthy because the government was relieved of its obligation to 'defend' an overvalued pound with damagingly high interest rates."" But he predicts a different outcome, should it happen again, observing that interest rates are already very low, and unlikely to drop further. :: Why The 'God Particle' Would Survive Brexit He also notes that the UK’s current account deficit is bigger now than it was in 1992, or during the financial crash of 2008. And he doubts that a devaluation would increase manufacturing exports, as happened post-Black Wednesday, because uncertainty would reduce investment.   But the former mayor of London and Leave campaigner Boris Johnson told LBC radio: ""The people I listen to are not people like George Soros, who speculate on market movements - that's how he makes his money.   ""I listen to people like Anthony Bamford of JCB, the biggest private manufacturer in this country.""

The 1964 killings of James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner in Neshoba County sparked national outrage and helped to bring in the Civil Rights Act. The case, one of more than 125 which remain unsolved from the civil rights era, later became the subject of Oscar-winning movie Mississippi Burning. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe in the 1988 film Mississippi Burning Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood said the decision ""closes a chapter"" in the state's divisive civil rights history. He said: ""The evidence has been degraded by memory over time, and so there are no individuals that are living now that we can make a case on at this point."" But he said if new information came forward due to the announcement that the case was closed, prosecutors could reconsider and pursue a case. Mr Hood presented a 48-page report by the FBI which revealed authorities concluded the three men were killed as part of a Ku Klux Klan conspiracy. Investigators uncover the men's remains in an earthen dam Mr Chaney, Mr Goodman and Mr Schwerner,  all in their 20s,  had been working to register African-American voters. They disappeared on 21 June, 1964, while investigating the burning of a black church. Their bodies were found weeks later under thick red clay of an earthen dam near Philadelphia, Mississippi. In 1967, eight people were convicted of federal civil rights violations related to their deaths. In 2005, three manslaughter convictions were made against white supremacist Edgar Ray Killen, who remains in prison. Ku Klux Klansman Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter in 2005 On Monday, relatives of Mr Chaney, Mr Goodman and Mr Schwerner said the focus should be on all people killed or hurt while seeking justice. Reverend Julia Chaney Moss, sister of Mr Chaney, said: ""The civil rights period was not about just those three young men. ""It was about all of the lives."" The FBI re-examined the 125 cases after launching its Cold Case Initiative in 2006. Congress set aside millions of dollars in 2007 under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act for the investigations, but most of the cases have not resulted in a prosecution. A memorial to the men in Philadelphia, Mississippi Among them was the 1964 killing of the black owner of a shoe shop in Ferriday, Louisiana. No prosecutions have taken place despite news articles linking a man from Rayville to the crime. In 2011, the Justice Department closed an investigation into the 1965 killing of a man in Pelahatchie, Mississippi, who was shot by a constable. Witnesses questioned the officer's version of events."

2016-06-21,"Tata Steel is courting buyers for two British units employing nearly 2,500 people, fuelling speculation that the Indian-owned company could retain the bulk of its UK business under a deal with the Government.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160621201010/http://news.sky.com/story/1715049/tata-courts-bidders-for-two-uk-steel-units,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor Tata Steel is courting buyers for two British units employing nearly 2,500 people, fuelling speculation that the Indian-owned company could retain the bulk of its UK business under a deal with the Government. Sky News has learnt that documents relating to the sale of Tata's speciality steels division and its pipeline tube operations - which operate at sites in Hartlepool, Rotherham and Stocksbridge near Sheffield - will be issued to potential bidders in the coming days. KPMG, which has been separately running a process to sell Tata Steel's entire UK business, is understood to have been asked to contact prospective bidders for the two divisions. The move will undermine Tata Steel's claim that its principal focus continues to be on offloading its British operations to a single buyer, and will reinforce the prospect of a further break-up of the business following the sale last month of the company's long-products unit to Greybull Capital. Sources say that Tata Steel's board is meeting on Tuesday to discuss the latest developments on a sale process which has morphed into a full-scale industrial crisis for the Government. In total, its British business, which has been losing an average of £1m a day, employs about 11,000 people, with more than 3,000 of them based at its Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales. Tata's speciality unit is the world's third-largest manufacturer of steel for the aerospace industry, with customers including Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine manufacturer. It employs more than 2,000 people at two sites in Yorkshire. The pipeline tube business supplies steel products to the oil and gas industry, and has a workforce numbering several hundred people. A source close to the situation said the two divisions had been identified as potential sale candidates because they are separable from the main Tata Steel supply chain. The speciality unit has a separate turnaround plan, while the pipeline division has attracted interest from a number of bidders, according to sources. ""This is about how Tata can extract maximum value from these assets on a standalone basis,"" said an industry source. It was unclear on Tuesday what price tag the Indian company would put on the two units. Seven bidders were shortlisted for Tata Steel's UK business, including Liberty House, a UK-based steel producer; JSW Steel, an Indian competitor; and a consortium involving Wilbur Ross, a billionaire American investor, and Endless, a turnaround firm. Tata Steel has denied a series of reports that it had set a deadline of the end of June to conclude a sale, with the process now expected to run into July. Sources have also dismissed the possibility of the company publicly naming a further shortlist of bidders. In recent weeks, the prospect of it keeping the bulk of the business has grown amid an offer of a wide-ranging Government aid package. Ministers have said that the Government is open to acquiring an equity stake of up to 25% in the company, as well as providing hundreds of millions of pounds in loans on commercial terms. Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary, has further paved the way for a rescue deal for Tata Steel's UK operations by proposing a restructuring of the British Steel pension scheme that would slash The proposals were backed last week by the scheme trustees, but the Pension Protection Fund - a lifeboat funded by a levy on solvent companies - is expected to raise a number of concerns about the plan when its response to the Government's consultation is published on Tuesday. A Tata Steel spokesman declined to comment."
2016-06-21,The car that crushed Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin to death had been under recall over fears it could roll without warning.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160621201010/http://news.sky.com/story/1715030/car-that-crushed-anton-yelchin-was-recalled,"The car that crushed Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin to death had been under recall over fears it could roll without warning. The Russian-born actor was discovered by friends pinned against a mailbox pillar and security fence by his Jeep Grand Cherokee early on Sunday. Investigators said the actor, 27, had got out of the vehicle before it rolled backwards down the steep driveway towards him. Yelchin died of accidental blunt force asphyxia, Los Angeles County Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter told Reuters. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in February that 2015 models of the vehicle - like Yelchin's - could continue to move after drivers thought they had locked them in ""park"", and linked the issue to more than 100 crashes. Dreadful news about Anton Yelchin. I thought he was an amazing actor. Manufacturer Fiat Chrysler's US unit issued a recall for hundreds of thousands of Jeep Grand Cherokees and other models in April to address the problem. However, FCA US said it had not found a permanent remedy and mainly advised owners to double check that their car was in ""park"" as intended. ""Drivers thinking that their vehicle's transmission is in the PARK position may be struck by the vehicle and injured if they attempt to get out ... while the engine is running and the parking brake is not engaged,"" the NHTSA said. No deaths have previously been linked to the problem but injuries reported included fractured bones and others that required hospital treatment. ""It is premature to speculate on the cause of this tragedy,"" FCA said in a statement, adding that it was investigating. Yelchin moved to the US when he was six months old with his parents, who were star figure skaters with the Leningrad Ice Ballet, and made his film debut at age nine in A Man Is Mostly Water. His breakout performance came in the 2006 crime thriller Alpha Dog, and his movie credits include JJ Abrams' three Star Trek films and last year's critically acclaimed Green Room. Abrams described Yelchin as ""funny as hell and supremely talented"", while Star Trek co-star Zachary Quinto said the actor was ""one of the most open and intellectually curious people"" he knew. ""So enormously talented and generous of heart. Wise beyond his years, and gone before his time,"" Quinto posted on Instagram. Susan Sarandon, who starred alongside Yelchin in the 2008 coming-of-age comedy Middle Of Nowhere, described the actor as ""an original"". ""One of the most curious, funny, sweet people I've ever known,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. ""He was a searcher, an incredible talent and a loyal and loving son. ""Any time would be too soon for his departure from this plane, but this is an unforgivable and unbearable loss."""
2016-06-23,Tesco has announced it plans to sell coffee chain Harris and Hoole to Caffe Nero - as boss Dave Lewis said he was encouraged by progress across the wider business.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624000327/http://news.sky.com/story/1716147/tesco-to-sell-coffee-chain-to-caffe-nero,"Tesco has announced it plans to sell coffee chain Harris and Hoole to Caffe Nero - as boss Dave Lewis said he was encouraged by progress across the wider business. It follows the recently announced disposals of garden centre chain Dobbies, the Giraffe restaurant chain, and Turkish supermarket Kipa. A sale of Harris and Hoole had been expected to follow as boss Dave Lewis continues to slim down the business to focus on its core UK supermarket trading, reversing the dramatic expansion of the retail behemoth under previous management. Shares rose more than 1% in early trading and closed 0.8% up. The announcement came as Tesco reported a second successive quarter of sales growth for the first time in more than five years. Britain's biggest supermarket said UK like-for-like sales rose 0.3% in the first quarter to 28 May - but this was a slowdown compared to 0.9% growth in the fourth quarter and Mr Lewis said the market remained tough as prices fall. Mr Lewis said: ""We have delivered a second quarter of positive like-for-like sales growth across all parts of the Group in what remains a challenging market with sustained deflation. Harris and Hoole is expected to be sold to Caffe Nero ""We are encouraged by the progress we are making."" Tesco said much of the ""deflationary"" effect weighing on its sales growth came from its introduction of cheaper new ranges including meat, fruit and vegetables. The supermarket is battling to recover under Mr Lewis, who took over nearly two years ago when predecessor Phil Clarke departed amid sliding sales and tumbling profits. Tesco is also facing the fallout from an accounting scandal. In May, it reported a £162m annual profit after slumping to a £6.33bn loss the year before, though warned that the tough market would slow the pace of profit improvement.  The wider industry is under pressure as store chains cut prices, faced by the threat from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Tesco said in its latest trading update: ""Following on from the agreed sales of Dobbies Garden Centres and the Giraffe restaurant chain, we are announcing today the proposed sale of Harris and Hoole to Caffe Nero. ""Together, these sales allow us to place even greater focus on our core UK business."" Harris and Hoole has 43 shops and around 400 staff. Tesco first took a stake in the company three years ago before later taking full ownership. The sale price for the business has not been disclosed."

The world's largest rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral last week, carrying the secret satellite. The launch's live feed was cut after a few minutes due to the payload's secrecy. Just days later, an Australian observer spotted the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellite. It was located near longitude 104E, over the Strait of Malacca, a stretch between the Malaysian Peninsula and the Indonesian Island of Sumatra. The blog of Dutch satellite tracker Marco Langbroek helped guide amateur astronomer Paul Camilleri toward the discovery. The satellite takes off from Cape Canaveral Pic: Air Force Space Command The satellite appears to be drifting west, Mr Langbroek wrote. ""My guess (and no more than that) is that it will eventually stop drifting near either 80E (south of Sri Lanka) or perhaps 10 E (over central Africa),"" he said. ""The reason for the initial placement near 104E is likely that in this position it is initially well placed for the Pine Gap Joint Defence Facility ground station in central Australia during the initial check-out phase."" There has been speculation that it is a Mentor satellite, which picks up electronic signals from ships, aircraft, ground stations and other satellites. The signals are processed on board the Mentor satellites, and encrypted before being sent back to authorities in the US. The NRO is described on its website as a government agency used when the US ""needs eyes and ears in critical places where no human can reach - be it over the most rugged terrain or through the most hostile territory""."

The All England Club is warning spectators can expect ""extensive searches"" of bags and bodies when they enter the grounds and show courts. Visitors are also being urged to check the Wimbledon website before they travel to the tournament, but organisers say the added security measures are ""comprehensive and proportionate with the threat level in the UK"". A spokesman for the All England Club added: ""The level of security and policing is commensurate with the threat and multi-layered, and it has been heightened as you would expect with everything that has been going on."" The security arrangements have been closely co-ordinated with the Metropolitan Police, who said: ""A range of tactics will be put in place, some highly visible and some that the public will not notice and that includes a dedicated deployment of armed officers. ""Armed officers have supported the policing operation in previous years, but this year will see them deployed in a different way."" The unprecedented operation follows high-level security at other major sporting events around the world, triggered in part by recent terror attacks in France and Belgium over the past year. Some 90,000 police and security officials have been on duty for Euro 2016 in France. Earlier this month, Sky News revealed how hundreds of undercover officers had been given last-minute assault rifle training in a bid to keep the football tournament safe.

The Prime Minister said he wanted to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU and then give people the ""simple choice"" between staying in under those new terms, or leaving the EU. :: 18/19 February, 2015 - The Prime Minister secures a deal to change Britain's membership of the EU at a crucial summit in Brussels. He claimed the reforms would give the UK ""special status"" in the 28 nation bloc, but Eurosceptics were dismissive of the agreement. Boris Johnson later said the PM had achieved ""two thirds of diddly squat"" in his pre-referendum negotiations with Brussels. :: 20 February - Following a special Cabinet meeting, David Cameron announced the referendum would be held on 23 June. It was agreed that collective cabinet responsibility would be suspended to allow ministers to campaign for Brexit - against the official government position. Michael Gove, Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, Theresa Villiers and John Whittingdale immediately announced that they backed quitting the EU. :: 21 February - Boris Johnson said he had made the “agonisingly difficult” decision to back the Leave camp and rejected claims it was linked to any leadership ambitions. :: 9 March - The Queen is dragged into the referendum campaign after The Sun claimed she had expressed Eurosceptic views during a lunch with former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. Buckingham Palace complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation. The watchdog found the ""Queen backs Brexit"" headline was ""significantly misleading"" but the newspaper rejected the ruling and insisted it had not made an error. On the eve of the vote, the newspaper again featured the monarch on its front page as part of its support for the Leave campaign. It, along with several other newspapers, reported the revelation by royal biographer Robert Lacey that the Queen had asked dinner guests: ""Give me three good reasons why Britain should be part of Europe."" :: 7 April - The Government revealed it was to spend more than £9m of public money on sending a leaflet to every UK household setting out the case for remaining in the European Union, sparking a furious backlash from Leave campaigners. :: 15 April - The official referendum campaign kicked off with both sides holding events and rallies across the country. It signalled the start of spending limits and rules for the official campaigns - Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe. :: 22 April - During a visit to the UK, US President Barack Obama said Britain would be ""in the back of the queue"" for a trade deal if it left the EU. Hitting back at the intervention by the American leader, Mr Johnson described him as ""part-Kenyan"", leading to accusations of ""dog-whistle racism"". :: 12 May - Bank of England governor Mark Carney was strongly criticised by Eurosceptics after issuing a stark warning of the threat to the economy of Brexit, which ""could possibly include a technical recession"". :: 13 May - Mr Carney's concerns were echoed by the International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, who said a UK vote to split from the EU would have ""pretty bad, to very, very bad"" consequences, and expected to see interest rates ""rise sharply"". Vote Leave said the IMF had been wrong in the past and was ""wrong now"". :: 15 May - Boris Johnson drew condemnation for comparing EU ambitions to create a single European state with the aims of Adolf Hitler. :: 20 May - Hundreds of celebrities, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Bill Nighy, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Keira Knightley, declare their support for staying in the EU. David Beckham also later gave his backing to the Remain camp. However, the Leave campaign highlighted the support of stars for its cause, including Dame Joan Collins, comedian John Cleese, actor Sir Michael Caine and cricketer Sir Ian Botham. :: 26 May - Pro-Brexit campaigners seize on data released in May that showed net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015 - the second highest figure on record. The figure for EU-only net migration was 184,000, equalling its record high. Boris Johnson said David Cameron had been ""cynical"" to promise to bring net migration down to below 100,000 while the UK remained part of the EU. :: 27 May - Four weeks out from the vote, the official purdah period started, barring civil servants from providing information on the referendum that could sway the public and influence the way that they vote. Central Government and local authorities were also forbidden from publishing material related to the vote. Both the Remain and Leave campaigners are accused of making ""misleading"" claims in the referendum battle by the cross-party Commons Treasury Select Committee. :: 2 June - David Cameron was grilled on Sky News by political editor Faisal Islam, before facing tough questioning from a live studio audience, in the first big television event of the referendum campaign. :: 3 June - Vote Leave supporter and Justice Secretary Michael Gove took his turn in the spotlight on Sky News where he accused the PM of scaremongering, but faced claims of behaving like a World War One general sending men into the unknown. :: 6 June - Conservative former prime minister John Major ramps up his criticism of the Leave campaign branding it ""squalid"" and savages ""court jester"" Boris Johnson. :: 7 June - The official deadline to register to vote in the referendum. However, following a last-minute rush to register that caused the Government website to crash, this was extended by 48-hours taking the deadline to midnight on 9 June. :: 15 June - UKIP leader Nigel Farage and rock singer Bob Geldof were involved in one of the more bizarre encounters of the campaign when a Leave flotilla was met by rival Remain boats on the River Thames. The slanging match saw Geldof shout ""You are no fisherman's friend"" across the water. :: 16 June - Labour MP Jo Cox dies after being shot and stabbed outside outside an advice surgery in her Batley and Spen constituency. The killing of the mother-of-two and Remain campaigner, cast a deep shadow over the final week of the campaign, with both sides suspending activities in the following days. The tone of the debate also remained largely subdued once campaigning restarted. The attack on Mrs Cox came just hours after Nigel Farage had unveiled a controversial poster showing migrants queuing to get into the EU under the slogan Breaking Point. The poster was roundly condemned by politicians from both sides, and in his tribute to Mrs Cox, her friend the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock warned that ""rhetoric has consequences"". Mr Farage insisted the ""isolated, horrific incident"" had nothing to do with the arguments in the referendum campaign. :: 22 June - David Cameron told Sky News his friend and cabinet colleague Michael Gove had ""lost it"" after he compared economic experts warning about the impact of Brexit to the Nazis smearing Albert Einstein in the 1930s. :: 23 June - Voters went to the polls in the historic referendum on whether Britain should stay part of the EU.  :: Follow the referendum results on Sky News TV, our apps and website.

Flooded streets were reported across the capital and some areas have been left without power. Usman Shah posted on Twitter: ""Never seen anything like this! So much rain in London! And then thunder. And then lightning. And then POWER CUT. And then my bedroom floods!"" Carl Mortimer posted: ""Looks like I'm not driving into London this morning then. Floods, everywhere!"" Sky News weather presenter Nazaneen Ghaffar said 6,000 lightning strikes had been reported in the UK and northern France overnight."

Initial reports suggested up to 50 people had  been hurt but police say there were no injuries. The man entered the Kinopolis cinema complex in Viernheim at around 3pm and fired four shots. A police spokeswoman at the scene, Christiane Kompus, said he took several hostages, but did not have a precise number. Officers ""successively entered the cinema and were able to locate the man and the people he was holding,"" she told reporters. ""There was a threat situation and the man was then shot dead by a colleague."" Ms Kompus said police were at the scene for about three hours and no-one else was hurt. She had no information on the assailant's identity and motives. Hesse state's interior minister, Peter Beuth, said it was not clear if the weapon was real. He added that the gunman was masked and appeared to be ""disturbed"". Police say they do not believe he was a terrorist."

A US Coast Guard spokesman declined to identify the body and said they would continue to search the Gulf of Mexico for three more family members. The discovery was made shortly after a ""debris field"" was spotted. Six life jackets, a tarp, water jugs and a propane tank have been found. Two empty kayaks that had been tied to the boat were later found in the vicinity of the debris field, authorities said. #BreakingNews: USCG aircrews locate debris field approximately 33nm off Sanibel Island. 6 life jackets found, no sign of missing family. There were no signs of the vessel, Cmdr Randall Brown told a news conference. Ace Kimberly, 45, and his teenage children, Rebecca, Donny and Roger were last heard from at the weekend. The family, who live on the boat, set sail from Sarasota on Sunday to Fort Myers to have repairs carried out. Mr Kimberly's brother alerted authorities on Tuesday after not hearing from the family for two days. He told the Coast Guard his brother informed him late on Sunday that they were battling ""rough seas and thunderstorms""."
2016-06-23,The UK last had a referendum on European membership in 1975.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624000327/http://news.sky.com/story/1716337/goodbye-eu-campaign-hello-referendum-result,"The UK last had a referendum on European membership in 1975. Now, 41 years later, it has held a second vote, once again brought about by an incumbent Prime Minister's attempts to hold his divided party together. Back then, Harold Wilson was Labour Leader, today David Cameron is Conservative Prime Minister. Today’s referendum became inevitable when the Conservatives won an outright majority in the General Election last year – holding it was a pledge in the Tory manifesto which he was now obliged to deliver. Harold Wilson called the last referendum on the Europe question Cameron negotiated what he said was a binding new deal for the UK with his 27 European Union partners, and on his return from Brussels on 20 February 2016 he announced that the Referendum would be held on 23 June. Even though the Government's official position was to remain in, the Prime Minister guaranteed that ministers could campaign on the side of their choice without endangering their careers. As Brexit became a catchphrase, Cabinet Ministers Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Theresa Villiers and John Whittingdale signed up, along with Iain Duncan Smith, who resigned from the Government in protest, he said, at George Osborne's budget. After much public dithering, Boris Johnson threw in his lot with them, denying it was because he thought it was the quickest way to become Prime Minister. Neither campaign got off to a good start. The chair of the Britain Stronger in Europe, businessman Stuart Rose, had difficulty remembering his organisation's clunky name and little more was heard of him after he suggested leaving the EU could mean higher wages for British workers. Two different groups battled for designation as the official Out campaign: Vote Leave, the Conservative dominated grouping, and Leave.EU, later rebranded Grassroots Out, dominated by the UKIP leader Nigel Farage and his main financial backer, Arron Banks. Vote Leave won the designation but as the campaign wore on they increasingly made their case on Mr Farage's terms, suggesting they could curb immigration as their trump card. Economic arguments dominated for the Remain campaign. Leading economic authorities, including the IMF, the governor of the Bank of England and Office of Budget Responsibility backed them up - all agreeing Britain would take a financial hit if it left the EU. The experts roundly condemned Vote Leave's claim, emblazoned on their battle bus, that Britain sends £350m each week to Brussels, or that, once out, such sums would be readily available for the NHS. Challenged on Sky News, the Out campaigner Michael Gove retorted ""people have had enough of experts"". However, few experts endorsed the claims from the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne that families would be worse off by £4,300 a year in the event of Brexit or that it would mean he would have to raise taxes and cut spending in an emergency Budget. The two sides squabbled fruitlessly about which of them would have been endorsed by unimpeachable historical figures including Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, Margaret Thatcher and the Queen. When David Cameron mentioned war graves and said the EU had helped ""anchor peace and stability"", Boris Johnson called him ""demented"" for conjuring up ""bubonic plague and World War 3"". Meanwhile, world leaders, with the exception of Donald Trump and a silent President Putin, backed David Cameron's position. President Obama warned that a UK outside the EU would find itself ""at the back of the queue"" trying to negotiate trade deals with the US. With opinion polls showing the two sides deadlocked, voters said they wanted more information and complained about the ""nastiness"" of the campaigns, which reached ludicrous levels when rival flotillas of small boats confronted each other on the Thames opposite parliament. The Leave camp accused their opponents of ""Project Fear"" scare tactics. Remain countered that the Brexiteers were guilty of ""Project Hate"" because of their concentration on immigration. They made this charge strongly after Nigel Farage produced his ""Breaking Point"" poster showing the long lines of desperate migrants from Africa and the Middle East. A week ago the Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered outside her constituency surgery. Campaigning was suspended for three days. When it resumed Brendan Cox said his wife had been killed by ""hate"" and highlighted her active backing for Britain remaining in the EU. Back in 1975 UK citizens voted to stay in the European Community (the Common Market) by a margin of two to one. Whichever side wins, the result is universally expected to be much closer this time on the question of membership of what has become the European Union. :: Follow the referendum results on Sky News TV, our apps and website.

2016-06-23,A father in Australia has been jailed for 22-and-a-half years for repeatedly raping his daughter and offering her to strangers to abuse.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624000327/http://news.sky.com/story/1716260/dad-who-raped-daughter-was-fun-while-it-lasted,"A father in Australia has been jailed for 22-and-a-half years for repeatedly raping his daughter and offering her to strangers to abuse. The man, who cannot be named to protect the child's identity, admitted committing 61 offences between 2013 and 2015. The girl, who lived with her father after her parents separated, was aged between 11 and 13 at the time. The 42-year-old father also arranged for six other men, whom he met online, to have sex with her while he watched or participated. The West Australian District Court in Perth heard that after his arrest he told police that while he had regrets about what he had done, ""it was fun while it lasted"". On one occasion when the father and another man were filming an attack, the girl was shown shackled to a bed, wearing a dog collar with the word 'bitch' on it, the West Australian newspaper reported. In the footage, the girl could be seen struggling against the restraints and pleading ""stop, please Dad"", it said. Prosecutor Justin Whalley described the case as one of the worst of its kind to come before the courts in Western Australia. The paedophile ring was smashed last year after a tip-off from the public. Sentencing the father on Thursday, Judge Philip Eaton said the abuse would likely have ""lasting and irreparable consequences"" for the girl. ""You completely disregarded her welfare,"" he said. ""I have no doubt that you derived perverse sexual enjoyment while doing so."" One of the other men involved, a church pastor, was sentenced to 10 years in prison last November. Two other men have also been jailed with three more still before the courts."

England will face Iceland after the tiny island nation defied the pundits with a 2-1 late win over Austria. The Republic of Ireland - who needed to beat Italy to progress - secured their place in the last 16 after another dramatic late winner gave them a 1-0 win. The Irish team celebrates after their 1-0 win over Italy It was the Irish victory that changed the dynamic of the second-round line-up. It had appeared for a time that Wales would play Turkey and Northern Ireland would tackle hosts France in the knock-out stages. But the Republic going through saw Turkey eliminated and paved the way for a Group B winners Wales to play Northern Ireland, one of the four best third-placed teams, in a clash at the Parc des Princes in Paris on Saturday. Irish President Michael D Higgins was at the match and hailed the team's ""wonderful achievement"" as Irish fans went wild celebrating one of the country's most memorable sporting achievements. England's game against Iceland takes place at the Allianz Riviera stadium in Nice on Monday. Iceland, the smallest nation ever to compete in a major tournament, went through after a 94th-minute stoppage-time winner against Austria, ranked 10th in the world. The team drew with Portugal in their first game of the tournament after which Cristiano Ronaldo declared: ""They are not going to do anything in the competition."" Ronaldo's Portugal finished third in the group behind Iceland, with Hungary topping the group. The success of the Icelanders is all the more remarkable given it is a country with just 330,000 inhabitants - fewer than Cardiff. The team is also unable to play outdoors for much of the year due to the freezing conditions. Their 2-1 victory over Austria, the side's first ever win in a major competition, sets the stage for a David and Goliath clash against England, which is about 165 times the size of Iceland. Roy Hodgson's squad finished second in Group B behind Wales, after a goalless draw against Slovakia."

An artist's impression of the event shows the star being quickly sucked into the monster black hole, which then gives off a burst of X-rays. It happened about 3.9 billion light years from Earth in the direction of the Draco constellation, and was spotted using high-energy X-ray data from NASA's public archives. The black hole, with a mass a few million times larger than the sun, gorged on the star at a rate 100 times greater than a theoretical maximum known as the Eddington limit. Nothing can escape a black hole after falling inside, including light. The black hole glows, giving off X-rays after devouring its space snack The majority of supermassive black holes are dormant, meaning they are not actively consuming matter. But occasionally a star drifts too close to a dormant black hole and a 'tidal disruption event' begins. Authors of the new research say their findings could solve the mystery of how the largest black holes in the universe came to grow to such huge sizes. The study's lead author Erin Kara, from the University of Maryland, said: ""Most tidal disruption events don't emit much in the high-energy X-ray band. ""But there have been at least three known events that have, and this is the first and only such event that has been caught at its peak."" The event was first detected in 2011, but the extensive research into the event was concluded and published this week."

The National Policing Football Unit launched the appeal following the violence involving England and Russia supporters in Marseille that marred the opening weekend of Euro 2016. A Russian hooligan gang described as ""hyper-violent"" by the Marseille prosecutor carried out several attacks in town and inside the stadium. The violence included bottle throwing and street furniture being used as weapons, and has been described by British police as the worst they have seen in many years. Police have been piecing together a timeline of what happened and working their way through footage collected by English and French police spotters who monitored the disorder as it flared over three days and nights in Marseille. They now want help identifying individuals picked out from footage, and have appealed for footage recorded by other supporters to help in the investigation of an attack on one fan, Stewart Gray from Leicester, who remains in a serious condition in hospital. Police have no footage of the attack, which is believed to have taken place in the Rue Forte Notre Dame area of the Vieux Port between 2.30pm and 4pm on Saturday June 11. Detective Superintendent Andy Barnes said: ""Please come forward if you have any information, photos or video of what happened in Marseille. ""We particularly need footage to help us understand how Stewart Gray became so badly injured. ""We are aware that there were people in the apartment above the incident who we would like to speak to as witnesses. ""They were seen to be taking video footage and this could be crucial evidence. If you recognise yourself or someone you know in this footage, then please get in touch."" Six England fans were jailed for between one and three months, most for throwing bottles, following the Marseille clashes and a number of Russian fans were thrown out of the country. The Russian football federation was also fined €150,000 and given a suspended disqualification from Euro 2012 over crowd disturbances at the game against England. Anyone with information about the violence in Marseille is asked to call the UKPFU at 0208 246 0076 or email centralfootballunit@met.pnn.police.uk."

The event was one of many held in the UK and elsewhere to celebrate what would have been her 42nd birthday. Brendan Cox started his eight-minute speech by thanking the organisers. ""Thank you to Jo's amazing friends, and friends of friends, and even complete strangers who have managed, despite your own grief, to organise all of this in less than a week. ""Your support and love has helped us all and I wanted our children to see what their mum meant to all of you. I know that they will remember today."" The huge crowd at Trafalgar Square Echoing his sister-in-law's words earlier this week, Mr Cox said his wife had ""just wanted people to be happy and for the world to be a fairer place"". Mr Cox said she had lived her life to the full. ""She was a mountain climber, a runner, a cyclist, an avid reader, an awful cook, a swimmer, a great exaggerator, a wild food forager, a middle lane driver, a log carrier, a ball of energy and determination, and above all else she was a mum. One of the many banners on display ""She was the best mum that any child could wish for. And wish we do, to have her back in our lives."" The event in London was watched by hundreds of people gathered outside the town hall in her Batley constituency in West Yorkshire. After a minute's silence, her younger sister, Kim Leadbeater, took to the stage to pay tribute to her ""caring, compassionate and inspirational"" sibling. Kim Leadbeater's speech was shown in Trafalgar Square She told the crowd: ""From Batley to Burma and from the Spen Valley to Syria, Jo's life was centred around helping people and standing up for the causes she felt passionate about - and there were many. ""I don't have any answers as to why such a horrendous and tragic event has occurred in our lives but I do know that Jo would not have wanted any of us to allow it to make her life anything other than the force for good it always was."" The service in Trafalgar Square also heard from Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai. It was hosted by broadcaster Mariella Frostrup, an old friend of Mrs Cox, and included a music tribute by U2 and a reading by actor Bill Nighy."

The tragedy happened in June 2014 when Zoe Woolmer was on a guided tour of Kings Canyon in the Watarrka National Park in the Northern Territory. The 23-year-old tried to have her photo taken on the Rim Walk at Kestrel Falls but stumbled backwards off a hidden cliff ledge. She was treated at the scene but died 50 minutes later. The firm involved, The Rock Tour, admitted health and safety failings and was fined AU$140,000 (£71,000) and ordered to pay AU$12,290 (£6,600) in legal costs. Judge David Bamber at Alice Springs Local Court said the tour guide encouraged Ms Woolmer and others to attempt the dangerous photo stunt. He said to allow anyone to go to the unmarked area at the top of the walk was ""clearly a significant breach"". The danger was ""obvious"" and ""anybody who thought sensibly about it would not have allowed this to happen"". The work health authority, NT Worksafe, said it was a serious and easily preventable tragedy. ""I know that [The Rock Tour] have improved their systems to ensure that their customers aren't taken to the edge of this particular area,"" said NT Worksafe executive director Stephen Gelding. ""But it's a wake-up call to all tour companies that they have a duty and obligation under the act, the legislation, to keep their tourists safe."" The Rock Tour declined to comment but its lawyer Tony Whitelum said he believed the fine was reasonable. He added: ""A conviction for anyone is a blot on your copybook but of course they're a great corporate citizen and I'm sure they'll overcome it in the course of time."" Another British tourist died on the same ledge as Ms Woolmer in 1996, an inquest heard last year. Ms Woolmer was in Australia on a 12-month working visa when she left Sydney for Alice Springs to take part in a three-day tour of the Watarrka and Uluru-Kata Tjuta national parks with The Rock Tour company."
2016-06-23,Only one out of the 11 police forces that help to keep people safe at the country's biggest music festivals have said they are increasing their presence in response to recent terror attacks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624000327/http://news.sky.com/story/1716023/festival-policing-concerns-after-terror-warning,"By Lucy Cotter, Arts and Entertainment Correspondent Only one out of the 11 police forces that help to keep people safe at the country's biggest music festivals have said they are increasing their presence in response to recent terror attacks. Sky News contacted all the constabularies, including the force in Avon and Somerset where Glastonbury is being held, and only Cambridgeshire police confirmed it was changing its arrangements at the Secret Garden Party, taking place near Huntingdon. That is despite warnings by senior officers that big music events and stadiums are particularly vulnerable after the massacre in Paris last November. A Cambridgeshire police spokesperson said: ""There is a slight increase in the number of officers that will be policing the Secret Garden Party compared to last year's event. ""Our number one priority is public safety. We have thoroughly planned for the event and been in regular contact with both the festival organisers and local authority. Gallery: Glastonbury Festival Preparations A waterlogged field at Glastonbury Festival at the Worthy Farm site in Pilton, Somerset, where heavy rain over a prolonged period has caused isolated flooding and muddy fields ""We have also sought the advice of one of the county's Counter Terrorism Security Advisors (CTSAs) in relation to the event and the policing of it."" Hampshire police would not comment on the number of officers involved in the Isle of Wight and Bestival festivals but said it works together with event organisers and local authorities to ""prepare for a range of scenarios, including terrorist-related acts"". Crisis management expert Chris Webb believes the threat is not being taken seriously enough. He said: ""The entertainment industry has somewhat buried its head in the sand and actually doesn't appreciate and does not realise or accept the current threat this country is facing especially attacks on crowded places. ""It really needs to wake up and look at the current threat, it needs to look at attacks in Europe and America, and it needs to prepare for the worst-case scenarios."" The Isle of Wight Festival is months in the planning and a terrorist attack has been among the many scenarios explored. Experts from all the emergency services work together in a 24-hour communication hub set up to respond to any potential threats as they happen. Events Safety Advisor at the festival, Alan Law, said they planned for many eventualities. ""I think we'd be very foolish not to be worried about the increased terrorist threat,"" he said. ""I think I'm comfortable we have the right procedures in place to manage and deal with any threat which might manifest itself as much as any organisation or indeed any large event can do at the moment."" The festival-goers we spoke seemed unfazed by the increased threat levels and were determined to focus on the music - just as it should be. Deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, the UK policing lead for protective security advice, said: ""It is wrong to suggest that police forces are not considering all relevant potential threats to events held in their areas. ""The UK has been at a threat level of 'severe' since August 2014 and our protective security measures, including advice to event organisers and the private sector, reflect this heightened state of readiness. ""Forces have longstanding and well established ways of working with event organisers - from county fairs to Remembrance events - assessing possible threats and reviewing security arrangements appropriate and proportionate to the risk to help keep the public safe."""

Filmed by the Hunt Investigation Team supported by the League Against Cruel Sports, an individual can be seen carrying a fox cub into a barn where hounds are kennelled and barking, and later disposing of a dead fox in a wheelie bin before another is taken in. Animal rights campaigners claim the video is evidence of ""cubbing"", the practice of using cubs to train hounds to hunt and kill foxes. Three people have been arrested and released on police bail - and an independent investigation has been launched into the South Herefordshire Hunt. Hunting foxes with dogs has been banned for more than a decade Hunting foxes with packs of hounds has been banned since 2004, with hunts now allowed to participate in ""drag hunting"" where an artificial scent is laid for the hounds to track. The Master of Fox Hounds Association, which regulates and represents hunts around the country, said it had launched the inquiry ""into conduct which suggests breaches of the association's rules"". It said two members of staff had been suspended and the kennels were currently closed. ""The South Herefordshire hounds are being looked after by other hunts which are members of the association,"" it added. The probe will be chaired by former Appeal Court judge Sir John Chadwick Bill Andrewes, an experienced former Master and Hunt chairman, and Pauline Tolhurst, a practising veterinary surgeon. Chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, Eduardo Goncalves, said: ""The hounds won't naturally kill foxes so they must be taught to do so and this footage exposes the gruesome training secrets of hunts in the UK."" West Mercia Police said a 37-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, both from Hereford, and a 37-year-old man from Abergavenny, were arrested on suspicion of causing suffering to animals and bailed until August."

The 22-year-old, from Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, was released by Peruvian authorities after serving only one third of her sentence and smiled as she was escorted through an airport in Lima by immigration officials. She landed back in the UK at 9.44pm on Wednesday night with her father Billy, after catching a connecting flight from Amsterdam. It is believed she avoided the waiting press in the arrivals lounge by taking an airside transfer - bringing to an end an ordeal which began in August 2013. The pair were convicted of trying to smuggle 11kg of cocaine out of Peru Reid and Michaella McCollum, a 23-year-old from Dungannon,County Tyrone, had been caught attempting to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5m in food packets from Peru to Spain. The pair, nicknamed the Peru Two, were paraded in front of the press and had initially claimed they were forced to board a flight with their 11kg (24lb) haul of Class A drugs. Both young women later admitted the offence and were sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars. During their imprisonment they were transferred to the notorious Ancon 2 jail, where conditions are said to be cramped, with poor sanitation and toilet facilities. McCollum had been released earlier in the year, but she remains on parole in Peru for an undisclosed period of time. The food packets had been hidden inside the duo's luggage Reid was released under a new Peruvian law which allows first-time drug offenders to walk free for good behaviour after completing a third of their sentence. Janeth Sanchez, a spokeswoman for Peru's prison system, said: ""(Reid) served her time in prison according to the law and can now go to her country, free, to the streets."" Courts in the South American country had concluded she has shown remorse for her crime. About 90% of the 1,800 foreigners in Peru's prisons are awaiting trials for drug trafficking, or have been sentenced for such crimes. Reid's father Billy has previously said the impact of his daughter's crime on his family had been ""horrendous"" and spoke in a video warning of the consequences of drug offences abroad."

The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), which polled a small number of 13 to 18-year-olds for their perspective on childhood obesity, has warned further ""hard-hitting measures"" are needed to tackle the epidemic. Their research suggests the majority of young people feel misled by the nutritional information displayed on food packaging, and want clear explanations on labels to help them make better dietary decisions. Most believe labels should detail how many teaspoons of sugar are in soft drinks, as this is a more understandable measurement than grams. Other proposals backed by those surveyed was a loyalty card to reward healthy food choices, or a simpler way of categorising food that is high in sugar, fat and salt - not dissimilar to the way films are certified as 12, 15 or 18. Shirley Cramer, the chief executive of RSPH, said: ""Our childhood obesity rates are disappointing, and tackling this must be a priority for government - there can be no excuses for fudging action on what is our number one public health challenge. ""While we welcome the Government's introduction of a sugar levy on soft drinks, it is absolutely critical that the forthcoming childhood obesity strategy builds on this positive step with a basket of hard-hitting measures, from greater controls on advertising and marketing of junk food to food reformulation."" Professor Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, described the quantity of children who order fast food at school as a ""great cause for concern"" - and said schools must be part of the solution. She added: ""It is now well recognised and extremely worrying that UK children leave school more overweight than when they start. ""As child health professionals treating children with obesity-related conditions we urge government to note that young people themselves are asking for help."" The RSPH's report comes ahead of the Government's childhood obesity strategy, which is due to be published later in the summer."

He said: ""I believe we now have a glorious opportunity - we can pass our laws and set our taxes entirely to the needs of the UK economy. ""We can control our borders in a way that is not discriminatory, but fair and balanced and take the wind out of the sails of the extremists and those who would play politics with immigration.

Our children and grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans travelling to the continent, understanding the languages and cultures, that make up of common European civilisation.""

2016-06-24,A company director who tried to stab to death his pregnant partner and their unborn child has been jailed for 18 years.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624204525/http://news.sky.com/story/1716500/man-who-tried-to-murder-pregnant-partner-jailed,"A company director who tried to stab to death his pregnant partner and their unborn child has been jailed for 18 years. Babur Raja carried out a ""horrific, premeditated, persistent knife attack"" with a 12-inch kitchen blade on Natalie Querioz, Judge Simon Drew QC said. Raja, 41, claimed that he was ""overwhelmed"" with stress because his mother disapproved of his relationship with a non-Muslim woman. The judge at Birmingham Crown Court accepted he was under ""great stress"" and was forced to choose between the two but said the offences were ""carefully planned"" for at least two days. Babur Raja wore a ""disguise"" to make himself look fat It had been ""no spontaneous meltdown"" but a ""deliberate"" plan, the judge said. ""Once you chose your mother over your partner and child you resolved not only to terminate your relationship but terminate them,"" Judge Drew added. Raja had quizzed his Ms Queiroz for her exact movements prior to the attack, so much so that she joked that he sounded like a stalker. ""You really were (a stalker),"" Judge Drew added. Raja admitted in May trying to kill Ms Queiroz during a ""frenzied"" attack in Sutton Coldfield town centre on 4 March. On Friday, the court heard the couple's unborn baby was just 2mm away from being struck by the blade he used in the attempt to kill her. The prosecution said that Ms Queiroz suffered a ""prolonged"" attack at the hands of Raja, who repeatedly attempted to stab her in the street. Several passers-by, aged between 16 and 70, tried to help and were in the process stabbed by Raja. As a result of the actions of the passers-by, Ms Queiroz was initially able to break free but Raja caught up with her and stabbed her again while she was on the floor, and tried to cut her throat.  The victim was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition and underwent an emergency caesarean section. Her baby was saved but suffered swelling to the brain and is said to have possible long-term brain damage. Neither mother or baby saw each other for the first five days of its life as both were in intensive care units. Jane Humphryes QC, in mitigation, said turmoil over the disagreement with his conservative Muslim mother had ""tipped him over the edge"" leading to a temporary mental illness or ""adjustment disorder"", leaving him with little memory of what he had done. She said: ""His mother had not been happy he was in a relationship with a white woman, and told him he must leave her or she would not be in contact."" Prosecuting barrister Benjamin Aina QC said that it is possible that Ms Queiroz's life was only saved by the type of bra she was wearing and her breast implants, which were ruptured during the attack. Raja had also admitted attempted child destruction, possession of a knife in public and the wounding and assault of two passers-by. A statement on behalf of Ms Queiroz was read out outside the court by her police family liaison officer DC Ruth Boddy."
2016-06-24,Voters defied dire warnings on the economy to back a Brexit – so what will the decision mean for Britain's household finances and their job prospects?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624204525/http://news.sky.com/story/1716974/how-uks-leave-vote-will-affect-your-money,"Voters defied dire warnings on the economy to back a Brexit – so what will the decision mean for Britain's household finances and their job prospects? Holidaymakers and motorists will be among the first to suffer thanks to the plunge in the value of the pound – while prior to the vote there have also been warnings about the impact of economic uncertainty on jobs, wages, pensions and house prices. The currency moves will mean more expensive trips abroad for UK tourists as their money will not go as far while drivers are to see petrol prices go up as oil – priced in dollars – becomes more expensive in pounds. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Pete Williams said forecourt retailers were likely to see an increase in the wholesale price of fuel of 1.5p which would be passed on to motorists at the pumps. The result could also have an impact on air fares, with Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs saying they could go up - though it was too early to say for sure. :: What about the economy and interest rates? Some experts are already predicting that Britain will see slower economic growth or even plunge back into recession, echoing a warning by Bank of England governor Mark Carney prior to the poll. Meanwhile, the fall in the value of the pound will push up the prices of all imported goods, putting upward pressure on inflation. Yet a rise in interest rates to keep this in check seems far from likely, with experts speculating instead that they could be cut to zero to help the economy withstand the shock of the Leave result. This would be welcomed by mortgage borrowers and other indebted consumers but spell more pain for savers – who have already been hammered by seven years of interest rates at the historic low of 0.5% following the financial crisis. :: Will wages and jobs suffer? Treasury forecasts – derided by Leave campaigners – predicted that an exit vote would cut wages by an average of £800 a year and cause 820,000 job losses. They also warned of hundreds of billions of pounds being wiped off retirement funds. But what is the reality following the vote? The market carnage that has wiped billions of pounds from the value of the UK’s biggest listed companies does paint a bleak picture about prospects. International banks were among those warning on the future, with Deutsche Bank boss John Cryan saying there was no doubt the consequences ""will be negative on all sides"". Deutsche employs 9,000 people in the UK. Wall Street giant JP Morgan has previously warned of an impact on UK jobs. Meanwhile UK-based telecoms giant Vodafone said on Friday it was ""too soon"" to say what the impact of the vote would be on where it has its headquarters. Elsewhere, the industry body representing big UK drugs firms such as GlaxoSmithKline and Astra Zeneca – in a sector employing 183,000 people and with an annual turnover of £56bn – warned following the vote that its prospects would be tougher. Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said the decision ""creates immediate challenges for future investment, research and jobs in our industry in the UK"". Trade body UK Steel said the vote would send shockwaves through its industry. Others were more circumspect, with German car maker BMW saying it would not speculate on the potential impact on operations in the UK and Ford, with 14,000 workers, saying it would make no changes to its plans ""unless there is clear evidence that action is needed"". :: What about house prices and housing? And pensions? In the property sector, Andy Pyle, UK head of real estate at KPMG, said in the wake of the result that London would see a decline in its position as Europe’s leading financial centre, impacting demand for property in the City in particular. David Thomas, chief executive of house builder Barratt Developments, said while there would be a ""period of uncertainty"" it was confident it could respond to the changes. For life insurance and pensions, Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London asset management, said it expected the UK to fall into recession after the result. He said long terms returns were likely to ""ride out the short-term volatility"" and advised shorter term investors to consult a financial adviser before making any changes."

A letter submitted by the retailer's chief executive Darren Topp said Mr Chappell ""saw no distinction between the company's money and his own personal money"" and that he ""saw them as one and the same"". It said Mr Chappell's Retail Acquisitions Limited (RAL) vehicle, which bought BHS for £1, had taken £17m out of the business and that this - together with its failure to raise finance for the business - was to blame for its eventual collapse. Mr Topp's claims - made in a letter to an inquiry by two parliamentary committees - add to his sharp criticism of Mr Chappell in front of MPs earlier this month. Mr Chappell giving evidence to MPs earlier this month BHS was sold to the former bankrupt by billionaire retailer Sir Philip Green last year. It collapsed into administration in April. In June it was announced that the business was being wound down after administrators failed to find a buyer - leaving 11,000 jobs likely to be lost. Mr Topp's evidence said that months earlier, in December 2015, Mr Chappell had ""attempted to buy a set of family holiday flights on the company travel budget"". It added: ""This was spotted by Darren Topp and stopped immediately much to the annoyance of Chappell."" The letter also said that Mr Chappell sought to take his December 2015 salary early, ahead of departing on his family holiday to the Bahamas, and that this payment had been allowed on the basis of ""hardship"". Mr Chappell responded to the claims in a statement saying that he had made a request for BHS to put flights on the company account as ""an issue of logistics"" and that the money was to be repaid, adding: ""There was no intent whatsoever to have the company pay for my private travel."" He said the early payment of his December salary was ""suggested by the BHS management"" before he went away for Christmas. Mr Chappell added: ""At no stage have I ever used the company bank account as a private account for myself and all and every payment except two went through the normal BHS process and system."" He described Mr Topp's claims as ""absolutely childish"" as well as ""pathetic and petty"". The collapse of BHS is being investigated by the Business, Innovations and Skills committee and the Work and Pensions committee. Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions committee, said: ""We are still elucidating the full story of the final collapse of BHS, but it happened under Dominic Chappell and RAL's stewardship. ""They should also account fully and properly for their decisions and actions, some of which appear quite extraordinary."" The letter comes as the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) - the ""lifeboat"" for failed retirement schemes - confirmed that it had appointed a second set of administrators, FRP, to oversee a winding down of BHS. Administrators at Duff & Phelps are currently overseeing the process. It follows a Sky News report that the PPF had requested the move amid concerns about the complex web of ties connecting the company's former owners. The BHS pension deficit is now thought to be more than £600m. Malcolm Weir, head of restructuring at the PPF, said: ""This is an unusual step, but one we regard as appropriate given the circumstances of this administration."""

As one minister put it when asked of their ambitions, ""it's all too sensitive and tender"". Leadership hopefuls had been preparing for the possibility of a Cameron resignation, however distant that prospect seemed on the eve of the referendum poll. Theresa May is almost certainly going to go for it, say colleagues. The Home Secretary went with Remain but did not campaign, keeping beneath the parapet in order to emerge as a potential unity candidate it the aftermath of a brutal campaign. Friends of Nicky Morgan have told Sky News that the Education Secretary is also taking soundings on whether to stand, and wants to position herself as the One Nation candidate and torch bearer of Cameron's legacy. Stephen Crabb, the Work and Pensions Secretary, is also emerging as one of the leading Remainers, but don't underestimate the formidable Jeremy Hunt, the ambitious and resilient Health Secretary. :: Live: Nation Reacts To PM's Brexit Resignation On the Leave side, Michael Gove, the Justice Secretary, former London mayor Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Employment Minister, and Andrea Leadsom, the Treasury Secretary, have spent the past five weeks showcasing their leadership skills as the frontmen and women of Vote Leave. In the coming days all must decide whether they can garner enough support in the parliamentary party to stand. :: Who Will Replace Cameron? Runners And Riders Mr Johnson is the bookies' runaway favourite to succeed Cameron and the former London mayor is popular with the grassroots' activists who pick the leader from the two candidates put forward by the parliamentary party. Plenty in Westminster, and his dad Stanley Johnson, believe Mr Johnson is too popular with the public not to get into the final round of the contest. But doubts remain over whether he really is prime ministerial material. Many Conservatives - particularly those on team Remain - are concerned he lacks the gravitas and leadership qualities to take the top job. They also feel rather bruised about the role he played in helping to bring around Mr Cameron's demise. The chief aim is to put to bed those Tory wars and the idea of 'In' and 'Out' MPs running on a double ticket is gaining traction. One MP says that one such dream ticket being talked about is Crabb and Leadsom. Crabb has the ability to appeal to the C2 base, he grew up on a council estate with a single mother. Leadsom is a former City banker who would be well qualified to take up the mantle of Chancellor.   Another, who is a Boris Johnson backer, thinks Michael Gove might try to team up with Crabb.

Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed she wants a second independence referendum within this period to prevent Scotland - where all local authorities voted Remain - being taken out of the EU ""against its will"". The First Minister said she would ""begin to prepare the legislation"" to allow this to happen. Attention will now turn to who will replace Mr Cameron in Number 10 - with Leave campaign figurehead Boris Johnson installed as the bookies' favourite. He told a news conference he was ""sad"" the Prime Minister was stepping down and described him as ""one of the most extraordinary politicians of our time"". But the former London mayor said the UK had a ""glorious opportunity"" to control its own taxes and borders and ""find our voice in the world again"". Meanwhile, Labour MPs have submitted a no-confidence motion in leader Jeremy Corbyn after criticism of his efforts in the Remain campaign. Mr Corbyn told Sky News earlier he would not resign. The first party leader to speak after the declaration was UKIP's Nigel Farage, who labelled 23 June ""independence day"" and demanded the creation of a ""Brexit government"". Reaction is also emerging from the continent, with European Council President Donald Tusk admitting the EU would have to reflect on its own future. He tweeted: ""A serious even dramatic moment, especially for the UK. ""We are prepared for this negative scenario. There will be no legal vacuum. ""On behalf of all 27 leaders: we are determined to keep our unity as 27. ""I have offered an informal meeting of the 27 in the margins of the European Council summit next week. ""I will also propose to leaders that we start a wider reflection on the future of our Union."" The result also exposes divisions across the UK, with Leave performing strongly in the English shires, Wales and north eastern towns and cities like Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool. Remain secured decisive majorities in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein sources said Brexit should lead to a poll on Irish unity, after Northern Ireland voted by 56% to 44% to Remain. The turnout was 72.1% - the highest in a national poll since the 1992 general election. A total of 33,577,342 voted -  17,410,742 for Leave and 16,141,241 for Remain. A petition calling for a second EU referendum because the turnout was below 75% and the majority below 60% has attracted more than 100,000 signatures. A separate petition calling for London to stay in the EU is being shared via the #LondOut hashtag. Look up all the results from the EU Referendum and see your local result."

The UKIP leader's comments came shortly before the Out campaign passed the winning post with an unassailable lead of more than one million votes - a margin of 51.8% to 48.2%. The Leave campaigner said he believed the referendum was won in Labour heartlands in the Midlands and northern England. He said: ""The sun has risen on an independent United Kingdom. It's been a hell of a long journey. ""It's a victory for ordinary people, decent people. It's a victory against the big merchant banks, against the big businesses and against big politics.

The turmoil prompted an intervention by the Bank of England, which made available a £250bn war chest to support markets while governor Mark Carney pledged that it would not hesitate to take further measures - amid speculation it would slash interest rates to zero.

It is also likely to push up some shop prices as imported goods will cost more for British consumers.

The reaction was all the greater for markets since they had confidently been pencilling-in a Remain victory on the back of a series of predictions from pollsters and bookmakers - sending the FTSE 100 and the pound higher in Thursday trading. The Bank of England said it was ""monitoring developments closely"" and pledged to ""take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability"". Governor Mark Carney said market and economic volatility was to be expected as the UK negotiates new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world but that it was ""well prepared for this"" after extensive contingency planning with the Treasury. He said the Bank was ready to provide more than £250bn of additional funds to keep markets functioning and would not hesitate to take further measures. Some experts predicted the Brexit vote would send the UK back into recession and there was speculation that interest rates could be cut from 0.5% to zero in coming months to cushion the economy from the expected blow. Ratings agency Standard & Poor reaffirmed its previous warning that the UK stood to lose its AAA credit rating following a Leave vote.

He had said he would, he suggested to me he would, but leading Leave MPs say it is a red line for them. :: LIVE: Reaction As UK Delivers Historic Out Vote The precise nature of the UK's new relationship with Europe, the flavour of Brexit, is still up for grabs. Out of the single market, what are the consequences for the car industry, pharma and the City? How will Parliament act to fulfil the people's mandate? Rescinding the European Communities Act seems inevitable. There could be another offer from Europe - the second referendum gambit first mentioned by Boris Johnson, and initially floated by Vote Leave. Could Europe create a second tier to the EU that restricts freedom of movement? Remember - the Leave campaign never actually confirmed there would be lower immigration.

The motion was filed by Dame Margaret Hodge and seconded by Ann Coffey shortly before a meeting of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet earlier. Dame Margaret told Sky News that Mr Corbyn had ""failed"" the test of leadership that the EU referendum provided - after northern Labour strongholds voted Leave. ""If there is a motion of no confidence ... I think he should reflect on his position and do the decent thing in the same way David Cameron has done,"" she said. ""He came out too slowly, he was very half-hearted about his attempts to campaign, and Labour voters simply didn't get the message. ""What we saw yesterday was swathes of Labour voters simply not voting Labour. Jeremy Corbyn could not connect with the people we needed to attract."" :: LIVE BLOG - Nation Reacts To Brexit The motion has no formal status but is expected to form the basis of a discussion within the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell, an ally of Mr Corbyn, said his leader had ""a huge mandate"" from Labour members. He said: ""The reality is the country's facing some dire financial situation, what we need to do is concentrate on that. ""These sort of motions, to be frank, fly in the face of what all our party members our saying about Jeremy ... he's reflected exactly how the country is feeling.""  In a letter to the chair of the PLP, the two MPs ask for the motion to be discussed on Monday before a ballot of MPs on Tuesday.  A spokesman for Mr Corbyn described the motion as a ""self-indulgent act"". ""It is a time when our party should be uniting to deal with the real issues that face Britain and the real issues that face the people of Britain, and so to create divisions in the party is a bit of a self-indulgent act,"" the spokesman said. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Corbyn thanked Labour campaigners and said the party must put its ""historic purpose into action now and campaign to protect and represent the people we serve,"" Sky News' senior political correspondent Sophy Ridge said several MPs have told her they would be prepared to back the motion, predicting it will be ""overwhelmingly passed"". One Labour MP said to her: ""Did Jeremy Corbyn actually vote for Remain? Because it wouldn't surprise me if he voted Leave."" More than 50 Labour MPs would have to sign a letter backing a rival candidate in order to spark a leadership contest. But Sky's Sophy Ridge says the motion ""does keep the momentum going and gives rival candidates time to get their campaign in order."" She said: ""Even then, though, Corbynites are confident their man has enough support among the membership to win all over again. In the words of one supporter, ""Bring it on""."" Mr Corbyn earlier told Sky News he would not resign as Labour leader, defending his role in the campaign and saying his party's voters were split. ""Large numbers of people voted both ways in this election ... there is a difference of position among Labour supporters, there is an even bigger difference of opinion amongst supporters of other parties,"" he said. :: UK Votes To Leave EU - A Complete Guide Ms Coffey said: ""In a leader you need somebody who can communicate a message and inspire confidence in that message and I think he failed on both counts.  ""I will say to people, you can win the election or you can have Corbyn as leader but you can't have both."" Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said that he was ""not surprised"" at the motion and also urged Mr Corbyn to consider his position. He said that the Labour leader should ""think about whether he should do the honourable thing.""  Senior Labour Leave campaigner Gisela Stuart said party leaders should ""reflect to what extent they are representing and reflecting the views of the voters"" without naming Mr Corbyn.

2016-06-24,So it's 24 June and the results of the referendum have said that the UK and the EU just don't want the same things any more.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624204525/http://news.sky.com/story/1712387/so-just-how-do-you-divorce-the-eu,"So it's 24 June and the results of the referendum have said that the UK and the EU just don't want the same things any more. It's time to go our separate ways, but just how are we going to divide the spoils?  Your questions answered: :: Can we divorce? Yes. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty says so. What it actually says is: ""Any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements."" :: Has anyone done it before? No. Britain is the first country to hold a referendum on leaving the EU and will therefore would be the first country to do so. However, before you all start shouting ""what about Greenland?""; yes it did leave the EU's forerunner the EEC in 1985 - mainly because it wanted its fishing rights back. It did cede some fishing rights to the EU in return for cash and it's still signed up to the single market so freedom of movement still applies – ie it must take EU immigrants. :: How long will the divorce take to come through? Longer than the average 33 weeks it takes to get a divorce in the UK. Article 50 states the UK will continue to be subject to EU rules for two years after giving its notice to quit. Only after that will those rules cease to apply. However, it's up to David Cameron as to when he wants to give notice. He's said he will do it straight away. Others have urged him to wait. It took the Greenlanders three years to thrash out their post-EU deal - but that was mainly all about fish. Remainers say it will take at least a decade. Certainly, Mr Cameron has said it will take that long to renegotiate the 52 trade deals the UK currently benefits from through its membership of the EU. :: What actually happens then? The UK tells the European Council (the body made up of leaders of the 28 member states) that it's off. The remaining 27 country heads will then thrash out a deal and decide what the UK should get and the arrangements for departure. The European Parliament has to vote on it and can veto the agreement if MEPs don't like what's on the table. :: Couldn't we just go, walk out the door, no turning around now? Yes. Article 50 only applies to what the EU does. The UK could just repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, slam the door and stomp off. But there is no getting away from the fact the UK and the EU countries do need to do business together – and both will want some kind of deal. :: Will we get the record collection and half the house? What we will get really depends on what the other 27 countries in the EU are prepared to give us. We might have really hurt their feelings so they could be feeling protective of their stuff – many have indicated as much. Or they might decide they want to give us quite a bit because being in a relationship with the fifth biggest economy in the world is a good thing. :: No but seriously, what will the settlement be? There's a number of things that could happen. It could be this whole referendum turns out to be a giant calling of the EU's bluff. The EU could be so worried Brexit will trigger exit for other EU countries and cause huge damage to the euro that they offer the UK a much, much better deal than they did in February and beg us to stay. It would have to offer some serious concessions on freedom of movement, aka immigration, which is the key issue for most Out voters. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove could then scuttle off to help the PM negotiate this, there will be a second referendum, Boris will be anointed King, the UK will stay in, and the Tories will win in 2020, delivering Johnson victorious to number 10. Or not. We could get a deal that means the UK can retain membership of the single market (tariff-free trade with the EU countries). What strings the EU would attach to this is unclear but the UK could be required to abide by freedom of movement, abide by some existing regulations and maybe pay some cash into the EU pot. Like Norway does. Or it could be something completely different. In short, we don't know what the settlement will be. :: What will happen to all the EU laws? Some of them – called directives – are implemented through UK law and they will stay but the regulations will fall away. It means the UK is going to have to make an awful lot of new law. Estimates are that there are around 5,000 pieces of secondary legislation affected. Although the Government has not shared plans for Brexit, it’s reasonable to hope there is a team of lawyers reviewing areas where new laws will be needed or existing laws can just be copied over. :: But more MPs want to stay In than Brexit so can't they just veto the public? Yes. They could do this by simply voting down the Brexit legislation. But this would mean they were overruling the public and effectively telling them: ""You don't know what’s best for the country"". And there's a General Election in 2020 at which, it's fair to guess, MPs would like to keep their seats. :: Is anyone actually prepared for this divorce? The Brexit camp has given it quite some thought. They would immediately enact six laws, allowing them to deport foreign criminals, scrap VAT on energy bills, give £100m of saved EU cash to the NHS, introduce an Australian-style points system on immigration, regain power over UK law and start negotiating trade deals. :: What if we realise we still love them and want them back? Tough. The UK cannot just take a look at the settlement on offer, say ""oh, I don't like that, I made a big mistake, please take me back"". Well it could but the EU would likely say ""no, we've moved on"". The only way to get back in is to reapply and funnily enough - as with all things EU - that could take a while. Unless of course the EU wants us back, in which case see above. :: Time To Decide: A special programme on the eve of the EU Referendum with Dermot Murnaghan on Wednesday from 10pm :: In or Out: Get all the results and reaction from the EU Referendum from 9.30pm on Thursday Look up all the results from the EU Referendum and see your local result."
2016-06-24,This much we know: today is already one of the most extraordinary and volatile days in UK economic history.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160624204525/http://news.sky.com/story/1716745/investors-terrified-at-chaos-created-by-brexit,"This much we know: today is already one of the most extraordinary and volatile days in UK economic history. For the time being, leave aside, if you can, all your questions about the future of the United Kingdom, about the fate of the government, even about whether Britain will be better off outside the European Union. That can wait for at least a few hours. What can't is this: overnight, Britain has swung from what economists would call a stable equilibrium to something resembling chaos. And investors are truly terrified. In the early hours, the pound lurched about more than any other day in modern history. More than on Black Wednesday, the day still cited as the most tumultuous moment in modern British economic policymaking. More than after Lehman Brothers collapsed or at any point in the financial crisis. Broadly speaking, a 1% intraday move in a major reserve currency is considered pretty big. A 10% move (as we have just seen) is, literally, unprecedented. Now, on the one hand you might be tempted to dismiss this as yet more scaremongering and nonsense. Not so fast. Many of us were sceptical about the Treasury's forecasts for the UK economy in the event of Brexit. :: LIVE: Reaction As UK Delivers Historic Out Vote But we also saw worrying signals in the market - that while in the long run Brexit might be an economic opportunity for the UK, in the short run it could spark volatility and capital flight. A few weeks ago we revealed that investors sold off £65bn of sterling assets in the first couple of months of the referendum campaign. It turns out that was only an early tremor of what we are seeing today. The exchange rate is a useful barometer of a country's economic prosperity because it reflects the flow of cash into and out of a country. It reflects whether people are buying or selling UK sterling assets. And the scale of the fall in sterling suggests a full-blown fire sale. This morning, every single sterling UK asset is worth 10% less, measured in dollars, and 6% less, measured in euros, than it was last night. Now, you might argue that the pound needs to be lower in the long run, which it probably does. We have a record current account deficit and a worryingly imbalanced economy. The worry is that the scale and speed of the fall smacks of capital flight. That traders were taken completely by surprise by the result of the EU referendum is hardly big news - many in the Leave camp thought they were heading for a resounding loss when the polls closed. But it underlines that today is likely to be a bloody day in markets. The Bank of England is likely to step in soon - perhaps to inject liquidity into the markets, perhaps even to cut interest rates. In the short run, it is in both sides' interests to ensure markets can regain some stability. The problem is that markets are unstable because the sheer range of possible economic outcomes in the coming years is enormous. Does the UK lift its drawbridge, cease immigration and face WTO-sized tariffs on all its trade? Does it stay in the European Economic Area, like Norway, even though that is effectively EU membership in all but name? Most economists think the gap in future prosperity between these two paths is far greater than between being inside the EU and out. And that is before we get on to the questions about who will be Prime Minister, who will be Chancellor, and will the UK exist in its current state in a few years' time? In other words, markets may remain unstable and unsteady for some time, until at least some of these big unknowns are resolved. And the longer that instability lasts, the greater the chance that Brexit spawns its own global financial crisis - a newly independent Britain's first export to the wider world."

It said that the unpredictability of UK decision-making factored into its move, as did the likelihood of lower economic growth. ""During the several years in which the UK will have to renegotiate its trade relations with the EU, Moody's expects heightened uncertainty, diminished confidence and lower spending and investment to result in weaker growth,"" the agency said. Rival ratings agency Standard & Poor's said before Thursday's referendum that Britain stood to lose its AAA credit rating, and Fitch Ratings said on Friday that the vote would be ""moderately negative"". But Moody's was the first to take concrete action after the vote, just as it was in 2013 when it was the first to strip Britain of its AAA rating due to slow growth and rising public indebtedness. Leave supporters have largely dismissed warnings about the economic consequences as scaremongering, and are confident Britain will negotiate trade deals and immigration controls superior to those it already has. But Moody's said leaving the EU was likely to leave Britain, the world's fifth-largest economy, with less money to spend on public services. ""The negative effect from lower economic growth will outweigh the fiscal savings from the UK no longer having to contribute to the EU budget,"" it said. ""The UK government has one of the largest budget deficits among advanced economies, and lower GDP growth will further complicate the implementation of the government's multiyear fiscal consolidation plan,"" it added. The Brexit vote wiped more than $2trn from global equity markets and European stocks ended down 7% - the biggest one day fall since 2008. After a day of turbulent trading, the markets rallied slightly with the FTSE closing down 3.2%. The pound crashed 10% against the US dollar to a 31-year low at one point, before rebounding slightly. The price of gold - a traditional safe haven during volatility - had its best day since 2009 rising 5%."

Knight Frank also said there was a chance mortgage rates could become ""detached"" from the Bank of England base rate, which is currently at 0.5%. :: How UK's Leave Vote Will Affect Your Money Lenders have offered some of their cheapest ever mortgage deals in recent years against the background of low interest rates. But Knight Frank suggested while the base rate could be cut further, lenders could start raising their mortgage rates as a technique to control their lending levels. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, described current mortgage availability as ""good"". But he added: ""When there is uncertainty it affects confidence and people are put off making decisions. ""Those who were thinking about buying property may now decide to leave that decision to, say, next year, in the hope that property prices will fall in the meantime."" Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) said: ""The UK construction industry has been heavily reliant on migrant workers from Europe for decades now – at present, 12% of the British construction workers are of non-UK origin. ""It is now the Government’s responsibility to ensure that the free-flowing tap of migrant workers from Europe is not turned off. ""If ministers want to meet their house building and infrastructure objectives, they have to ensure that the new system of immigration is responsive to the needs of industry."""

Bernard Jenkin, a Tory MP who was a prominent campaigner for Brexit, said the Prime Minister's plan for his successor to invoke Article 50 in the autumn was unrealistic. He warned: ""I think there is a problem just saying 'right, we're not going to do anything between now and October' to address the European Union relationship, because they don't want us hanging around and destabilising all their arrangements. ""They want certainty, and I think we should be able to do this more quickly."" Mr Jenkin's remarks came after senior EU officials warned the trading bloc would not be held ""hostage"" as the Tories conducted a leadership race, with Boris Johnson regarded the front-runner. :: UK Exit: Juncker Calls For Speedy 'Divorce' The uncertainty caused by the decisive result for the Out campaign, which attracted 52% support from voters in Thursday's referendum, has already caused the credit rating agency Moody's to downgrade the UK's long-term issuer and debt ratings from stable to negative. Support for Brexit was unequal across the UK, with the majority of voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland voting to remain in the EU. The shock victory for the Out campaign has prompted the Scottish Cabinet to convene in Edinburgh later today, where they will discuss the Holyrood administration's next steps. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already warned that a second vote on Scottish independence is now ""highly likely"" - and described the prospect of the country being taken out of the EU as ""democratically unacceptable"". :: The Hurdles Sturgeon Faces Before 'Indyref 2' Protesters gathered outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to decry the ""torrent of racism"" unleashed by the lengthy and bitter EU referendum campaign. Organisers for the rally said migrants from the trading bloc should be defended, and added: ""Unabashed, unchecked racist and xenophobic hyperbole has dominated the entire campaign, with migration being defined as a 'problem' or 'crisis', with bigotry being stoked up against migrants, and with EU citizens here being systematically denied a voice."" A petition on the UK Parliament website is calling for a second EU referendum as no campaign attracted more than 60% of the vote, and turnout was less than 75%. More than 500,000 people have already signed, which means it will now automatically be considered by a committee for debate by MPs. :: Live: Shockwaves After Britain Breaks With EU Another campaign has also begun which calls for London Mayor Sadiq Khan to declare London independent from the UK, so the city can apply to join the EU. Although potentially tongue in cheek, more than 100,000 people have already signed the petition in support of ""Londependence"" after most boroughs in the capital voted to remain in the EU.

Scotland's First Minister said she will establish an advisory panel with experts to advise her on legal, financial and diplomatic matters as she seeks to continue Scotland's membership following the Brexit vote. Scotland voted 62 to 38% to remain in the EU in Thursday's referendum, sharply contrasting with Britain's overall 52-48% vote to leave. Speaking outside her official residence in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said her cabinet had agreed to begin work on legislation that would allow for the option of a second independence referendum. :: The Hurdles Sturgeon Faces Before 'Indyref 2' Following a meeting with her cabinet, Ms Sturgeon said: ""We are determined to act decisively but in a way that builds unity across Scotland about the way forward. ""As I said yesterday, a second independence referendum is clearly an option that requires to be on the table and is very much on the table. ""To ensure that that option is a deliverable one within the required timetable, steps will be taken now to ensure that the necessary legislation is in place. Cabinet this morning formally agreed that work."" The First Minister added: ""Cabinet agreed that we will seek to enter into immediate discussions with the EU institutions and other EU member states to explore all possible options to protect Scotland's place in the EU. ""Over the next few days I will establish an advisory panel comprising a range of experts who can advise me and the Scottish Government on a number of important matters - legal, financial and diplomatic."" :: Live: What Do We Do Now We've Gone Brexit? Scottish independence from the UK was rejected by 55 to 45% in 2014. Ms Sturgeon will need permission from Westminster to hold a referendum and there must be public confidence in the currency economic opportunity of an independent Scotland. Opposition parties in Scotland have warned against rushing into a second referendum. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the 1.6 million votes cast in favour of remaining in the EU ""do not wipe away the two million votes that we cast less than two years ago"". She said: ""We do not address the challenges of leaving the European Union by leaving our own Union of nations, our biggest market and our closest friends."" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said fundamental questions asked during the independence campaign, such as those over currency, remained unanswered.   Look up all the results from the EU Referendum and see your local result."

As one minister put it when asked of their ambitions, ""it's all too sensitive and tender"". Leadership hopefuls had been preparing for the possibility of a Cameron resignation, however distant that prospect seemed on the eve of the referendum poll. Theresa May is almost certainly going to go for it, say colleagues. The Home Secretary went with Remain but did not campaign, keeping beneath the parapet in order to emerge as a potential unity candidate it the aftermath of a brutal campaign. Friends of Nicky Morgan have told Sky News that the Education Secretary is also taking soundings on whether to stand, and wants to position herself as the One Nation candidate and torch bearer of Cameron's legacy. Stephen Crabb, the Work and Pensions Secretary, is also emerging as one of the leading Remainers, but don't underestimate the formidable Jeremy Hunt, the ambitious and resilient Health Secretary. :: Live: Nation Reacts To PM's Brexit Resignation On the Leave side, Michael Gove, the Justice Secretary, former London mayor Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Employment Minister, and Andrea Leadsom, the Treasury Secretary, have spent the past five weeks showcasing their leadership skills as the frontmen and women of Vote Leave. In the coming days all must decide whether they can garner enough support in the parliamentary party to stand. :: Who Will Replace Cameron? Runners And Riders Mr Johnson is the bookies' runaway favourite to succeed Cameron and the former London mayor is popular with the grassroots' activists who pick the leader from the two candidates put forward by the parliamentary party. Plenty in Westminster, and his dad Stanley Johnson, believe Mr Johnson is too popular with the public not to get into the final round of the contest. But doubts remain over whether he really is prime ministerial material. Many Conservatives - particularly those on team Remain - are concerned he lacks the gravitas and leadership qualities to take the top job. They also feel rather bruised about the role he played in helping to bring around Mr Cameron's demise. The chief aim is to put to bed those Tory wars and the idea of 'In' and 'Out' MPs running on a double ticket is gaining traction. One MP says that one such dream ticket being talked about is Crabb and Leadsom. Crabb has the ability to appeal to the C2 base, he grew up on a council estate with a single mother. Leadsom is a former City banker who would be well qualified to take up the mantle of Chancellor.   Another, who is a Boris Johnson backer, thinks Michael Gove might try to team up with Crabb.

2016-06-25,Voters defied dire warnings on the economy to back a Brexit – so what will the decision mean for Britain's household finances and their job prospects?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160625182845/http://news.sky.com/story/1716974/how-uks-leave-vote-will-affect-your-money,"Voters defied dire warnings on the economy to back a Brexit – so what will the decision mean for Britain's household finances and their job prospects? Holidaymakers and motorists will be among the first to suffer thanks to the plunge in the value of the pound – while prior to the vote there have also been warnings about the impact of economic uncertainty on jobs, wages, pensions and house prices. The currency moves will mean more expensive trips abroad for UK tourists as their money will not go as far while drivers are to see petrol prices go up as oil – priced in dollars – becomes more expensive in pounds. RAC Fuel Watch spokesman Pete Williams said forecourt retailers were likely to see an increase in the wholesale price of fuel of 1.5p which would be passed on to motorists at the pumps. The result could also have an impact on air fares, with Ryanair's chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs saying they could go up - though it was too early to say for sure. Thomas Cook announced Friday it was temporarily restricting orders in store to £1,000 per customer following a surge for foreign currencies after after the markets plunged into turmoil with tens of billions of pounds wiped off the FTSE 100's value and the pound plunging to a 31-year low against the US dollar. :: What about the economy and interest rates? Some experts are already predicting that Britain will see slower economic growth or even plunge back into recession, echoing a warning by Bank of England governor Mark Carney prior to the poll. Meanwhile, the fall in the value of the pound will push up the prices of all imported goods, putting upward pressure on inflation. Yet a rise in interest rates to keep this in check seems far from likely, with experts speculating instead that they could be cut to zero to help the economy withstand the shock of the Leave result. This would be welcomed by mortgage borrowers and other indebted consumers but spell more pain for savers – who have already been hammered by seven years of interest rates at the historic low of 0.5% following the financial crisis. :: Will wages and jobs suffer? Treasury forecasts – derided by Leave campaigners – predicted that an exit vote would cut wages by an average of £800 a year and cause 820,000 job losses. They also warned of hundreds of billions of pounds being wiped off retirement funds. But what is the reality following the vote? The market carnage that has wiped billions of pounds from the value of the UK’s biggest listed companies does paint a bleak picture about prospects. International banks were among those warning on the future, with Deutsche Bank boss John Cryan saying there was no doubt the consequences ""will be negative on all sides"". Deutsche employs 9,000 people in the UK. Wall Street giant JP Morgan has previously warned of an impact on UK jobs. Meanwhile UK-based telecoms giant Vodafone said on Friday it was ""too soon"" to say what the impact of the vote would be on where it has its headquarters. Elsewhere, the industry body representing big UK drugs firms such as GlaxoSmithKline and Astra Zeneca – in a sector employing 183,000 people and with an annual turnover of £56bn – warned following the vote that its prospects would be tougher. Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said the decision ""creates immediate challenges for future investment, research and jobs in our industry in the UK"". Trade body UK Steel said the vote would send shockwaves through its industry. Others were more circumspect, with German car maker BMW saying it would not speculate on the potential impact on operations in the UK and Ford, with 14,000 workers, saying it would make no changes to its plans ""unless there is clear evidence that action is needed"". :: What about house prices and housing? And pensions? In the property sector, Andy Pyle, UK head of real estate at KPMG, said in the wake of the result that London would see a decline in its position as Europe’s leading financial centre, impacting demand for property in the City in particular. David Thomas, chief executive of house builder Barratt Developments, said while there would be a ""period of uncertainty"" it was confident it could respond to the changes. For life insurance and pensions, Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London asset management, said it expected the UK to fall into recession after the result. He said long terms returns were likely to ""ride out the short-term volatility"" and advised shorter term investors to consult a financial adviser before making any changes."

Foreign ministers from the six original members attended a hastily arranged meeting in Berlin - with the UK not invited. Speaking to reporters afterwards, French minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said it was a ""matter of respect"" that the UK did not ""play cat and mouse"" with its soon-to-be-former partners. David Cameron said yesterday he would leave it to his successor to invoke Article 50, which will start the two-year negotiation of our departure. A replacement is not expected to be in Number 10 until October - but pressure is mounting on the continent for swifter action. Mr Ayrault said: ""There is a certain urgency ...  It is in Britain's interest and in the interest of Europeans not to have a period of uncertainty that would have financial consequences, and that could have economic and political consequences. ""Of course a new (British) prime minister must be appointed, that will probably require a few days but this is quite urgent."" Germany Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier added: ""We join together in saying that this process must begin as soon as possible so we don't end up in an extended limbo period but rather can focus on the future of Europe and the work toward it."" The meeting - attended by France, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg - comes after European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said he wanted Article 50 to be invoked ""immediately"". But German Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted there is no need for European countries to be ""nasty"" once negotiations begin. Gallery: How World Papers Saw Brexit Vote The New Yorker carries a sketch of John Cleese stepping off a cliff Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott said on Saturday there was no rush. ""We don't think there is a need to swiftly invoke Article 50,"" said Mr Elliott. ""It is best for the dust to settle over the summer and during that time for there to be informal negotiations with other states."" On Tuesday EU leaders will open a two-day Brussels summit on the crisis at which a change of direction is likely to be on the agenda. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told reporters Europe must deliver answers on immigration, security and jobs. Meanwhile, Britain's representative on the EU executive in Brussels, Financial Services Commissioner Jonathan Hill, has stepped down. Lord Hill said: ""I don't believe it is right that I should carry on as the British commissioner as though nothing had happened. ""I came to Brussels as someone who had campaigned against Britain joining the euro and who was sceptical about Europe. I will leave it certain that, despite its frustrations, our membership was good for our place in the world and good for our economy."""
2016-06-25,One referendum to settle the matter once and for all. That was David Cameron's pitch to us as voters. We responded and decided. But is it as simple as that? Does a 'leave' vote definitely mean a Brexit?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160625182845/http://news.sky.com/story/1717492/does-a-leave-vote-definitely-mean-a-brexit,"One referendum to settle the matter once and for all. That was David Cameron's pitch to us as voters. We responded and decided. But is it as simple as that? Does a 'leave' vote definitely mean a Brexit? EU officials seem to think so. They are already trying to force the pace. The EU's branches of government want a quickie divorce.  ""I would like to get started immediately,"" said Jean Claude Juncker, European Commission president.  But he can't and no one else can. Only Britain can begin the process of separation, formally, by invoking Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty.  For now it seems, Europe will have to wait and watch politics unfold in Britain. :: So Just How Do You Divorce The EU? David Cameron has complicated things. Having said he is not a quitter, he has decided to quit, or do so in a few months. He will not follow through on his own referendum, saying his successor as Conservative leader will have to do so instead. And there's the rub. People voting to leave may have understandably thought the outcome would be acted on. Well not yet and a lot now depends on politics and diplomacy. Mr Cameron will be replaced by a new Conservative leader and prime minister who will decide how to exercise the manifest will of the majority of the country regarding Europe. Then it all comes down to Article 50. Does Parliament have to approve it and how? It is not entirely clear. Expert opinion differs. The Government has studiously avoided clarification. If it requires a vote, there could be a constitutional crisis. A majority of MPs oppose Brexit. Would they dare defy the outcome of the biggest exercise in democracy in modern British history? Possibly, if they believe they are acting in the best interests of their constituents. That is after all their duty. Secondly, would a new Conservative leader and prime minister be able to remain in power long enough to invoke Article 50, anyway? The Tory majority is a slim one. If Boris Johnson, or Theresa May, or whoever replaces Mr Cameron face difficulties managing that majority, a new general election looms.  Could Europe then intervene? A new offer from the EU at that point could be crucial. The Labour leader could campaign on staying in the EU, on the better terms being offered. They would risk losing the many Labour voters who wanted Brexit but could gain others who want to remain. It would be a single issue election, in effect a second referendum on Europe. If it led to a remain outcome the fallout would be unimaginably messy but Britain would stay in the EU. So far, it has to be said, the EU is showing no sign of wanting to wait and play a tactical game to keep Britain in.  The EU's priority is to maintain stability and prevent a contagion. Logically that requires swift and decisive action. European Parliament President Martin Schulz says he is already consulting lawyers to see if there is a way around Article 50.  And a revised offer from the EU, to help influence British electoral politics down the line, looks problematic. The EU cannot afford to be generous to the UK for fear of encouraging others to follow its lead. Speculative scenarios, with enough ifs and buts to shake a stick at? Certainly. But they illustrate the complexities ahead. We are deep in uncharted territory now; a Bermuda triangle of politics, diplomacy and economics intersecting in the strangest of ways. The old rules of navigation seem to have been upended. But then, aren’t we getting used to that? Look up all the results from the EU Referendum and see your local result."

Earlier, it emerged a German government paper has warned that France, Austria, Finland, the Netherlands and Hungary may follow the UK and leave the EU.

Our children and grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans travelling to the continent, understanding the languages and cultures, that make up of common European civilisation."" He added: ""It is the essence of our case that young people in this country can look forward to a more secure and more prosperous future if we take back the democratic control that is the basis of our economic prosperity."" Mr Johnson, who campaigned against Prime Minister David Cameron, paid tribute to his Tory party leader. He said he was ""sad"" Mr Cameron had decided to stand down, ""but I respect his decision"". Mr Johnson said the PM's ""bravery"" gave the nation its first referendum on the EU, and he described Mr Cameron as ""one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age"". :: David Cameron Resigns After UK Votes To Leave EU Fellow Tory and Vote Leave campaigner Michael Gove, a close friend of the PM, also paid tribute to Mr Cameron, saying he deserved to be remembered as a ""great prime minister"".

Both Mr Johnson and Mr Gove were among more than 80 Tory MPs who had earlier signed a letter saying the Prime Minister had a ""mandate and a duty"" to stay on whatever the result. Neither politicians revealed whether they would be putting their names forward to replace Mr Cameron. Mr Johnson's father, Stanley, a Remain campaigner, suggested earlier that he thinks his son deserved to have his hat in the ring. He told Sky News: ""I think if a man has actually managed to get 17-and-a-half million people to vote for his programme - which he did with the other Brexiteers of course, he certainly deserves a place on the shortlist. At least his name ought to go forward."""

Economists and government leaders have warned the Brexit decision will affect growth prospects for the world's fifth largest economy and make it less attractive to investors. However, the result could discourage Hollywood studios and cable networks from filming in Britain, in part because it will no longer have access to European subsidies. :: UK Exit: Juncker Calls For Speedy 'Divorce' Game Of Thrones is partly filmed in Northern Ireland and the series received support from the EU's European Regional Development Fund in its early years.

""We do not anticipate that the result of the EU referendum will have any material effect on HBO producing Game of Thrones,"" the network said in a statement. As results from Britain's historic referendum came in overnight, speculation spread online that the decision would hurt HBO's most-watched series, which had as many as 20 million viewers per episode last season.

Other international rivals with the United Kingdom around the world will be rattled. China has invested heavily, or at least planned to, using the UK as the bridgehead into Europe's 500 million-person market. Japan has been doing so for years - imagine Sunderland without the added Nissan. Britain's flexible labour market, rule of law, financial services and tradition of entrepreneurism have, for 40 years, meant that it was able to attract non-EU investors keen to muscle in on the mainland's markets. Britain has been seen by EU-outsiders as the broker between German and French competition inside Europe. Its standing in the world has been derived not only from its recent history of empire and Commonwealth connections but also because it has been a major player in the biggest trade bloc on earth. What its place in that market will be in the long term will be the focus of anxious and prolonged negotiation. But there can be no doubt that from Washington to Beijing leaders have been, and will be, shaking their heads with incredulity at what they will see as a bizarre turning inward by a nation that once saw no horizons to its influence. The European Union is now more vulnerable to collapse than ever before. The Danes and Dutch may follow the British into referenda. Fences are going up across eastern Europe where borders were brought down as countries try to control the movement of refugees and migrants. And, of course, the Eurozone still struggles to reconcile vastly different economies among its members. Some may leave the euro, others may have to accept greater fiscal integration. All this adds up to centrifugal weakness in Europe. Italy, Greece, Finland, Sweden, Hungary, France and even Germany are seeing a growth in anti-EU parties. Some, like the French National Front, have enjoyed funding from Russia. Putin has always seen the EU as the greatest rival to Russian power. He has worked hard to weaken it just as it has often provided fuel for his theory that it's an endlessly expansionist organisation biting into areas of traditional Russian influence - like Ukraine. The EU, remember, has imposed the most biting and far-reaching economic sanctions on Russia following its annexation of the Crimea and semi-covert invasion of eastern Ukraine. EU Council president Donald Tusk said soon after the result of the UK's referendum: ""I always remember what my father used to tell me: 'What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger'."" So far, Putin is the only one looking stronger."

However, those remarks have now been contradicted by the French government.  Speaking after the referendum result, French government spokesman Stephane Le Foll said bilateral immigration treaties between Britain and France will not be affected by the Brexit.

Whether they were full-blown crisis talks in the boardroom or an idle five minutes at the water cooler, leaving the European Union will eventually affect every British worker.  The historic decision came as Worcester-based firm Gtech moves into shiny new headquarters on the edge of the city - a bold expansion for a British success story built on cordless vacuums and battery-powered bikes and lawnmowers. Founder Nick Grey launched the company from his home in 2001 and now employs 120 staff. Among the organised chaos of the move, he told Sky News that the EU decision had to be embraced. Mr Grey said: ""Of course it is daunting, it is scary, but running a business is scary - you just have look at the long-term picture - that's just what we as a country have to do. ""All you ask for is a fair playing field and for me the EU legislation, that had become incredibly complicated in some areas, wasn't allowing a fair playing field. ""For me that was one of the reasons why I came down on the side of leaving, I'd like us to be left on our own a little bit more."" Like every other workplace in the UK there have been disagreements at Gtech - and occasional heated exchanges - over the rights and wrongs of divorcing the EU. Several companies had written to their workforce to lay out the benefits for remaining in the EU, and in some instances, the case for leaving. Many organisations have said they respect the result, and do not expect any adverse impacts on trading in the short-term. Others stressed that they remain committed to keeping operations based in the UK. However, there are likely to be complexities faced by the whole business community in the years to come - and swift agreement on what the UK's relationship will be with the EU post-Brexit could prove crucial to keep investment flowing and the economy growing."

He added: ""It is undeniable that the decision to leave has made the task of protecting our citizens more difficult."" Mr Jamieson said the days when criminals operate in a single area or country are long gone. ""Today, criminals are highly mobile, tech-savvy and operate across borders,"" he said. ""Law enforcement should be equally mobile and co-operate across national boundaries to counter the threats we face. ""Terrorists often finance their attacks via organised criminal activities - international crime, therefore, requires an international response."" Mr Jamieson's concerns have been echoed by senior police who say officers must continue to work closely with their foreign counterparts. Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt, vice chairman at the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""Ahead of the EU referendum, we stated our need to work closely with European countries. ""This operational requirement must be maintained as the UK leaves the European Union."" He said the Council would work with ministers ""to ensure we retain our ability to share intelligence, biometrics and other data at speed"". Police are waiting to see how the Brexit vote will affect a number of mechanisms including the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). This a legal framework introduced to speed up the extradition of individuals between member states to face prosecution or serve a prison sentence for an existing conviction. According to the Government, since 2004 the EAW has enabled the UK to extradite more than 7,000 people accused or convicted of a criminal offence to other EU nations."

Responding to his statement, shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News: ""I think it's important that we all put out reassuring messages now. ""I think that his message that Britain is open for business is exactly the right one, but I'm concerned that the economy is fragile as a result of his mismanagement of the economy.

The likes of Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan have made ominous mutterings about relocating jobs elsewhere in Europe. This isn't financiers having a hissy fit; more, potentially, sound business sense. It comes down to ""passporting"" - a regime established in the 1990s whereby a bank setting up in one EU state can open branches or offer services in other states without needing authorisation. Hence many overseas banks set up bases in London, attracted by an favourable tax regime, skilled staff, infrastructure, and a time zone conveniently positioned midway between the US and Far East. Retaining passporting rights is likely to be one of the trickier negotiations we encounter. Some argue that, given the creative nature of multinationals, banks could open a nominal base in another EU state to circumvent the change, while retaining operations in the UK. In reality, though, at least some may choose to move offices and staff elsewhere. With the vote for Brexit arguably seen as a vote against the elites, some might have limited sympathy for a few bankers losing their jobs. But the implications for the wider economy are significant. According to the Bank of England, nearly 170 non-European banks operate in the UK now. In the last 20 years, our trade in financial services has tripled to 3% of GDP. That's more than twice the EU average, and happened despite our decision not to join the euro. We sell roughly £20bn more of financial services to the EU in a year than they sell to us. By comparison, we ran a deficit in our trade in goods with the EU of more than £20bn in the last 3 months. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the services industry accounted for 78.5% of the country's gross domestic product in 2015, of which the financial industry made up 7.6% - accounting for £111bn. There's a lot at stake. The next time you see one of those photos of a trader with their head in their hands, they may have more than the falling pound on their mind."

""As the German equivalent of the CBI - the BDI - has very sensibly reminded us, there will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market."" He went on: ""The only change - and it will not come in any great rush - is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU's extraordinary and opaque system of legislation: the vast and growing corpus of law enacted by a European Court of Justice from which there can be no appeal. ""This will bring not threats, but golden opportunities for this country - to pass laws and set taxes according to the needs of the UK.

""Yes, we will be able to do free trade deals with the growth economies of the world in a way that is currently forbidden."" Mr Johnson also reached out to disappointed Remain voters, saying:  ""There were more than 16 million who wanted to remain. ""They are our neighbours, brothers and sisters who did what they passionately believe was right. In a democracy majorities may decide but everyone is of equal value. ""We who are part of this narrow majority must do everything we can to reassure the Remainers.

We're under pressure from our EU partners to do it quickly, but the timing is entirely up to us."" One of the leading Brexit campaigners, Conservative MP Liam Fox, insisted talks should begin with the aim of the UK leaving the union by the beginning of January 2019. ""What we want to be doing is seeing a process that means we can leave the European Union on 1 January 2019. That seems to me like a reasonable timetable,"" Mr Fox said. The Prime Minister said in the wake of the referendum result that he would step down by October and leave negotiations on Brexit to his successor. To begin the withdrawal process, Britain must invoke Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon treaty, which has never been used before. The EU's summit on Tuesday and Wednesday will discuss the fallout from the British vote and the European Parliament will also hold a special session. US Secretary of State John Kerry is also travelling to Brussels and London today for talks on the future of the EU and the fallout from the vote. A senior official said Mr Kerry would stress the importance of other EU members not following Britain to further weaken the bloc. Mr Schulz's demands came after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no need to be ""nasty"" during talks to discuss Britain's exit. She told a news conference it ""shouldn't take forever"" for Britain to deliver formal notification that it wants to leave the European Union but made it clear that the matter is in London's hands."
2016-06-27,One referendum to settle the matter once and for all. That was David Cameron's pitch to us as voters. We responded and decided. But is it as simple as that? Does a 'leave' vote definitely mean a Brexit?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160627122026/http://news.sky.com/story/1717492/does-a-leave-vote-definitely-mean-a-brexit,"One referendum to settle the matter once and for all. That was David Cameron's pitch to us as voters. We responded and decided. But is it as simple as that? Does a 'leave' vote definitely mean a Brexit? EU officials seem to think so. They are already trying to force the pace. The EU's branches of government want a quickie divorce.  ""I would like to get started immediately,"" said Jean Claude Juncker, European Commission president.  But he can't and no one else can. Only Britain can begin the process of separation, formally, by invoking Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty.  For now it seems, Europe will have to wait and watch politics unfold in Britain. :: So Just How Do You Divorce The EU? David Cameron has complicated things. Having said he is not a quitter, he has decided to quit, or do so in a few months. He will not follow through on his own referendum, saying his successor as Conservative leader will have to do so instead. And there's the rub. People voting to leave may have understandably thought the outcome would be acted on. Well not yet and a lot now depends on politics and diplomacy. Mr Cameron will be replaced by a new Conservative leader and prime minister who will decide how to exercise the manifest will of the majority of the country regarding Europe. Then it all comes down to Article 50. Does Parliament have to approve it and how? It is not entirely clear. Expert opinion differs. The Government has studiously avoided clarification. If it requires a vote, there could be a constitutional crisis. A majority of MPs oppose Brexit. Would they dare defy the outcome of the biggest exercise in democracy in modern British history? Possibly, if they believe they are acting in the best interests of their constituents. That is after all their duty. Secondly, would a new Conservative leader and prime minister be able to remain in power long enough to invoke Article 50, anyway? The Tory majority is a slim one. If Boris Johnson, or Theresa May, or whoever replaces Mr Cameron face difficulties managing that majority, a new general election looms.  Could Europe then intervene? A new offer from the EU at that point could be crucial. The Labour leader could campaign on staying in the EU, on the better terms being offered. They would risk losing the many Labour voters who wanted Brexit but could gain others who want to remain. It would be a single issue election, in effect a second referendum on Europe. If it led to a remain outcome the fallout would be unimaginably messy but Britain would stay in the EU. So far, it has to be said, the EU is showing no sign of wanting to wait and play a tactical game to keep Britain in.  The EU's priority is to maintain stability and prevent a contagion. Logically that requires swift and decisive action. European Parliament President Martin Schulz says he is already consulting lawyers to see if there is a way around Article 50.  And a revised offer from the EU, to help influence British electoral politics down the line, looks problematic. The EU cannot afford to be generous to the UK for fear of encouraging others to follow its lead. Speculative scenarios, with enough ifs and buts to shake a stick at? Certainly. But they illustrate the complexities ahead. We are deep in uncharted territory now; a Bermuda triangle of politics, diplomacy and economics intersecting in the strangest of ways. The old rules of navigation seem to have been upended. But then, aren’t we getting used to that?"
2016-06-27,Several bidders for Tata Steel's British operations are close to abandoning talks with their Indian owner as the outcome of the EU referendum threatens to deepen the crisis enveloping the UK's biggest steel producer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160627122026/http://news.sky.com/story/1717499/tata-steel-bidders-get-cold-feet-over-brexit,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor Several bidders for Tata Steel's British operations are close to abandoning talks with their Indian owner as the outcome of the EU referendum threatens to deepen the crisis enveloping the UK's biggest steel producer. Sky News has learnt that the billionaire tycoon Wilbur Ross, who is among seven bidders shortlisted for Tata Steel's UK business, has signalled that exiting the EU would diminish the prospects of him pursuing a takeover. A number of other prospective buyers are understood to have similar concerns about the potential impact of Brexit on global demand for steel, the robustness of new trade deals negotiated by the Government, and the ability to sell steel produced in the UK in the European single market. ""Wilbur has been reasonably open that this deal is far less attractive if Brexit happens,"" said a person who has discussed the Tata Steel situation with Mr Ross. Sources said this weekend that Tata Steel, which employs roughly 11,000 people in the UK, had raised the possibility of putting its British business into some form of liquidation, although they added that no decisions had been taken. The company owns the vast Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales as well as smaller sites across the country. The remaining bidders for Tata Steel's UK operations have been told by advisers to the company that they will be updated early next week on its intentions, according to a person close to the situation. Prior to the referendum, Tata Steel had indicated to the Government that it was leaning towards retaining the bulk of its UK business, aided by a support package comprising an equity injection, loans and a possible restructuring of the British Steel Pension Scheme. However, the vote to leave the EU has made that outcome less likely, a source said. If Tata Steel did elect to walk away from its British operations - and found it impossible to sell them - the decision would escalate the industrial crisis confronting a key manufacturing sector as well as the political crisis facing Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary. Sources said they doubted that Mr Javid now had the political clout to push through the legislative changes needed to restructure the steelworkers' pension scheme, particularly after strong objections raised by the Pension Protection Fund. In trading in Mumbai on Friday, soon after the result of the UK's referendum on EU membership was confirmed, Tata Steel shares closed down nearly 6.5%. It remains possible that the Indian group's board will still be able to secure a buyer for its British operations, with other parties including the management of the Port Talbot site and JSW Steel, another Indian company, assembling offers. Mr Ross has joined forces to bid for Tata Steel's operations with Endless, a firm which specialises in reviving struggling businesses. ""Decisions by the UK electorate will always be respected by Tata Steel,"" a company spokesman said. ""Whatever the political framework, we are committed to developing the best prospects possible for our UK operations."" Earlier this week, Sky News revealed that Tata Steel was courting buyers for two British units employing nearly 2,000 people, fuelling speculation that the Indian-owned company could retain the bulk of its UK business under a deal with the Government. Tata's speciality steels division and its pipeline tube operations - which operate at sites in Hartlepool, Rotherham and Stocksbridge near Sheffield - have been put up for sale independently of the wider auction."

Economists and government leaders have warned the Brexit decision will affect growth prospects for the world's fifth largest economy and make it less attractive to investors. However, the result could discourage Hollywood studios and cable networks from filming in Britain, in part because it will no longer have access to European subsidies. :: UK Exit: Juncker Calls For Speedy 'Divorce' Game Of Thrones is partly filmed in Northern Ireland and the series received support from the EU's European Regional Development Fund in its early years.

The victory came after Gareth McAuley scored an own goal following a teasing Gareth Bale cross during the match at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Wales claimed most of the possession in the match and spent much of the second half on the front foot, but were unable to break down Northern Ireland's resilient defence. The match was locked at 0-0 until the 75th minute, when Bale's cross was deflected into the net by McAuley. It was a cruel blow for the Northern Irish, who had more than held their own in the encounter but lacked the quality to craft enough opportunities.  Wales will now face Hungary or Belgium in the last eight in Lille on Friday.  ""They were better than us today really,"" said Wales coach Chris Coleman. ""They played very well. We showed a lot of heart, a lot of courage. We showed another side to our game. ""We hung on and we came through. It is a fantastic achievement."" Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis added: ""We gave it everything and we can't have any regrets. I am disappointed in the manner that they scored. ""He (McAuley) didn't deserve that because he has been excellent."""

Sterling reached a 31-year low against the dollar, below Friday's nadir, at $1.32. It fell more than 3%, on top of the plunge of up to 10% witnessed after last week's referendum. The FTSE 100 was down by more than 100 points, or 1.65%, despite a better than expected opening. The FTSE 250, which is a better indicator of the health of UK businesses than the more global FTSE 100, fell even more sharply, down 5%, or 825 points. Bank and property stocks continued to be hammered as investors singled out the sectors most likely to be hit by leaving the EU. Trading in RBS and Barclays shares was suspended briefly after falls of more than 10%. RBS was trading down 16% at lunchtime, which will make the government's target for revenue from its sale practically impossible.  Given Monday morning's stock movement, the taxpayer's entire 73% stake in the bank is now worth less than £18bn. The FTSE 100 appeared to be reassured slightly after Chancellor George Osborne intervened early on Monday in an attempt to reassure markets and limit further turmoil - saying he would do everything he could to make Brexit work for Britain. He admitted that while it would not be plain sailing in the days ahead, Britain's financial system would help to prevent further shocks and there would be no rush for the EU exit without a clear plan.  However, the respite was short-lived, and the market lost ground, along with the pound, which seemed to have stemmed its losses in the morning.  On Friday, the pound slumped to its lowest level since 1985 after initially climbing steeply on the back of early suggestions that Remain would win. Global stock markets lost about $2tn in value. The FTSE 100 fared better than most - closing 3.2% down on Friday.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her party's board that as far as the markets were concerned, the EU no longer seemed governable. Hong Kong stocks lost ground in the first few minutes of Monday's trading. The Hang Seng Index fell 1.36%, or 276 points but Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index was up 2.34% - having dived nearly 8% on Friday in its biggest one-day plunge since Japan's 2011 earthquake-tsunami disaster. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency meeting with top officials in the morning to discuss Brexit and how to deal with the market fallout amid a fresh rush for the safe haven yen. Japan could intervene in a bid to bring down the value of its currency if it is seen as too much of a threat to its export-led economy. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that what happens next depends on how policymakers handle the fallout in the coming days. :: Boris Johnson Insists Pound And Markets Are Stable Economic risks, she said, depend on the level of uncertainty. ""How they come out in the next few days is going to really drive the direction in which risk will go."" George Soros, the billionaire famed for netting $1bn for himself and his investors by betting against the pound in 1992, said he did not speculate against sterling ahead of the EU vote. He had warned then that the pound could fall as low as $1.15 in the event of a Leave vote."

So am I. The reason for their departures was summed up by Ms Turley, who cited a ""lacklustre referendum campaign"" as being among the reasons that ""it has become clear to me beyond doubt that you and your team are not providing the strong, forward looking and competent leadership we need to provide an alternative government to these increasingly right-wing Conservatives"". Mr Perkins wrote that the party ""urgently needs a change at the top"", adding: ""To allow (the Labour Party) to risk the catastrophe it will surely face if you lead us into the General Election campaign, would be a betrayal of my members, constituents and the wider country"". Ms Forvargue said that she doesn't believe the party ""can connect with all areas of the country"" under Mr Corbyn's leadership. Sky's Political Correspondent Tamara Cohen, described the new shadow cabinet as ""a very very new and quite inexperienced team...but they're determined to get on with it"".

Eight children and two adults were hurt after the Tsunami ride crashed to the ground at M&D's amusement park at Strathclyde Country Park in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, on Sunday. The injured were trapped upside down when the ride came off the rails at around 3.40pm, according to witnesses. Four of the children are being treated at the Royal Hospital for Children. Three of them are in a serious condition, and one is described as stable. Five other patients were taken to Wishaw General Hospital. Three children and one adult are in a stable condition, and another child has been discharged, a spokesman confirmed. The other injured adult is in a stable condition at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Details of the injuries have not been released, but an unconfirmed report in the Scottish Sun newspaper said a girl aged 12 was in a coma after suffering what was believed to be serious head injuries. The ride was full when the accident happened.

""When we got there the rollercoaster had come off the track entirely. (It) was upside down on the concrete path."" Six ambulance crews, a specialist operation team and emergency doctors worked at the scene. Chief Inspector David Bruce said: ''Along with other emergency services we attended immediately and on arrival it became clear that a series of five gondolas connected on a train on the Tsunami ride have detached from the rails, struck the superstructure and then struck the ground. ''We have launched an investigation and an inquiry between Police Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)."" THE THEME PARK IS CLOSED! A serious incident occurred today involving the tsunami rollercoaster. All emergency services on site to assist! He added: ''They (the gondolas) fell less than 20 feet. It would appear that they have been coming round a bend and at that point it has detached."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ''My thoughts are with everyone involved in this terrible incident at M&D's theme park, especially those injured.'' A spokesman for the theme park's operators M&D's said: ''As a family-run business, our thoughts are with those who have been injured and their families. ""We wish everyone a full recovery. ''We are co-operating fully with Police Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on their joint investigation to ascertain the cause of the accident.'' According to the M&D's website, the Tsunami rollercoaster can go at speeds of up to 40mph through corkscrew turns and loops. Children under 10 are not allowed on the ride, and under 14s must be accompanied by an adult. The Tsunami ride is described on the theme park's website as ""Scotland's only inverted rollercoaster"". Nine people had to be rescued from the Tsunami rollercoaster in July 2011 after it suffered a mechanical failure.

Footage showed several passengers, including children, sliding to the runway at Terminal 3. Ross Hiscock, who was on another flight, said he saw smoke coming from the aircraft when the doors were opened. ""I wondered if it was normal, whether it was just exhaust fumes,"" he said. ""Then the door opened on the right side of the aircraft and crews deployed slides from the rear and the middle of the plane. ""Next we wondered whether it was a drill, but then we saw they were real passengers. I saw at least one carrying a child. ""It all happened in a matter of seconds. Everyone seemed to be okay."" American Airlines said about 25 people had used the slides to leave the plane, while the rest of the passengers and crew had exited using the jet bridge. Heathrow said the ""technical issue"" had been resolved."

Former Conservative chairwoman Baroness Warsi told Sky News that race hate crime organisations had reported some ""disturbing early results"". And she blamed the ""divisive and xenophobic"" leave campaigning during the EU referendum. Prime Minister David Cameron's spokeswoman said on Monday that he wanted to be ""absolutely clear that this Government will not accept intolerance"". Boris Johnson, the leading figurehead of the Leave campaign, also sought to address EU migrants' fears and concerns.

It is absolutely clear that people from other European countries who are living here, have their rights protected. ""All that people want to see is a system that's fair, impartial and humane to all people coming from around the world."" Police are investigating a report of an ""alleged racially-motivated"" attack on a Polish community building in London and hate notes posted through the doors of Polish residents in Cambridgeshire. Baroness Warsi attacks 'xenophobic' campaign There were also scores of accounts of post-Brexit racism being posted on social media. One woman tweeted how her daughter saw a Muslim woman surrounded by a gang of men in Birmingham telling her to ""get out, we voted leave"". Speaking to Sky's Dermot Murnaghan, Lady Warsi said she wanted leave campaigners ""to come out and say that the campaigning was divisive and was xenophobic and give a commitment that future campaigning and the way that they intend to run this country will be united, will make people from all backgrounds feel like they belong"". She added: ""I've spent most of the weekend talking to organisations, individuals and activists who work in the area of race hate crime, who monitor hate crime, and they have shown some really disturbing early results from people being stopped in the street and saying look, we voted Leave, it's time for you to leave. ""And they are saying this to individuals and families who have been here for three, four, five generations. The atmosphere on the street is not good."" A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed there had been graffiti sprayed on the doors of the Polish Social and Cultural Association in Hammersmith, west London, on Sunday morning. A spokesman said: ""We were informed of an incident of alleged racially-motivated criminal damage to a building in King Street.  ""Officers attended and enquiries are ongoing."" While Cambridgeshire Police were investigating laminated cards being posted through doors in Huntingdon carrying the message: ""Leave the EU - no more Polish vermin."" During campaigning Nigel Farage was roundly lambasted for his ""Breaking Point"" poster showing a snaking queue of refugees in Europe, saying the UK needed to take control of its borders. It prompted Lady Warsi to announce her support for the remain campaign having previously backed leave."

If this was the case she would ""of course"" think about calling on MSPs to stop it. :: Sturgeon: Indyref 2 Option Very Much On Table However, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said he did not think the Scottish Parliament would be ""in a position to block Brexit"". But he said there would be another independence referendum if that was what the people of Scotland wanted. North of the border, some 62% of people voted to stay in the EU, while across the UK 52% backed leaving. In the wake of the Brexit vote, Ms Sturgeon said a second independence referendum was ""highly likely"" and she would seek to enter into ""immediate discussions"" with Brussels to ""protect Scotland's place in the EU"". Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan programme, Ms Sturgeon said: ""A second independence referendum in these circumstances would not just be a rerun of the 2014 one because the context has totally changed. ""The UK that we voted to remain within in 2014 does not exist anymore."" :: The Hurdles Sturgeon Faces Before 'Indyref 2' The SNP leader said the UK was in ""uncharted territory"" following the outcome of the EU referendum. With laws passed by Holyrood required to comply with European legislation on human rights, she was pressed on the issue on BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The issue you're talking about is whether there would require to be a legislative consent motion, or motions in the Scottish Parliament for the legislation that extricates the UK from the European Union. ""Looking at it from a logical perspective I find it hard to believe that there wouldn't be that requirement, I suspect the UK government will take a very different view on that and we'll have to see where that discussion ends up."" :: UK Should Start Brexit By Tuesday - EU Chief When asked if she would consider asking the Scottish Parliament not to back a motion for legislative consent, she stated: ""Of course, if the Scottish Parliament was judging this on the basis of what's right for Scotland then the option of saying we're not going to vote for something that is against Scotland's interests, of course that is on the table."" She said she could imagine the ""fury"" such a move could cause in England, but added: ""It is perhaps similar to the fury of many people in Scotland right now as we face the prospect of being taken out of the European Union against our will."" But Mr Mundell insisted: ""We have to respect the result on Thursday, even if we don't like it. ""I personally don't believe the Scottish Parliament is in a position to block Brexit."" The Brexit vote, in which Northern Ireland backing Remain by 56% to 44%, has also led to calls by Sinn Fein for a border poll on Irish unity.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is examining PwC's conduct in relation to the audit of financial documents in the year to 30 August 2014, the year before Sir Philip Green sold the business for a £1. The FRC has already carried out a preliminary investigation, which confirmed a ""suspicion of misconduct"" and paved the way for a formal investigation. If this investigation does confirm misconduct on PwC's part, the case will go to an independent tribunal and be argued in court. Should the FRC's findings be upheld, PwC could face unlimited fines or costs, and individuals could be barred from working as an auditor. A PwC spokesperson said: “We will co-operate fully with the FRC’s investigation.” The high street giant went into administration in April, putting some 11,000 jobs at risk with the closure of up to 164 stores. The retailer's collapse leaves the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) – the ""lifeboat"" funded by a levy on other retirement schemes – having to shoulder the burden of a £571m BHS pension black hole. The Department for Work and Pensions, and the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Select Committees are currently investigating the sale and collapse of BHS, and there are separate probes by the Insolvency Services and Pensions Regulator. The inquiry hearings have often been stormy, with no love lost between former owner Sir Philip and Dominic Chappell, who headed Retail Acquisitions Limited (RAL), which bought BHS in 2015. The roles of administrators Duff and Phelps, and investment giant Goldman Sachs have also been scrutinised closely."

After slumping to a fresh 31-year low against the dollar on Monday, sterling was just under a cent up on the greenback at $1.33. The FTSE 100 opened 1.6% up - with every constituent in positive territory - after a 2.6% fall for the index in the previous session. The declines witnessed on both Friday and Monday meant almost £100bn had been wiped from its market value since the referendum result was known. Banks, house-builders and airline stocks have felt most of the pain. The FTSE 250, which is a better indicator of the health of UK businesses than the more global FTSE 100, lost 14% of its value in the same two-day period. It opened 3% higher on Tuesday. Stocks in France and Germany also saw gains in early deals - with the CAC and DAX both up by around 2%. Trading on markets in Asia was reported to be light following the intense activity witnessed on Friday and Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.9% while Japan's Nikkei 225 closed fractionally higher on hopes of a fresh stimulus package from the Japanese government. Commenting on the situation Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities, said ""Short-covering in the currency market and US futures market is limiting selling. ""But overall sentiment remains fragile"", he added. The referendum result, being largely unexpected by markets, has massively contributed to the jitters that were already evident about the state of the world economy. Uncertainty over the potential impact on Britain and the EU from a Brexit - along with the resulting political crisis in the UK - has sparked warnings that companies and even governments will delay investment. Ratings agency Standard and Poor's stripped the UK of its top AAA credit rating on Monday evening, arguing that the vote ""will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the UK"". Sky News later reported that rival Moody's was likely to revise its outlook on the ratings of UK banks."

The UKIP leader said they should be ""grown up"" and accept Britain’s decision to leave the EU after 43 years. He also warned the UK would not be the last country to quit the 28-member bloc. Offering a tongue in cheek ""thank you for the warm welcome"", Mr Farage said: ""When I came here 17 years ago and said I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union you all laughed at me. ""Well I have to say you're not laughing now are you?"" During a highly-charged session, Mr Farage declared: ""The reason you are so upset, the reason you are so angry, has been perfectly clear from all the angry exchanges this morning: you are in denial. ""You are in denial that your currency is failing,"" he said. ""You are in denial over Mrs Merkel's call last year for as many people as possible to cross the Mediterranean into the European Union, which has led to massive divisions between countries and within countries. ""But the biggest problem you have got... is that you have, by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe, you have imposed upon them a political union."" Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, now an MEP, retorted: ""Lets be positive, finally. We gonna get rid of the biggest waste in the European Union... your salary.” Mr Farage made his comments after the President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, rounded on UKIP members, asking them: “Why are you here?” ""We must respect British democracy and the way it has expressed its view,"" he said to rare applause from the UKIP group. He went on: ""That's the last time you are applauding here... and to some extent I'm really surprised you are here. ""You are fighting for the exit. The British people voted in favour of the exit. Why are you here?"" Mr Juncker went on to say he was banning any informal and secretive negotiations on Britain's departure from the EU. He told the special session in Brussels: ""I want the UK to clarify its position, not today, not tomorrow at 9 am, but soon. We cannot allow ourselves to remain in a prolonged period of uncertainty."" In the meantime, he said there will be no secret meetings between UK, national governments and commissioners in the corridors. ""I ban that."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will use ""all her strength"" to prevent the EU drifting apart in the wake of the Brexit vote. In an address to the German parliament, Ms Merkel said she expects Britain will want to maintain ""close relations"" with the EU once it leaves. But she also signalled it could not expect a business-as-usual approach. ""Whoever wants to leave this family cannot expect to have no more obligations but to keep privileges,"" she said. :: UK Stripped Of Top Credit Rating After Brexit Prime Minister David Cameron will face EU leaders for the first time since the referendum when they meet in Brussels later. He is expected to urge them and EU institutions to be ""constructive"" about negotiations over a new relationship between the UK and Europe. However, he will reject calls to trigger the formal process for Britain to leave the EU - insisting it is a matter for his successor, who may not be in place before 2 September. Earlier, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who may run for the Conservative leadership, has suggested Britain could hold another vote on the leaving the EU. He said the next Prime Minister should be allowed to ""negotiate a deal"" with Brussels that the public can have a say on through a second referendum or a general election."

That is an increase of £4.6m on the previous financial year. But the Queen and the Royal Family's official travel costs to the taxpayer fell more than £1m to £4m. The single most expensive trip was taken by the Prince of Wales, whose two-day journey in September from Scotland to Yorkshire on official business cost taxpayers more than £33,000, royal accounts showed. Buckingham Palace and the Government are reviewing the amount of money the Queen receives each year from the Treasury. It comes at a time when new figures reveal that the Crown Estate - a £12bn property portfolio including Regent Street and Ascot racecourse - has made a record annual profit of £304.1m. That money goes to the Treasury, but the Queen receives a Sovereign Grant of 15% of the estate profits, paid two years in arrears. It means the amount she receives under that grant would rise to more than £45m in 2017. The Crown Estate owns nearly all of Regent Street in London Every five years, the Palace and the Government review the formula for calculating the grant, and that is being discussed in this financial year. It is unclear what effect the Brexit vote will have on the review, as it involves the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister, who will be replaced by the autumn. The Queen has seen a 38% rise in the money she receives in the Sovereign Grant in recent years. Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sir Alan Reid, said that despite the investment they are making, the condition of the estate was deteriorating at a faster rate than they have been able to respond to. He said a significant part of the current grant will be used to increase the annual works programme to tackle the backlog in essential maintenance. Meanwhile, Prince Charles' income from his private Duchy of Cornwall estate of lands, buildings and financial investments has increased by 3.1% to £20.5m. His tax bill increased by £531,000 to just over £5m. The Duchy of Cornwall owns assets such as London's Oval cricket ground, and has the Isles of Scilly in its portfolio. The estate is given to the heir to the throne and is made up of 132,518 acres of land across 23 counties, mainly in the south-west of England. Prince Charles also received £1.4m from the Sovereign Grant and government departments last year."

The result, unexpected to all but the most pessimistic, is defeat and a shock exit from Europe. The outcome is so abject that the man in charge is left with no choice but to resign before the result has really sunk in with the public. Sound familiar? After last week's political earthquake there was always a chance Euro 2016 would become an extended metaphor for the political carnage at home. So it has proved, though England's defeat to Iceland was so abject that even the architects of self-inflicted Brexit might object to comparison with Eng-xit. Any prospect of the football providing light relief from the graver issues of state disappeared in Nice as Iceland, a country of just 330,000 souls, reduced the cream of the richest football nation on earth to panic and confusion. We have seen England labour in the heat of major tournaments regularly over the last decade, but here they were exposed, not just by their own failings, but the stature of the opposition. Chelsea's Gary Cahill is distraught at the final whistle In the World Cup two years ago England foundered on the rocks of Italy and Uruguay, world-class teams with tournament pedigree. Iceland offered no such built-in excuse. The smallest nation ever to reach these finals with not a single fully professional club, against a nation of 53 million with four professional leagues. Gallery: Iceland Send Woeful England Crashing Out Of Euro 2016 After Wayne Rooney had put England ahead, Iceland equalised before Kolbeinn Sigthorsson put the minnows ahead after 18 minutes Modest journeymen by comparison to their Premier League peers, Iceland were organised where England were off-the-cuff; cool and composed while Roy Hodgson's side panicked. For that, responsibility must primarily lie with Hodgson. He has had four years to shape the side and receives more than £3m a year for doing so, yet they arrived in France long on youthful promise but short on an identifiable plan. A decent, cerebral fellow, he has not been quite the caricature of a man out of time, that some would paint. On his watch he has managed the progression from a squad led by experienced hands like Steven Gerrard to a younger, and outwardly more exciting, youthful group. Yet he arrived in France (at a lavishly-appointed base in Chantilly declared ""the best ever"") without apparently being clear of his best starting team, or how they would adapt to circumstance. The players must share responsibility, but this was a failure of planning and execution rather than effort. Take England's two most reliable international players, Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart.  One found himself playing in centre-midfield for the first time for England weeks before the tournament; the other missed routine saves for two of the goals England conceded. Hodgson's resignation solves one short-term problem for the Football Association but the tougher issues remain, including who will replace him. There is a shortage of English candidates and no-one obvious. Eddie Howe of Bournemouth has one season of Premier League survival behind him, Gareth Southgate a so-so record with the under-21s, Alan Pardew an itinerant career at middle-ranked clubs on his CV. The bigger question is the same one the FA faced, one way or another, since the sepia days of 1966. How to capture the huge financial power and enthusiasm for English football to ensure that it has a national side to match the expectations of its public. If civil servants struggling to deal with Brexit fancy light relief, they might turn their minds to Wembley and reflect that it could be worse."

A total of 172 MPs voted for the motion with 40 MPs voting against with a turnout of 95%. Sky's Faisal Islam said that there was a rush at the end of the voting period with several of Mr Corbyn's supporters registering their vote in the House of Commons in a bid to send a message that he will run in a leadership election if challenged. The channel's senior political correspondent Sophy Ridge says that Labour deputy leader Tom Watson and former shadow business secretary Angela Eagle are currently meeting. It is believed the pair are the most likely to attempt a leadership challenge. The vote is not binding on Mr Corbyn to stand down as Labour leader but will pile further pressure on him after more than 40 members of his shadow cabinet and ministerial team resigned over the weekend and on Monday. Gallery: Who's Gone From Labour's Frontbench? Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health Luciana Berger Islam said the MPs who voted against him are gambling that the huge majority Mr Corbyn received during the last leadership election will not be there following the UK's vote to leave the EU. He said: ""For many, he didn't do enough in this European referendum.... His ambivalence, his lack of enthusiasm for the European union helped create among a certain Labour voter a bit of confusion ... and that has motivated a move like this. ""The bigger point is the prospect of a Boris Johnson-led Conservative Party and the possibility of a general election has fired the parliamentary Labour Party into action. ""They have laid down the gauntlet now to the membership and the calculation comes down to this - has the Labour membership changed."" Mr Corbyn responded quickly with a statement that said: ""I was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60% of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning. ""Today's vote by MPs has no constitutional legitimacy. ""We are a democratic party, with a clear constitution. Our people need Labour party members, trade unionists and MPs to unite behind my leadership at a critical time for our country."" Shortly after his statement, three more shadow ministers and two parliamentary private secretaries became the latest on his team to resign. Former Home Secretary Jack Straw described the current crisis as the worst to affect the party since at least 1935, if not ever.  He said: ""Mr Corbyn's position is wholly untenable. The Labour Party exists to implement its values through a parliamentary majority and to its members of Parliament. ""Whatever electoral system you have, if Members of Parliament of your own party lose confidence in you, to this degree and this publicly that you cannot continue as a leader."" Labour MPs began voting in the non-binding secret ballot at 10am on Tuesday. :: Why Won't Jeremy Corbyn Step Down? Earlier, video showed an awkward first meeting for Mr Corbyn's new cabinet.

Hodgson brought on Jack Wilshere, Jamie Vardy and Marcus Rashford in the second half but England rarely threatened to score. The manager's contract was due to expire after the tournament and he confirmed he would quit in his post-match press conference, where he read a pre-prepared statement.

""My contract was always up after the Euros, so now is the time for someone else to oversee the progress of this young, hungry and extremely talented group of players."" Hodgson confirmed his assistants Ray Lewington and Gary Neville would also be leaving their roles. Iceland, the surprise package of the tournament, will now face hosts France in the quarter finals. England fans outnumbered those from Iceland in the stadium and in Nice's Place Massena but their team gave them very little to cheer about. England fan Wayne Johnstone, 47, from Manchester, said: ""At the end of the day, we just couldn't get a goal. It's just heartbreaking. ""My fiancee is French and I was hoping we'd win and there would be a game between England and France in the quarter-final but it isn't to be. ""I won't hear the last of it when I get back. I'll be in for plenty of stick."" Joe Fowler, from Bradford, said: ""England were absolutely shocking. They don't deserve to be at the tournament. Every round they've played, they've been diabolical. They do not play as a team and it's upsetting."" The Football Association backed Hodgson's decision and said it would imminently start the process to find his successor. Bookies installed Gareth Southgate - currently manager of England's U21 side - as the favourite to take over."

""Looking at it from a logical perspective I find it hard to believe that there wouldn't be that requirement, I suspect the UK government will take a very different view on that and we'll have to see where that discussion ends up."" :: UK Should Start Brexit By Tuesday - EU Chief When asked if she would consider asking the Scottish Parliament not to back a motion for legislative consent, she stated: ""Of course, if the Scottish Parliament was judging this on the basis of what's right for Scotland then the option of saying we're not going to vote for something that is against Scotland's interests, of course that is on the table."" She said she could imagine the ""fury"" such a move could cause in England, but added: ""It is perhaps similar to the fury of many people in Scotland right now as we face the prospect of being taken out of the European Union against our will."" But Mr Mundell insisted: ""We have to respect the result on Thursday, even if we don't like it. ""I personally don't believe the Scottish Parliament is in a position to block Brexit."" The Brexit vote, in which Northern Ireland backing Remain by 56% to 44%, has also led to calls by Sinn Fein for a border poll on Irish unity. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has urged the NI Assembly and Irish government ""to uphold the vote of the electorate in the north to remain in the EU""."

Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns is believed to have murdered the 14-year-old from Ealing, west London, in a sexually motivated attack before taking his own life. Zalkalns had previously served a prison sentence for killing his wife in his native country and Ros Hodgkiss, Alice's mother, said the family ""remain stunned"" he was able to come to the UK. ""It is impossible to express the devastation that we still feel at Alice's death,"" Ms Hodgkiss said, reading from a statement. ""We have many unanswered questions. We will never know exactly what happened on that day."" Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox ruled last year that the inquest, being held at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, would examine whether failures by the British Government and police contributed to Alice's death. Ms Hodgkiss said the family was ""extremely grateful"" that possible failures were ""going to be explored"". ""We want to reiterate that the reason for these questions is so that we can establish whether or not the systems for monitoring foreign offenders and cross-border sharing of information are robust,"" she said. ""We appreciate that they may have changed significantly, but we remain stunned that a foreign national with a conviction for murder was not monitored, or even known about in any way. ""This has destroyed much of our faith in our country's ability to protect its citizens. ""The Home Office and the police forces nationwide should be doing everything they can to ensure that this should not be allowed to happen again."" Ms Hodgkiss said her daughter was ""witty, smart and academic but she could also push boundaries"". ""In this way she was no different to any normal teenager,"" she said. ""She was independent and like many teenagers of her age she enjoyed shopping, cinema and attending parties with her friends. ""She could also at times be shy and under-confident and she cared a lot about what other people thought of her."" Alice's body was found in the River Brent, tied up and weighted down with bricks, logs and a bicycle wheel, a little over a month after she went missing from home. Pathologist Ashley Fegan-Earl told the inquest that ""compression asphyxiation"" was the most likely cause of death. Zalkalns was found dead in a park less than a week after Alice's body was found and police said he would have been charged with murder had he not died."
2016-06-28,"A controversial far-right politician in the Netherlands has warned EU leaders that ""punishing"" the UK for Brexit will damage the EU more than Britain.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160628160554/http://news.sky.com/story/1718486/eu-warned-against-punishing-uk-for-brexit,"By Tom Rayner, The Hague, Netherlands A controversial far-right politician in the Netherlands has warned EU leaders that ""punishing"" the UK for Brexit will damage the EU more than Britain. It comes ahead of a crucial summit in Brussels where discussions about how to handle Britain's departure from the EU will get under way. In an interview with Sky News, Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigration Freedom Party, said ""the europhiles were beaten by the British people, I hope that they are not seeking revenge"". ""I think that will not happen because they will hurt themselves maybe even more than they will hurt Britain,"" said Mr Wilders. Around half of Dutch voters would like an EU referendum, polls suggest ""It's a big economy, the third trading partner with countries like Germany and France - if you punish them you punish yourself, and the people are fed up with playing political games."" His comments reflect the dilemma, and division, that will be at the heart of the discussions in Brussels in the coming days. Those who prioritise preventing Brexit contagion, will likely advocate taking tough steps that could act as a deterrent to anti-EU sentiment elsewhere - such as in France, Italy and Austria - by demonstrating that ""out means out"". But others have indicated they favour a more negotiated approach, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel warning against hasty actions, saying there was ""no need to be particularly nasty in any way"". Mr Wilders was one of the first to celebrate the Brexit vote when the result became clear last Friday. In a post on Twitter he said: ""Hurrah for the British! Now it is our turn. Time for a Dutch referendum."" The demand for a so-called ""Nexit"" referendum will be a central plank of his party's campaign ahead of a general election in the Netherlands next year. Current polling suggests the Freedom Party could win the largest number of seats, even though it would be unlikely to be part of a government due to other parties ruling out a coalition with Mr Wilders. But pro-EU politicians in the Netherlands have claimed the chaotic fallout since the results of the British referendum may already be changing opinions. ""It's not good, obviously as we can already see, for stability in the UK,"" said former ambassador and Dutch Labour Party MP, Marit Maij She added: ""It's not good for the Netherlands, and it's not good for Europe. We think a referendum like this in the Netherlands would bring a lot of insecurity."" She told Sky News the impetus was now on Britain to set out what Brexit will look like, and for the EU to focus more on proving to voters around Europe that it can be reformed to serve them better. A poll published on Sunday by peil.nl found that while 50% of Dutch voters currently favour a referendum, compared to 47% who do not, a narrow majority of people would vote to stay in the EU if a vote was ever held."
2016-06-28,Several bidders for Tata Steel's British operations are close to abandoning talks with their Indian owner as the outcome of the EU referendum threatens to deepen the crisis enveloping the UK's biggest steel producer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160628160554/http://news.sky.com/story/1717499/tata-steel-bidders-get-cold-feet-over-brexit,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor Several bidders for Tata Steel's British operations are close to abandoning talks with their Indian owner as the outcome of the EU referendum threatens to deepen the crisis enveloping the UK's biggest steel producer. Sky News has learnt that the billionaire tycoon Wilbur Ross, who is among seven bidders shortlisted for Tata Steel's UK business, has signalled that exiting the EU would diminish the prospects of him pursuing a takeover. A number of other prospective buyers are understood to have similar concerns about the potential impact of Brexit on global demand for steel, the robustness of new trade deals negotiated by the Government, and the ability to sell steel produced in the UK in the European single market. ""Wilbur has been reasonably open that this deal is far less attractive if Brexit happens,"" said a person who has discussed the Tata Steel situation with Mr Ross. Sources said this weekend that Tata Steel, which employs roughly 11,000 people in the UK, had raised the possibility of putting its British business into some form of liquidation, although they added that no decisions had been taken. The company owns the vast Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales as well as smaller sites across the country. The remaining bidders for Tata Steel's UK operations have been told by advisers to the company that they will be updated early next week on its intentions, according to a person close to the situation. Prior to the referendum, Tata Steel had indicated to the Government that it was leaning towards retaining the bulk of its UK business, aided by a support package comprising an equity injection, loans and a possible restructuring of the British Steel Pension Scheme. However, the vote to leave the EU has made that outcome less likely, a source said. If Tata Steel did elect to walk away from its British operations - and found it impossible to sell them - the decision would escalate the industrial crisis confronting a key manufacturing sector as well as the political crisis facing Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary. Sources said they doubted that Mr Javid now had the political clout to push through the legislative changes needed to restructure the steelworkers' pension scheme, particularly after strong objections raised by the Pension Protection Fund. In trading in Mumbai on Friday, soon after the result of the UK's referendum on EU membership was confirmed, Tata Steel shares closed down nearly 6.5%. It remains possible that the Indian group's board will still be able to secure a buyer for its British operations, with other parties including the management of the Port Talbot site and JSW Steel, another Indian company, assembling offers. Mr Ross has joined forces to bid for Tata Steel's operations with Endless, a firm which specialises in reviving struggling businesses. ""Decisions by the UK electorate will always be respected by Tata Steel,"" a company spokesman said. ""Whatever the political framework, we are committed to developing the best prospects possible for our UK operations."" Earlier this week, Sky News revealed that Tata Steel was courting buyers for two British units employing nearly 2,000 people, fuelling speculation that the Indian-owned company could retain the bulk of its UK business under a deal with the Government. Tata's speciality steels division and its pipeline tube operations - which operate at sites in Hartlepool, Rotherham and Stocksbridge near Sheffield - have been put up for sale independently of the wider auction."

The likes of Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan have made ominous mutterings about relocating jobs elsewhere in Europe. This isn't financiers having a hissy fit; more, potentially, sound business sense. It comes down to ""passporting"" - a regime established in the 1990s whereby a bank setting up in one EU state can open branches or offer services in other states without needing authorisation. Hence many overseas banks set up bases in London, attracted by an favourable tax regime, skilled staff, infrastructure, and a time zone conveniently positioned midway between the US and Far East. Retaining passporting rights is likely to be one of the trickier negotiations we encounter. Some argue that, given the creative nature of multinationals, banks could open a nominal base in another EU state to circumvent the change, while retaining operations in the UK. In reality, though, at least some may choose to move offices and staff elsewhere. With the vote for Brexit arguably seen as a vote against the elites, some might have limited sympathy for a few bankers losing their jobs. But the implications for the wider economy are significant. According to the Bank of England, nearly 170 non-European banks operate in the UK now. In the last 20 years, our trade in financial services has tripled to 3% of GDP. That's more than twice the EU average, and happened despite our decision not to join the euro. We sell roughly £20bn more of financial services to the EU in a year than they sell to us. By comparison, we ran a deficit in our trade in goods with the EU of more than £20bn in the last 3 months. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the services industry accounted for 78.5% of the country's gross domestic product in 2015, of which the financial industry made up 7.6% - accounting for £111bn. There's a lot at stake. The next time you see one of those photos of a trader with their head in their hands, they may have more than the falling pound on their mind."
2016-06-28,"The Government's fiscal watchdog is to slash its forecasts for revenues from the sale of shares in Britain's bailed-out banks, leaving the Treasury facing a post-referendum black hole in the public finances.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160628160554/http://news.sky.com/story/1718202/obr-to-slash-forecast-for-rescued-bank-stakes,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The Government's fiscal watchdog is to slash its forecasts for revenues from the sale of shares in Britain's bailed-out banks, leaving the Treasury facing a post-referendum black hole in the public finances. Sky News has learnt that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will project a significant cut in the sums that the Government will raise from disposing of stakes in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) during this parliament. The OBR said in March that George Osborne, the Chancellor, could expect to generate £21.5bn from the sale of RBS shares alone between 2016-17 and 2019-20. However, that forecast looks virtually impossible to achieve given that on Monday morning, shares in RBS had slumped to a level which meant that the taxpayer's entire 73% stake in the bank was now worth less than £18bn. Shares in RBS and Barclays was halted briefly on Monday morning after falling sharply, while bank shares across European markets plunged amid continuing fears about the impact of the UK's decision to leave the EU. The OBR will provide its next update on the likely revenue from bank sales either alongside an emergency budget - although Mr Osborne appeared to retreat on Monday from his pre-referendum suggestion that one was inevitable - or the Autumn Statement later this year. Whether it will be Mr Osborne who delivers that statement is unclear, after he signalled that he would provide an update on his future ""in the coming days"". David Cameron's successor as Prime Minister is likely to be in place by October, with speculation that Mr Osborne could yet decide to serve in an administration led by Boris Johnson.  The Treasury has already been forced to slash its forecast for the expected proceeds from the sale of RBS shares. In last November's Autumn Statement, it predicted it would generate £30.8bn from selling RBS stock by 2020-21 - a figure which is now larger than RBS's entire market value. Last August, the Chancellor  sanctioned the sale of a 6% stake in RBS, raising £2.1bn, but the transaction's crystallisation of a £1bn loss for taxpayers has prompted demands for an inquiry. On Monday, RBS shares were trading at around 179p, barely one-third of the 502p average cost of the holding bought by the then Labour government nearly eight years ago. Mr Osborne has already been forced to postpone plans for an offering of Lloyds Banking Group shares to ordinary investors, with plans for an autumn sale now certain to be abandoned. Bank analysts said that in total, the shortfall facing the Treasury across this parliament could be well over £10bn compared to the anticipated revenues from bank sales. The Chancellor has confirmed that he is seeking to sell the remnants of the Bradford & Bingley loan book in a series of transactions aimed at recouping ""sufficient proceeds for B&B to repay the £15.65bn debt to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and, in turn, the corresponding loan from the Treasury"". That process is also likely to be delayed."

Labour MP Paula Sherriff told the Commons that the leaflets said Mrs Cox, who was shot and stabbed in Birstall on 16 June, had been ""helping Muslims in the country who may now go on to join ISIS, alongside some other horrendous allegations"". ""Then I have received a significant number of communications from constituents, one - a seven year-old Muslim girl - was told on Friday (the day the EU referendum result was confirmed), I've removed the expletives from this for the purpose of this House, 'it was the best day ever today, go home all of you' to her and her family.""

Reluctantly attending a valedictory media appearance he was a walking warning for the toll that the job takes on even the most experienced, and every answer was laced with a disappointment that runs deep. The day after a tournament exit is the toughest press conference any England manager has to give but it comes to them all in the end, assuming they've been good enough to get England to a finals. Sven Goran Eriksson was the last to face the media in such circumstances a decade ago. That was the day after a World Cup quarter-final defeat on penalties to Portugal, and some thought that was bad. Hodgson made no secret of the fact he did not want to be there. It was the first thing he said, a sign of admirable honesty, but also the occasional tin ear that means he is sometimes misunderstood. But having been persuaded to answer questions after only a statement in the wake of elimination, he spoke plainly. He said he felt ""fragile"" after a long night, and spoke of his shock at elimination. ""I'm disappointed because I didn't see it coming. Nothing in our first three games gave me an indication that we were going to play that poorly, but we did."" He touched also on the personal price for a failure that may cost him the respect he believes he is due for a distinguished itinerant career, as well as the young players who now share the taint of failure that marked the previous generation.  ""One particularly bad game has caused a lot of damage to me personally and the team going forward. We have a major bridge to repair - had we played better last night that might not need repairing."" Throughout this tournament Hodgson has clung to the view that performances have not been matched by results, and that his changes - cast by some as indecision - have delivered all but goals. But Hodgson knows results are the yardstick of football management, never more so than in major tournaments for a manager with three lions on his blazer pocket. When I asked him if he felt he had laid out a clear plan that the players delivered on, his answer was both clear, and laced with emotion. ""That depends whether the analysis is based on performance or results, and if it is based on results then the answer has to be no, but over the three games, we played some very good stuff from box to box and didn't take our chances."" Delivering results is now someone else's problem and the Football Association will begin a recruitment process led by chief executive Martin Glenn, advised by technical director Dan Ashworth and Manchester United director David Gill. Glenn said he will conduct a review into why England are ""brittle"" and ""fail to punch our weight"" at the sharp end of tournaments, but he will not limit his managerial candidates to Englishmen. He said he wanted the best man for the job and that may mean a foreigner, given the lack of stand-out English candidates in the limited field of Premier League coaches. Gareth Southgate, currently under-21 coach, may be asked to takeover on a temporary basis while the credentials and enthusiasm of others is assessed. Arsenal's Wenger has been targeted by the FA in the past, Claudio Ranieri's cheerful, wise inspiration of Leicester will have been noted, and Jurgen Klinsmann may feature on a long-list, though even in its impoverished state the English game may balk at a German. Whoever it is eventually would do well to talk to Hodgson first, and to watch back his last official act as England manager. It should remove any illusions, as well as setting the benchmark for how much they need to care."

His decision to bat for the Leave campaign was seen by many as a political gamble which, if successful, would have seen him replace his former Eton chum as Prime Minister. :: Gove's Bombshell: He'll Stand For Tory Leader Gallery: Gallery: Who Will Succeed David Cameron? Home Secretary Theresa May declared herself a remain supporter but did little, if any, campaigning. Vastly experienced at senior level, she says she is ""ready and able to do the job"" In a dramatic press conference just moments before the midday deadline for nominations passed on Thursday, Mr Johnson said that the next Tory leader would have to unite the party and country. Citing his own credentials, Mr Johnson said he was immensely proud of what his team had achieved in the capital at City Hall. He said the UK's Brexit vote was a chance for the country's next leader to ""restore Britain's standing as an independent sovereign"" and ""our moment to stand tall in the world"". But then he added: ""My friends, you have waited for the punchline of this speech. ""Having consulted colleagues and in view of the circumstances in Parliament, I have concluded that person cannot be me."" There were audible gasps from Tory MPs and journalists in the room as he made the revelation. Moments later, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of senior Tory backbench MPs, confirmed Mr Gove, Home Secretary Theresa May, former defence secretary Liam Fox and MPs Stephen Crabb and Andrea Leadsom as the official leadership contenders. The first sign of any tension between Mr Gove and Mr Johnson was exposed in an email from the Justice Secretary's wife, journalist Sarah Vine, who warned her husband about the risks of backing the former London mayor without ""specific assurances"" about his role in any Johnson-led Cabinet. This was cemented when Mr Gove took a swipe at Mr Johnson when he declared his intention to stand in the contest, saying: ""Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead."" Sky's Political Editor Faisal Islam described the move as an ""Et tu, Brute?"" moment. Justice Minister Dominic Raab who backed the joint ticket of a Mr Johnson bid supported by Mr Gove, said the ex-London mayor's ""cavalier"" attitude had scuppered the plan. The party needed a ""unity figure who can bring people together and ultimately put a team together"", he told Sky News. ""Until the 11th hour Michael Gove was committed to doing that with Boris. It hasn't happened and some of the reassurances that we had had about turning a dream ticket into a dream team didn't materialise."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""Boris follows the Bullingdon playbook: you break it and someone else has to fix it."" Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have both ruled themselves out of the race, with Mrs Morgan backing Mr Gove and Mr Hunt throwing his support behind Mrs May. The first round of voting will take place on Tuesday, with the contender with the least votes eliminated at each round until two front runners emerge and a new party leader is chosen by 9 September."

Brad Treat died on Wednesday afternoon on a trail in the Halfmoon Lakes area of the Flathead National Forest. Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry said Mr Treat was with another person when they surprised the bear, which knocked him off his bike. The second rider was not injured and went to get help. The body of Mr Treat, who worked for the US Forest Service, was found at the scene, but the bear has not been located. Mr Curry said: ""Brad was an integral member of our area law enforcement team and a friend to us all."" Mr Treat grew up in nearby Kalispell and was an outstanding distance runner in high school, his former coach said. ""He was a really good runner but he was also a kind-hearted person who cared about people,"" Paul Jorgenson told the Flathead Beacon newspaper. Before this attack there had been 10 bear-related human deaths in Glacier since the park was created in 1910. The last was in 1998, when three bears killed and partially ate a park employee while he was hiking."
2016-06-30,The Labour Party has descended further into chaos with more resignations and growing uncertainty over a potential leadership contest.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160630223705/http://news.sky.com/story/1719726/labour-descends-deeper-into-chaos-and-confusion,"The Labour Party has descended further into chaos with more resignations and growing uncertainty over a potential leadership contest. Angela Eagle was strongly expected to run against Jeremy Corbyn and was due to announce her candidacy at 3pm on Thursday. But, as the hour came and went, there has been no word from the former business secretary. Ruth Smeeth leaving the conference Meanwhile, MP Rob Marris resigned from his role in the shadow Treasury team during the committee stage hearings on the Finance Bill. It is thought Ms Eagle's decision to wait is designed to give Labour rebels more time to intensify the pressure on Mr Corbyn to quit of his own accord. But Sky sources say there is some concern among Labour MPs about Angela Eagle's voting record on supporting the Iraq war and airstrikes in Syria, ahead of the release of the Chilcot report next week. Some support is understood to have been building around Owen Smith, who resigned as shadow work and pensions secretary, as an alternative candidate. Sky's Darren McCaffrey said that he has been told MPs will now make the decision about who will run against Mr Corbyn on Monday. But the confusion occurred on a day during which Mr Corbyn was accused of making ""offensive"" comments at the launch of a Labour party inquiry into anti-Semitism. The Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said that rather than rebuilding trust among the Jewish community, the Labour leader had caused ""even greater concern"". His comments came after Labour MP Ruth Smeeth stormed out of the launch of a report into anti-Semitism in the party. Ms Smeeth was accused of colluding with The Daily Telegraph by a member of Momentum, the group that provides political support to Mr Corbyn. She said that the attack on her was an anti-Semitic remark. ""I was verbally attacked by a Momentum activist and Jeremy Corbyn supporter who used traditional anti-Semitic slurs to attack me for being part of a 'media conspiracy',"" she said. ""It is beyond belief that someone could come to the launch of a report on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and espouse such vile conspiracy theories about Jewish people."" She said that previously she had not been an opponent of Mr Corbyn but as the Labour leader ignored the criticism of her in the meeting, ""the fact that he failed to intervene is final proof for me that he is unfit to lead."" The Labour leader was also forced to deny comparing Israel and Islamic State after telling those attending the event that Jews were ""no more responsible for the actions of Israel"" than Muslims were for the ""various self-styled Islamic states or organisations"". Sky's Darren McCaffrey was repeatedly ignored when attempting to ask questions in the meeting and was forced to ask one without being allowed a microphone. When he did get to ask Mr Corbyn a question about the leadership, he was shouted down by the leader's supporters and told to show some ""respect"". Mr Corbyn ignored the anti-Semitism controversy when he later released a statement on Twitter, and still refused to stand down. He said: ""United we stand, divided we fall is one of the oldest and truest slogans of the labour movement. ""Labour has the responsibility to give a lead where the Government will not. We need to bring people together to hold the Government to account. ""To do that we need to stand together. Since I was elected leader of our party nine months ago, we have repeatedly defeated the Government over its attacks on living standards. ""I was elected leader of our party, for a new kind of politics, by 60% of Labour members and supporters. The need for that different approach is now greater than ever. ""As leader, it is my continued commitment to dedicate our party's activity to that goal."" In a further instance of disarray, the tweet with the statement - in which Mr Corbyn's name was spelled incorrectly - was later deleted before being retweeted with the correct spelling. The review into anti-Semitism, carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, found the Labour Party ""is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism"". It was commissioned in the wake of controversial remarks about Jews made by former London Mayor Ken Livingstone. Ms Smeeth later tweeted that Ms Chakrabati apologised ""unreservedly for the way I was treated at her press conference"". Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has said he will not run against Mr Corbyn but has been attempting to persuade him to move aside, on Wednesday describing his party as being ""in peril"". Former leaders Ed Miliband, Gordon Brown and Harriet Harman have also joined calls for Mr Corbyn to quit. The big four unions that back the Labour Party have said they recognise the need for a leadership contest but will continue to support Mr Corbyn. On Tuesday night, following mass resignations from the shadow front bench, 172 Labour MPs backed a vote of no confidence in him, with just 40 voting against. On Wednesday, Mr Corbyn was attacked in the Commons by David Cameron during PMQs, with the Prime Minister telling him: ""For heaven's sake man, go."" Meanwhile, author and former Labour donor Robert Harris has urged people who are concerned about what is happening to the party to become members to vote Mr Corbyn out."

Police say 26-year-old Krystin Lisaius and Somchai Lisaius, 42 - both TV presenters - were indicted on charges of possession of a dangerous drug, drug paraphernalia and child abuse on 9 June. The four-month-old baby was taken to hospital on 15 May after being breast-fed and appearing to be unwell. Mrs Lisaius said the child was like a ""rag doll"" whose ""eyes would roll up"", according to a police report on the incident. Test revealed cocaine in the child's body. Neither parent is in custody and both can reportedly visit the child Authorities found nearly 2g of ""white powder or white residue"" at the couple's Oro Valley home, KOLD-TV reports. They made their first appearance in court on Monday. Mrs Lisaius worked at KGUN-TV, while 42-year-old Mr Lisaius was a reporter for Tucson News Now. The baby is now living with a relative, but remains in the custody of the state children's services department. Neither parent is in custody and both can reportedly visit the child. Hospital staff noticed the baby's parents were acting strangely when their baby was admitted, local media report. According to a report from Oro Valley Police Department, they ""did not want any lab work performed on the child"". The couple allegedly left a different hospital earlier that day when staff asked to do a blood test. According to Mr Lisaius' former employer, Tucson News Now, they eventually agreed to a urine test, which revealed the drug's presence in their baby's system. Mrs Lisaius said she had breast-fed her child about 12 hours after using the drug, local media report. But she told authorities she did not think it would harm the child. They will next appear in court on 28 July."

Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office released tapes of 911 calls from the Houston-area house where 42-year-old Christy Sheats fatally shot her two daughters on Friday afternoon. In one call, a woman is heard crying: ""Please! Forgive me! Please! Don't shoot!"" After a scream, she cries: ""Please! I'm sorry! Please! Don't point that gun at her!"" Christy Sheats (L) with daughter, Taylor The gunwoman's husband, Jason Sheats - who was unharmed in the attack - is heard saying: ""I promise you, whatever you want."" The call is then disconnected. In another call, a neighbour describes 17-year-old Madison Sheats and 22-year-old Taylor Sheats lying fatally wounded in the street outside their home. The neighbour describes Christy Sheats kneeling over her eldest daughter and shooting her dead. Taylor Sheats with her father Jason In a news conference on Wednesday, Sheriff Troy Nehls told reporters that Christy Sheats had a history of depression and suicide attempts and was about to divorce her husband. ""We asked Mr Sheats for a motive in his own words,"" Sheriff Nehls said. ""He stated that he felt Christy wanted him to suffer."" Sheriff Nehls said Christy Sheats had ""ample time and opportunity to shoot and kill Mr Sheats in the home, but she chose not to"". He added: ""Mr Sheats stated that Christy knew how much he loved Taylor and Madison and how much they loved him. ""By killing his children, Mr Sheats will have to live the rest of his life with this horrible memory."" Christy Sheats (R) and Madison Sheats The sheriff said the marriage had been in a ""downward spiral"" since 2012 when Christy Sheats' grandfather, who raised her, died. The shootings happened on Mr Sheats' birthday and on the week the couple's eldest daughter was to get married. Sheriff Nehls said the final straw came when Christy Sheats had tried to ground Taylor after a quarrel and prevent her from seeing her fiance. Mr Sheats had told his wife she could not ground their 22-year-old daughter just days before her own wedding. A family friend said the mother had inherited the gun from her great-grandfather. An officer killed Christy Sheats after she refused orders to drop her gun. Sheriff Nehls said the unidentified officer has had a ""difficult time"" since the shooting. According to Christy Sheats' Facebook page, she was a gun rights advocate and had posted comments about how much she loved her family. ""It would be horribly tragic if my ability to protect myself or my family were to be taken away,"" she posted in March, as she railed against proposed gun control. In another post, she said: ""Happy Daughter's Day to my amazing, sweet, kind, beautiful, intelligent girls."""

Charaf Elmoudden went to the singer's four-bedroom house in northwest London on 28 November last year and made off with a stash of expensive shoes, phones, computers and a designer bag, Harrow Crown Court heard. The former X Factor judge called the police and said she would ""f*** up"" the burglar after he woke her sister Elena up rifling through her bedroom. Ora and her sister were asleep upstairs at the semi-detached home they share with their parents when two men broke in to the three-storey house. Elmoudden and an accomplice allegedly made off with designer goods and electronics which included iPhones, Apple Mac computers, a Fifty Shades Of Grey handbag worth £2,682 and a Louis Vuitton bag, the court heard. Charaf Elmoudden He was picked out in a line-up by Elena three months after the burglary, jurors were told. Elena told the jury she confronted an intruder and he ""looked dead in my eyes"". Ora gave evidence from behind a screen during the trial and the court was also played a frantic 999 call from the star. In it, she sobbed ""I don't have a knife"" and threatened to kill the thieves. She was heard screaming ""Don't you f****** come up these stairs. I will f*** you up - you f****** hear me?"" after locking herself in her room with her sister. Elmoudden has a number of previous convictions including for trying to sell pictures of the body of a dead Harry Potter actor. He had denied being involved in the burglary but police discovered £3,500 in cash ""hidden"" in an envelope in a sofa bed at his home on Sydney Road, Muswell Hill, north London, at the time of his arrest in January. He was found guilty with a majority verdict of 10 to two of burglary. Ora was not present at court for the verdict."

With Mr Cameron potentially not stepping aside until October, there is plenty of time for those with leadership ambitions to garner support. Here are the runners and riders: :: Boris Johnson Popular with the public, the former London mayor has spent years trying to deflect questions about his leadership ambitions - and hasn't always been successful. His decision to bat for Leave was seen by many as a political gamble which, if successful, could see him replace his former Eton chum as Prime Minister. He is now favourite with all the bookies. :: Theresa May Seen by many as the main rival to Mr Johnson after a successful stint at the Home Office. Ms May backed Remain - but did so in a less provocative way than many of her senior Tory colleagues and was careful not to alienate either side. Would be a popular choice within the party. :: George Osborne Many believe the Chancellor - once viewed as a likely successor to Mr Cameron - irreparably damaged his chances of moving from Number 11 to Number 10 with his doomsday warnings that a Leave vote would result in a ""Brexit budget"" containing cuts and a tax hikes. You can now get odds of 30-1. :: Michael Gove The Justice Secretary was considered by Number 10 to be ""toxic"" among the electorate after being removed from his education post in 2014 - but his position at the heart of the Leave campaign has put him among those being talked about. Has repeatedly said he has no leadership ambitions. :: Nicky Morgan The woman who replaced Mr Gove as Education Secretary is said by Sky sources to be sounding out the level of support she would receive for any leadership bid. From the left of the party, Ms Morgan would continue the Cameron legacy. She told Sky News: ""To be considered to be the leader would be an enormous privilege."" Opposition to Brexit appears to make her a long shot. :: Andrea Leadsom Brexit-supporting Ms Leadsom was tipped as ""one to watch"" within the party after entering Parliament in 2010. The former City high-flyer was appointed Energy Minister after the general election and her pro-Brexit stance has made her fourth favourite with most bookmakers at 12-1. :: Other contenders Priti Patel, Stephen Crabb, Sajid Javid, Ruth Davidson and Philip Hammond all have the potential to throw their hat in the ring."

The Justice Secretary, who had repeatedly said he had no leadership ambitions, dropped the bombshell just hours before the midday nominations deadline on Thursday. His surprise declaration was seen as a devastating blow for Mr Johnson, who was expected to stand with the backing of Mr Gove and who shortly afterwards equally stunned Tory MPs and journalists by declaring he would not be standing in the contest.  :: LIVE: Gove And May Join Tory Leadership Race The pair campaigned side by side during the EU referendum campaign to secure the shock Brexit victory. But Mr Gove said events since last week had ""weighed heavily with me"" and led him to change his mind. :: Who Will Replace Cameron?

""In particular, I wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future. ""But I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. ""I have, therefore, decided to put my name forward for the leadership. ""I want there to be an open and positive debate about the path the country will now take. ""Whatever the verdict of that debate I will respect it. ""In the next few days I will lay out my plan for the United Kingdom which I hope can provide unity and change."" Sky's Political Editor Faisal Islam described the move as an ""Et tu, Brute?"" moment. :: Boris Johnson: I'm Not Running For Leadership Just weeks ago, during a live Sky News TV interview ahead of the EU referendum, he had insisted ""count me out"" and told voters: ""I'll tell you this, whatever posters you put up on your wall, don't put one up of me. ""I'm not the sort of person you want to have when you wake up, on your bedroom wall."" However, on the eve of the nominations deadline, in a leaked email his wife, journalist Sarah Vine, warned him about the risks of backing the former London mayor without ""specific assurances"" about his role in any Johnson-led Cabinet. Minutes after Mr Gove declared his bid, another Brexiteer, Andrea Leadsom, announced she was throwing her hat into the ring also, tweeting: ""Let's make the most of the Brexit opportunities!"" And she was swiftly followed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who pledged to unite both the Conservative Party and the country. ""My pitch is very simple: I'm Theresa May and I believe I'm the best person to be Prime Minister,"" she said. ""We need a bold new positive vision for the future of our country - a country that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us."" Gallery: Gallery: Who Will Succeed David Cameron? Home Secretary Theresa May declared herself a remain supporter but did little, if any, campaigning. Vastly experienced at senior level, she says she is ""ready and able to do the job"" Mrs May backed Remain - but did so in a less provocative way than many of her senior Tory colleagues and was careful not to alienate either side. In a move to garner the support of the eurosceptics in her party, she asserted: ""Brexit means Brexit ... there must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door and no second referendum. ""The country voted to leave the European Union and it is the duty of the Government and Parliament to make sure we do just that."" In a clear swipe at Mr Johnson, Mrs May said politics was not a ""game"" and added: ""It's a serious business that has real consequences for people's lives."" She said there should be no general election until 2020 and no ""Brexit budget"", adding Article 50 - which sets into motion the two-year window for leaving the EU - should not be triggered before the end of this year. ""You can judge me by my record,"" she said. ""We have immediate work to do. Together, we, the Conservative Party, can build a better Britain."" Asked if there would be a job for Mr Johnson in her Cabinet if she were to win, she replied: ""I am being clear I am not going around offering jobs to individuals of any sort."" She also brushed off comparisons with Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel as a woman aspiring to lead her country, saying: ""Whether it's a woman or a man, what counts is the quality of the individual."" Today I launch my campaign to be our next PM. Please read & share my vision of a country that works for everyone: https://t.co/TqTTz0hlIz TM Mrs May later joined Twitter and unveiled the slogan ""a country that works for everyone"" as she posted her first message. On Wednesday, former defence secretary Liam Fox and the Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb - whose running mate is Business Secretary Sajid Javid - put themselves forward. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who had both previously indicated they were considering a bid, ruled themselves out of the race and said they would be backing Mrs May and Mr Gove, respectively."

The F-35B Lightning II - the world's most advanced stealth combat aircraft - arrived on British soil for the first time overnight at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. It was flown by RAF pilot Squadron Leader Hugh Nichols on its maiden nine-hour transatlantic crossing. Ther state-of-the-art fighter jet was accompanied by two United States Marine Corps F-35B aircraft from their training base at Beaufort, South Carolina. The combined British and American team of aircrew and engineers are in the UK to demonstrate just what the supersonic aircraft can do. Aviation enthusiasts will be able to catch a glimpse of them when they are showcased at the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough International Air Show over the coming weeks. The aircraft is due to enter service with the Royal Navy and RAF from 2018. The F-35 has three main models. The F-35A is a conventional take-off and landing variant, the F-35B is a short take-off and vertical-landing variant and the F-35C is a carrier-based variant. According to the RAF, The Lightning II design ""applies stealth technology manufacturing techniques to minimise its radar signature"". ""It will put the RAF at the forefront of fighter technology and will give it a true multi-role aircraft that will surpass the majority of other weapons systems in production today, or envisaged in the foreseeable future."" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ""The F-35Bs are the most advanced fast jets in the world. ""Whether operating from land or from one of our two new aircraft carriers, they will ensure we have a formidable fighting force."""

Despite making 32 recommendations, the report said the outcomes of care at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children were ""broadly comparable"" with other specialist units for children with heart conditions. The chair of the review, Eleanor Grey QC, said: ""What we've tried to do, in order to be accountable and transparent, about our work is not only publish the main report - which tries to look at the system on a systemic basis - but also to produce 27 individual reports for families to try and answer their concerns and questions personally."" Stephen Jenkins is the recipient of one of those reports. His son Luke died four years ago, aged seven, whilst receiving treatment for congenital heart disease. Mr Jenkins told Sky News that the response to their son's cardiac arrest was panicked and disorganised and that had he received better care, he may still be alive. He described the report as ""very poor"" and Luke's individual report as ""really weak"". He said: ""It's just disheartening really - from looking at this individual report it seems to be that they've just collated evidence that was already supplied through the inquest and not as independent as I thought it would be. University Hospital Bristol NHS Foundation Trust which manages the hospital said that it accepted the recommendations. Chief Executive Robert Woolley said: ""I would like to say to say how sorry I am to those families where the review has found that our care fell below acceptable standards were we didn't listen to their concerns and we didn't give them the information that they needed in a full and timely fashion. ""We haven't waited for the review to come out today, we've invested millions in new medical and nursing staff over the last three years, new facilities and equipment."" In 2001 a separate review at the same hospital exposed a failing system which lead to children unnecessarily dying. The latest review found that there was no evidence to suggest failing in care on the same scale. Recommendations include: recording conversations with clinicians, implementing a framework for dealing with child deaths and carrying out a nationwide review into paediatric intensive care units."

Speaking during a visit to Canada, the US President said he expected the global economy to stay steady in the short term after Brexit - but he warned there could be trouble later. Mr Obama said the priority for Britain and Europe should be to work on a clear plan to reassure nervous populations and businesses that deal with the EU. He said: ""My main message to David Cameron, Angela Merkel and others is everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand. :: Obama Says UK Special Relationship Will Endure ""Obviously leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved for it to move as crisply and as effectively as it needs to."" Acknowledging the turbulent week for markets and currencies since the historic referendum, Mr Obama said preparations by central banks, finance ministers and the US treasury secretary had kept the financial system on an even keel. But he added: ""I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole. :: Obama: UK-US Trade Deal Would Be Back Of Queue ""At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help."" The President backed Mr Cameron's Remain campaign when he visited the UK in April. He warned that Britain would be ""in the back of the queue"" for a new trade deal if it left the 28-member bloc. But since the referendum result Mr Obama has moved to reassure Britons about the future.  He said: ""While the UK's relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is special relationship that exists between our two nations. ""That will endure. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners."""
2016-06-30,"My Local has been placed in administration, with more than 1,000 jobs lost through the closure of 93 stores.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160630223705/http://news.sky.com/story/1719549/my-local-buyer-sought-but-1000-jobs-are-lost,"My Local has been placed in administration, with more than 1,000 jobs lost through the closure of 93 stores. It was confirmed on Wednesday night that the convenience store operation, which was created through the sale of Morrisons' chain of smaller stores just nine month ago, was now in the hands of KPMG. The administrator said while 93 of the 125 stores were shutting their doors, the rest would be kept open while a buyer was sought. My Local had employed 1,658 people ahead of the announcement but it is hoped that many of those losing their jobs will be able to take up work at Morrisons. When it emerged last week that My Local was on the verge of collapse, the supermarket chain said staff who had transferred to the convenience chain from Morrisons could have roles at its stores. My Local was bought by Greybull Capital for £25m last year in a deal fronted by retail entrepreneur Mike Greene, who appeared on Channel 4 show The Secret Millionaire. He said: ""The last nine months has been one of the toughest retail trading periods that I have ever experienced and My Local has faced intense competition. ""The management team has been unable to return the business to profitability. For that I am truly sorry. ""We will continue to support the administrators in their efforts to safeguard as many jobs as possible."" Mark Orton, partner at KPMG and joint administrator at My Local, said: ""Management have faced tough trading conditions and despite their best efforts to improve performance, My Local was ultimately unable to return to viability. ""Although the majority of stores have now closed, we are in active discussions with a number of interested parties in relation to both the remaining 32 premises that are trading and a small number of those that have closed."" The collapse of My Local is the latest blow to the UK's retail sector following the failures of BHS and Austin Reed - with the fallout from the EU referendum adding to fears for the high street. On Tuesday, the owners of fashion firm Store Twenty One said they would push for a restructure that could result in store closures and job losses."
2016-06-30,CCTV images have emerged of two of the men believed to have carried out Tuesday's bombings at Ataturk airport in Istanbul which killed 42 people.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160630223705/http://news.sky.com/story/1719590/cctv-images-of-istanbul-bombers-released,"CCTV images have emerged of two of the men believed to have carried out Tuesday's bombings at Ataturk airport in Istanbul which killed 42 people. One attacker detonated his explosives downstairs at the arrivals terminal, while another went upstairs and blew himself up in the departure hall. The third waited outside for the fleeing crowd before setting off the final bomb, Turkish officials said. The bombers have yet to be identified The director of the CIA has said the attack ""bears all the hallmarks"" of Islamic State (IS). Istanbul's governor's office said more than 230 people were wounded and dozens remained in a critical condition. At least 13 of the victims were foreigners and several people remain unidentified. Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim has revealed the bombers were initially thwarted by airport security. ""When the terrorists couldn't pass the scanners, police and security controls, they returned and took their weapons out of their suitcases and opened fire at random at the security check,"" he said. :: Turkey Attack Exposes Challenge Of 'Soft Targets' As the chaos unfolded, terrified travellers were sent running, first from one explosion and then another. Airport surveillance video showed a crowd of people, some rolling suitcases behind them, stampeding down a corridor, looking fearfully over their shoulders. Other surveillance footage posted on social media showed terrified passengers racing for cover from a ball of fire that followed one of the blasts. Another video showed an attacker blowing himself up seconds after being shot by a security officer. One passenger, Cihan Tunctas, said he had just got off a flight from Azerbaijan when he heard the sound of gunfire. ""Then the bomb exploded. We were at the exit and ... the roof collapsed on our heads,"" he said. ""The group tried to escape, but their path was blocked by the arrival of a second attacker. ""Two of the security guards noticed him. They walked towards him. ""They just caught him and at that moment he detonated the bomb."" Investigators later found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a handgun and two grenades on the attacker's bodies, according to the state-run Anadolu news service. Police who raided two addresses also discovered encrypted organisational documents and computer files, the agency said. Gallery: Explosions Hit Istanbul Airport Broken windows are pictured at the attacks and explosions site in Ataturk airport's international arrivals terminal, a day after a suicide bombing and gun attack targeted Istanbul's airport, killing at least 36 people Turkey has suffered a spate of bombings this year, including two suicide attacks in tourist areas of Istanbul and two car blasts in the capital Ankara. So far no one has claimed responsibility for the latest attack, which has been likened to the airport and metro bombings in Belgium in March."
2016-06-30,A British activist and alleged hacker has told a court he fears he will take his own life if he is extradited to the United States.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160630223705/http://news.sky.com/story/1719291/alleged-hacker-lauri-loves-suicide-fears,"By Tom Cheshire, Technology Correspondent A British activist and alleged hacker has told a court he fears he will take his own life if he is extradited to the United States. Lauri Love is accused of being involved in a hack called #OpLastResort, which targeted parts of the US Army, the US Federal Reserve and NASA, as part of Anonymous in early 2013. If he is extradited, he faces a maximum potential prison sentence of 99 years, according to his legal team. Westminster magistrates heard about Love’s diagnoses for depression and Asperger’s syndrome. He described the ""urges, despair, helplessness and hopelessness"" that would compel him to exercise ""the one thing I would have control of - my body"". With his parents, a prison chaplain and a prison officer watching, Love told the court that ""he couldn’t imagine anything worse"" for him than being imprisoned in the US. ""I don't entertain any prospect of justice in the USA,"" he said. Love’s lawyers argue that he is facing extradition for alleged crimes committed in the UK, and should be prosecuted here, and that extradition would have a devastating impact on his physical and emotional well-being. The National Crime Agency arrested Love in October 2013 but did not bring charges. He recently sued them, successfully, for the return of his property, including computers. On Tuesday, autism expert Professor Simon Baron Cohen testified that ""about two thirds of people with Asperger's have suicidal thoughts ... the overwhelming priority is to keep him [Love] alive"". #OpLastResort was launched by Anonymous as a reaction to the death of Aaron Swartz, a 26-year-old computer scientist and activist who killed himself while awaiting trial in the US on charges of computer fraud. In 2012, the Home Secretary Theresa May intervened to prevent Gary McKinnon, who allegedly hacked the US Department of Defense and who was also diagnosed with depression and Asperger’s, being extradited to the US. Love’s case is seen as the first proper test of the so-called ""forum bar"" - measures that allow UK courts to decide whether a person should stand trial in the UK or abroad - introduced as a result. Before the hearing, Love told Sky News: ""It's been difficult … Luckily I've got a great support network of friends and family, and the Courage Foundation, and lots of people on the internet who have got my back and are in my corner, which helps, but I wouldn't wish this on anyone. ""The whole process has changed a lot of my attitudes, as any difficult life experience should be a learning opportunity. ""So I'll draw many lessons from this. But I won't give up trying to work for a better world. ""I'll just try and find ways that are less likely to result in conflict."" A decision on Love’s extradition is not expected immediately."

Saunders, who reprises the role of Eddy in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, was joined on the gold carpet by her great friend Joanna Lumley, who returns as Patsy. Asked by Sky News whether she could have envisaged such an occasion when the sitcom first hit TV screens, she said: ""Not in my wildest dreams. ""I imagined we would probably have both retired by now. It's wonderful."" Lumley added: ""Particularly in these rather dark times, to suddenly be able to escape into this Absolutely Fabulous world of glamour and ridiculous things, and funny[ness], and jeopardy, and danger, and bad behaviour, is all rather good."" They were joined by other favourites from the show including Julia Sawalha, June Whitfield and Jane Horrocks. Sawalha, who plays Eddie's daughter Saffy, admitted to being apprehensive about joining the cast of the film. ""There are always doubts and I think that's healthy,"" she said. ""I didn't know if I wanted to reprise Saffy again because when you play a character for so long you think you want to move on. ""But I love Jennifer so much and when we come together to do a workshop and you laugh all day, you think 'why would I want to do anything else?'"" Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie sees best friends Eddy and Patsy embroiled in a PR nightmare after accidentally ""killing off Kate Moss"". An incident at a fashion party attended by famous faces, including Jon Hamm and Stella McCartney, sees them push the supermodel into the River Thames. The pair are forced to flee to the French Riviera to escape the media storm. The film features around 60 cameos, including Pitch Perfect's Rebel Wilson, Spice Girl Emma Bunton, fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier and, Kate Moss. Saunders wrote the film after a bet with close friend Dawn French, who said she would never do it. The original TV series ran from 1992 to 1995 but Saunders insists that the movie adaptation will be relevant to a younger audience. ""They will definitely get it because it's about them,"" she says. ""It's about them and the age they are now. It's not stuck in the 90s."" Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie opens on Friday, darling."
