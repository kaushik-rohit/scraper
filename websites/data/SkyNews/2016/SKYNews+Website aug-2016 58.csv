2016-08-03,Police in Portugal have arrested a man in connection with the murder of  a six-year-old boy found dead near his home in Peterborough over 20 years ago.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160803050329/http://news.sky.com/story/rikki-neave-murder-man-arrested-in-portugal-10520348,"Rikki Neave was discovered strangled in woodland near him home in Peterborough in November 1994. The 35-year-old, from Peterborough, was arrested by officers in Lisbon and will remain in custody in Portugal while extradition proceedings begin. The Major Crime Unit, national authorities and authorities in Portugal had been working together to secure the man's arrest.Â  The suspect's age means he would have been a juvenile at the time of Rikki's death. In April, police said they hadÂ detained a man in his 30s from Peterborough. Ruth Neave leaving her son Rikki's funeral Cambridgeshire police relaunched an investigation into the boy's death last June, building a timeline of his last movements. In November, detectivesÂ said in a Crimewatch appeal that they wanted to speak to two teenage boys over the killing. The man was arrested around lunchtime on TuesdayÂ under a European Arrest Warrant,Â suspectedÂ of having breachedÂ his licence. British officers are expected to travel to Portugal in the next few days. His mother,Â Ruth Neave, was charged with murder at the time but found not guilty by a jury. She admitted child neglect and cruelty and was sentenced to seven years in prison."

Pageant officials moved into damage control mode, saying in a statement that her language was ""unacceptable at any age and in no way reflects the values of The Miss Universe Organisation"". The three finalists Emily Wakeman, Karlie Hay and Marley Stokes  They said the 18-year-old had been ""in a different place in her life"" when she posted the tweets. ""Karlie learned many lessons through those personal struggles that reshaped her life and values. ""We as an organisation are committed to supporting her continued growth."" Hay posted an apology on Twitter and Instagram, saying she had used language that ""is not representative of who I am as a person"". It is understood that Hay, of Tomball, Texas, will be allowed to keep her crown. She has promised to use her new position to advocate for those affected by drug and alcohol abuse. Several years ago, I had many personal struggles and found myself in a place that is not representative of who I am as a person... The pageant was owned by NBC Universal and the Republican Party's presidential nominee Donald Trump until Mr Trump made anti-immigrant remarks last year. NBC and Spanish-language network Univision thenÂ refused to broadcast the show. Mr Trump bought NBC's stake and in September heÂ sold the whole pageant to talent agency WME/IMG. Miss Teen USA also faced accusations of a lack of diversity after posting an image of the top five contestants on Twitter. All five are white, with long blonde hair and light-coloured eyes. Model Chrissy Teigen replied: ""Wow how can we choose from such a diverse bunch."""

The prime minister is clear that her industrial strategy will ensure the benefits of growth are shared ""across the cities and regions up and down the country"" - not just the north of England.Â  :: PM Holds Brexit Meeting To Get Economy Firing Putting clear blue water between herself and the old regime, Mrs May'sÂ remarks suggest that George Osborne's beloved ""Northern Powerhouse"" project to rejuvenate cities such as Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds, is not high on her agenda. It is another sign that Mrs May is unpicking her predecessor's economic legacy: last week her government announced a review of the Â£18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project, a deal which had been the centrepiece of David Cameron's desire to bring about a ""golden era"" of China-UK ties. David Cameron and Xi Jinping at The Plough pub near Chequers The government will decide whether to allow the Chinese to invest Â£6bn in the power plant in the autumn. But expect the deal to be on the agenda today amid concerns that cancelling the project could jeopardise more than Â£100bn of investment in Britain over the next decade. :: China Urges HInkley Power Plant Go Ahead Chinese investment is crucial to other infrastructure projects: Mr Osborne launched the Â£11.8bn procurement process for the high speed rail line between London and Manchester -Â HS2 - in China last September. Lord O'Neill, chief secretary to the Treasury and key architect behind the previous government's attempts to attract Chinese investment into the UK, has threatened to resign over Mrs May's new approach to China - a resignation that No 10 is keen to avoid. Mrs May will chair the meeting, alongside her new Chancellor Philip Hammond and a clutch of key ministers including Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, Sajid Javid, the local government and communities secretary, and Chris Grayling from transport. The new collective approach to drawing up an industrial strategy is a far cry from the previous regime, where economic decision making was concentrated in the hands of the once all-powerful chancellor Mr Osborne."

It has advised passengers to use alternative routes to avoid disruption on the London St Pancras to Nottingham and SheffieldÂ line and between Leicester, Lincoln and Grimsby.

2016-08-03,"An Aids charity has won a High Court battle to ensure a ""game-changing"" preventative HIV treatment can be funded by the NHS.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160803050329/http://news.sky.com/story/charity-wins-court-battle-for-hiv-treatment-10520066,"NHS England said it had received advice that it does not have the legal powerÂ to fund pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) -Â a ""highly effective"" anti-retroviralÂ drug used to stop HIV from becoming established in the event of transmission. Instead, it said the drug - which costs Â£400 per month for each patientÂ - was the responsibility of local councils, which are in charge of funding preventative health services. But Mr Justice Green, sitting in London, ruled that NHS England ""has erred inÂ deciding that it has no power or duty to commission the preventative drugs inÂ issue"". The ruling is a victory for theÂ National Aids Trust (NAT), which brought theÂ case to court. However,Â NHS England said it is appealing against the judgement. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIVÂ infection in people who are at high risk by more than 90%. InÂ his judgement Mr Justice Green said: ""One governmental body says it has no power to provide the service and the local authoritiesÂ say that they have no money. ""The claimant is caught between the two and the potential victims of this disagreement are those who will contract HIV/Aids but who would not were the preventative policy to be fully implemented."" NAT chief executive Deborah Gold said: ""This is fantastic news. It is vindication for the many people who were let down when NHS England absolved itself of responsibility for PrEP. ""The judgement has confirmed our view - that it is perfectly lawful for NHS England to commission PrEP. Now NHS England must do just that."" The ruling does not mean PrEP will automatically be funded on the NHS - as health chiefs may decide the drug is not effective enough to warrant using NHS money. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which advises the NHS on funding priorities - is due to look at the evidence on PrEP. Health service bosses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not yet made a decision on funding for PrEP."
2016-08-03,The Home Office has won an appeal against a court ruling which allowed four Syrian refugees to join family in the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160803050329/http://news.sky.com/story/calais-refugee-case-home-office-wins-appeal-10520091,"In a landmark case earlier this year, a judge ruled three teenagers and a 26-year-old man suffering mental health problems should be allowed to join relatives living in Britain. The court heard that the boys faced conditions that were akin to ""living hell""Â in the French migrant camps and should be immediately brought to the UK. A migrant walks among tents in a muddy field at a camp of makeshift shelters called the Grande Synthe jungle, near Calais ThatÂ decision was hailed as groundbreaking by refugee welfare groups, who had said they hoped it would pave the way for other families separated by war in Syria to be reunited. However, three Court of Appeal judges upheld the Home Office appeal against the decision on the grounds the four refugees had not followed the correct process. The Home OfficeÂ said it could set a legal precedent and undermine Britain's control over its borders. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Refugee Taskforce, said: ""I amÂ appalled that Theresa May has pursued this appeal to make it harder forÂ vulnerable child refugees who are alone in Europe to join family in Britain. ""These children's lives and safety are at risk as they have no one to lookÂ after them. The result of this appeal is to put extra bureaucratic obstacles inÂ the way of lone child refugees who are desperately vulnerable to trafficking,Â slavery and abuse - even though they have relatives who could care for themÂ here."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""It is disgusting that the GovernmentÂ is putting ideology above what is best for desperate and vulnerable children."" The man and the three teenagers are already in the UK but will not now face deportation, the judges said. Under an EU law called the Dublin Regulation, asylum claims must be made in the country refugees arrive in but children can have their claims transferred to another country if relatives are already living there. Migrants queue in the Calais 'jungle' Lawyers had successfully argued that the regulation was not working properly and an immigration judge ruled, the boys, who had been traumatised by their experiences, should be allowed to live in the UK while their cases were considered. However, the Home Office said the four should have applied for asylum in France first and they could then have been handed to the UK. Criticising the decision, George Gabriel, from the charity Citizens UK, which represented the four,Â said: ""When we brought this case, it wasÂ an enormous kick...Â for the Government, and the system is now workingÂ better because 50 children have been brought to Britain since the case. ""But it means that charities like ours will have to continue identifyingÂ children one by one, taking them through a lengthy bureaucratic process as theyÂ have to wait to be reunited with their loved ones. ""Today is a great day for bureaucrats because it means that the letter of theÂ process will have to be followed despite the clearly unacceptable wait thisÂ leaves refugee children facing."" A Home Office spokesman said:Â ""We welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal to recognise the principle that those seeking protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. ""Any request to unite family members under the Dublin Regulation is carefully considered. Where someone seeking asylum elsewhere in the EU can demonstrate they have close family members legally in the UK, we will take responsibility for that claim."""

2016-08-03,"The UK made a net contribution to the European Union of about Â£199m a week last year, according to new official figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160803050329/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-paid-163199m-to-eu-a-week-official-figures-10519565,"The amount was the second-highest in the past decade and an increase of Â£13m on the previous year. The figures were released more than a month after the UK voted to leave the European Union, with one of the key issues being the cost of membership. A bus used by the Leave campaign had a slogan on it sayingÂ ""We send the EU Â£350m a week"", but the Remain side said the figure was misleading because it did not take into account the money the UK received in return - in the form of rebates and payments to the public sector. The figures, from the UK's current account published by the Office for National Statistics, say that, before the application of the rebate, the UK's gross contribution was Â£19.6bn a year - about Â£376m a week. The Vote Leave campaign bus had the 'misleading' figure painted on it But the rebate was Â£4.9bn, leaving a yearly contributionÂ for the UK of Â£14.7bn. Taking into account the EU's payments to the UK public sectorÂ brings the final figure down further to Â£10.4bn a year - or about Â£199m a week. The figure for 2014 was roughly Â£186m a week. During the campaign, the UK Statistics Authority said the Treasury deducts the value of the rebate before paying the UK's contributions to the bloc. The most expensive year for the UK's EU membership in the past decade was in 2013, when itÂ paid Â£11.3bn, or about Â£217m a week. But these amounts do not take into account EU grants to the private sector, such as research organisations and universities."

We can't film any other buildings, or corridors, or cars, or people's faces. Because this is Porton Down, the home of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratories and they prefer to work in secret. One hundredÂ years on from the mustard and chlorine gas attacks on the trenches in northern France and Ypres Salient, I have been given rare access to this establishment, to see how technology has moved on. ""The range of threats we face in terms of their complexities is probably quite broad,"" Simon tells me. Porton Down had a sinister reputation in the early part of the 20th century For their own security, we're asked to only publish the scientists' first names. Simon is the Division Head of Biological and Chemical and Radiological Sciences. ""I think it is fair to say that if you look at the press and you watch the news then you can see that it's been a very unstable world for the past few years,"" he said. ""Events in Syria and the Middle East have clearly shown that chemical weapons are as relevant today as they were 100 years ago in the First World War."" Bunkall inside the gas chamber with the latest gear It was in the laboratories at Porton Down that scientists developed a repellent to protect clothes against chemical weapons. Their work over the last century has progressed gas mask technology considerably. Early gas masks were horribly claustrophobic. Respirators were even developed for dogs and horses. ""The black veiled respirator was Britain's first response to the use of chlorine back in 1915,"" Colin explains, showing me a mess of fabric that was once the rushed response to German gas attacks on the Allied trenches in northern France. ""It's essentially cotton waste material soaked with various chemicals. ""You tie it around your mouth and hope for the best."" Entrance to one of the buildings at Porton Down The modern version, in use since 2010, is called the second General Service Respirator. It has a large wraparound visor for better vision and two oxygen canisters to help the wearer breathe more easily. In a controlled gas chamber, filled with harmless smoke, I put it to the test. It is first fitted to my face carefully. If the seal leaks, harmful gases could seep in. I also have to put on a military hazard suit. One of the main buildings at the site - the only one we were allowed to film I wear lightweight trousers and top but these are protected with the chemical repellent. Finally I wear long black rubber gloves and pull the hood over my head. On my back I have a heavy backpack - this contains the computer equipment that will feed live data back to analysts outside. They will look for how many particles of gas are leaking into my mask. In the chamber I'm put through some tests to put the mask under stress and replicate movement on the battlefield. I have to run on the spot and jump on and off and platform. It's hot, but my vision remains good - technology in the mask keeps it clear and stops the visor fogging up. The mask works perfectly. Porton Down is a military establishment, under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence, but they also work closely with the Home Office developing equipment for counter-terror police. Although they prefer to work in secret, if terrorists do manage to get hold of chemical weapons, Porton Down's work will come into its own."

The former bookkeeper had promised to ""get her home safe"" after finding the 20-year-old studentÂ in a drunken state outside the nightclub.

         But instead he raped and strangled her, leaving her with more than 30 injuries. On Tuesday, Judge Mr Justice Saunders told him he would serve at least 30 years in prison. He said: ""This was a terrible crime. It was committed because the defendant was determined to satisfy his own sexual desires on an attractive and much younger woman. ""It was a crime of utter depravity."" The court heard that Ms Chipchase was ""drunk"" and ""upset"" when she met Tenniswood by chance outside NB's nightclub, according to friends she was out with that night. CCTV showed him outside at 1.11am, turning to look at Ms Chipchase before walking up toÂ her minutes later. He led the student - who hadÂ almost three times the drink-drive limit of alcohol in her blood - to a waiting taxi but kept changing his destination rather than give his address. When they arrived at his home, Tenniswood raped his victim and then ""squeezed the life"" out of her, prosecutors said. In his account, Tenniswood claimed the idea to strangle Ms Chipchase was her suggestion and her death was an accident. He said: ""I, in my over-eagerness to please her, either sustained the pressure just too long or just gripped too tightly."" After killing the young woman, Tenniswood told a jury at Birmingham Crown Court that he ""cuddled up"" to her lifeless body thinking she was in a deep sleep. But instead of raising the alarm, he went to get a kebab and then sat and drank lager in a nearby hotel bar where he accessed a news story about the search for Ms Chipchase. A rucksack he was carrying when he was arrested 22 hours later contained a kitchen knife and a pair of latex gloves. Tenniswood told the court he used the gloves to reclothe his victim and put a sheet over her body so she would not be cold. CCTV showed Tenniswood and Ms Chipchase getting into a taxi in Northampton In a victim statement, India's father Jeremy Chipchase said: ""I am sure that I and other family members will continually have moments like this of pain, anguish, emotion until we take our last breath."" Her mother, Susan, said: ""Her death has left a huge void in all our lives and her siblings are quiet and subdued without her."" Tenniswood was labelled a fantasist by prosecutors, and claimed during the trial that he had dated former fashion model Heather Stewart-Whyte in the late 1980s. Speaking after the trial, Ms Stewart-Whyte said she ""never had any kind of relationship with him""."
2016-08-03,"A total of 81,000 workers were involved in employment disputes in 2015 - the lowest since figures were first collected at the end of the 19th century - according to research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160803050329/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-strike-action-figures-hit-record-low-10520085,"The number of working days lost through strike action last year was the second lowest since records began in 1891. In total 170,000 working days were lost, considerably less than the figure for 2014, which was 788,000.Â  The lowest annual figure on record, was in 2005, when 157,000 days were lost due to strikes. ""The main reason that 2014 had a higher figure than last year was that it saw a number of large scale public sector strikes that were not repeated in 2015,"" said ONS labour market statistician Nick Palmer. Disputes over pay made up 71% of the total days lost last year, followed by rows over redundancies. Pay has been the main cause of disputes for the last decade, with the exception of 2009 and 2010, when the main cause was redundancy. Commenting on the figures, TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said strikes are far less common these days and tend to be short.

Mr Taylor, who has given hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Tory party, said along with the reports of his gong recommendation there had been ""seriously inaccurate comments"" about hisÂ firm. He has now written to former prime ministerÂ Mr Cameron and his successor TheresaÂ May asking for his name to be withdrawn from the controversialÂ list, which was leaked to theÂ Sunday Times. His decision to withdraw his name was revealed by Sky's City Editor Mark Kleinman. The cronyism row was sparked by reports that Mr Cameron had recommendedÂ knighthoods for four pro-EU Cabinet colleagues - Philip Hammond, Michael Fallon,Â Patrick McLoughlin and David Lidington. Mr Cameron has beenÂ accused of misuse of the system after the list showed he was seeking to reward 48 Tory donors, allies and aides, including his wife's assistant and stylist. It was claimed Mr Cameron also recommended a knighthoodÂ for another major Tory donorÂ Andrew Cook. Those said to be in the running for an OBE include Isabel Spearman, who helped Samantha Cameron with her diary and outfits for various engagements, and Thea Rogers, Mr Osborne's closest aide who is credited with overhauling his image. Mr Taylor said in a statement: ""In recent days, speculation in the media has suggested that I may be recognised in the forthcoming resignation honours list. ""This has been accompanied by seriously inaccurate comments about the company I lead. ""In these circumstances, I think it is right I request that my name does not go forward, if indeed I was being considered for an honour.""

The proprietor was inspired by the 19th century physicist Michael Faraday. Steve Tyler told Sky News: ""So basically we built a Faraday cage. A Faraday cage is a tin box that prevents signals from coming in. ""I just wanted people to enjoy a night out in my bar, without being interrupted by their phones. ""So rather than asking them not to use their phones, I stopped the phones working."" Mr Tyler said the only complaint he had was from a customer whose phone did in fact work. He moved them to another table. The system was easy to install. He added: ""It's not difficult at all. ""It's silver foil in the walls and it's copper mesh. And it's not the perfect system, it's not military grade. ""The Americans are still listening. But the general public get poor signal or no signal, so they have to go outside to use their phones. ""That's what I want them to do. I want them to talk to the people they're with, not the people they're not with."" The law is slightly unclear on blocking phones. The Wireless Telegraph Act 2006 states that ""the use of any apparatus, whether or not wireless telegraphy apparatus, for the purpose of interfering with any wireless telegraphy, is an offence"". That certainly includes electronic jamming devices (which the Gin Tub isn't using), since those interfere with communications over a wide area, and could disrupt emergency services. Faraday cages are a grey area. An Ofcom spokesman told Sky news: ""Unlike jammers, Faraday cages don't proactively cause interference, although they do interfere with mobile reception. ""We would always recommend people seek legal advice if they are unsure whether an installation breaches wireless telegraphy laws."" David Stupples, professor of electronic and radio systems at City University of London, told Sky News: ""You could use jammers,Â it will actually transmit on the same frequency on the mobile phone, so it will receive noise and noise only. ""In this country, and most countries, that's totally illegal. ""The Faraday cage is sitting on the edge of what is legal and what is not. ""I understand some restaurants use it and some don't in certain areas. It's debatable whether that's illegal or not. But it is on the edge. ""He invented it in 1836. The Faraday cage is used all the time so it's nothing new about it, it's really, really quite basic technology."" Faraday Cages are probably all right in the eyes of the law. So, in Hove at least, it seems that a 19th century technology is helping solve a very 21st century problem."

The influential think-tankÂ argued the flawed healthchecks masked the ability of British banks to cope with another major economic shockÂ andÂ accused the BofE of being ""asleep at the wheel again"". The study highlighted 13 flaws in the stress test, which was compared to a ""ridiculously easy exam with a ludicrously low pass rate"". It argued every single UK lender would currently fail ""more rigorous"" stress tests by the US Federal Reserve. The researchÂ warned the UK is ""sailing blindly into a second global financial crisis"" and has called on the stress tests to be ditched, with decision-makers instead forced to be personally liable for risks. The report's author, Kevin Dowd, professor of finance and economics at Durham University, said: ""The purpose of the stress-testing programme should be to highlight the vulnerability of our banking system and the need to rebuild it. ""Instead, it has achieved the exact opposite, portraying a weak banking system as strong. ""This is like having a ship radar system that cannot detect an iceberg in plain view. ""As the EU banking system goes into a renewed crisis, the UK banking system is in no fit state to withstand the storm. ""Once contagion spreads from Italy to Germany and then to the UK, we will have a new banking crisis but on a much grander scale than '07-'08. ""The Bank of England is asleep at the wheel again, and we will be back to beleaguered banksters begging for bailouts - and the taxpayer will be ripped off yet again, but bigger this time."" The findings comes after the Royal Bank Scotland performed poorly compared to other major British banks when the results of the European stress tests were revealed last week. RBS's capital levels fell by 7.5% - the third biggest fall of the 51 banks tested. Deutsche Bank's share price took a hit at the end of June when it was branded one of the world's riskiest banks by the International Monetary Fund. There is also mounting concern over the state of the Italian banking sector.

The think-tankÂ pointed to double-digit falls in ownership across Leeds, Sheffield and inÂ Greater Manchester,Â where it said ownership levels had sunk the most, falling 14.5% from their peak of 72.4% in April 2003 to 57.9% in February this year. One typical two-bedroom houseÂ in Urmston, in Manchester, had already been seen by 10 people on Tuesday, six of which declared an interest in renting the property, withinÂ less than 24 hours of it coming onto the rental market. Prospective tenant Ryan Heathcote told Sky NewsÂ the prospect of himÂ buying a property was slim. ""To get a decent deposit you are looking at Â£20,000, and then you have to furnish it and do it up, so it is difficult,"" he said. The report put Outer London as seeingÂ the second biggest drop - of 13.5% - to just under 58%. The Foundation saidÂ the figures showedÂ the proportion of people owning their own homeÂ hadÂ plummeted across every part of the UK since their peak in the early 2000s. It can be mainly explained by house prices soaring during times of weaker wage growth and lower supply of new housing.

         According to the latest official figures, the average UK house priceÂ stood at a record Â£211,230 in May - Â£227,000 in England. The figure for LondonÂ was Â£472,163, theÂ Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with annual growth running at a rate of almost 14%. In contrast, annual salary growth hadÂ run at levels of 2% or below since the financial crisis. The Foundation released its report a week after theÂ English Housing Survey found two-thirds of private and social renters cited affordability as a barrier to home ownership. It also came as separate figures from Eurostat showed home ownership is falling faster in the UK than any other country in the European Union - dropping 7.3% in the five years from 2009 to 2014 to 64.8%. Only Denmark, Austria and Germany have a smaller percentage of home owners. The EU-wide average is 70.1%.

More than 300,000 people have been helped into home ownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, however a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government, says there is still a lot more to do. ""We've set outÂ the most ambitious vision for housing in a generation, including delivering hundreds of thousands of homes exclusively for first-time buyers, he said."""

2016-08-03,A couple from Arizona have been arrested after leaving their two-year-old son at home to go out and play Pokemon GO.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160803050329/http://news.sky.com/story/couple-admit-leaving-son-to-play-pokemon-go-10519881,"Police found the youngster abandoned outside his family's residence in East Payton Street inÂ San Tan Valley. The temperature was 30C (90F), he had no water and he was screaming and crying and trying to get back inside. His parents, Brent and Brianne Daley, aged 27 and 25, admitted leaving him around 90 minutes earlier and have been charged with child endangerment and child neglect. Sheriff Paul Babeu said: ""(We) have been warning people about personal safety while playing this interactive smartphone game. ""But we never would have imagined that parents would abandon a child to play Pokemon Go. This goes beyond comprehension."" Police say they found what they believed to be his father's telephone number and rang him. When told his son had been found abandoned, he allegedly replied ""Whatever"" and hung up. When the Daleys returned home almost an hour later they insisted they had only gone out to put fuel in their car. According to police they later admitted they had been playing Pokemon GO, ""stopping at parks and other places to interact with the game"". Meanwhile, a New Jersey resident is suing Niantic and Nintendo because players of the game keep showing up atÂ his home uninvited, according to US media reports. The man claims the two companies behind the game have created a nuisance and wants class-action status on behalf of other Americans who claim players have trespassed on their properties."
2016-08-03,"A leading dentist has said there is only ""weak evidence"" flossing stops gum disease and cavities - despite it being recommended by most in the profession.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160803050329/http://news.sky.com/story/flossing-health-claims-not-proved-says-expert-10520945,"Professor Damien Walmsley, of Birmingham University, said the time and expense required for reliable studies meant the health claims often attributed to floss were unproven.Â Prof Walmsley, who is also a scientific adviser to the British Dental Association (BDA), said: ""The difficulty is trying to get good evidence. People are different and large studies are costly to do...until then you can't really say yes or no."" He added ""more sophisticated trials"" were needed. Earlier this year, the US government dropped the flossing recommendation from its guidelines because they must be legally based on scientific evidence. A spokeswoman for Public Health England (PHE) said it keeps ""abreast of the evidence base and will consider these findings"". She added: ""Some people may not have large enough spaces in between their teeth to use an inter-dental brush, so flossing can be a useful alternative. ""Patients should speak to their dentist if they have any concerns."" Prof Walmsley's views have been borne out by a large number of studies in the past decade. One review conducted last year said: ""The majority of available studies fail to demonstrate that flossing is generally effective in plaque removal."" Another review in 2015 cited ""inconsistent/weak evidence"" for flossing and a ""lack of efficacy"". Floss can occasionally cause harm, with poor technique leading to damaged gums and teeth. There is also a risk of dislodging bad bacteria, which can lead to infections. The BDAÂ said: ""Small inter-dental brushes are best for cleaning the area in between the teeth, where there is space to do so. ""Floss is of little value unless the spaces between your teeth are too tight for the inter-dental brushes to fit without hurting or causing harm."""
