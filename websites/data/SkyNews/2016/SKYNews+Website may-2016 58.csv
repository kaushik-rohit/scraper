They developed the symptoms after the ambulance crew was called to the property in Newcastle, Co Down, on Friday evening. The paramedics were able to treat themselves and the three others with oxygen. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, along with four additional ambulances, were sent to the scene. High levels of the toxic gas, which can be deadly, were discovered at the house. All five people have been checked for levels of contamination and are being treated but are expected to make a speedy recovery."
2016-05-01,British astronaut Tim Peake has successfully taken control of a robot on Earth from the International Space Station (ISS).,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160501022905/http://news.sky.com/story/1687244/tim-peake-controls-uk-based-rover-from-space,"British astronaut Tim Peake has successfully taken control of a robot on Earth from the International Space Station (ISS). Major Peake, 44, piloted the rover - named Bridget - through a simulated Martian landscape at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage. But it was not all plain driving - at one point Bridget got stuck on a large rock and its signal was lost for around 10 minutes. Under Major Peake's guidance, the British-built Rover travelled around 20 metres (65ft) during the two-hour test, and entered a mock darkened cave. Bridget is put through its paces Loud applause and cheers rang out from the control room at Airbus at the end of the experiment. Dr Ellie Allouis, mission and robot engineer, praised Major Peake's driving as ""measured"" and ""careful"". He said: ""Tim found targets, avoided obstacles - almost all of them - and returned to the entrance of the cave."" Dr Allouis added that the team was ""elated"" with what they had learned, The ExoMars rover is due to be launched in 2018 and will take nine months to reach Mars, using parachutes to land safely on the surface. Bridget returns to the entrance of the 'cave' :: Tim Peake Runs London Marathon It is named after the 1960s French movie star Brigitte Bardot. Bridget weighs around 300kg (660lbs) and can travel at a maximum speed of 2cm (0.8ins) per second on a flat surface. Within the first 70 minutes of the experiment it drove over several fake rocks, moving around 10-15 metres (33-49ft) through the cave. But the Bridget's greatest challenge was telling the difference between a shadow and a rock, something rovers cannot do in dark conditions. Bridget is due to fly to Mars in 2018 That was where Major Peake came in. His task was to get Bridget into the cave and find three targets marked with UV paint before exiting - all within 90 minutes. Bridget had to frame up each target for a picture, mark a map and notify ground control. The object was to develop the technology needed for astronauts to navigate rovers while orbiting Mars and to see how humans and robots can work together. Bridget will be the first rover sent to the Red Planet specifically designed to find evidence of past or present life."

Mohammed Ali Ahmed, 26, and Zakaria Boufassil, 26, are charged with giving £3,000 to Abrini when he was in Britain. It is alleged they met Abrini - ""the man in the hat"" - in a park in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, in July last year, and handed over the cash. The pair face one count of the commission of offences abroad under section 17 of the Terrorism Act. They are accused of entering into an arrangement in which money was made available to another person, and that they knew, or had reasonable cause to suspect, it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism. Ahmed is also accused with a third person, Soumaya Boufassil, of collecting money for terrorism between 1 January 2015 and 8 April 2016. Soumaya Boufassil wore a burka and spoke only to confirm her name, date of birth and address. The two men wore jumpers and also spoke only to confirm their details. The case lasted for 23 minutes. Chief magistrate Howard Riddle sent the case to the Old Bailey for a hearing on 13 May. The defendants were remanded in custody. The trio were among five people arrested on 14 and 15 April. A fourth man - Fazal Sajjad Younis Khan, 40, also from Small Heath - has been charged with possession of CS spray. A 59-year-old man remains on bail with strict conditions while the investigation continues."
2016-05-01,Jeremy Corbyn has announced plans to tackle anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the Labour Party.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160501022905/http://news.sky.com/story/1687681/corbyn-launches-anti-semitism-action-plan,"Jeremy Corbyn has announced plans to tackle anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the Labour Party. It follows the suspension of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone over his comments about Adolf Hitler being a ""Zionist"". He made the remarks during an interview in which he sought to defend Bradford West MP Naz Shah, who was suspended on Wednesday over a series of Facebook posts about Israel. Mr Corbyn says he will be proposing a new code of conduct on anti-Semitism to Labour's national executive committee next month. This will make it ""explicitly clear for the first time"" that Labour will not tolerate any form of racism, including anti-Semitism, among its members. Mr Corbyn is also setting up an inquiry into anti-Semitism and racism, to be chaired by the former director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti. The inquiry, which will report in two months, will consult widely with the Jewish community and other minorities ""about a statement of principles and guidance"". Mr Corbyn, who has faced calls to sack Mr Livingstone, a close ally, said: ""Labour is an anti-racist party to its core and has a long and proud history of standing against racism, including anti-Semitism. ""I have campaigned against racism all my life and the Jewish community has been at the heart of the Labour Party and progressive politics in Britain for more than a hundred years. :: 'Red Ken' No Stranger To Damning Headlines ""We have taken decisive action over allegations of anti-Semitism since I became leader, suspending all those involved from membership, and have set up an inquiry under Baroness Royall into reports of anti-Semitism in the Oxford University Labour club and elsewhere."" He added: ""There is no place for anti-Semitism or any form of racism in the Labour Party, or anywhere in society, and we will make sure that our party is a welcoming home to members of all communities."" The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism's Jonathan Sacerdoti expressed concern that Mr Corbyn's taskforce could teach Labour MPs and members how to disguise anti-Semitism instead of solving the problem altogether. He told Sky News: ""The Labour Party's plan to deal with anti-Semitism is certainly a start, but we need to make sure this isn't just a disguise for the problem. ""The leadership itself has not acted quickly enough or decisively enough to inspire a lot of confidence in much of the Jewish community. ""People at the top need to show they too are willing to change in order to change the tone of the party."" Earlier, Mr Livingstone called for a Labour inquiry to reinstate him because he had first made his inflammatory remarks about Hitler 30 years ago and they were known to party members."

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross was found sitting alone by the driver of the 158 to Stratford on Thursday night. The bus was taken out of service to the Stagecoach garage in West Ham, but the dog refused to get off. Staff fed and kept him warm until he could be collected by Newham Council's animal welfare team on Friday morning. Bus depot worker Ricky Hatton took a picture of the dog and put it on social media in the hope a new home could be found. He told Sky News: ""When I arrived around 6.30am he'd been there all night. Very scared, but not aggressive. ""I gave him food, water and my bodywarmer. I nicknamed him Bus-ter. ""(He) seemed in shock. I'm hoping he's found a new loving home."" Bus driver Amos Paul Mak reportedly posted on Facebook that he wanted to take the dog home but it was against regulations ""in case he bites"". A Newham Council spokesperson told Sky News: ""This dog is currently being looked after by our animal welfare team while we try to locate its owner. ""If anyone recognises this dog, please contact the team on 020 8586 9739."""

Pyongyang has alleged that American personnel were pointing their fingers at North Korean soldiers, making strange noises, and pulling ""disgusting"" facial expressions. In a statement, the secretive state's military warned US soldiers to end the ""hooliganism"" at the village which divides North and South Korea, or else they would meet a ""dog's death any time and any place"". It was also claimed that US soldiers had encouraged fully armed South Korean troops to aim at their adversaries, which North Korea described as a ""dangerous provocation"". Christopher Bush, a spokesman for the UN command in the region, said the allegations were investigated but determined to be unfounded. This is not the first time that North Korea has accused South Korean and US troops of trying to wind up its forces, and vice versa. After Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear bomb test a decade ago, American soldiers claimed that North Korean troops were spitting across the demarcation line, flashing their middle fingers, and making throat-slashing gestures. There are currently about 28,000 US troops deployed in South Korea in a bid to deter potential aggression from across the border. The latest spat unfolded in Panmunjom, where an armistice heralding the end of the Korean War in 1953 was signed. Despite being one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints, the village is popular with tourists. But guides regularly warn visitors against making gestures which could antagonise the North Korean soldiers nearby."

People in the East African state say it is the worst drought in living memory, caused by successive poor rainy seasons made worse by El Nino conditions in the Horn of Africa. Adan Shariff Gabow, from charity Islamic Relief, said there are cases of women collapsing from hunger and being set upon by starving hyenas. ""They fell down, malnourished, and we understand they were then set on by the animals,"" he said. The severe weather conditions have killed thousands of goats and cows, bringing the risk of wide-spread famine, aid workers said. Even camels - which are more drought-resistant - are dying. Malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed their babies, and farmers are feeding cardboard boxes to their animals because there is no grass left for grazing. The United Nations - which has launched a £72m appeal - said 1.7 million people need aid in Somaliland and neighbouring Puntland - both self-declared states in northern Somalia. Thousands of goats and cows are among the animals that have died Islamic Relief spokeswoman Mary Griffin said there was a ""terrible sense of deja vu"" after a drought killed more than 250,000 people in southern Somalia in 2011. Aid agencies were criticised then for responding too late. Hany El-Banna, chairman of the Muslim Charities Forum, called on the world not to repeat the same mistake. ""We cannot wait like we did in 2011 when we acted too late,"" he said. ""We need to deal with this today - if we don't this drought will turn into a famine."" Britain's shadow development secretary Diane Abbott, who recently visited the region, plans to raise the issue in parliament next week. ""I spoke to families who had 500 or more animals three months ago, and now are left with 20 or fewer,"" she said. ""For people who rely on their animals for meat, milk and trade, it's the equivalent of losing your entire life savings."" She said drought conditions that would normally strike every seven to 10 years are now becoming an annual occurrence. Nimo Mohamed Abdi, a mother of three, described how she had lost all her livestock - more than 180 animals - in three months. ""We were living by the coast then and the animals died so quickly, one after another, that we could do nothing with their corpses but throw them into the sea,"" she said."
2016-05-01,"Housing developers should be forced to install flood prevention measures when building new homes in at-risk areas, the Local Government Association has said.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160501022905/http://news.sky.com/story/1687760/make-builders-flood-proof-new-homes-govt-told,"By Siobhan Robbins, West of England Correspondent Housing developers should be forced to install flood prevention measures when building new homes in at-risk areas, the Local Government Association has said. The group, which represents councils in England and Wales, believes protection including raised electrical sockets, sealed floors and wiring above floor level should become a mandatory part of building regulations. Deputy chairman of the LGA, Councillor Peter Fleming, told Sky News that the Government and the construction industry must ""step up to the plate"" to stop homes being devastated in future storms. ""These are simple, low cost changes that can easily be made that would actually make a massive difference to people that have been affected by flooding,"" he added. An estimated one in six homes in the UK are at risk of flooding, and last winter's floods are believed to have caused damage worth £5bn. Among those supporting the LGA's proposals is Curry Rivel Primary School in Langport, Somerset, which was flooded for the third time in eight years in February. The school is now installing flood-proof floors in the hope of mitigating the impact of any future storm. Headteacher Peter Staddon said: ""If they were in place when we were built we wouldn't have flooded, or the flood would have been less extreme and easier to contain."" The Government has said it takes flood prevention extremely seriously and was investing £2.3bn in defences over the next six years. In response to the LGA's proposals, a spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government added: ""Since 2004, statutory building regulations guidance has promoted the use of flood resilient construction, and councils can insist on a host of measures to protect new homes against flooding when granting planning permission.  ""We will continue to work closely with the industry to see what else can be done to improve flood resilience, but are clear that wrapping the industry in red tape is not the way to build the homes that this country desperately needs."""

Her Majesty gave President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama a right royal put-down in a quirky cameo posted on the Kensington Palace Twitter account. Prince Harry - spearheading next month's Paralympic-style event in Orlando, Florida - enlisted his grandmother to respond to a mock-threatening video message from the President and his wife. Harry is seen sitting with the Queen in front of a roaring fire, showing her some of the games' competitors from last year, when he receives a text message from the First Lady, complete with a Hail To The Chief ringtone. ""Hey, Prince Harry. Remember when you told us to bring it at the Invictus Games?"" Mrs Obama asks, with three servicemen standing in the background. Mr Obama then adds: ""Careful what you wish for!"" The Obamas' video message fails to impress across the pond The US troops pull funny faces, then one throws down the gauntlet with a drop the mic-style ""boom"" as they make clear their readiness to take on the UK's injured servicemen and women at the Games. After watching the video, the Queen shrugs her shoulders and says: ""Oh, really? Please!"" The Prince then turns to the camera with a mocking ""boom"" of his own. Mrs Obama is due to join Harry at the Games, and there will also be a jet flypast and appearance from Hollywood star Morgan Freeman. Harry told WFTV Channel 9: ""This is an experience, it's an emotional rollercoaster, there's not a single point during these games that spectators will sit there feeling sorry for these guys - that is not what this is about. ""People in America and people across the world if you haven't seen the Games may think 'oh, this is a bunch of wounded soldiers on a sporting field taking each other on', it's completely the opposite to what it is - it's an emotional rollercoaster."" The five-day spectacle begins on 8 May and will involve more than 500 competitors from around the world."

The material was apparently found on a GoPro camera recovered by the Kurdish Peshmerga following a clash in December. It shows a very different outfit to that portrayed in IS propaganda videos, with disorganised militants arguing with one another during a chaotic battle. The IS fighter wearing the camera is referred to as Abu Radhwan throughout the video. At one point he shouts at a fellow militant whose automatic weapon slipped and fired inside their armoured vehicle. ""Abu Hajer! Stop firing,"" Abu Radhwan can be heard saying. A short time later he screams: ""Abu Hajer! I told you to aim higher! What's wrong with you? You are firing the bullet casings straight at us!"" The footage begins with an apparent suicide bomber saying his final farewells before boarding the vehicle. ""May God accept you (as a martyr),"" another fighter says to him. ""Do not be sad for me,"" he replies. The first militant then says: ""Come on, hurry up brothers, there are (war) planes around, please."" A desert battle ensues and the vehicle is hit, seemingly killing the driver. The fighters then leave the vehicle and retreat as a screaming Abu Radhwan is struck down. Peshmerga officer Lieutenant-Colonel Yasir Abdulla said the camera was found the morning after a battle. He added that the Kurdish Peshmerga often replenishes its equipment from weapons, ammunition and vehicles left behind by defeated IS militants."
2016-05-01,"Some GP surgeries are refusing to register asylum seekers and refugees - even though they are eligible for treatment under NHS guidelines, according to a charity.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160501022905/http://news.sky.com/story/1687777/health-fears-as-gp-surgeries-refuse-refugees,"By Harriet Hadfield, Sky News Reporter Some GP surgeries are refusing to register asylum seekers and refugees - even though they are eligible for treatment under NHS guidelines, according to a charity. Two-fifths of patients that Doctors of the World attempted to register were refused at GP surgeries in England. The vast majority of asylum seekers and refugees were rejected because they did not have ID or a proof of address, but these documents are not legally required to sign up for primary healthcare. Meanwhile, 13% were turned away specifically because of their immigration status. At a drop-in clinic for vulnerable people in east London run by Doctors of the World, Sky News met Sanjeevan - a Sri Lankan asylum seeker who was refused registration at his local surgery. He made the four-hour round-trip to be seen by one of the charity's volunteer GPs. Sanjeevan went to the charity's clinic as he 'really needed medical help' ""I was very worried, I had so much pain and really needed medical help,"" Sanjeevan said. ""I showed my asylum letter but they said they couldn't register me because the letter had no address."" The Royal College of GPs says the problem is more about paperwork than discrimination. Dr Steve Mowle told us: ""There are complicated rules around patients, many receptionists are trained that they have to have various proof of identity."" ""I don't think GPs are sitting there thinking 'let's block care to refugees', I think it's the complexity of what's going on in reception and I think our receptionists need support."" Primary care in England is free to almost everyone, and GP surgeries are crucial to ease pressure on A&E departments and prevent the spread of disease. Tuberculosis expert Dr Al Story thinks the situation poses a real risk to public health. He said: ""If people get turned away from primary care and they are symptomatic and they could have tuberculosis, the consequences of that is transmission in the community, so it's in all our interests to diagnose TB early."" Doctors of the World has now helped Sanjeevan sign up with his local surgery. Now, GPs across England are under pressure to ensure frontline staff understand exactly what the rules are - and register all eligible patients."
2016-05-01,"Ken Livingstone stands by his comments about Adolf Hitler, even though he's been suspended and may be expelled for Labour for making them – but he can't remember why he said them.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160501022905/http://news.sky.com/story/1688096/ken-cant-remember-why-he-made-hitler-remark,"Ken Livingstone stands by his comments about Adolf Hitler, even though he's been suspended and may be expelled for Labour for making them – but he can't remember why he said them. In a phone conversation, I asked the former London Mayor what point he was trying to make when he started talking about Hitler's policies in 1932. But Mr Livingstone simply replied: ""I can't remember."" Ever since he made the remarks on Thursday there has been a great deal of discussion about historical accuracy, and he was confronted about this by Labour MP John Mann on the day. Labour MP Naz Shah There has also been talk about whether the uproar around the comments were part of a Blairite conspiracy to overturn Jeremy Corbyn. And there has been a focus on whether Mr Livingstone should apologise for saying what he said. However, there has been very little discussion about what he meant by the remarks. Why did he bring it up? How did it strengthen whatever point he was trying to make? And indeed, when I asked him this, he seemed rather taken aback by the question and admitted he really couldn't remember – even though he utterly stands by the accuracy of what he was saying. I did discover that during the interview on BBC London he had been out walking the dog – and, he told me, he might not have heard exactly what the question was that prompted him to start talking about Hitler's policy. So, I had a listen back to see if I could jog Mr Livingstone's memory. Vanessa Feltz, who was conducting the interview on Thursday, had asked him about some of Labour MP Naz Shah's comments. Feltz asked him: ""She talked about relocating Israel to America. She talked about what Hitler did being legal. She talked about Jews rallying… You didn't find that to be anti-Semitic?"" Mr Livingstone replied: ""No, it was completely over the top, but it was not anti-Semitic. ""Let's remember, when Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel, he was supporting Zionism, before he went mad and ended up killing 6 million Jews."" He then went on to talk about the uneven death ratios between Palestinians and Israelis. So, you could argue there was a Hitler prompt in the question, but it still doesn't explain what Ken Livingstone was driving at in the context of Naz Shah's comments. I called back, reminded him what was said and put this point to him. Again, he was unclear. He couldn't outline what message he was trying to get across, other than he was sure it was historically accurate. He reads lots of academic books, he told me. The reference to Hitler in the question ""must have got me thinking about Hitler's policy the early 1930's,"" he said. And so he concluded: ""I should never have learned so much.""  If he was trying to make the point that anti-Zionism was not the same as anti-Semitism, and using the actions of Hitler as his evidence, then that wasn't something he seemed prepared to clarify in our phone conversation. It should be said that while he wasn't walking the dog during our exchange, he was ""stood in a pond, moving newts"". So again, he may not have fully heard the question."

A 41-year-old British man working for oilfield services firm Halliburton was among at least 13 people killed when the Airbus EC225LP aircraft crashed. The Briton is understood to be from Aberdeenshire in Scotland. The aircraft, also known as the Super Puma, came down near the city of Bergen in Norway. The CAA said in a statement: ""Following the accident the UK CAA has issued an instruction to stop any commercial passenger flights by UK operators flying the Airbus EC225LP helicopter. ""This mirrors action taken by the Norwegian CAA. The restriction does not apply to search and rescue flights. ""The accident involved a Norwegian helicopter and will therefore be investigated by the Norwegian authorities. ""We will offer any assistance that we can."" A Super Puma helicopter Police spokesman Morten Kronen said the helicopter was ""totally smashed"" in the crash in the North Sea. The aircraft had its maintenance servicing delayed twice, according to Norway's Civil Aviation Authority. A witness told Norwegian media the helicopter's rotor was seen flying away from the helicopter before it crashed. Wreckage of the rotor was found lying onshore, up to 300m away from the rest of the helicopter. ""While I looked up, the rotor loosened and disappeared towards the north,"" John Atle Sekkingstad told local newspaper Bergens Tidende. ""After that, the helicopter turned north and I saw fire at the top of the helicopter, where the rotor had been attached. ""It caught fire before it crashed."" Eleven Norwegians and an Italian were also on the flight, which crashed close to the country's west coast as it transported workers from a North Sea offshore oil field.  A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We have offered our support to the family of a British national who has sadly died in a helicopter crash in Bergen, Norway. ""Our thoughts are with all those affected. We will remain in contact with local authorities."" Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg described the tragedy as ""horrible"". Accident investigators from Britain are travelling to Norway to assist with the inquiry. State-owned Statoil, which operates the Gullfaks B platform which the helicopter was flying from, has stopped production at the site."

Detective Sergeant Matt Besch said: ""We would urge this person who has found the shotgun, to contact us so its recovery can be arranged, and we can ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands."" The gun is described as having a dark brown stock with ""rose-style"" engraving on the handle. Its wooden parts are said to look ""tatty"" from not having been oiled."

""At her request, we have removed her results from the system and she will be returning her finisher's medal to us."" Argent's results page showed she started Sunday's race at 10.16am and had completed the first 20km by 12.33pm. However, her timings for the next 20km were not visible on the site. She then reappeared at the 40km mark at 1.21pm and finished at 2pm. Organisers said there are a number of suspect times every year and around 20 out of 39,000 entrants are being investigated this year. James Argent completed the London Marathon in 2012 with a time of just over six hours. On Sunday he congratulated his sister on Twitter for her achievement but the tweet was later deleted. Sky News has contacted his representative for a comment."

A jury found Dynel Lane guilty in February of attempting to kill Michelle Wilkins on 18 March 2015 in the suburb of Longmont in Denver, Colorado. The 36-year-old was also convicted of four felony assault charges and another felony count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy. Prosecutors had pressed for the maximum sentence of 188 years. The victim, Michelle Wilkins, addressed her attacker in court She had spent months faking a pregnancy before she lured Ms Wilkins, 28, to her apartment with a Craigslist ad for maternity clothes. Lane bludgeoned Ms Wilkins over the head with a lava lamp and stabbed her in the neck with the broken glass. She then cut Ms Wilkins' abdomen, took the unborn baby and left the woman for dead. Ms Wilkins' child, later named Aurora, did not survive the attack The child, later named Aurora, did not survive the attack. Ms Wilkins addressed her attacker in court on Friday in front of a poster-sized photo of Aurora. ""It is clear that you need healing and I hope that you get it,"" Ms Wilkins told Lane. Lane had spent months faking a pregnancy Prosecutors said they could not charge Lane with murder in the unborn baby's death because of state law. Colorado Republicans introduced legislation that would have allowed such a murder charge, but Democrats rejected the measure. Some 38 US states have made killing a foetus a homicide despite objections from abortion rights supporters."

James Fairweather mouthed towards his parents ""I don't give a ****"" as he was sent down at the Old Bailey. James Fairweather and one of his weapons Justice Spencer, sentencing, said the killings were ""brutal and sadistic"". He added: ""You are well aware of the publicity this first murder attracted. ""I have no doubt you relished the sense of power and control that it gave you."" Fairweather  was 15 years old when he carried out the random attacks, emulating his idols - the Yorkshire Ripper and Ted Bundy. He demonstrates how he killed Mr Attfield He stabbed 33-year-old Mr Attfield 102 times as he lay drunk and helpless in a park in Colchester, Essex, in March 2014. Three months later, he attacked Ms Almanea, 31, with a bayonet as she walked along a nature trail in the town. He stabbed both through the eyes. Justice Spencer said: ""I have no doubt the way James Attfield screamed in pain when he was stabbed through the eye had remained with you and excited you."" Fairweather was prowling the same area for a third victim when police finally stopped his killing spree in its tracks in May last year. A police mugshot after his arrest At the time of his arrest, he was wearing gloves and armed with a lock knife. Following his conviction, Mr Attfield's mother, Julie Finch, had said: ""James Fairweather is a monster in our eyes - and we will never be able to forgive him."" The court heard Fairweather was ""turned on"" by serial killers and researched Ian Huntley, Myra Hindley and Peter Sutcliffe. Ted Bundy, who was his favourite serial killer, sexually assaulted, murdered and decapitated his victims. Fairweather, who has autism, had been playing violent computer games Call Of Duty and Grand Theft Auto since he was 13 years old. And he had a stash of horror films including Wrong Turn: The Carnage Collection, a DVD about Sutcliffe and a book called The World's Worst Crimes. Police said that after he killed, he obsessively looked up press coverage of the murders on the internet. He claimed he was possessed by the devil, admitting manslaughter - but was found guilty of the murders at the Old Bailey."

The former London mayor is Jeremy Corbyn's close ally and has a place both on Labour's National Executive and on a party defence review. Some Labour MPs are already calling for him to be expelled. After an extraordinary day in Westminster which saw tensions boil over between Mr Livingstone and colleague John Mann, some Labour MPs are already calling for him to simply be expelled. Labour's mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan said not only had Mr Livingstone's comments been ""appalling and inexcusable"", but he felt there were ""too many incidents where the Labour party leadership have appeared to take no action"" on anti-Semitism. :: 'Red Ken' No Stranger To Damning Headlines Labour MP Neil Coyle said: ""I think it should have been expulsion ... the reaction was too slow. ""As soon as Ken made the absurd suggestions he did about Hitler, the leader should have acted straight away."" Commenting later in the day, Mr Corbyn said ""grave concerns"" about Mr Livingstone's language had led to his suspension - and denied the party was tolerating anti-Semitism. But Mr Corbyn insisted there was “no crisis” and even claimed that those making this claim were “nervous of the Labour party’s strength at a local level”. This is a claim which MPs say only fans the flames of this scandal. The timing of Mr Livingstone’s outburst could not be worse – just a week ahead of local elections next Thursday in which Labour is already predicted to lose council seats. One shadow minister said: ""It's party members who are furious. I've had party members - people knocking doors for us ahead of the local elections - ringing me up threatening to resign. ""This will inflict long-term damage on Corbyn, because Ken Livingstone is a Corbynista, but I don't believe those around the leader are aware of that."" His many critics in the party are in an uneasy place, unwilling to challenge Mr Corbyn’s authority until next week's mayoral and local elections and June's EU referendum are over. But with David Cameron twice this week declaring that the Labour party has a problem with anti-Semitism, this is a charge which will continue to dog the Labour leader."

""As a fire and rescue service dealing with road traffic accidents is always difficult and even more so when a colleague or someone you know is involved."""
2016-05-03,A Somali asylum seeker is the second person in less than a week to set fire to herself at an Australian immigration detention centre in Nauru.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160503145949/http://news.sky.com/story/1688971/woman-is-second-to-set-herself-alight-on-nauru,"A Somali asylum seeker is the second person in less than a week to set fire to herself at an Australian immigration detention centre in Nauru. The 21-year-old is said to be in a critical condition at Royal Brisbane Hospital and had been on 24-hour mental health watch due to previous suicide attempts. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said that the woman, who he named as Hadon or Hodan, had suffered head injuries in November and last week had been among three asylum seekers who had been taken from recuperation in a Brisbane detention centre and flown back to Nauru. A vigil for asylum seeker Omid, who died after setting himself alight Mr Rintoul said her case ""raises particular questions about the duty of care"". Three days earlier, a 23-year-old Iranian man, named Omid, had died in the same hospital after setting himself on fire at the Pacific island camp, which holds asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat. Australia's policy on asylum seekers has attracted criticism from many groups, including the country's church leaders who have also promised to give sanctuary to those seeking refuge in the country. The policy sees everyone who arrives seeking asylum is detained and processed in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Those found to be refugees will be resettled in PNG, Nauru or Cambodia. The two are understood to have been protesting against Australia's harsh policies against asylum seekers, with the woman's actions coinciding with a visit by UN representatives, Nauru's government said. Australia's immigration minister Peter Dutton Australia's immigration minister Peter Dutton blamed refugee advocates and others ""who are encouraging some of these people to behave in a certain way, believing that that pressure exerted on the Australian Government will see a change in our policy in relation to our border protection measures"". He repeated his government's insistence that alleviating the plight of those at Nauru and Manus Island would see a flood of asylum seeker boats, saying: ""No action (that) advocates or those in regional processing countries take will cause the government to deviate from its course. We are not going to allow people to drown at sea again."" Australia's other offshore immigration camp, which is on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, was judged by a court to be unconstitutionally detaining asylum seekers. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said he would close the centre, sending Australia scrambling to make other arrangements for the 900 people housed there."

We can now add Claudio Ranieri to the ranks of managers who have led a team to English football’s highest annual honour through man-management above all else. The Leicester City squad he inherited last July wasn’t broke, and he didn’t try to fix it. But it takes a little more than that to pull off the Premier League’s most improbable triumph. Support was limited. Leicester fans’ comments to the Daily Mail included: ""Putting my money on him to be the first manager to be sacked,"" ""Half-wit, we are doomed,"" and ""Relegation!"". City vice-chairman Aiyawatt Raksriaksorn saw it differently, of course. Referencing the Italian’s time at Inter Milan, Roma, Juventus, Chelsea and Monaco, he called Ranieri ""a man of remarkable experience and knowledge that will lead us into the next phase of our long-term plan for Leicester City"". ""Long-term,"" note. Absolutely no one expected Ranieri to deliver this title, notwithstanding Leicester’s remarkable late charge to escape relegation last season. Any optimism would have been tempered by his recent failure as Greek national manager (he was sacked after a defeat against the Faroe Islands). Wrong place, wrong time, perhaps. But those who know this Roman warrior well speak of his single-mindedness, attention to detail and tactical mastery. And a steely centre beneath the charming exterior of a man who goes round shaking journalists’ hands at news conferences. He had more than enough self-belief to replace big-name Swiss international Gokhan Inler with Aston Villa reject Marc Albrighton in a changed formation. ""Dilly Ding Dilly Dong!” was surely the saying of the season - revealed when he explained how he rang a bell to wake up dozy players in training. Classic Ranieri. Humorous and serious at the same time. He dealt with his exasperation at the early-season goals Leicester leaked by promising his defenders pizza when they stopped conceding. Known a decade ago at Chelsea as the ""TInkerman"", for constantly changing his team, the Leicester incarnation has found his favoured lineup and stuck with it. Define ""team spirit"" how you like. What you can’t deny is that this collection of mostly journeymen footballers have it, that Ranieri has engendered it, and it is key to their success. And now what? He is 64, still driven, still smiling. Next season, no doubt, he will try to re-dream the impossible dream. His antiques dealer wife Rosanna might just whisper in his ear that this would be a fantastic time to conjure one more rabbit out of his hat and quit while he’s so improbably ahead. But the Champions League beckons. What’s Spanish for Dilly Ding Dilly Dong?"

The trio of Earth-like planets are similar in size to our home and are close enough for their atmospheres to be analysed with technology we already have, scientists said. ""This is the first opportunity to find chemical traces of life outside our solar system,"" Michael Gillon, an astrophysicist at the University of Liege in Belgium, said. The dwarf star is only 11% of the diameter of the Sun and is much redder Using a 60cm telescope in Chile, known as TRAPPIST, scientists tracked several dozen dwarf stars not visible with optical telescopes. After identifying the most promising one, which is about one-eight of the size of the Sun and observing it for several months, scientists noticed its infrared signal faded slightly at regular intervals, suggesting it had objects orbiting it.  The study concluded their size and proximity to the star meant all three planets could have regions at temperatures within a range suitable for sustaining liquid water and life. An artist's impression of the planets. Pic: ESO/M. Kornmesser/N. Risinger Julien de Wit, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said the team had hit the ""jackpot"". ""These planets are so close, and their star so small, we can study their atmosphere and composition,"" he said. He added that it could be determined if they are home to life ""within our generation"". For life as we know it to exist, planets have to be in a ""Goldilocks zone"" in relation to their star, far enough away so that its heat does not evaporate all the water, but close enough so that it can exist in liquid form."

A study involving the complete genetic codes of 560 people from around the world found 93 genes - including five new ones - associated with the disease. The results, published in Nature and Nature Communications, provide evidence that breast cancer genomes are ""highly individual"", researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute said. The team looked at genomes in patients - including four men - and focused on mutations that encourage the disease to grow and the patterns - known as mutational signatures - in each tumour. They found that women with genes that leave them at a higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, have entire genome profiles that are very different to each other and distinctive from other breast cancers. Dr Serena Nik-Zainal, who led the team of researchers, said: ""In the future, we'd like to be able to profile individual cancer genomes so that we can identify the treatment most likely to be successful for a woman or man diagnosed with breast cancer. ""It is a step closer to personalised healthcare for cancer."" Professor Sir Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said the discovery of gene mutations was ""crucial"" to understanding the causes of cancer. Lawrence Young, pro-vice chancellor at Warwick Medical School and professor of cancer research, said he believed the discovery was a milestone moment in the fight against breast cancer. He told Sky News: ""For the first time we have a comprehensive understanding of all the changes that occur that make normal breast tissue become cancer. ""It is a product of all the technology and understanding that's gone into reading the genome...and will help us to think of new ways of diagnosing and treating the disease. ""We should be able to find ways to intervene and prevent the disease - and that's very exciting. ""But probably more exciting and more immediate is our ability to use this information in individual breast cancer patients to better diagnose the disease and find the optimum treatment so that in that particular individual, the treatment is 100% effective."""
2016-05-03,"Islamic State and the Assad regime in Syria have been colluding with each other in deals on the battleground, Sky News can reveal.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160503145949/http://news.sky.com/story/1688756/is-files-reveal-assads-deals-with-militants,"By Stuart Ramsay, Chief Correspondent Islamic State and the Assad regime in Syria have been colluding with each other in deals on the battleground, Sky News can reveal. Our exclusive investigation into leaked secret IS files suggests one piece of co-operation was over the ancient city of Palmyra. The files also show that the militant group has been training foreign fighters to attack Western targets for much longer than security services had suspected. The revelations underscore fears in the United States that a network of sleeper cells is spread across Europe, avoiding detection, and is planning further Paris- and Brussels-style assaults. IS defectors, meanwhile, have told Sky News that Palmyra was handed back to government forces by Islamic State as part of a series of cooperation agreements going back years. New letters obtained by Sky News, in addition to the massive haul of 22,000 files handed over last month, appear to confirm this. They show: :: An agreement with the Syrian regime to withdraw IS weapons from Palmyra. :: A deal between IS and Syria to trade oil for fertiliser and; :: Arrangements to evacuate some areas by Islamic State forces BEFORE the Syrian army attacked. All appear to be pre-agreed deals and suggest direct evidence of collusion between the Syrian regime and Islamic State chiefs. For the past 18 months Sky News has maintained contacts with a Free Syrian Army group originally from Islamic State's headquarters in Raqqa, but now living across the border in Turkey. The group operates a network to smuggle defectors away from IS. Some of the defectors openly admit their prior allegiance to the terror group and acknowledge that they only left because of internal disagreements with some of the IS leadership. In reality they remain wedded to the basic tenets of Islamic State: strict Sharia law, a caliphate and on-going war against anyone deemed to be an enemy. The authenticity of the latest documents is impossible to verify, but all previous leaks of material funnelled through this group have proved to be genuine. The new documents are copies of handwritten orders sent from Islamic State's headquarters. One document requests safe passage for a driver through IS checkpoints ""until he reaches the border with the Syrian regime to exchange oil for fertiliser"". The defectors claim that this is a trade agreement between the two sides that has been going on for years. Another letter contains instructions for a commander to ""transfer all equipment and weapons to the agreed evacuation point. We have received intelligence that al Qasr and its surroundings will be bombed on 24th November, 2013"". The defectors claim this was a withdrawal agreed between Syria and Islamic State. The most interesting document was written shortly before the Syrian army recaptured the ancient city of Palmyra, after months of occupation by IS. ""Withdraw all heavy artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns from in and around Palmyra to Raqqa province,"" the document says. I asked one of the defectors if Islamic State was coordinating movement of its fighters and leaving areas they previously controlled, in direct coordination with the Syrian army and even the Russian airforce. His answer was simple. ""Of course,"" he said. Terror experts asked to analyse the documents say they show this is arguably the most complicated war they have ever tried to make sense of. ""This is a war of perception and narrative and everyone is trying to manipulate events,"" said Dr Afzal Ashraf from the think tank Royal United Services Institute. ""It may take 20 years before what we know exactly what is going on,"" he added. ""Almost certainly there will be some sort of communication going on between mortal enemies, and that is for short term tactical gains and losses. ""Certainly if there is economic trading going on, which we know there is, there would be communication."" But defectors and civilians contacted by Sky News over many months all maintain there is not just communication but widespread collusion between the various warring factions, as well as the Syrian and Iraqi governments. The United States has been particularly exasperated at air assaults by Syria’s ally Russia on groups the Americans have helped fund and train. Any evidence there is collusion with America's number one target, Islamic State, will test relations between the US and Russia even more. Our analysis of all the Islamic State files has revealed the organisation needs to maintain its caliphate in part to give it the room to train foreign jihadists to carry out attacks in Europe and further afield. Al Qaeda needed first Sudan, and then Afghanistan, for exactly the same purpose. In doing so, it co-opted failed and ungoverned areas to use for its own training and development. What the files reveal is that IS’s training programme and exporting of terror has not just been going on for months, but for years - for much longer than Western security services were aware of. Indeed, they suggest that a programme of coordinated attacks on Western countries was one of the original building blocks of Islamic State. Some of the documents, also from Islamic State's headquarters, are orders for a terrorist cell travelling out of Syria and dated November 2014. They request fighters divide into groups of four as part of an operation codenamed ""Break the siege"". The operation involved travelling over the Syrian border and deploying to ""Infidel countries"". Another set of papers, dated a month later, confirm the groups have reached their ""Specialised Areas"". One defector Sky News spoke to said Europe is the target of ""Break the siege"".

One commented: ""Gone at such a young age. you might be gone, but you will never be forgotten, Fly high angel R.I.P."" Another wrote: ""RIP Ben u will always be in my heart man I will miss you so much you will always be in everyone's heart u was so funny.

The Italian told reporters he had watched the match at home after jetting back early from a trip to see his 96-year-old mother. In a statement, he said winning his first top-flight title was an ""amazing feeling"". As reporters crowded around his car, he said: ""I'm very very happier now because maybe if I won this title at the beginning of my career now I forgot. Now I'm very very old man and I can feel much better."" Vardy and his teammates were mobbed as they went for pizza after training Ranieri - written off by some pundits when he got the job last year following his sacking by Greece - said the ""heart"" and ""soul""  of his players was key to them pulling off the nearly impossible. When asked if he had a message for fans, he said: ""Keep going, we want to improve a lot."" Leicester's title was confirmed on Monday night after Tottenham's draw with Chelsea. There were tears and wild celebrations in pubs across Leicester and outside the King Power stadium as the 2-2 draw confirmed the Foxes as unlikely champions - beating 5,000-1 odds. It was a heartbreaking night for Tottenham, who looked set to keep the title race going before letting their lead slip. Leicester defender Christian Fuchs tweeted a video showing wild celebrations at Jamie Vardy's house as the final whistle blew in west London. :: Nation Reacts To Foxes' 'Extraordinary' Win Ranieri also released a statement saying: ""I'm so proud. I'm happy for my players, for the Chairman, for the staff at Leicester City, all our fans and the Leicester community. Gallery: Leicester Fans Celebrate Premier League Title A man snuggles up to his Leicester-loving pooch outside the King Power stadium ""It's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy for everyone. ""I never expected this when I arrived. I'm a pragmatic man, I just wanted to win match after match and help my players to improve week after week. Never did I think too much about where it would take us."" Ranieri changed his plans and flew back early from Italy to watch the game, after previously saying he would be in the air during the match. After the historic win goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel tweeted: ""Words can not describe the love I have for my teammates. I dreamt of this since i was a boy and i will be forever grateful to you all ❤️"" His father, Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel, changed his Twitter biography to read simply ""Father to a Premierleague winner"".  :: Ranieri: How The Tinkerman Won The Title Words can not describe the love I have for my teammates. I dreamt of this since i was a boy and i will be forever grateful to you all ❤️ Leicester will now receive the Premier League trophy following their final home game of the season against Everton on Saturday. Despite the raucous celebrations of the night before, the players were back at training on Tuesday morning. The players posed with a ""champions"" flag as Ranieri embraced the club's Thai owners, who arrived at the training ground by helicopter. There were more cheers for the team as they stepped out together for a celebratory pizza after training. Leicester were predicted by many to be destined for a relegation scrap after pulling off their own great escape last season and managing to stay up with a late run of wins. Their typical starting eleven cost around £23m to assemble, with Premier League player of the year Riyad Mahrez costing just £400,000 and Jamie Vardy £1m. Manchester City - currently fourth in the table - paid £55m for Kevin De Bruyne last year. :: Will Our Leicester City Quiz Outfox You? Ranieri, too, raised eyebrows when he was drafted in at the start of the season after losing to the Faroe Islands as Greece's national coach. But now he looks set to lead the Foxes into the lucrative Champions League to do battle with the greats of the European game. The club will get at least £29m for making the competition and more depending on how far they progress. A few lucky punters who had a bet on Leicester will also be enjoying their own windfalls. William Hill said 25 customers went for the 5000-1 odds, with the biggest stake of £20 put down by someone in Manchester.  Bookies were offering the same or better odds for such improbabilities as Elvis being discovered alive and Simon Cowell becoming the next prime minister. William Hill's biggest overall winner was a person from Guildford who put down £75 at 1500-1, meaning a £112,500 return.  Sky Bet now has Leicester at a much improved 33-1 to repeat their success next season."

In an incident with echoes of the Smiler accident that left five people seriously injured last year, 28 people got stuck on the Galactica ride after it ground to a halt when heavy rain obscured a sensor. Alton Towers said it took 19 minutes to get 28 people down from the ride after it stopped shortly before 2pm - although some witnesses said they were stuck for between 30 and 40 minutes. Thomas Symons wrote on Twitter: ""So being stuck mid air in the pouring rain on Galactica for 30 minutes was not pleasant.."" Another Twitter user, laylaw, added: ""We were stuck at the top of it for 40 minutes! Still shaking!"" So being stuck mid air in the pouring rain on Galactica for 30 minutes was not pleasant.. Contrary to some reports, the riders were not stuck upside down, a spokesperson for the Staffordshire theme park said. Alton Towers said in a statement: ""Heavy rain obscured a sensor on Galactica which meant that the ride was automatically stopped. ""This is a standard safety feature on this ride and the ride was working exactly as it is designed to do. ""The health and safety of our guests is our number one priority and our team followed standard procedures to get the guests off as quickly and as safely as possible. ""The ride has re-opened."" So just got stuck on Galactica for 30 minutes in mid air 😂😂 and upside down trust me 😂 According to Alton Towers, Galactica is the first fully virtual reality ride to link graphics on headsets with physical twists and turns. It reopened in March after refurbishment and former International Space Station commander Chris Hadfield was the first person to ride the revamped version of the attraction.  The 20m-high ride simulates the feeling of flying as it takes riders on a 189-second journey on a virtual space station and through an asteroid field. Alton Towers bosses have been working to rebuild the park's reputation after the Smiler accident on June 2, 2015, which left teenage passengers Vicky Balch and Leah Washington needing leg amputations after their carriage collided with a stationary car.  The park's parent firm Merlin, which blamed the crash on human error, is facing a large fine after it admitted breaching health and safety rules over the incident."
2016-05-03,"Labour's ""anti-Semitism"" row is unlikely to end with Ken Livingstone's suspension, as pressure now builds on the party leadership.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160503145949/http://news.sky.com/story/1687007/hitler-row-and-questions-for-labour-leadership,"By Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent Labour's ""anti-Semitism"" row is unlikely to end with Ken Livingstone's suspension, as pressure now builds on the party leadership. The former London mayor is Jeremy Corbyn's close ally and has a place both on Labour's National Executive and on a party defence review. Some Labour MPs are already calling for him to be expelled. After an extraordinary day in Westminster which saw tensions boil over between Mr Livingstone and colleague John Mann, some Labour MPs are already calling for him to simply be expelled. Labour's mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan said not only had Mr Livingstone's comments been ""appalling and inexcusable"", but he felt there were ""too many incidents where the Labour party leadership have appeared to take no action"" on anti-Semitism. :: 'Red Ken' No Stranger To Damning Headlines Labour MP Neil Coyle said: ""I think it should have been expulsion ... the reaction was too slow. ""As soon as Ken made the absurd suggestions he did about Hitler, the leader should have acted straight away."" Commenting later in the day, Mr Corbyn said ""grave concerns"" about Mr Livingstone's language had led to his suspension - and denied the party was tolerating anti-Semitism. But Mr Corbyn insisted there was “no crisis” and even claimed that those making this claim were “nervous of the Labour party’s strength at a local level”. This is a claim which MPs say only fans the flames of this scandal. The timing of Mr Livingstone’s outburst could not be worse – just a week ahead of local elections next Thursday in which Labour is already predicted to lose council seats. One shadow minister said: ""It's party members who are furious. I've had party members - people knocking doors for us ahead of the local elections - ringing me up threatening to resign. ""This will inflict long-term damage on Corbyn, because Ken Livingstone is a Corbynista, but I don't believe those around the leader are aware of that."" His many critics in the party are in an uneasy place, unwilling to challenge Mr Corbyn’s authority until next week's mayoral and local elections and June's EU referendum are over. But with David Cameron twice this week declaring that the Labour party has a problem with anti-Semitism, this is a charge which will continue to dog the Labour leader."

The French Football Association chose the song I Was Made For Lovin' You, originally by American rock veterans Kiss. A cover version for the football competition has been done by French group Skip The Use. The words have been changed from ""I was made for lovin' you, babe"" to ""I was made for lovin' you, my team"" and the clip shows fans with tricolour flags inside a stadium as football players dance to the tune. Skip The Use's lead singer Mat Bastard told Le Parisien that he hoped the tune would get fans dancing like they did to I Will Survive, the Gloria Gaynor classic which became the national song to celebrate Les Bleus' World Cup victory at home in 1998. Andre Vallini is not happy that the French language has ""lowered its guard"" Andre Vallini, Secretary of State for Francophony, was not convinced, describing the choice of song as ""very concerning"". He added: ""Euro 2016 will be a great festival of sport which is taking place in France and will therefore project the image of our country abroad. And our language too. ""It is therefore incomprehensible that the anthem of the French national team should be in English."" Mr Vallini is also upset that France's entry in this year's Eurovision Song Contest - J'ai Cherche, by Amir - contains a chorus largely in English. ""At a time when we are defending the place of the French language in international institutions and especially European institutions... it is incomprehensible that for these two big popular events, the French language has lowered its guard,"" he said. Euro 2016 takes place from 10 June to 10 July while the Eurovision song contest takes place on 14 May."

Climbers attempting to reach the summit of Shishapangma in Tibet discovered the bodies of Alex Lowe and David Bridges encased in ice on a glacier. The bodies had clothing and backpacks that matched the gear Mr Lowe and Mr Bridges were wearing when they disappeared in 1999, the Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation said in a statement. The pair died after they were swept away during a trek that aimed to ski down the 26,291ft (8,013m) peak - the world's 14th highest. A third climber, Conrad Anker, was injured but survived. NBC News reported that the bodies were found last week. In a statement, Mr Lowe's widow Jenni Lowe-Anker said: ""Alex and David vanished, were captured and frozen in time. Now they are found. ""We are thankful. Conrad, the boys and I will make our pilgrimage to Shishapangma. It is time to put Alex to rest."" Mr Anker, who married Mr Lowe's widow in 2001, said the discovery ""brings closure and relief for me and Jenni and for our family"". Mr Lowe's accomplishments included two climbs to the top of Mount Everest, several first ascents in Antarctica and dozens of less prominent but highly technical ascents. The foundation bearing his name provides advice and financial support to humanitarian programmes that operate in remote parts of the world."

A Royal College of Physicians audit found that out of 9,000 dying patients, one in five families were not told that CPR would be withheld. That is the equivalent of up to 40,000 patients every year, the Daily Telegraph reports. Overall, it is estimated 200,000 patients every year are subject to an order not to perform CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or if a patient stops breathing. In 16% of the cases looked at by the Royal College of Physicians there was no record of a conversation with the patient about the order. Professor Sam Ahmedzai, the audit's chairman, told the Telegraph: ""When a decision has been taken, it is unforgivable not to have a conversation with the patient - if they are conscious and able - or with the family."" Doctors need to be more open with dying patients, added Prof Ahmedzai, because half of those identified as likely to be dying were dead by the next day. ""This is being done very late in the day - as doctors we just don't like to face up to it,"" he said. But he admitted that for many patients - such as those dying with cancer and dementia - resuscitation would not be appropriate. ""It would be quite inappropriate for a doctor, a crash team, to come along and start pounding on the chest, putting tubes in when actually the person is reaching the end of their life and no amount of resuscitation is going to help."" An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""We welcome the results of this audit, which we commissioned, and which shows there has been some improvement in the care provided. ""But there is clearly more that can be done. Although this audit presents a snapshot of end-of-life care within NHS hospitals, there are clear variations in the support and services received across hospitals and areas where improvements must continue to be made."""

Police chief Khurram Rasheed said the girl was drugged, strangled and put in the same van her friend used to elope. The van was then torched. The girl's mother, who supported the decision of the tribal council, or jirga, was also arrested. The group has been remanded into police custody for two weeks on murder and terrorism charges. In Pakistan, women who defy their family in the name of love are considered a source of shame. Hundreds of women are murdered in Pakistan every year by their relatives in so-called ""honour killings"". Activist Samar Minallah said tribal councils often kill women in order to teach a lesson to others in the community. ""Until and unless you take strong action against these jirga members and their supporters in the community, no law can help to stop the brutal killing of women for honour,"" she said."

Public Health England (PHE) said 29 cases of cryptosporidiosis, which causes diarrhoea, were confirmed in people who had visited Swithens Farm in Rothwell, Leeds, since the start of March. There were also two cases of E.coli, which can lead to kidney problems in serious cases. The farm, which has been run by the Broadhead family for more than 20 years, has now installed more sinks and signs reminding visitors to wash their hands after touching animals. Dr Mike Gent, PHE's consultant in communicable disease control, said it is investigating the outbreak with Leeds City Council and the Animal and Plant Health Agency. He said the farm closed voluntarily while a ""number of matters"" were addressed. Dr Gent added: ""It's important to remember when visiting a petting farm that contact with farm animals carries a risk of infection because of the bacteria they naturally carry. ""It's very easy to touch animals or surfaces which carry bacteria and then people, especially children, put their fingers in or near their mouths without first washing their hands adequately and they become infected. ""It's really important when visiting these sorts of attractions to wash your hands thoroughly using soap and water after you have been in contact with animals and especially before eating or drinking anything. ""People may be tempted to use hand gels and wipes during a farm visit and after touching animals but, although they remove visible dirt and contamination, they may not be effective in removing the germs found on farms.""

2016-05-06,Millions of Britons with old-style passports are being warned they will be turned away from the United States following a security clampdown amid terrorism concerns.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160506170751/http://news.sky.com/story/1691172/passport-warning-to-millions-heading-for-us,"Millions of Britons with old-style passports are being warned they will be turned away from the United States following a security clampdown amid terrorism concerns. Under new rules introduced by the US government, visitors travelling to America from a Visa Waiver Programme (VWP) country, including the UK, are required to have an electronic passport - one which has an embedded electronic chip. The change came into force on April 1 but some Britons, unaware of move, have reportedly been caught out and refused entry to the US. E-passports were brought in on October 2006. Passports last for 10 years so the change is thought to only affect British passports issued between April and October 2006. But with six million of the travel documents handed out each year, it is thought over three million Britons could be caught up in the change. A spokeswoman for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said after the Visa Waiver Programme Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act 2015 was passed, detail have been posted on its own and the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (Esta) websites. She added: ""CBP encourages travellers to check their passports and their current Esta status to make sure they are in compliance with the requirement. ""CBP also sent an email to the applicants whose passports would no longer be valid for travel, as long as a valid email address was on file with their applications."" The VWP scheme allows passport holders from those nations to visit the US for a period of up to 90 days. Visits that can be made include business, tourism and travel to another country. The CBP spokeswoman said those from VWP countries without an e-passport and who wished to travel to the US could obtain a non-immigrant visa. According to advice on the Home Office website, this visa can be applied for and obtained from the nearest US embassy or consulate.

Maureen Lock left the trial as jurors were played a videoed police interview of Matthew Daley, in which he described how he stabbed 79-year-old Donald Lock to death. Daley who will not be giving evidence during the trial, knifed retired solicitor Mr Lock 39 times after the older man crashed his car into the back of his vehicle at about 16mph. Matthew Daley denies murder The 35-year-old said he felt ""threatened and afraid"" as Mr Lock was driving close behind him before the collision, looking ""very angry"".. The vehicles collided after Daley made an emergency stop on the A24 at Findon, near Worthing, West Sussex, last July. ""The knife went into him and then I went in again,"" Daley told officers. ""I looked at the body and went back to my car."" Asked by an officer whether his reaction was appropriate following a minor collision, Daley replied: ""No, I don't think so, but you have to remember that I was scared."" Mr Lock, who had recently been given the all-clear from prostate cancer, died at the scene as Daley drove off. Donald Lock was stabbed 39 times His widow walked out of the trial for a second time as Daley described using ""nearly all my force"" to inflict the injuries. The jury heard Mr Lock suffered seven heads wounds, 19 deep punctures, including multiple wounds to his back, shoulder, lungs and liver. Daley told officers:  ""I'm not happy that the man has died. I'm not happy that in the final minutes of his life he was in that much pain, and I don't want to be reminded of it. ""I feel very sorry about what I have done and I don't want to see anything like that happen in my lifetime again."" Jurors heard he had recently split up from his girlfriend, but he was not upset about the break-up. He said he was the ""happiest man alive"" before the stabbing. Daley denies murder and says he acted in self-defence. Jurors have heard Daley had been suffering from mental health problems for 10 years, and that his family had ""pleaded"" with experts to section him. The trial continues.

Muhiddin Mire, 30 appeared in court charged with the attempted murder of a 56-year-old man who was attacked from behind in front of shocked travellers at the east London station on 5 December. Mire, of Sansom Road, Leytonstone, is accused of punching his victim to the ground and kicking him repeatedly, before grabbing his head and cutting a 5in (12cm) wound in his neck. The victim - known as Witness A - was in surgery for five hours after the attack. Mire also allegedly brandished the blade at other members of the public - aiming it at the throats of at least two of them before police stunned him with a Taser. Much of the incident was captured on a mobile phone - with witnesses claiming the attacker said: ""This is for Syria."" Mire appeared before Judge Richard Marks QC at the Old Bailey via video link for a plea and case management hearing. During the hearing, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC applied for four counts of attempted wounding to be added to the indictment.

A student found the remains of gang member Peter Martinez on Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn this week. It is thought that strong currents swept the 28-year-old's body to shore. His head was covered in duct tape and his feet were in a five-gallon bucket filled with 50lb (22kg) of concrete up to his shins. Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn is a popular spot NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told NBC New York: ""This individual was wrapped in plastic bags and his arms were tied behind him and his feet were submerged in concrete."" Officials say Martinez may have been asphyxiated, but it is not clear if he was alive when his feet were placed in the bucket, or when he was dumped in the water. He was identified through his tattoos and a fingerprint. Police sources told US media that Martinez was a member of the G Stone Crips crew. Jailed rap star Bobby Shmurda is also alleged to be a member of the Brooklyn street gang.  According to reports, Martinez had been arrested more than 30 times. He had been reported missing in February by his girlfriend. It is believed to be the first case documented in the US of a body found wearing cement shoes, long a mob legend. However, concrete blocks were used to anchor the bodies of two murdered criminals in waterways in New Jersey in 1941 and New York in 1964."

Sonja Farak, who worked for an Amherst laboratory which tested drug samples for police, was on methamphetamines, ketamine, cocaine, LSD and other drugs during most of her time there, even when she testified in court, according to a report. Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Maura Healey, said the information on Farak ""will no doubt have implications for many cases"". She said: ""We are deeply concerned whenever the integrity of the justice system is called into question or compromised."" Annie Dookhan was jailed for three years in 2013 for faking test results Defence lawyer Luke Ryan told the Boston Herald that Farak handled around 30,000 cases while working at the lab between 2005 and 2013. He said: ""This is a statewide scandal, and I think it's going to take an enormous toll on the system."" The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts (ACLU) said the number of criminal cases affected by Farak's misconduct could rival the approximately 40,000 cases thrown into question by the actions of Annie Dookhan, who worked at a state drug lab in Boston. Dookhan was sentenced to at least three years in prison in 2013 after pleading guilty to faking test results in criminal cases which jeopardised thousands of convictions. Matthew Segal, legal director of ACLU, said: ""It's now beyond doubt that the drug war in Massachusetts during the Dookhan-Farak era was built on a foundation of falsified evidence."" He said that prosecutors who got convictions using drug samples tested by Farak ""have an obligation to identify and notify everyone who might have been denied due process"". Farak has admitted ingesting lab ""standards"" - drug samples used as benchmarks to test against substances submitted by police for testing. Mr Segal said all cases that went through the lab should be re-examined. Farak, 37, of Northampton, pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence, stealing cocaine from the lab and unlawful possession in January 2014 and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. She served her sentence and has been released. During her own grand jury testimony, she admitted she once smoked crack before a 2012 state police accreditation inspection of the now-closed lab. She also testified that she manufactured crack cocaine for her personal use in the lab. Governor Charlie Baker has said the state will have to allocate more money to deal with the Farak scandal. He said: ""We certainly believe we are going to have a big responsibility to work with the courts and with others to make sure that people who are affected by this have the appropriate opportunity to engage in that conversation."""

Schools rated as good or outstanding now no longer have to be turned into self-governing academies free of local authority control. Major reversals have become a feature of the running of this Government: tax credits, disability payments, union laws, hunting, short money, Sunday trading, the Dubs amendment on refugee children, and now forced academisation too. A number of backbench Conservatives had told whips they did not back the plans for so-called ""forced academisation"". :: UK Election Results At A Glance :: Decision Time: Election Live Blog There is now a fluid grouping of two to three dozen liberal Tory backbenchers who are making it very difficult for the Government to get its business through the Commons. This is making the lack of a majority in the House of Lords even more difficult. The Government clearly attempted to bury this reversal on the afternoon of major election announcements. In April, David Cameron said at PMQs this plan would be featured in the Queen's Speech this month. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will feel some vindication for his decision to ask the Prime Minister about the academisation issue for 12 questions on the trot over two weeks. Privately some Government officials acknowledge that between a small majority, a minority in the Lords, a tough fiscal situation and the EU referendum, the Government's agenda is not strong. Labour may have failed to capitalise politically on this weakness. But it appears that the Opposition in the Commons, including backbench rebels, are having an impact on changing Government policy.

He will have read, then, that one of Wilson’s most famous quotes was: ""I know what’s going on … I’m going on."" So no surprise that after dismal 'Super Thursday' election results the embattled Labour leader responded to calls to quit by declaring: ""I'm carrying on. Don't worry about that. I'm carrying on. I'm fine. I'm very happy."" Mr Corbyn’s long-time ally, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who some MPs claim is ""on manoeuvres"" and wants his old comrade’s job, told Labour MPs sniping at the Labour leader to ""put up or shut up"". Was that wise? Unfortunately for Mr Corbyn, his fiercest critics in the Parliamentary Labour Party appeared to see it as an invitation rather than a slap-down. And so within minutes, rather than shut up, they put up! :: Election Results At A Glance :: Election Results Live Blog Ian Murray, who glories in the title of shadow Scottish secretary on account of being Labour’s only MP in Scotland, said voters don’t see Labour under Mr Corbyn as a credible party of government. And the veteran Jewish MP David Winnick, 82, said Mr Corbyn should consider stepping down in the interests of the party. He did say, though, that a coup in the PLP was not the best option. So far, there is indeed no coup – or plot – yet. Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell told me two days before polling day: ""If there was a Blairite plot, I’d know about it."" No doubt he would. As the king of spin acknowledged, the plotters’ main problem is that they don’t have a candidate. As we saw last year in the run-up to the leadership election won by Mr Corbyn, the Blairites have shown themselves to be non-runners (Dan Jarvis), ditherers (Tristram Hunt) or bottlers (Chuka Umunna). Another problem for the MPs Ken Livingstone calls ""embittered old Blairites"" is that the result in the English local government elections weren’t quite as dire as the Blairites feared – or hoped! In the two Parliamentary by-elections, in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, even though both were safe Labour seats, the party romped home with thumping majorities. And in Wales, Labour won 29 of the 60 seats in the Welsh Assembly, almost a working majority and better than the 27 seats predicted by YouGov in a poll published as votes were being counted. It was in Scotland that the result for Mr Corbyn and his party was an unmitigated disaster, though at least Labour had the satisfaction of seeing Nicola Sturgeon fall just short of an overall majority, winning 63 seats compared with 69 in 2011. :: Corbyn's Vow To Scotland After Labour Thrashed After the rout in last year’s general election, Labour has now been wiped off the map in Clydeside, where its Glasgow seats were once impregnable fiefdoms and – critics would claim – rotten boroughs. But what denied Ms Sturgeon her overall majority was the surge of Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Tories, in a remarkable comeback. Back in the 1980s, when original Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, was the prime minister, the Conservatives held rural seats in the Highlands, Borders and leafy glens of Perthshire - mostly represented by toffs in tweeds and, in some cases, kilts. Now the Tories, under their new 'Irn Lady', Ms Davidson, are beginning to win back many of those seats, along with seats like Eastwood, which was Tory until Jim Murphy snatched it in Mr Blair’s Labour landslide in 1997. Gallery: Super Thursday: Politicians At Polling Stations Labour's Jeremy Corbyn at his local polling station in Islington No wonder David Cameron is gloating. The Tory revival in Scotland is the best news for the Conservatives for years and good news for their prospects in the 2020 general election. The SNP’s failure to win an overall majority at Holyrood is also a severe blow to Ms Sturgeon’s hopes of a second referendum on independence. More good news for Mr Cameron. Before the Prime Minister gets too smug, however, he should consider the danger of the gains of UKIP in local government and the Welsh Assembly. In Wales, voter registration was high ahead of the referendum, bringing out UKIP voters, which could spell trouble for Mr Cameron and the Remain campaign on 23 June. If he loses the referendum, it will be Mr Cameron facing a coup or a plot. And despite poor election results, Mr Corbyn – like Harold Wilson – may go on after all.

2016-05-06,The Halifax says it is responding to the growth in Britain's ageing population by raising its upper limit for mortgages from 75 to 80.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160506170751/http://news.sky.com/story/1691345/halifax-increases-mortgage-age-limit-to-80,"The Halifax says it is responding to the growth in Britain's ageing population by raising its upper limit for mortgages from 75 to 80. The lender took its decision amid growing political concern about a lack of credit for older people. The bank announced the move in a week of renewed debate about lending practices after Barclays said it had launched a 100% mortgage – the first time such a product has been widely available since the financial crisis. The Halifax - part of the country's biggest lender Lloyds Banking Group - had earlier released the findings of its own research that suggested one in three 20 to 45-year-olds expect to be working beyond their retirement age to pay off their mortgage. It said the change it was implementing applied to new mortgage applications only and the borrower's term would be allowed to run until their 80th birthday. However, a condition that could prove a stumbling block would be a customer only qualifying if they can prove sufficient pension and investment income beyond the age of 70. Managing director for retail customer products at Halifax, Stephen Noakes, said: ""As demographics and working habits continue to change, we continually review our products and policies to ensure they reflect the evolving needs of our customers, including those who wish to continue working longer."" The industry has been reluctant in the past to offer mortgages to those of retirement age, although there has been some flexibility among smaller providers on age limits for borrowers with larger incomes. Metro Bank - a challenger to the established lenders - has no age limit. David Hollingworth, a spokesman for broker London and Country, welcomed the development from the Halifax. He said: ""The question has been, why aren't more high street names able to help older borrowers?"" The Financial Conduct Authority expects the number of consumers aged over 65 in the UK to increase by 1.1 million over the next five years so there is a growing potential market for lenders to tap - especially if customers are working on. A report from Royal London earlier this year warned that today's workers will be forced to work into their late 70s to get the same level of pension as their parents’ generation. It has been suggested that many older borrowers may be wanting to raise money to help their children or grandchildren secure deposits. A separate study from Legal & General on Tuesday forecast that the 'Bank of Mum and Dad' would be among the top ten lenders in the country this year, pumping £5bn into mortgages to help their younger relatives.   Look up all the results from the elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales."

It has emerged that two other firearms were recovered at the scene which did not belong to police. Investigators have also said that no body-worn video footage was available from the operation. An IPCC spokesman said: ""The officers involved in the incident have provided both initial accounts and full accounts to the IPCC in a process which was overseen by IPCC investigators."" Mark Love, 37, of Frittenden Road, Staplehurst, has been charged with murder and aggravated burglary in connection with Mr Blackman's death, Kent Police said. Look up all the results from the elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales."

Lonnie Franklin Jr was convicted by a Los Angeles jury on Thursday following a two-month trial. The 63-year-old, who could face the death penalty, was also found guilty on one count of attempted murder. The former trash collector was accused of fatally shooting or strangling nine women and a 15-year-old girl between 1985 and 2007. All of the victims were found dumped in alleys and rubbish bins in South Los Angeles.  An 11th victim survived after being shot, raped, pushed out of a car and left for dead in 1988. The killings came in two spurts that were 14 years apart, earning the killer the nickname the Grim Sleeper. However, police said that since his indictment in March 2011, Franklin has been linked to six more deaths. Franklin was arrested and charged in July 2010 after DNA collected from pizza crusts and napkins at a birthday party linked him to more than a dozen crime scenes. Prosecutors said he went after vulnerable young black women during LA's crack cocaine epidemic. Some of the victims were prostitutes and most had traces of cocaine in their systems, authorities said. Franklin's defence claimed a ""mystery man"" committed the killings, but the prosecution dismissed the theory as a fabrication."
2016-05-10,A white South African judge has been condemned after comments emerged in which she suggested rape is part of black culture.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160510103412/http://news.sky.com/story/1693048/south-african-judges-rape-remarks-racist,"A white South African judge has been condemned after comments emerged in which she suggested rape is part of black culture. High Court Judge Mabel Jansen made the remarks in Facebook messages to social justice activist Gillian Schutte. Referring to black people, Ms Jansen wrote: ""In their culture a woman is there to pleasure them. Period. ""It is seen as an absolute right and a woman's consent is not required."" Ms Jansen, who sits in the High Court in Pretoria, added: ""I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious."" ""Murder is also is not a biggy. And gang rapes of baby, daughter and mother (are) a pleasurable pastime."" The comments were made around a year ago, but they resurfaced at the weekend in a Facebook post by Ms Schutte. Petitions have since been launched to remove her as a judge amid a social media storm. Local media reported that Ms Jansen was not responding to questions as her husband died on Saturday. On Monday, she said on Twitter that she had been ""taken completely out of context"". ""What I stated confidentially to somebody in a position to help has been taken completely out of context and referred to specific court cases,"" she said. Ms Schutte claims the comments were made in public posts and were not part of a private conversation. ""Mabel Jansen did not contact me for advice on victims as she claims. She joined in a fb debate and then inboxed me on same day,"" she said on Twitter. Political parties have rushed to condemn Ms Jansen's remarks. What I stated confidentially to somebody in a position to help has been taken completely out of context and referred to specific court cases The opposition Democratic Alliance party said the comments were ""not only hurtful and demeaning"", but undermined ""the dignity of our people"". It said it would report the comments to South Africa's Judicial Services Commission to investigate whether she breached her judicial oath. The women's league of the ruling African National Congress also criticised the judge. ""Her comments made on Facebook where she claims that the rape of young children is part of black culture, are purely racist and misrepresentation of facts about black culture,"" it said. The league also questioned whether the judge could deal fairly with cases of rape in court. The outrage comes after a series of racism rows sparked by comments on social media. Earlier this year a white estate agent Penny Sparrow was widely criticised after her racist Facebook post went viral. In it she complained about black people littering beaches and likened them to ""monkeys"". In the ensuing uproar, a local government employee Velaphi Khumalo wrote in another viral Facebook post that blacks should act towards whites ""as Hitler did to the Jews""."

Mr Khan arrived at City Hall to be greeted by a crowd of wellwishers, following his victory in last week's election. He received a total of 1,310,143 votes - 57% of the total - compared to Conservative Zac Goldsmith's 994,614, after the capital had its largest ever turnout at 45.6%. Mr Khan's victory ends eight years of Conservative leadership at City Hall, under Boris Johnson. Labour's former Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has highlighted Mr Khan's success as an example of the sort of tactics the party needs to adopt if it is to succeed at the ballot box. The new Mayor was widely seen to have distanced himself from party leader Jeremy Corbyn's left-wing agenda. Ms Cooper, who lost out in last year's leadership contest, said Mr Corbyn must urgently develop a strategy to win back votes across Britain. She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ""We don't know what is going on in the Tory Party, at what point they will change leaders. ""Therefore we need a plan and a strategy to win votes across the country, because we need a Labour government."" Jeremy Corbyn is expected to address Labour MPs after being warned by Mr Khan that he must appeal to voters beyond the party's core support. The new London Mayor used a series of media appearances over the weekend to issue a warning about the party's direction. Yvetter Cooper says Labour needs a new strategy to win back votes Mr Corbyn was a notable absentee from his signing-in ceremony, but the two men are expected to hold talks today."

Mohammed Zaman is accused of manslaughter after a customer with a severe peanut allergy died after eating a curry from his takeaway - even though the diner had insisted his meal must be nut-free. Paul Wilson suffered a severe anaphylactic shock after ordering the meal from the Indian Garden restaurant in North Yorkshire. The 38-year-old was found dead by a flatmate at their home, and when police began to investigate his death, they discovered ""no nuts"" had been written on the lid of his curry - as well as on the order slip back at the restaurant. A prosecutor told Teesside Crown Court that Zaman had a ""reckless and cavalier attitude to risk"" and had been warned by a trading standards officer to change his business' practices only a week before Mr Wilson died in January 2014. The court was also told that, in the weeks before his death, a teenage girl had been treated in hospital for an allergic reaction caused by the peanuts in a curry ordered from another restaurant owned by Zaman. She had been assured by the restaurant's staff that her meal would be free of nuts, the jury heard. Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said Zaman had swapped from using almond powder to cheaper groundnut powder, which contains peanuts, in June 2013. Mr Wright added: ""Mohammed Zaman received numerous warnings that he was putting his customers' health, and potentially their lives, at risk. ""Tragically for Paul Wilson, Mohammed Zaman took none of those opportunities and ignored all the warnings he was given. ""The evidence will establish that Mohammed Zaman put profit before safety and that he cut corners at every turn."" Zaman, from Huntington in York, denies manslaughter by gross negligence, perverting the course of justice, and six food safety offences. The trial continues."

Christopher Hampton will serve a minimum of 22 years after he admitted killing the teenager in the early hours of 9 June, 1984, as she made a 20-minute walk home alone following a night out with friends.  Melanie was sexually assaulted and died from multiple stab wounds to her chest and back. Her body was discovered at 5.30am by a milkman and his son, near a block of garages a short distance from her home. Melanie's family said she was 'caring, kind, sensible and intelligent' Hampton, from Staple Hill Road, Fishponds, Bristol, had been due to stand trial at Bristol Crown Court on Monday after denying the charge, but changed his plea at the last minute. Members of Melanie's family, including her 81-year-old mother Jean, sat in the public gallery of court room one to hear Hampton admit his guilt. Grey-haired Hampton, wearing glasses and a black suit and shirt, stood up and clearly replied ""Guilty"" as the murder charge was put to him. The painter and decorator was caught only after his 41-year-old daughter was arrested over a minor incident in 2014 and her DNA profile was put on the national database. A familial match was identified with DNA taken from Melanie's body and clothing in 1984 - prompting police to request a mouth swab from Hampton.  His DNA was found to match the sample taken from staining on Melanie's trousers. Hampton had refused to answer questions in police interviews, referring to a statement read by his lawyer that merely said: ""I did not kill or rape Melanie Road."" After Hampton's guilty plea, Melanie's mother described what it had been like to see the man who had evaded justice for her daughter's murder for so long. She said: ""When we finally went to the court in Bath and I saw this man standing there I thought 'it's not a man, he's a monster,' how could he do that? ""And then I realised that his wife and his daughter were sitting behind me - both blonde hair, the same as Melanie. ""How could he do that to somebody and then live with people like that and them not knowing? ""It hurts beyond repair. I always said if I got hold of him I'd strangle him or stick a knife into him, but I wouldn't even use my energy up on him. ""I feel he should be shut up in a dungeon...and left to rot, because he's not worth looking after."" Weeping as she read a victim impact statement in court, Melanie's sister Karen said she felt like she had been ""living in a horror film"" and her sister's death had affected every aspect of her life. She said: ""For me and my family, nothing has ever felt safe again. This is a nightmare I can't ever wake up from."" She said Melanie was ""caring, kind, sensible and intelligent"" about life and going travelling, but ""her future was brutally taken"". Melanie's brother Adrian said: ""I have spent the last 32 years worrying about every man that ever walked down the street, asking myself, 'did you kill our little sister Melanie?'."""

The Indian firm said that while those submissions were progressing to the next stage of the bid process, it was also ""clarifying outstanding points with a number of other parties"". Tata added that others who had expressed an interest had been thanked for their participation but told their plans were not currently being considered. The statement said: ""As previously announced, it is Tata Steel Europe’s primary intention to assess expressions of interest for the whole of Tata Steel’s UK business. ""The seven expressions of interest being immediately taken forward are on this basis. Expressions of interest for parts of the UK business are not being taken forward at this point."" Tata Steel UK was put up for sale earlier this year after losses grew to £1m a day. It left 11,000 jobs hanging in the balance - 4,000 of them at the sprawling Port Talbot works in south Wales. The bidders were not identified by Tata but they are known to include Excalibur Steel - essentially a management buyout vehicle - and metals group Liberty House. Excalibur wants 10% of its funding to come from employees, including those in the buyout team, and is also counting on support from the Government which has raised the prospect of taking a 25% stake in any winning bid. It is currently seeking the support of banks. Last week, Excalibur said taking on the company's large pension obligations was ""off the table"". Liberty believes Port Talbot's future lies with the production of recycled steel rather than slab, in a move that would see blast furnaces replaced by electric arc furnaces. It has placed an emphasis on the business being competitive - calling on the Government to cut energy costs further. Commenting on the way forward, Tata's group executive director Koushik Chatterjee, said: ""The expressions of interest received have been through a robust initial assessment process with inputs received from the UK Government whose views have been considered by the board. ""We believe that the bids being taken forward offer future prospects of sustainability for the UK business as a whole. ""The sales process will continue as announced earlier in an expedited and robust manner to deliver greater clarity for all key stakeholders such as employees, customers and suppliers."" Tata said the next phase of the sales process would be giving interested parties access to further business information and management team presentations."

Thousands of homes were burnt to the ground, but authorities say the damage is far less extensive than first feared. Officials have toured the town for the first time following the evacuation of 88,000 people. They discovered blocks of residential properties that have been reduced to blackened ruins. But despite the damage, officials say that the battle to contain the wildfires may have reached a turning point. Drizzle has started to fall in some areas and favourable winds have turned the fires' advance away from the city. :: Rain Offers Hope For Blaze-Hit Firefighters Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said some 2,400 structures in Fort McMurray were burnt, but added that officials were encouraged by how much of the town escaped destruction. It is estimated almost 90% of the buildings were saved. The wildfires have burnt around 204,000 hectares of land in Alberta. Ms Notley said: ""We were really encouraged ... to see the extent of residential communities that were saved. ""That of course doesn't mean there aren't going to be some really heartbreaking images for some people to see when they come back."" ""First responders and repair crews have weeks of work ahead of them to make the city safe for the people of Fort McMurray and the surrounding communities. ""But it is going to be made safe. It is a home you will return to. And we are going to work together to get this job done."" Ms Notley added that it is still not safe for residents to enter the city without an escort. Many parts of the town are still smouldering and large areas remain without power, water and gas. All schools except one that had been under construction were intact. Insurance experts earlier lowered their estimates of the cost of damage from the blaze, which began on 1 May. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed a multi-year commitment by the national government to rebuild Fort McMurray. ""We will support and invest in rebuilding Fort McMurray in a broad range of ways in the coming days, weeks, months and yes, years,"" he said. :: Watch a Sky News special report on the Canada wildfires at 9.30am, 3.30pm and 8.30pm."

The plan contained in Nicky Morgan's Education White Paper to make all schools into academies has been ditched. Schools rated as good or outstanding now no longer have to be turned into self-governing academies free of local authority control. Major reversals have become a feature of the running of this Government: tax credits, disability payments, union laws, hunting, short money, Sunday trading, the Dubs amendment on refugee children, and now forced academisation too. A number of backbench Conservatives had told whips they did not back the plans for so-called ""forced academisation"". :: UK Election Results At A Glance :: Decision Time: Election Live Blog There is now a fluid grouping of two to three dozen liberal Tory backbenchers who are making it very difficult for the Government to get its business through the Commons. This is making the lack of a majority in the House of Lords even more difficult. The Government clearly attempted to bury this reversal on the afternoon of major election announcements. In April, David Cameron said at PMQs this plan would be featured in the Queen's Speech this month. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will feel some vindication for his decision to ask the Prime Minister about the academisation issue for 12 questions on the trot over two weeks. Privately some Government officials acknowledge that between a small majority, a minority in the Lords, a tough fiscal situation and the EU referendum, the Government's agenda is not strong. Labour may have failed to capitalise politically on this weakness. But it appears that the Opposition in the Commons, including backbench rebels, are having an impact on changing Government policy. Look up all the results from the elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales."

2016-05-10,"The multimillionaire founder of JD Wetherspoon is donating £200,000 to the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union (EU).",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160510103412/http://news.sky.com/story/1693104/wetherspoon-boss-gives-200k-to-back-brexit,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The multimillionaire founder of JD Wetherspoon is donating £200,000 to the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union (EU). Sky News has learnt that Tim Martin, the pubs giant's chairman, has handed the sum to Vote Leave as it struggles to keep pace with the financial firepower of the opposing camp, Britain Stronger in Europe (BSiE). His donation makes Mr Martin one of the most recognisable corporate figures to emerge as a backer of either of the official EU referendum campaign groups. While many of the donors to both sides of the debate are relatively anonymous, Mr Martin - who confirmed his donation on Monday night - has a significant public profile. A vocal advocate of Brexit, Mr Martin has signed a number of letters arguing that leaving the EU will give the UK greater economic freedom. The founder of JD Wetherspoon nearly four decades ago, he has repeatedly said that small businesses are hampered by red tape from Brussels. Mr Martin's donation will come as a welcome boost to Vote Leave's coffers ahead of the first disclosure of donations by the Electoral Commission on Wednesday. Sky News revealed last week that BSiE has already raked in £14m from donors - twice the amount it is permitted to spend during the ten weeks before polling day. Scores of backers, led by multimillion pound contributions from David Harding, a hedge fund tycoon, and Lord Sainsbury, have contributed the vast total, which is said by insiders to be more than twice the amount raised by Vote Leave. BSiE's fundraising - which remains ongoing - highlights the fact that some expenses, such as some staffing costs, are excluded from the £7m limit. An insider said that a significant sum had been spent by BSiE - which is chaired by the former Marks & Spencer chairman Lord Rose - prior to the commencement of the formal referendum period. The £14m raised so far by BSiE may differ from the amount outlined next week by the Electoral Commission owing to the cut-off points for the regulator's disclosure of donations. This week's publication will cover the period from 1 February to 21 April. However, a source close to the Remain campaign said it would go beyond regulatory requirements by naming all donors above the £7,500 threshold - not only those who committed money between February and April. That list will include dozens of individuals, as well as the investment banks Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley - a quartet which has collectively handed over approximately £1.5m. Virgin Media's owner Liberty Global, which disclosed in a regulatory filing in the US last week that it was seeking shareholders' permission to donate up to £500,000, will not be named on next week's list. A series of fundraising events have been held by BSiE in recent weeks, with David Cameron and George Osborne among the attendees. Vote Leave has secured significant donations from City figures such as Paul Marshall, a prominent hedge fund manager, and Peter Cruddas, the CMC Markets boss. Others including Crispin Odey and Michael Hintze have also been linked with potential donations to Vote Leave, underscoring the extent to which financiers are dominating the funding of the rival campaigns."
2016-05-10,The last London Labour mayor was Ken Livingstone.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160510103412/http://news.sky.com/story/1690858/boxing-clever-capitals-new-king-sadiq-khan,"The last London Labour mayor was Ken Livingstone. Still one thing the freshly expelled-from-the-party Mr Livingstone and the newly-crowned Mayor of London Sadiq Khan have in common is that they are not politicians to walk away from a fight. Mr Khan learned to box as a child growing up on a Tooting housing estate. It was to combat the racism. He's been landing blows and dodging punches ever since, first as a human rights lawyer with some very controversial cases and then as a Labour MP. Here's what you need to know about the man who now has control of the capital's £17bn budget. :: Son of a ... Pakistani bus driver. It's how he describes himself and he jokes: ""You wait for a Pakistani bus driver's son to come along. Then two come along at once."" (Business Secretary Sajid Javid is also the son of a Pakistani bus driver). :: London Living? Council estate kid, one of eight children, attended a tough comprehensive, shared a bunk-bed until age 24. Went to university, got a degree in law, became a human rights lawyer. :: Married? To another lawyer. Two daughters. Mr Khan with his wife Saadiya :: MP For? Tooting – since 2005. Has also been transport minister and shadow justice secretary and shadow minister for London. :: Style? As a trained pugilist he's used to a scrap. He was the man who successfully ran Ed Miliband’s leadership campaign. And he is tireless. Mr Khan should not be underestimated. He was not expected to win the Labour candidacy - he was up against the popular Dame Tessa Jowell. But he did. :: First job? Human rights lawyer, who became a partner at a precociously young age. He defended, in his own words, some ""unsavoury individuals"" including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. In the early 2000s, Mr Khan attempted to have the ban on Farrakhan entering Britain overturned – then home secretary Jack Straw said he posed a risk to community relations. Farrakhan had called white people ""devils"", Jewish people ""bloodsuckers"" and said Hitler was a ""great man"". The ban was not overturned. Defending Farrakhan :: What drives him? Giving back - and the fight. Colleagues say he still enjoys the fight. A teacher suggested that he might be better suited to a career as a lawyer, rather than one as a dentist. In the end he chose human rights over corporate law because he wanted to give something back and not for personal gain. :: What he's promised to deliver? To be ""a mayor for all Londoners"". The biggest manifesto pledge was on housing – affordable housing for Londoners. The mayoral marathon requires endurance Mr Khan will build more homes, offer part-buy part-rent homes, provide starter homes for under £450,000 and ring-fence new homes on brownfield sites for London people (ie not rich foreigners).

2016-05-10,The high-speed choreography of Formula One pit stops could help save the lives of critically ill babies.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160510103412/http://news.sky.com/story/1693193/f1-crew-helps-nurses-save-premature-babies,"By Thomas Moore, Health & Science Correspondent The high-speed choreography of Formula One pit stops could help save the lives of critically ill babies. Doctors and nurses at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, are being trained by the Williams pit crew in the hope of fine-tuning the resuscitation of premature newborn babies. The Formula One team is the slickest so far this season, changing four tyres in just two seconds. Sky News was exclusively invited to the Williams HQ in Oxfordshire to watch the interaction between the medical team and the pit crew. Dr Rachel Hayward, a neonatal care specialist at the hospital, approached the team after realising that vital seconds were being lost in treating babies with breathing problems. She told Sky News: ""They said to us, 'We are putting wheels on cars and you are saving lives. We can't see what the analogy is'. ""And we said, 'If your mechanic doesn't put a bolt on a wheel correctly then you may lose your driver's life on the first bend. If we don't do something right in our resuscitation processes, we lose a baby'."" The Williams team practises around 2,000 pit stops a season in the hope of shaving a few tenths-of-a-second from the tyre-change. Small mistakes can cost positions on the track. Gemma Fisher, a human-performance specialist at Williams, said: ""That's a lot of pressure to deal with. ""It's a different pressure to what the doctors and nurses are dealing with at the hospital but it binds those people and builds that team ethic: even more so because they are in such a complex and stressful environment."" The collaboration between the Formula One team and the hospital has already resulted in unneeded equipment being removed from the emergency trolley and a dedicated area being marked out in maternity operating theatres for the neonatal team to work in. The doctors and nurses now hope to start filming resuscitation attempts from cameras attached to their bodies so they can learn from any mistakes or hesitation to further improve their performance. After watching the pit crew practising, Louise Cleaton, lead nurse on the project, said: ""Everybody has a job to do, it is the way forward. ""We are not aiming at targets of time, we are aiming at efficiency with less stress. A baby is a delicate living thing we have to treat gently."" Hospitals are increasingly looking to other industries to improve efficiency. The Ferrari Formula One team has worked with Great Ormond Street Hospital to help doctors transfer children from operating theatres to intensive care, and North Bristol NHS Trust pioneered airline industry-style safety checks to improve the care of surgical patients."

The study, funded by the British Heart Foundation, looked at 13 treatments recommended for patients who suffered a NSTEMI, the most common type of heart attack where the blood flow to the heart is partially blocked. They found that for patients treated across 247 hospitals in England and Wales between 2003 and 2013, nearly 90% did not receive at least one of the interventions they should have been given. Advice to stop smoking, a rehabilitation programme to improve patients' diet, and the prescription of statin drugs to reduce cholesterol were among missed treatments that would have given patients the best chance of survival. Other frequently missed interventions included the prescription of an anti-blood clotting drug known as a P2Y12 inhibitor. Doctors were failed to provide advice to improve patients' diets ""If all eligible patients in the study had received optimal care at the time of guideline publication, then 32,765 deaths may have been prevented,"" said researchers from the University of Leeds and University College London. Dr Chris Gale, associate professor of cardiovascular health sciences at the Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, said: ""What we've highlighted here is the unacceptable deficit in the care being given to people after they've had an NSTEMI heart attack. ""We calculate that roughly one patient per month per hospital in England and Wales is losing their life as a direct consequence of this deficit. ""The good news is that now we've identified the problem, we can certainly fix it. Simple interventions, such as prescribing statins, are being missed, and this is resulting in loss of life."" The results of the study have been published in the European Heart Journal: Acute Cardiovascular Care."

Officials said ""following the events during the morning of Thursday's elections"" Andrew Travers was leaving ""by mutual consent"".  People were asked to ""return later if possible"" after a mistake meant names were left off voting lists at the 155 polling stations, sparking anger from those who were unable to cast their votes. Among them was the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who was unable to return to vote because he was travelling to Amsterdam. Staff at polling stations were told that there had been a ""printing error"". Please can voters unable to vote this morning return to their polling station later if possible. We apologise for these problems. The council could face a legal challenge over the results because of the mistake. London Assembly Conservative Leader Conservative group leader Gareth Bacon has called for a ""full explanation"" for the ""abysmal administrative performance. The Conservatives narrowly missed out on getting an assembly seat under the list system in an area with a high Jewish population, following the anti-Semitism crisis engulfing Labour. He said: ""The total incompetence of London Elects and Barnet Council in their handling of this ballot has led to serious questions over the Londonwide list result and caused huge delays in the counting process. ""To have voters turned away for any reason is completely unacceptable. The votes that were unable to be cast could very well have altered the result of the Londonwide list allocation."" Recommend you take polling cards with you to polling stations in Barnet as they appear to have a problem identifying voters Women's Equality Party mayor candidate Sophie Walker has registered a complaint with the council and the London Assembly. Speaking on Thursday, she said: ""I am very disappointed. I have spent my morning responding to messages from people upset that they could not vote. ""Women first got the vote 100 years ago and there are women today who have been able to vote."" A council spokesman said: ""Following the events during the morning of Thursday's elections, it has been decided, by mutual agreement, that Andrew Travers, chief executive, will leave the council."""

The exercise began at midnight when a man playing the part of a suicide bomber entered the crowded centre before pretending to detonate a bomb. Hundreds of volunteers played the role of shoppers, screaming in panic and fleeing while others collapsed on the ground covered in fake blood. The sound of gunfire was also heard rattling around the shops. Emergency services including counter-terrorism police, fire and ambulance crews - who had not been told the precise nature of the exercise - rushed to the scene as if they were dealing with a real event. Volunteers were assured no live rounds would be used and within minutes groups of armed police arrived and entered the centre while stepping over 'injured' members of the public.  The exercise has been designed to appear as real as possible to allow officials to measure the response of emergency services in the event of a real terrorist attack in the UK. Sky News revealed on Monday that a leading police firearms unit had been ""inundated"" with requests from unarmed officers to retrain after the Paris attacks. The Trafford Centre, which is the second largest shopping centre in the UK and attracts some 35 million visitors every year, will be open for business as usual this morning. Similar exercises are expected to continue at undisclosed locations throughout the day."

Jurors were told that Matthew Daley, 35, instead had an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that went undiagnosed for years. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Roderick Ley made the assessment of Daley after he was arrested following the fatal stabbing of Donald Lock. Mr Lock, 79, was knifed 39 times after crashing at about 16mph into the back of Daley's Ford Fusion car on the A24 near Worthing in West Sussex on July 16 last year. The minor crash happened after great-grandfather Mr Lock, who was returning from a cycling meeting, was forced to brake suddenly when Daley made an emergency stop. Mr Lock, who had recently been given the all-clear from prostate cancer, died at the scene as Daley sped off. Jurors have heard that Daley had been suffering from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had ""pleaded"" with mental health experts to section him. Dr Ley told the trial at Lewes Crown Court: ""It's clear that the diagnosis of Asperger's was wrong. He has an underlying paranoid schizophrenic illness that was undiagnosed for many, many years."" The court was told of an incident outside a pub in which Daley held down a man he suspected was in a relationship with his girlfriend, telling him repeatedly: ""Do you yield?"" Dr Ley said Daley was not psychotic every moment of every day. And Daley would often ""downplay"" his symptoms, jurors were told. Dr Ley agreed that Daley exhibited ""narcissistic"", ""histrionic"" and ""self-centred"" traits, adding that it was unlikely he would ever have complete resolution of his illness. The court also heard that while working as a lifeguard, he started hearing voices of young children and believed people were projecting thoughts into his head. A week before the trial, the chief executive of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust wrote an apology to Daley's family, saying his care ""should have been better"", the court has heard. In court hearing the evidence were Mr Lock's widow Maureen, and relatives of Daley, including his mother Lynda. Daley, formerly of Worthing, denies murder, but admits manslaughter through diminished responsibility."

An official foundation which showcases the inmate's artwork has sold one of his pictures with the proceeds going to the fundraising page of Ben Baddeley, who has cerebral palsy. Bronson's Kray tribute raised £510 for the child's cause after an unnamed person's winning bid on eBay. Ben's mother Amy Baddeley told Sky News that the prisoner had seen the child's story and has also drawn another piece for Ben to keep. Bronson's Kray tribute sold for £510 on eBay Last week the 11-year-old boy walked up to 10 Downing Street to hand deliver a letter, asking that the NHS provide the physio that has helped him walk independently for the first time. Almost two years ago, Ben, from Stoke-on-Trent, had an operation on spinal nerves to relax painful muscle contortions in his limbs. But just five days before he was due to have surgery, the NHS withdrew funding - saying the benefits were uncertain. A private benefactor stepped in, but Ben's parents say they weren't warned that it would mean all subsequent treatment would also have to be paid for privately. The couple have been paying almost £2,000 a month - with the help of fundraising - for specialist treatment that allows him to walk on his own. But they will soon run out of money, halting his progress. In a letter he delivered on 4 May, Ben, who has spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, said: ""I see three different types of doctors who my mum and dad pay for me to see by fundraising. ""They all tell me that I'm doing well and I've learned to walk upstairs on my own. ""If the doctors I see now have decided that my treatment is working shouldn't that mean that I should get my treatment by the NHS?"" He added: 'My mum and dad speak to the NHS all the time but I'm still not getting help and none of the other kids are either. ""I'm not the only child with cp (cerebral palsy) having this problem. ""Please can you help us Mr Cameron? We all need the NHS, so please can you fix it?"" A week on, Ben's parents say they have not yet had a reply from the Prime Minister."

Daljinder Kaur and her 79-year-old husband became parents last month following two years of treatment at a clinic in the northern state of Haryana. The baby was conceived using the couple's own egg and sperm and, despite being very small at birth, weighing just two kilograms (4.4lbs),  was now ""healthy and hearty"", the National Fertility and Test Tube centre said. Mrs Kaur said she did not believe she was too old to be a first-time mother and said she felt very well and fit enough to cope. She said she and her husband of 46 years had almost given up hope of ever having a child and had faced ridicule in a country where infertility is sometimes seen as a curse from God. ""God heard our prayers. My life feels complete now. I am looking after the baby all by myself, I feel so full of energy. My husband is also very caring and helps me as much as he can,"" Ms Kaur revealed. ""When we saw the (IVF) advert, we thought we should also give it a try as I badly wanted to have a baby of my own,"" she said. Mrs Kaur gave her age at around 70 - many people in India do not have birth certificates and only have a rough idea of their actual age - but the clinic said in a statement that she was 72. Her husband, Mohinder Singh Gill, who owns a farm outside Amritsar, said he was unconcerned about their age, saying God would watch over their child whom they named Armaan. ""People say what will happen to the child once we die. But I have full faith in God. God is omnipotent and omnipresent, he will take care of everything,"" he said. Anurag Bishnoi, who runs the fertility clinic, said he was initially unsure about going ahead with the treatment, but tests indicated the mother would be able to carry the unborn baby. ""I first tried to avoid the case because she looked very frail. Then we made her undergo all the tests and once all the results were okay we went ahead,"" Dr Bishnoi said. The case is not the first in India, with a 72-year-old woman from Uttar Pradesh state reportedly giving birth to twins in 2008, also through IVF."

Dr Michael Todd Schulenberg treated the musician on 7 April and 20 April, and he was interviewed by police. The suburban Minneapolis hospital where he worked was also searched, according to the warrant. A law enforcement official told the Associated Press news agency that investigators are looking into whether Prince died from an overdose, and whether a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death. Mementos left by fans at the star's Paisley Park home in Minneapolis The search warrant - obtained on Tuesday by news outlets before authorities moved to seal it - did not specify which medications had been prescribed, or whether Prince had taken them. :: DNA Testing Of Prince's Blood Can Go Ahead Amy Conners, a lawyer for Dr Schulenberg, declined to comment, citing patient confidentiality. Dr Schulenberg is the second doctor whose name has emerged in the investigation. Last week, a lawyer for California addiction specialist Dr Howard Kornfeld said Prince's representatives had contacted him seeking help a day before the superstar was found dead on 21 April. Dr Kornfeld sent his son Andrew, who is not a doctor, because he could not immediately fly to Minnesota and had arranged for Prince to be evaluated by a doctor there on the day he died. Andrew Kornfeld was one of those who found the star unconscious in an elevator at his home. The search warrant was carried out on Thursday last week at North Memorial Medical Center, in the Minneapolis suburb of Robbinsdale. Lesa Bader, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Dr Schulenberg was a primary care physician at its Minnetonka clinic but said he no longer worked for the health care system. She declined to say why. Gallery: Pop Genius Prince: The Purple Life Prince's publicist has confirmed the music icon was found dead at his Minneapolis home Prince's treatment on 7 April came on the day he cancelled shows in Atlanta, citing illness. He then went on to play alternative shows on 14 April. During his return home on 15 April, his plane made an emergency stop in Moline, Illinois. The law enforcement official said he had been found unconscious on the plane and given a shot of Narcan - used in suspected opioid overdoses. Dr Schulenberg told a detective that he was dropping off test results when he discovered the singer, according to the warrant. He told officials that he had prescribed Prince ""medicine"", with the prescription to be filled at a Walgreens store. The warrant sought ""any and all medical records, documents, reports, charts, photographs, prescriptions, doctor notes and medical images for Prince Rogers Nelson""."

The former prime minister argued that sticking with the EU is the only way Britain can tackle global tax avoidance in his first big intervention on Europe ahead of the referendum on 23 June. In a pitch to left-leaning voters, Mr Brown said only Europe could push through a global effort to clamp down on tax avoidance in the face of a recalcitrant US. ""If we are to ensure no hiding places for tax evaders, no safe haven for tax avoiders and no treasure islands for the money launderers who hide an estimated $7.5 trillion (£5.2 trillion) of global wealth, we need the automatic exchange of tax information worldwide,"" he wrote in the Guardian. ""Britain cannot achieve this on its own. And with America currently resisting reciprocal tax arrangements, collective action by all 28 countries of the European Union to blacklist avoiders, impose sanctions and even levy withholding taxes - on our own overseas territories, if necessary - is currently the one game in town,"" he added. :: 100 Things About The EU Mr Brown also warned Britain faces a ""dog-eat-dog"" race to the bottom in workers' rights if voters decide to leave the EU, claiming the bloc ensured that ""markets need morals"". The former prime minister's remarks came in a speech at the London School of Economics - and is expected to be the first in a series of interventions planned for the remaining 43 days of the campaign. With opinion polls close, the Remain camp are acutely aware it needs to galvanise Labour voters, who tend to be younger and more pro-European, to secure victory. Mr Brown, who argued against joining the euro when chancellor, is not viewed as a slavish Europhile - which the Remain camp hopes will give him more credibility with undecided voters. :: If UK Quits EU: Answers To The Key Questions Mr Brown made what was considered an important intervention in the Scottish referendum debate in 2014, when the Scot made an impassioned speech imploring his fellow countrymen to reject independence and remain part of the UK. Ahead of his speech, Mr Brown said he wanted to offer a different ""view of Britishness that confronts the UKIP-inspired culture war head on"" that is ""outward-looking - and engaged in the world."" He said Britain was stronger co-operating with Europe than going it alone, and sought to reassure voters that remaining part of the EU did not rob voters of their sovereignty: ""Put simply, the future lies not in the United States of Europe but in a United Europe of States."" Mr Brown also said the prime minister should put British overseas territories and crown dependencies on a tax haven blacklist if they fail to have public registers of company ownership. :: EU Vote: Who Are Team In And Team Out? His EU pitch comes as Vote Leave campaigner Boris Johnson started his own battle-bus UK tour in Cornwall. The former London mayor brandished a bunch of asparagus spears and a Cornish pasty as he launched the Brexit roadshow, claiming the vote offered a ""once-in-a-lifetime chance for us to take back control of our country and our democracy"". Meanwhile, a senior backbench MP has accused the Remain camp of over-hyping the dangers of an EU exit. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, told Chancellor George Osborne that he and other ministers risked weakening the case for staying with warnings about job losses, falling house prices, terrorism and even war."

Speaking at the London premiere of Alice Through The Looking Glass, produced by Tim Burton, Depp said: ""He was a supremely unique talent. That voice, that persona. There's hardly anyone unique anymore. He was unique."" The 52-year-old, who returns to the role of the Mad Hatter after the success of Alice in Wonderland, prompted screams from the crowd as he walked on to the red carpet at London's Odeon Leicester Square. Tim Burton described the cast as his 'weird, dysfunctional family' ""It was a lot of fun to come back to the Mad Hatter,"" he said. ""It was a gas to get back together with the cast and the addition of Sacha (Baron Cohen) upped the stakes quite a lot.

""Bringing in James (Bobin) was brilliant because he has such a profound respect for the language that Tim created and stretched it into his own vision."" Director James Bobin described Rickman as a ""fantastic actor"", commending him for his role as Absolem the caterpillar in the film, which sees Australian actress Mia Wasikowski reprise the lead role, as Alice returns to the nonsensical world of Wonderland. The actor died at the age of 69 in January Describing how she was drawn to the strength of Alice's character, Ms Wasikowski said: ""Despite expectations of her being quite low she manages to hold on to this sense that she's worth more than what people expect of her. ""The message in the film is really nice, that the best way to deal with time is to accept what happened in the past and not try and change it and move on freely into the future."" Burton described having the cast from the original film back together again as ""Alice in Wonderland and a weird dysfunctional family,"" adding his love of unusual people influenced his casting. ""I like working with weird people, they're very lucky that way,"" he said. In return, Burton described Depp as his ""brother,"" adding he could never grow tired of working with the actor. Alice Through The Looking Glass is released in UK cinemas on 27 May."

The gaffe occurred during a garden party hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The Queen was speaking to Police Commander Lucy D’Orsi, who was recounting a meeting she had with Chinese officials ahead of President Xi Jinping's visit to the UK last year. When told that the Chinese officials had threatened to cancel the visit, the Queen responded: ""They were very rude to the ambassador"". Chinese President Xi Jinping with the Queen at a state banquet Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond confirmed the Chinese state visit ""got a bit stressful on both sides"". ""But it was a great state visit - everybody agrees, hugely successful - and our relationship with China is very strong and has been greatly strengthened by the success of that visit."" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ""We do not comment on the Queen's private conversations. However, the Chinese state visit was extremely successful and all parties worked closely to ensure it proceeded smoothly."" A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry also declined to comment directly on the Queen's remarks, instead describing President Xi's trip as a ""very successful visit"". Foreign media reports of the story are being blanked out by Chinese censors, indicating officials are sensitive about the issue. Sky News Royal Correspondent Rhiannon Mills says it’s ""unusual"" to hear the Queen talking about diplomatic matters. ""It’s worth pointing out that the person filming this exchange was Peter Wilkinson who is a cameraman based at Buckingham Palace. ""He is always the one that will film… the Queen's engagements. Maybe she was feeling very relaxed in that environment."" The Queen's remarks come after the Prime Minister was caught on microphone ahead of an anti-corruption summit describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as ""possibly two of the most corrupt countries in the world"" to the Queen. Nigeria initially said it was offended by the remark, but the country's President Muhammadu Buhari has since conceded his country is corrupt."

2016-05-11,The last London Labour mayor was Ken Livingstone.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160511192148/http://news.sky.com/story/1690858/boxing-clever-capitals-new-king-sadiq-khan,"The last London Labour mayor was Ken Livingstone. Still one thing the freshly expelled-from-the-party Mr Livingstone and the newly-crowned Mayor of London Sadiq Khan have in common is that they are not politicians to walk away from a fight. Mr Khan learned to box as a child growing up on a Tooting housing estate. It was to combat the racism. He's been landing blows and dodging punches ever since, first as a human rights lawyer with some very controversial cases and then as a Labour MP. Here's what you need to know about the man who now has control of the capital's £17bn budget. :: Son of a ... Pakistani bus driver. It's how he describes himself and he jokes: ""You wait for a Pakistani bus driver's son to come along. Then two come along at once."" (Business Secretary Sajid Javid is also the son of a Pakistani bus driver). :: London Living? Council estate kid, one of eight children, attended a tough comprehensive, shared a bunk-bed until age 24. Went to university, got a degree in law, became a human rights lawyer. :: Married? To another lawyer. Two daughters. Mr Khan with his wife Saadiya :: MP For? Tooting – since 2005. Has also been transport minister and shadow justice secretary and shadow minister for London. :: Style? As a trained pugilist he's used to a scrap. He was the man who successfully ran Ed Miliband’s leadership campaign. And he is tireless. Mr Khan should not be underestimated. He was not expected to win the Labour candidacy - he was up against the popular Dame Tessa Jowell. But he did. :: First job? Human rights lawyer, who became a partner at a precociously young age. He defended, in his own words, some ""unsavoury individuals"" including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. In the early 2000s, Mr Khan attempted to have the ban on Farrakhan entering Britain overturned – then home secretary Jack Straw said he posed a risk to community relations. Farrakhan had called white people ""devils"", Jewish people ""bloodsuckers"" and said Hitler was a ""great man"". The ban was not overturned. Defending Farrakhan :: What drives him? Giving back - and the fight. Colleagues say he still enjoys the fight. A teacher suggested that he might be better suited to a career as a lawyer, rather than one as a dentist. In the end he chose human rights over corporate law because he wanted to give something back and not for personal gain. :: What he's promised to deliver? To be ""a mayor for all Londoners"". The biggest manifesto pledge was on housing – affordable housing for Londoners. The mayoral marathon requires endurance Mr Khan will build more homes, offer part-buy part-rent homes, provide starter homes for under £450,000 and ring-fence new homes on brownfield sites for London people (ie not rich foreigners). On transport, there will be a four-year fare freeze, Night Tube, better relations with transport unions to end strikes, Cross Rail 2 and even 3 and a fair market for black cab drivers. He will sell off the water cannon Boris bought for the police to fund schemes tackling youth crime and order a Met Police armed response review to make sure the city is prepared for a terror attack. Mr Khan has said he will make 50% of the city green and opposes a third runway at Heathrow. He says expand Gatwick. :: Trouble ahead? Mr Khan will likely work hard to extricate himself from the troubles of the Labour party and set himself apart – remember he will have to work with a Conservative Government. Mates with Ed Miliband. With Jeremy Corbyn, not so much Pundits have suggested in being mayor Mr Khan will provide a credible Labour alternative to Jeremy Corbyn. He has tried very hard to distance himself from Mr Corbyn, criticised the leader for failing to get a grip on the anti-Semitism row and has not been seen with Mr Livingstone. :: That thing you didn't know …  As a paper boy when he was young he used to deliver newspapers to Dirty Den's mistress (EastEnders). Look up all the results from the elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales."

Nine-year-old Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows, 10, were found dead in bushes in Wild Park, Brighton, East Sussex on 10 October 1986. The young friends, who lived nearby, had been sexually assaulted and strangled. The girls had been reported missing the day before and their disappearance led to a huge search involving friends, family and scores of police officers. On the 20th anniversary of the unsolved case, the victims' relatives took part in a march to mark the milestone, clutching teddy bears and single roses. The suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was detained by officers from the Surrey and Sussex major crime team after new evidence came to light. No one has ever been successfully prosecuted for the murders."

The file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) by South Yorkshire Police. The CPS said it will ""carefully consider"" whether to bring charges or not against the 75-year-old entertainer. ""We have received a full file of evidence from South Yorkshire Police,"" a CPS spokesman said. ""We will now carefully consider its contents in line with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, in order to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and whether it is in the public interest to do so."" A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: ""Investigation files relating to allegations of non-recent sexual abuse involving a 75-year-old man have been handed over to the CPS. ""The CPS will now consider the matter and South Yorkshire Police awaits their decision."" Sir Cliff's Berkshire home was searched during the investigation Sir Cliff, who was knighted in 1995, has always denied any wrongdoing.  His Berkshire home was searched by officers in August 2014 as part of the investigation. He has also been interviewed by police twice - once in 2014 and again last year. He was questioned voluntarily and was not arrested. Sky's Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt said: ""We don't know specifically how many allegations there are - we think there are two."" Brunt said one claim is believed to relate to an alleged incident at an event held by American evangelist preacher Billy Graham in a Sheffield park in 1985. A historical claim of a sexual nature was made involving a boy who was under the age of 16 at the time. Brunt said it could be weeks before the CPS makes its decision. ""Prosecutors must now decide whether there's a public interest in charging Sir Cliff and if there's sufficient evidence with which to do so,"" he said."

Ellis Downes, from Harwell, had not been seen since around 9pm on Saturday in Culham, near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. Thames Valley Police said divers recovered a body from the river at around 11pm on Monday night, which they believe to be the teenager, although formal identification has not yet taken place. The force said the death was being treated as ""unexplained"", but was not thought to be ""suspicious"". Ellis' sister, Alex Downes, criticised the police search on Facebook as she appealed for volunteers to come forward and help find ""my little brother"".

Our thoughts are with his family at this time. ""Police have been useless and are starting to give up the search already because apparently they 'don't have the resources',"" she wrote on Sunday night. ""But I refuse to give up on him!"" Following the discovery, she wrote: ""There are no words to explain how I'm feeling right now, I thought I would wake up and it would of just all been a terrible nightmare. ""My heart aches so badly it hurts, a massive part of it is missing ... all I have now are the happy memories of the cheeky, loveable, handsome young man I was proud to call my brother, and I will cherish those memories forever. ""Ellis, I'm so sorry we didn't find you sooner but I hope you would be proud of me for doing everything I could to get you back, I was never ever going to give up on you. ""I love you so much words are not enough, my beautiful angel."" A Surrey-based volunteer dive team - Specialist Group International - recovered the boy's body. Its chief executive claimed they were initially turned away by police. Peter Faulding told the Oxford Mail: ""We turned up with dive equipment wanting to go in and police refused access. ""They said they couldn’t prove our credentials so they rang up the National Crime Agency who confirmed who we were. ""They still wouldn’t let us in the water - I said 'we can have him out within a couple of hours, you're wasting valuable time'."" He added: ""The father Darren went over to the police officers and said 'if you do not let them dive I will get in the water myself' and it was only at that point that we were allowed into the river."""

The Vermont senator won by a margin of 51.4% to 36%, though he remains well behind Mrs Clinton in the overall delegate count. Mr Sanders has now won 19 states, compared with Mrs Clinton's 23, but she remains on track to seal the Democratic nomination by early June. The former Secretary of State is just 144 delegates short of the 2,383 delegates required to become the party's candidate for November's election. Mr Sanders has 1,454 delegates. Mr Trump took another step to securing the GOP nomination outright The Clinton campaign may be more concerned by an opinion poll released on Tuesday that showed her in a dead heat with Donald Trump in the crucial swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. She was up by a single point in both Florida and Pennsylvania, while Mr Trump had a four-point lead in the key presidential bellwether of Ohio, according to the Quinnipiac University survey. On the Republican side on Tuesday night, presumptive nominee Mr Trump cruised uncontested to victories in both West Virginia (by 76.9%) and Nebraska (by 61.4%). They were the billionaire businessman's first primaries since his last remaining rivals bowed out of the race. He has 1,135 delegates, within touching distance of the 1,237 needed to win the Republican nomination outright. Mr Sanders won Nebraska's Democratic caucus in March. Mr Trump is also on course to break the record for the most votes won by any candidate in the history of Republican presidential nomination contests. Heading into Tuesday, the former reality TV star was 141,167 votes shy of the record 10,844,129 votes acquired by George W Bush in the 2000 primary season. Mr Trump has been taunting Mrs Clinton, saying she ""can't close the deal"" against her rival, Mr Sanders. Her prospects in the Mountain State were not helped by her comments about the coal industry, one of the state's biggest employers. While outlining her plans to increase renewable energy sources, Mrs Clinton said she would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"". The former New York senator later apologised and said her comments were taken out of context. But Mrs Clinton's rebuke by voters in economically struggling West Virginia highlights the difficulty she may face in industrial states during  the general election."
2016-05-11,So was it a gaffe or was it deliberate? Did David Cameron blunder by blurting out that Nigeria and Afghanistan were corrupt?,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160511192148/http://news.sky.com/story/1693734/was-camerons-corruption-gaffe-deliberate,"So was it a gaffe or was it deliberate? Did David Cameron blunder by blurting out that Nigeria and Afghanistan were corrupt? Or did he mean to kick-start his anti-corruption summit, taking place in London later this week, with some useful pre-summit publicity? And another conspiracy theory in Westminster is that he wanted to move the news agenda away from the EU referendum, after Iain Duncan Smith accused him of being Angela Merkel's puppet. The scene was Buckingham Palace, the event a reception to mark the Queen's 90th birthday and the elite group caught on camera were Her Majesty, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the PM, Commons Speaker John Bercow and the Leader of the Commons, Chris Grayling. The PM knew the cameras were present, his spokesman said All present appeared to be clutching glasses that looked like champagne flutes. So had the bubbly loosened the Prime Minister's tongue when he called the two countries ""fantastically corrupt"" and ""possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world""? Was it another example of the carelessness or arrogance his critics accuse him of? His opponents will say Yes. Or is he demob happy now he isn't standing for election as Prime Minister in 2020? He would certainly deny that. At first his indiscretion appeared to be a repeat of his reckless comments to the New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, picked up by Sky News after the 2014 Scottish referendum, when he said the Queen ""purred down the line"" when he phoned her with the result. Labour then accused the Prime Minister of being ""disrespectful"" to the Queen and the SNP's Alex Salmond said Mr Cameron should ""hang his head in shame"" for sharing details of a private conversation. Then last year, on a visit to Yorkshire, the Prime Minister was recorded while rehearsing a speech, saying: ""We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much."" Oh dear! Touchy, sensitive types, those Tykes. The Yorkshire Post newspaper said his ""disdainful"" remark was rooted in a ""rather stereotypical and outdated view of Yorkshire"". Those two gaffes prompted an immediate apology and expression of regret from the Prime Minister. Not so this time. He was unrepentant and vigorously defended his remarks about Nigeria and Afghanistan being corrupt. The presidents of the two countries, who will attend the anti-corruption summit later this week, had acknowledged the scale of corruption in their countries and vowed to tackle it, the PM's spokesman insisted to political journalists. Maybe. But the Afghanistan Embassy later said because the new government in its country was taking ""major steps to fight corruption"", the Prime Minister's comments were ""unfair"". But further evidence that Mr Cameron knew exactly what he was doing when his spokesman was asked if he knew there were TV cameras present. ""The cameras were very close to him,"" the spokesman revealed. ""There were multiple cameras in the room."" So if the remarks were a clever piece of spin to publicise an international anti-corruption summit and to move the news agenda on from the EU, Mr Cameron's supporters will claim he has played a blinder. But there remains the issue of a potential insult or slight to the Queen and the charge of dragging her into political controversy once again. His opponents are already on the attack. ""This is another gaffe from the PM,"" said the Labour MP Wes Streeting. ""You'd hope he'd have learned his lesson when it comes to off the record comments and the Queen but sadly not."" Mr Cameron would say he has learned many lessons in his six years as Prime Minister. Those who have observed him during that time would say they include canny news management."

Bottles and other objects were thrown as the coach was hemmed in by supporters near West Ham's Boleyn Ground in east London, where they played their final ever game before moving to the Olympic Stadium. Police boarded the coach after it became trapped and kick-off was pushed back by 45 minutes as the Manchester United squad arrived an hour late. The coach's tinted windows were damaged and video footage showed pieces of the bus falling from its sides. Lady Brady wrote on Twitter: ""I, the Board and everyone at West Ham United totally condemn the unacceptable behaviour we saw outside the ground last night. The events in the stadium last night were incredible and it would be a shame if the actions of a mindless few outside overshadowed them. ""West Ham is a family Club and the vast majority of fans attended Tuesday's Final Game to respectfully say Farewell Boleyn. ""Those who chose to behave unacceptably will be dealt with in the strongest way possible, with life bans for those guilty of violence. ""The events in the stadium last night were incredible and it would be a shame if the actions of a mindless few outside overshadowed them. ""Their behaviour was unacceptable &won't be stood for. But my overriding memory will not be of them but of a fitting farewell to the Boleyn."" Gallery: Window Damaged As Team Held Up Outside West Ham's Ground A woman and a child are helped after a smoke canister was set off as some fans attacked the Manchester United team bus as it arrived to play West Ham The Football Association said it ""strongly condemns the unsavoury incidents"", adding that it will work with both clubs and police to investigate the incident. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney said the coach ""got smashed up"" on the way into the ground. He told Sky Sports: ""It wasn't nice ... I'm sure you'll see the images. It's not for me to say, but it was disappointing of course.  ""It's a big night for West Ham, but I'm sure West Ham as a club will be disappointed with what the fans have done."" Video footage apparently filmed by United player Jesse Lingard showed the players taking refuge in the aisle down the centre of the bus as bottles smashed against the windows. Some of them are heard shouting and Lingard puts his hand in front of his mouth in apparently feigned shock.  The Metropolitan Police said four officers and a member of the public had sustained minor injuries. The force said three men had been arrested during the match - two of them for invading the pitch and one 20-year-old man on suspicion of affray. Louis Van Gaal, Manchester United's manager, said: ""It is not so nice. The way we have been received is not the proper way, of course. ""That makes all the influence on the players and that is a pity."" Manchester United's club secretary requested the delay to allow for the players to fully prepare for the match, pushing kick off back to 8.30pm. West Ham's co-chairman David Sullivan clarified comments he made on Tuesday night, when he appeared to suggest he believed the away team's bus had not been damaged. He said: ""When I was asked about the incident prior to yesterday's game, I was unaware of the damage that had occurred to the Manchester United team bus. ""I want to apologise to Manchester United for that damage and assure them that we will be doing all we can to track down those responsible and ban them for life."" Objects were also thrown from the stands by some supporters during the game, which West Ham won 3-2.

The former London mayor kicked off his nationwide tour from Truro in Cornwall on a bus that was manufactured by Neoplan Starliner. Remain campaigners claim that leaving the EU would slap an extra £56,000 on to the cost of that type of German vehicle in the UK. But the Leave camp disagrees. ""Of course it's a German bus. We want it to run on time!"" responded campaign director Robert Oxley. ""Is that the best they've got? Do they really think Germany won't want to sell us their top-range buses if we leave the EU?"" Mr Johnson was also attacked for brandishing a Cornish pasty as he boarded the bus. Pasties are protected by the EU's Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) meaning they must be made in the region they are associated with. The Leave camp insists this protection will continue if we leave the EU - as other non-EU products are also protected. Before setting off, Mr Johnson purchased some asparagus from Truro market, claiming British farmers' EU subsidies would be protected and that a poll in Farmers Weekly showed that most of them wanted to leave. Asparagus would be ""sprouting"" and ""delicious"" if we leave, he said. In a stump speech, he attacked the Remain camp for sending out a £9m taxpayer-funded leaflet. He told the crowd: ""They think they've got the big battalions. ""They've got all the taxpayers money, we've got the passion, we've got the commitment and we've got right on our side."" Amid placards calling for the UK to ""vote leave"" someone had written in felt tip pen on cardboard ""blaming immigrants lets the Tories off the hook"". The protester managed to infiltrate the Brexiteers standing right behind Mr Johnson's head. Then it was off to Charlestown, where TV series Poldark was filmed. Some suggest Mr Johnson brought with him some romantic fiction on the side of his bus which proclaims that £350m-a-week saved from the EU budget could be spent on the NHS. The UK Statistics Authority disputes this figure as ""potentially misleading"" because a large proportion of it comes back to the UK. But Mr Johnson told Sky News he was ""very happy"" with the slogan, although he conceded that a ""portion of that comes back"", but ""the UK has no control over how it is spent"". The residents of Charlestown for the most part seemed to support Mr Johnson's view that the UK should leave the EU and he in turn expressed his love of the town's clotted cream ice cream. Then, after about five licks he said ""Oh no - it's starting to melt"" and passed it on to local Julia Ray, who had no reservations about eating the rest. She was already leaning towards Brexit, but told Sky News that Mr Johnson's visit ""clinched it"" for her. After a trip to St Austell Brewery, Mr Johnson headed towards Exeter. On route, in an interview with Sky News, he insisted campaigning on opposing sides had not damaged his relationship with the Prime Minister. “Everybody is interested in personalising this,"" he said. ""This is not about relationships between politicians - and by the way they remain very good - but this is indescribably trivial compared to the choice our country faces."" Asked if he thought he would win, Mr Johnson seemed confident saying that only three or four of the 100 people he had met so far wanted to remain in the EU."

Some are being sent home ""alone and afraid"", while relatives and carers are not always being told when patients are discharged. The report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) cited ""harrowing"" examples of people being ""badly let down by the system"". In one case, a woman in her late 90s died in her granddaughter's arms moments after being dropped off at home after she was discharged without being properly examined. Some patients are enduring ""harrowing ordeals"" when they leave hospital The PHSO also found a father's death from sepsis could have been avoided if he had been treated for the condition before he was discharged. In another case, an 85-year-old woman with dementia was sent home alone at 11pm without her family being informed. ""Our investigations have found that some of the most vulnerable patients, including frail and older people, are enduring harrowing ordeals when they leave hospital,"" said the PHSO's Julie Mellor. ""Poor planning, co-ordination and communication between hospital staff and between health and social care services are failing patients, compromising their safety and dignity. ""Health and social care leaders must work harder to uncover why ten years of guidance to prevent unsafe discharge is not being followed, causing misery and distress for patients, families and carers."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the ""dreadful cases"" marked ""a new low in what looks like a continuous downward trend in the capacity of our health and care system to look after our older people adequately - indeed, on occasion even in its ability to keep the most vulnerable safe and alive"". NHS Improvement said better discharge processes were being worked on to ensure vulnerable patients are protected. A spokesman said: ""Rather than frail elderly people staying in hospital longer than they need to, it is better to get patients home as quickly as possible and to assess them in their own homes rather than in a hospital - but this must be done with the right help and support in place."""

Arthur DaRosa, 28, was shot and killed by deputy sheriff James Creed after DaRosa crashed his car into a shopping mall entrance in Taunton and began attacking people with a knife. George Heath, a 56-year-old teacher, was fatally stabbed after he tried to get the knife away from DeRosa, authorities said. Relatives said DaRosa was dealing with mental health issues. Pic: Facebook. Sheenah Savoy, a waitress at the restaurant, suffered serious injuries in the Tuesday night attack that has left authorities searching for answers. DaRosa also beat three women in a Macy's inside the Silver City Galleria, where an unidentified store employee tried to stop him. Before arriving at the shopping mall, police said DaRosa stabbed two people at a nearby residence. Patricia Slavin, 80, died in hospital, while her daughter, 58-year-old Kathleen, suffered serious injuries, authorities said. District Attorney Thomas Quinn said the attacks began after DaRosa left his daughter's soccer practice, crashed his car and walked into Ms Slavin's home. Family members told WFXT-TV in Boston that DaRosa, a father-of-two, had been receiving treatment for mental illness on the day before the attack. The motive for the attacks remains unclear. Witnesses told local television station WHDH-TV that they heard gunfire and saw people running from the shopping centre. The centre was evacuated and put on lockdown as state and local police units established multiple crime scenes. Taunton is about 40 miles south of Boston."

Police said he went on the run, dumping his truck and phone to go ""off grid"" and using a bicycle or hitch-hiking for 150 miles.

Judith Cooper (L) and her daughter Tierney McCann were stabbed to death Ms Cooper McCann's sister Cortney Rider told local media the McCanns' marriage had broken down and the suspect's business was in trouble. She said she was woken on the day of the killings by the sound of McCann breaking down the door of the house in Clovis, near Fresno. She said he attacked his wife, slitting her throat, before she had a chance to call the police. A mugshot of Dave McCann issued by the Clovis Police Department She added: ""He looked at me and said, 'you're next', and I immediately ran out of the front door and ran to the next door neighbours. ""My mum was hiding in the master bedroom having it locked and he busted down the door after not being able to catch me. He went back to the house and he slit my mum's throat in the back bedroom."" Ms Rider said that despite being fatally wounded, her sister went to their mother's aid after McCann left. ""She was able to walk back to the bedroom and lay with my mum and they both died together,"" she said. Mr McCann is believed to have been living in the US on a green card and police initially suspected he might have been trying to make his way back to his native UK."
2016-05-13,An American Invictus Games champion has asked Prince Harry to return her gold medal to the British hospital that saved her life.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1694485/us-invictus-winner-gives-medal-to-nhs-hospital,"An American Invictus Games champion has asked Prince Harry to return her gold medal to the British hospital that saved her life. Sergeant Elizabeth Marks requested Harry give the medal to the medical team at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, as he placed it around her neck. Sgt Marks collapsed with a serious lung condition in 2014 on the eve of the first Invictus Games and was put into a medically induced coma. She was treated in London by a team from Papworth, who put her on life support for 10 days after she suddenly became ill. Sgt Marks and the Prince in conversation during the games in Orlando She said: ""They absolutely saved my life and I can't thank the UK enough for having that kind of medical support and taking such good care of me. ""So I gave Prince Harry one of my medals and hope it will find its way back to Papworth."" Sgt Marks, who has won every swimming event she entered at this year's games in Orlando, decided to give her 100m freestyle gold to the hospital as it had been touched by the Prince. Holding back tears, she said of the NHS staff who treated her: ""Thank you, I'll never be able to repay you, but what you're doing is wonderful."" The combat medic was left with no sensation in her left leg after suffering a serious hip injury in 2010, but has returned to fitness and still serves in the military. She described it as ""an honour"" to compete in the games alongside the other servicemen and women taking part. Sgt Marks, who joined the US Army at 17, added: ""I was nervous because of what had happened last time but I was eager to perform and show my team and show the other countries how much I love their support. ""When I came out of my coma to see all the pictures of them supporting me while I was there, without even knowing I was in that state, made me cry like a baby so it was a chance to give something back."" Prince Harry launched Invictus in 2014 as a means of using sport to support the rehabilitation and recovery of injured soldiers, and staged the inaugural games in London."

Daljinder Kaur and her 79-year-old husband became parents last month following two years of treatment at a clinic in the northern state of Haryana. The baby was conceived using the couple's own egg and sperm and, despite being very small at birth, weighing just two kilograms (4.4lbs),  was now ""healthy and hearty"", the National Fertility and Test Tube centre said. Mrs Kaur said she did not believe she was too old to be a first-time mother and said she felt very well and fit enough to cope. She said she and her husband of 46 years had almost given up hope of ever having a child and had faced ridicule in a country where infertility is sometimes seen as a curse from God. ""God heard our prayers. My life feels complete now. I am looking after the baby all by myself, I feel so full of energy. My husband is also very caring and helps me as much as he can,"" Ms Kaur revealed. ""When we saw the (IVF) advert, we thought we should also give it a try as I badly wanted to have a baby of my own,"" she said. Mrs Kaur gave her age at around 70 - many people in India do not have birth certificates and only have a rough idea of their actual age - but the clinic said in a statement that she was 72. Her husband, Mohinder Singh Gill, who owns a farm outside Amritsar, said he was unconcerned about their age, saying God would watch over their child whom they named Armaan. ""People say what will happen to the child once we die. But I have full faith in God. God is omnipotent and omnipresent, he will take care of everything,"" he said. Anurag Bishnoi, who runs the fertility clinic, said he was initially unsure about going ahead with the treatment, but tests indicated the mother would be able to carry the unborn baby. ""I first tried to avoid the case because she looked very frail. Then we made her undergo all the tests and once all the results were okay we went ahead,"" Dr Bishnoi said. The case is not the first in India, with a 72-year-old woman from Uttar Pradesh state reportedly giving birth to twins in 2008, also through IVF."
2016-05-13,The Tories have handed over a series of general election expenses documents after the Electoral Commission went to court to force them to do so.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1695211/tories-hand-over-battle-bus-expenses-documents,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent The Tories have handed over a series of general election expenses documents after the Electoral Commission went to court to force them to do so. Police forces across the UK are investigating whether nearly 30 Tory MPs breached spending rules in last year’s general election campaign. The commission launched an investigation in February after complaints that visits by a Tory battle bus to key marginal constituencies were not included in the candidates' expenses. The party’s Battle Bus Tour, led by then party chairman Grant Shapps, took teams of activists to dozens of Conservative/Lib Dem and Conservative/Labour marginals.  But the party included the cost of the bus tour, thought to be around £2,000 a day including hotel bills for the activists, in national election expenses rather than those of the candidates. The expenses controversy is the second potential scandal concerning the Battle Bus Tour, following bullying allegations against former party official Mark Clarke after a young activist, Elliott Johnson, killed himself. Business Minister Anna Soubry is one of the MPs caught up in the dispute Those caught up in the expenses dispute so far include several who were newly elected last year, many of whom ousted Liberal Democrat MPs.  The most high-profile is the business minister Anna Soubry, MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire.  They all deny any wrongdoing. Also caught up in the row is Alison Hernandez, who was elected Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall last week and who was the agent for winning Tory candidate Kevin Foster in Torbay last year. David Cameron talking to journalists on the Tories' battle bus last April She denies any wrongdoing, but is now being investigated by her own force and is facing calls to stand aside while police probe her part in the election campaign.  The Electoral Commission says it went to the High Court because the Tories failed to supply documents demanded first when it launched its inquiry on 18 February and then again on 23 March. ""If parties under investigation do not comply with our requirements for the disclosure of relevant material in reasonable time and after sufficient opportunity to do so, the Commission can seek recourse through the courts,"" said Bob Posner, the commission’s director of party and election finance and legal counsel. After the Tories handed over the material, the commission said it had received additional information from the party and had begun assessing whether it fulfilled the requirements of the orders. But the Conservative Party insisted the legal action was not needed as they always intended to hand over the information. ""We advised the Electoral Commission on 29 April that we would comply with their notices by 1pm today - and have done so,"" a spokeswoman said. ""There was no need for them to make this application to the High Court."" The party has acknowledged that some accommodation for the activists was not properly registered, blaming an ""administrative error"", but insists the bus tour was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ) and therefore did not need to be recorded in individual constituency spending limits."
2016-05-13,A senior police officer has been ordered to fly back to the UK after reports detectives searching for Ben Needham in Greece went on an eight-hour drinking session.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1694677/ben-needham-police-boozing-claims-investigated,"A senior police officer has been ordered to fly back to the UK after reports detectives searching for Ben Needham in Greece went on an eight-hour drinking session. South Yorkshire Police said there would be an investigation after claims the officers on Kos were drinking from 5pm on Tuesday, with some not finishing until after 1am. A new bid to find out what happened to Ben was launched this week and 10 police have jetted out to the Greek island to try to uncover new information. The drinking claims were reported in The Sun newspaper The Sheffield toddler went missing in 1991 during a holiday with his parents and grandparents, and would now be 26. But The Sun reported police involved in the search knocked back beer and wine on Tuesday evening as they gathered at a hotel and headed out to a pizzeria and bars. The last officers did not turn in until 1.24am, according to the paper - which published pictures reportedly showing the night out. In February, South Yorkshire Police got an extra £450,000 to search for Ben. Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, one of the senior detectives on the sun-kissed island, said no public money had been spent on alcohol and insisted the team was ""working really hard"" and was ""desperately"" trying to find Ben. Ben's mother, Kerry Needham, has come out in support of the police and criticised The Sun for doing the story. She said the decision to recall the senior officer - who has not yet been named - could put the ""entire investigation... in jeopardy"". In a letter to South Yorkshire Police, her lawyer said: ""Ms Needham trusts the officers involved, believes they are working to the highest standards operationally and professionally and wishes there to be no disruption"". It adds: ""To recall their leader is incredibly worrying for Ms Needham."" A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said the team had been investigating the disappearance for a number of years. ""We're absolutely committed to this investigation and require the highest possible standards from all of those involved. The team must now get on with the important task in hand,"" she said. ""Following concerns raised regarding the behaviour of some of those involved, the senior officer has been recalled to the UK with immediate effect to provide the details of exactly what has happened. An internal investigation will follow."" It is thought the officers were intending to stay on Kos for two weeks and appealed to local people earlier this week - asking them: ""Could you be Ben?"" They have taken a sample of Ben's DNA with them to test anyone who believes they could be the missing child. A key line of inquiry is a call received by the Missing People charity in 1993. The caller said that Ben was living in Greece under the name ""Andreas"" and was being cared for by a man called ""Nicos"". Ben's mother told Sky News on Tuesday the family had received a lot of support from the public, who ""want to know the answers too""."

The announcement was made by Crown Office prosecutors in Scotland following a five-year inquiry into whether shareholders were criminally wronged when the bank launched a £12bn cash call in 2008. Its statement said: ""The Crown's investigation focused on the rights issue of April to June 2008, and involved detailed consideration of whether there was any evidence of criminal conduct associated with the rights issue. ""Following careful examination of all the evidence seen to date, Crown counsel have decided that there is insufficient evidence in law of criminal conduct either in relation to RBS as an institution or any directors or other senior management involved in the rights issue. ""If any further evidence comes to light which is relevant to this inquiry it will be considered by the Crown and we reserve the right to make further inquiry, if considered appropriate."" The bank was run, at the time of the £12bn cash call to shareholders, by Sir Fred Goodwin who has faced no legal or regulatory sanction in connection with events that led to its bailout. He lost his job at that time and was subsequently stripped of his Knighthood in 2012. :: What Went Wrong At RBS? Goodwin earned the nickname 'Fred the Shred' for the bank's habit, during his tenure as chief executive, of aggressively cutting costs while also spending big on acquisitions, including the near-£50bn purchase of Dutch lender ABN Amro. The deal proved toxic and, just months later, the value of RBS shares plunged 90% and the Government had to step in. The bank went on to report a financial loss for 2008 of £24bn - the largest in corporate history. It remains loss-making as it continues to get its house in order. The Government, which still owns 73% of RBS stock, has admitted it is likely to make a loss on the return of shares to private hands. :: RBS To Axe 200 Jobs And Close More Branches The Crown Office said its inquiry team had examined more than 160,000 documents and was assisted by financial regulators and banking institutions, including the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Serious Fraud Office. An RBS spokesman said: ""We cooperated fully with the investigation and we note today’s decision."" It could be viewed positively for groups representing former and current RBS shareholders who are pursuing civil claims worth £4bn against those in charge at the bank at the time of its rescue, as no criminal proceedings are risking delays to their case."

John Whittingdale has unveiled the Government's blueprint for the future of the corporation, which will include Ofcom regulation for the first time. Mr Whittingdale said the current system of regulating the BBC is ""confusing and ineffective"", adding that ""reform is vital"". The Culture Secretary told MPs the Government is ""emphatically not saying the BBC should not be popular"" - but would introduce a new requirement to provide ""distinctive content"" rather than just pursue ratings. This led to Mr Whittingdale being accused of ""ideologically-driven meddling"" by Labour, with shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle claiming his ideas were ""totally out of step with the licence fee payers who value and support the BBC"". Mr Whittingdale also announced that: :: The pay of top stars who earn more than £450,000 will have to be disclosed, which could potentially affect the likes of Graham Norton, Chris Evans and Gary Lineker :: The £145.50 licence fee will increase in line with inflation until 2022, when there will be a new settlement. :: People watching BBC programmes on demand online will have to obtain a TV licence, closing a loophole that costs it £150m a year :: The corporation will have a new unitary board, with a majority of members independent of the Government. The BBC Trust will be abolished :: The Culture Secretary also revealed that the current BBC chair, Rona Fairhead, will remain in her post until the end of her term in 2018. Outlining the reforms, the Culture Secretary said: ""The BBC is and must always remain at the very heart of British life. ""We want the BBC to thrive, to make fantastic programmes for audiences and to act as an engine for growth and creativity."" He added: ""The BBC will operate in a more robust and more clearly defined governance and regulatory framework and it will be more transparent and accountable to the public it serves, who rely on the BBC to be the very best it can possibly be, so it can inform, educate and entertain for many years to come."" The charter renewal process has proved to be controversial, with the BBC and its backers fearful the Government would use it as an opportunity to whittle back the corporation. But Government sources insisted before the statement that paring back the BBC was not David Cameron's intention. The BBC gave a positive response to the Government's white paper. Director-general Tony Hall said it ""delivers a mandate for the strong, creative BBC the public believe in. A BBC that will be good for the creative industries - and most importantly of all, for Britain""."

A statement from the Malaysian Minister of Transport said investigators have concluded an engine cowling with a Rolls Royce logo and an interior panel from an aircraft cabin are consistent with those found on Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft. ""As such, the team has confirmed that both pieces of debris from South Africa and Rodrigues Island are almost certainly from MH370,"" the statement said. It added the findings complemented results from an examination of two further pieces of wreckage discovered along the coast of Mozambique said to be ""almost certainly"" from the missing aircraft, according to Australian officials. Local archaeologist Neels Kruger found the Rolls Royce debris near Mossel Bay, a small town in Western Cape province, South Africa, in March. He came across it while walking with his family along a river, and immediately contacted authorities. The other piece of wreckage was found by hotel guests on Rodrigues Island, which lies about 350 miles east of Mauritius Island, in April. MH370 went missing on 8 March, 2014, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. There were 239 passengers and crew aboard. Aviation experts believe MH370 veered sharply off course to the far-southern Indian Ocean before crashing into the sea. The Malaysian Transport Ministry statement added that the governments of Malaysia, Australia and China continue to be ""wholly committed"" to the search for MH370."
2016-05-13,Vote Leave are furious.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1694790/brexit-debate-why-are-vote-leave-so-angry,"Vote Leave are furious. When the news broke last night that ITV would be hosting a debate with Nigel Farage and David Cameron I was with the campaign team - and they didn't like it. In their view this was ITV sabotaging the whole campaign. So why do they think this? First of all, Vote Leave is the Electoral Commission's nominated official Out campaign group, and Mr Farage stood against them as part of the Grassroots Out campaign which failed to get the nomination. Secondly, Vote Leave were in negotiation with ITV over the debates and believe their decision allows the Prime Minister to potentially swerve a blue-on-blue conflict with the likes of Michael Gove or Boris Johnson. Thirdly, Nigel Farage is seen as a marmite character. There is no denying he has been instrumental in creating the referendum but could he also play a part in the downfall of the campaign the leave the EU? :: EU In Or Out: Put Yor Questions To The PM Or Gove Vote Leave campaigners think he could. The reason being that, while his message appeals to UKIP voters and great deal of people who are concerned about immigration, those people are probably going to vote for Brexit anyway.  The lead out campaign group wants to attract undecided voters who are on the cusp of ticking either box - could these people tick ""remain"" through a desire not to be associated with Nigel Farage? The UKIP leader can be a formidable debater. It's generally agreed that he defeated Nick Clegg in their set-to ahead of the EU elections. Then again, remember what happened in the ITV General Election debate when he brought up the cost to the taxpayer of foreign HIV patients? His rivals turned on him and he was roundly condemned. In the BBC debate he accused the audience of being biased and was booed as he tried to make his case. ITV say that by inviting Mr Farage they have ""made an editorial judgement"" which is ""fair to both sides"". Vote Leave argues that the broadcaster has ""effectively become part of the In campaign"". While Michael Gove will represent Vote Leave on the Sky News programme - the Prime Minster will be on the same stage but not on the same night and it could be argued that the ITV debate is likely to reach a larger audience. And so it seems the UKIP leader will play a central role in the final outcome of this huge question looming on 23 June. A source close to Mr Farage said they were ""disappointed at Vote Leave's negativity"". A few weeks ago Mr Farage told me he didn't think the Out camp would win a blue-on-blue fight unless, possibly, it was against Boris - which the Prime Minister would never agree to. So in his view, just as it was his party that forced Mr Cameron to hold a referendum in the first place, so too the mission to persuade the public to vote out falls to him. :: EU: In Or Out with David Cameron will be shown on Sky News on 2 June at 8pm on Sky News, and the programme with Michael Gove is on 3 June, also at 8pm."

In an interview with a TV station, the former neighbourhood watch volunteer said he had just got the pistol back from the US Justice Department after his 2013 acquittal in the 17-year-old's death. He said he was listing the 9mm Kel-Tec PF-9 pistol with a starting price of $5,000, so he can ""move past the firearm"". Mr Zimmerman told WOFL: ""And I thought it's time to move past the firearm. And if I sell it and it sells, I move past it. George Zimmerman was acquitted over the teenager's death in July 2013 ""Otherwise, it's going in a safe for my grandkids and never to be used or seen again."" But the auction was halted shortly after it was set to begin on Thursday morning. Gallery: July 2013 - Trayvon Martin Protests Held Across US Protests have been held across the United States after George Zimmerman was acquitted of killing black teenager Travyon Martin. Here, Keesha Clark displays the youngster's name on her face. Zimmerman told the Orlando Sentinel the site had not been ""prepared for the traffic and publicity surrounding the auction"". But GunBroker.com told the newspaper it wanted ""no part in the listing on our website or in any of the publicity it is receiving"". Mr Zimmerman later put the gun up for sale on another site, UnitedGunGroup.com. According to the original GunBroker listing, part of the proceeds from the sale were to go towards fighting against violence by the Black Lives Matter movement against law enforcement. It said proceeds would also go towards combating anti-gun rhetoric by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and ending the career of Angela Corey, who led the prosecution against Mr Zimmerman. When asked what he thought of people opposed to the auction, Mr Zimmerman said: ""They're not going to be bidding on it, so I couldn't care less about them."" We have never expressed interest in collecting George Zimmerman’s firearm, and have no plans to ever collect or display it in any museums He said he was defending himself when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed. He was acquitted of second degree murder and manslaughter charges. The shooting and acquittal sparked protests across the US and a national debate on race relations. A lawyer for Trayvon Martin's family said: ""The Trayvon Martin Foundation is committed to its mission of ending senseless gun violence in the United States. ""This election season, we are laser-focused on furthering that mission. As such, the foundation has no comment on the actions of that person."" Mr Zimmerman claimed he has been subjected to death threats since the shooting. He added: ""I'm a free American. I can do what I want with my possessions."""

The account of @AzealiaBanks returned a message saying that it was suspended, with a link to the website's conditions on ""abusive tweets and behaviour"". On Tuesday, the 24-year-old New York rapper posted tweets accusing Malik of copying her style on his latest music video. She used epithets related to Muslims in the messages, which she has since deleted, targeting the 23-year-old. Malik and his girlfriend Gigi Hadid at the Met Ball last week ""When your entire extended family has been obliterated by good ol the U.S of A will you still be trying to act like a white boy pretending to be black?"" Banks said in one tweet. Malik declined to take the bait. @AZEALIABANKS why you been saying nasty things about me ? I wasn't talking about you lol ? ""My @'s too good for you,"" tweeted the singer, who is partially of Pakistani origin and was brought up in Bradford, England. Malik, who has chosen to go by his first name as a solo artist, has taken on an R&B sound since leaving One Direction with his songs featuring lyrics about sex and relationships. In a fresh tweet on Wednesday, Banks reiterated her accusations about Malik's music and cast her remarks about Muslims as a gesture of solidarity. ""He felt as if he was too good to acknowledge me yet not too good to copy my creativity,"" she wrote. ""I had to remind him that we're both in the same boat in this industry and people of colour."" Banks won wide acclaim for her single 212 but has become better known for her Twitter outbursts, with her pledge in March to quit the platform proving short-lived. She notably engaged in a long-running feud with the Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, whom she accused of exploiting black culture. Banks also provoked outrage in December 2014 when she appeared to cast doubt on Bill Cosby's sex assault accusers. The rapper tweeted: ""them b****** frontin' like they wasn't trying to get some of that pudding pop!!!!""  Even non-famous Twitter users have not escaped Banks' ire. ""One day your hemmroids (sic) are going to burst and you'll bleed to death b****,"" she responded to one person who accused her of homophobia. A London music festival, Rinse/Born & Bred Festival, has also removed Banks from its line-up next month."
2016-05-13,The biggest surprise of the Government's much-awaited white paper on the BBC is that it didn't really contain any surprises at all.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1695093/culture-secretary-fails-to-spring-bbc-surprise,"By Beth Rigby, Senior Political Correspondent The biggest surprise of the Government's much-awaited white paper on the BBC is that it didn't really contain any surprises at all. For months the corporation’s supporters have been in a panic that the Conservative government was going to use the renewal of the BBC’s governing charter to perform some radical surgery on the public broadcaster. There was talk about the corporation being forced to spin off its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, and its 50% stake in commercial broadcaster UKTV.  There were also fears that the Culture Secretary, John Whittingdale, would meddle with BBC scheduling and demand the corporation stop airing its most popular shows at peak times.     But none of it came to pass. The BBC has emerged from charter renewal with its future largely intact. As Mr Whittingdale told Sky News: ""[The BBC] is a national treasure and I am not about to tarnish it."" There were big wins for the BBC with its funding and charter guaranteed for the next decade.  The licence fee will rise with inflation, while the iPlayer loophole, which means people can watch the BBC on catch-up for free, will be closed, bringing in another £150m a year.  But Mr Whittingdale has proposed some changes. He thinks the BBC should be more transparent about how it spends its £3.7bn a year licence fee income. BBC stars earning more than £450,000 a year will have to disclose their mega-bucks salaries, while the National Audit Office will be given a wide-ranging role as the corporation’s official auditor. Mr Whittingdale also pronounced on governance, confirming that the widely discredited BBC Trust would be scrapped and replaced with a new unitary board responsible for governing the BBC. Regulation will be passed to Ofcom.  But, again, the Culture Secretary rowed back from some of his more thunderous threats in the face of resistance from Tory backbenchers – and almost certainly No 10. Instead of stuffing the board with government appointees (his original plan), Mr Whittingdale announced that the majority of the board could be selected by the BBC.  BBC insiders admit that they could not really have hoped for more. Rearguard action from Conservative MPs, coupled with outpourings of support from the stars of the big and small screen, seem to have convinced the Prime Minister that a fight over the BBC is best avoided when he has much bigger battles on this hands."
2016-05-13,The final curiosity of the most refreshing season in many moons is that it reaches its final weekend with only the minor placings and a Champions League slot to be decided.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1695057/curious-season-levels-footballs-playing-field,"The final curiosity of the most refreshing season in many moons is that it reaches its final weekend with only the minor placings and a Champions League slot to be decided. Leicester City turned the title into a stroll, and Sunderland’s resurrection under Sam Allardyce means the trapdoor has shut behind relegated Aston Villa, Norwich and Newcastle United with a game to spare. But if the season will be defined by Leicester's triumph, nothing encapsulates this upside-down season better than the spectacle of the two richest clubs in the land, Manchesters City and United, scrabbling for a top-four finish they had come to regard as routine (City are the favourites, requiring just a point). Why two clubs with a combined annual revenue of almost £800m are struggling to earn a place at Europe's top table, while one with a quarter of the resources and a fraction of the pedigree won the league, defies easy explanation. Norwich were relegated despite beating Watford 4-2 There is no neat answer, but it is possible to find a trend or two in the season that shook our pre-conceptions. Size is no longer everything. Clubs from the moderate middle-classes have prospered and punched their weight. Leicester won the league; West Ham and Southampton contested the Europa League places; Tottenham, with a larger fan base and revenue but still outside the richest five, will finish no worse than third; Bournemouth, playing in the smallest ever ground in the division, stayed up. Meanwhile, historic metropolitan giants Aston Villa, Newcastle and Sunderland flopped, Chelsea's season has been over for weeks, Everton's underachievement just cost Roberto Martinez his job, and Liverpool's inconsistency may be redeemed by a Europa League win and entry to the Champions League. Management and recruitment matters more than ever In European terms, all 20 Premier League clubs are rich. Next season they are all guaranteed a minimum £100m from broadcast income, before they sell a shirt or a sponsorship. That means they can all compete for the best players in the world, and have a better chance of hanging on to those they've got. Everyone has the resources, so identifying the right players and manager matters more than ever. Newcastle make the point. For all the criticism of Mike Ashley, only Manchester City spent more on transfers than the Magpies' £80m, but the quality was mixed and Steve McClaren was the wrong choice to lead them. Ditched too late for Rafa Benitez, they paid the price. The right man with the right plan is essential. Running a Premier League club is harder and more expensive than it looks. English football is a great leveller for the petro-billionaires, retail-colossi and financial market millionaires drawn like moths to its flame in the last decade. We can assume nothing has been as chastening to Randy Lerner, Ellis Short and Mike Ashley than their stewardship of Villa, Sunderland and Newcastle respectively. And who, fans apart, can honestly say they've not enjoyed the cold-fish slap this season has delivered to Roman Abramovich, the Glazer family and Abu Dhabi’s ruling scions at Chelsea and in Manchester? No one has any idea what will happen next season Me included. Particularly me."
2016-05-13,"Workers for some of the largest poultry producers in the US are resorting to wearing nappies while on the processing line because they are being denied bathroom breaks, an Oxfam America report has revealed.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1694898/poultry-workers-wear-nappies-over-lack-of-breaks,"By Sky News US Team Workers for some of the largest poultry producers in the US are resorting to wearing nappies while on the processing line because they are being denied bathroom breaks, an Oxfam America report has revealed. The report, which involved interviews with employees at Tyson Foods, Pilgrim's Pride, Perdue Farms and Sanderson Farms, revealed workers were subjected to ridicule or punishment if they requested toilet breaks while working on the line. It claims some employees were forced to urinate and defecate where they stood, or restrict how much they ate and drank to dangerous levels for fear of losing their jobs. The report, titled No Relief: Denial of Bathroom Breaks in the Poultry Industry, calls on poultry companies to change their practices. Arkansas-based Tyson Foods was one of the companies named in the report It states: ""Supervisors mock their needs and ignore their requests; they threaten punishment or firing. Workers wait inordinately long times (an hour or more), then race to accomplish the task within a certain timeframe (eg ten minutes) or risk discipline. ""Workers struggled to cope with this denial of a basic human need. They urinate and defecate while standing on the line; they wear diapers to work; they restrict intake of liquids and fluids to dangerous degrees; they endure pain and discomfort while they worry about their health and job security. ""Supervisors deny requests to use the bathroom because they are under pressure to maintain the speed of the processing line, and to keep up production."" Oxfam America claims the estimated 250,000 poultry workers in the US are subjected to poor compensation, high rates of injury and illness and a climate of fear. Sanderson Farms, based in Mississippi, was also identified in the report The report also states that women are harder hit by the lack of toilet breaks and are at an increased vulnerability to infections as a result. It adds: ""Denial of regular access to the bathroom is a clear violation of US workplace safety law, and may also violate US anti-discrimination laws."" As part of the campaign it launched in October last year to improve conditions for US poultry workers, Oxfam America calls on major poultry producers to implement changes to working conditions. Two of the four producers - which account for around 60% of the poultry market - responded in the report. In a statement, Tyson Foods said: ""We care about our team members, so we find these claims troubling. ""We can tell you we're committed to treating each other with respect and this includes giving workers time off the production line when they need it. Restroom breaks are not restricted to scheduled work breaks and can be taken at any time."" Perdue Farms said: ""The health and welfare of our associates is paramount and we take these types of allegations very seriously. ""The anecdotes reported are not consistent with Perdue's policies and practices."""

The international journalists stay in a hotel on a small piece of land in the middle of the Taedong River in Pyongyang. Every time we leave the island we're accompanied by our government chaperones - Sky News' two-person team has two assigned. They are perfectly polite, impeccably-dressed gentlemen, ostensibly there to ""guide"" us and help translate, but they are at our sides during every interview, and supervising everything we see. We wear blue press armbands at all times when filming - to identify ourselves as foreign journalists to everyone we encounter. In fact, our island hotel is not a bad metaphor for the experience of reporting here. Life on the island is fine - as it is in the model factories we're taken to visit, with the model citizens we meet. But there's a big country beyond this media tour that we're not allowed to go to, so many conversations we're not able to have. So, as to what people's lives are really like here, how they truly feel about the leadership of Kim Jong-Un - I don't think we can know. We can only report what we see - and we can only see what they're prepared to show us. All we have are snapshots - sketches of life here in the relatively prosperous capital, Pyongyang. It can feel quite claustrophobic being accompanied everywhere, but I did discover one way to have some brief, unsupervised time beyond the hotel gates - by going for an early morning run. I couldn't leave the island, I was told - it ""wasn't safe"" - but I could run circuits around it. Gallery: Flowers, Flags and Pom-Poms At Massive Rally In North Korea A mass rally and parade has been staged in Pyongyang for North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, as the leader marks the end of the first Workers' Party congress in 36 years The first couple of paths I tried were blocked - one by metal bars, another by a guard who waved me back, but you could run along a stretch of the embankment, and back and forth to the sports stadium at the far end. Most people I passed looked at me like I had just arrived from outer space, some simply pretended not to see me, but a few did nod hello. There were party officials in their dark suits, always with their red Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il lapel badges in place. A long line of people pushing their bikes across the bridge overhead on the way to work. Soldiers in uniform, men in traditional Mao Zedong-style caps, a relay of boats dredging mud from the river bed. A schoolboy cycled past in his young pioneer's uniform - skidding to a halt and leaping off to walk alongside a friend. Not exactly meaningful interactions - just quick glimpses of passing lives. Maybe one day we'll get to talk to them and find out what they really think."
2016-05-13,NHS England has announced plans to improve cancer care and give patients a definitive diagnosis within four weeks.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1694573/nhs-plans-to-diagnose-cancer-within-28-days,"NHS England has announced plans to improve cancer care and give patients a definitive diagnosis within four weeks. It is hoped a £15m investment boost will allow doctors to diagnose people suspected of having cancer within 28 days of them being referred by their GP. The target was first proposed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in October and an NHS report suggests the move could save 30,000 lives a year by 2020. Improvement plans include using health experts to analyse data for cancer survival rates, early diagnosis rates, treatment outcomes, patient experience and quality of life, and use it to target areas for improvement. The plan to improve the service follows a Sky News investigation in February which revealed cancer patients are being treated on radiotherapy machines past their sell-by date. The Royal College of Radiologists said Sky News' findings were ""scandalous"" and a senior cancer specialist blamed the financial crisis in the NHS. The action plan also follows the NHS' Independent Cancer Taskforce report published last year, which identified how the NHS can achieve a world-class cancer outcomes. Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said: ""One in two people will be diagnosed with cancer and too many people are being diagnosed when their cancer is advanced. We need to change this. ""Through this cancer strategy we will drive a transformation in cancer care that will touch every corner of the country and improve services for thousands of people."" Dr Fran Woodard, executive director of policy and impact at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""We are also pleased to see commitments in the plan to ensure more people benefit from personalised care after treatment. ""But it is not clear how these parts of the strategy will be funded over the next five years.  ""NHS England and the Government must set out how they propose to fund this essential part of the cancer strategy if the improvements described in the plan are to be delivered."""
2016-05-13,An investigation has found no evidence Wiltshire Police deliberately sabotaged a trial in order to suppress allegations of sexual offences involving former prime minister Sir Edward Heath.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160513010147/http://news.sky.com/story/1694956/no-evidence-case-was-shelved-over-heath-claims,"An investigation has found no evidence Wiltshire Police deliberately sabotaged a trial in order to suppress allegations of sexual offences involving former prime minister Sir Edward Heath. It was alleged that the defendant had threatened to go to the media and say she supplied Sir Edward with males under the age of consent for sex if the trial went ahead. Investigators from the IPCC examined the circumstances surrounding the 1994 court case, which related to former brothel-owner Myra Ling Ling Forde. The police watchdog said the inquiry ""has found no evidence that a prosecution was not pursued because a defendant threatened to allege publicly that Sir Edward Heath had been involved in sexual offences involving young men"". The IPCC said it had found no evidence to support the claim that the alleged comment had any bearing on the outcome of the trial against Ms Forde. It also found no evidence that other officers within Wiltshire were aware of the alleged comment and failed to act upon it. The IPCC said: ""The investigation concluded that the trial against Ms Forde was stopped by the prosecution because their witnesses would not attend court or refused to give evidence."" Sir Edward, who was in office from 1970-1974, died in Salisbury in July 2005, aged 89. He became the most high-profile figure to be linked to historical abuse allegations last year. After the IPCC probe was announced, Wiltshire Police appealed for potential victims and others with information to come forward. In the aftermath of this it emerged a number of other forces were also carrying out inquiries linked to allegations against Sir Edward. In a statement issued on Thursday, Wiltshire Police said in a statement: ""As a result of the announcement by the IPCC naming Sir Edward Heath, Wiltshire Police felt it was appropriate to make an appeal to the public for any information relating to the allegation. ""As a result of the appeal, a number of people individually came forward with information. ""This led to a wider police investigation being established and we are following a number of lines of inquiry."" The force was appointed as the lead national force for the investigation into the allegations relating to Sir Edward. It said: ""At this time, the investigation led by Wiltshire Police continues and a panel of independent experts outside of policing is providing ongoing scrutiny of the investigation and its proportionality."" The IPCC's conclusions were revealed a day after it emerged that the inquiry into historical abuse claims has cost £367,965 so far."

The 32-year-old singer made a plea for ""peace and love"" as she collected her trophy after beating Australia - which competed for the second time after appearing as a guest last year - into second place and Russia into third. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko hailed Jamala's ""unbelievable"" victory with her song about Russian-annexed Crimea. ""Yes!!!"" Poroshenko tweeted. ""An unbelievable performance and victory! All of Ukraine gives you its heartfelt thanks, Jamala."" Jamala is a member of the Muslim Tatar minority of Crimea who saw her great-grandmother deported along with 240,000 others by Stalin in the penultimate year of World War II. Russia had earlier protested Ukraine's entry in the contest because of its ""political"" subtext - a violation of the contest's rules. But Eurovision ruled that Jamala was ""historical"" in nature and allowed her song to compete. The victory means Ukraine gets to host the contest next year. Asked by a Crimean journalist whether she thought the competition should be held in Crimea, Jamala answered ""I hope Eurovision will be in Ukraine."" The theme of this year's Eurovision was ""Come Together,"" a subtle message for Europe to stay united amid a backlash against migration to the continent and rising nationalism. Hosts Petra Mede and Mans Zelmerlow introduced a sombre mood to the contest by suggesting it would allow countries to ""set aside any differences we have"" as Europe faces ""darker times"". Some 26 finalists took part in the contest at Stockholm's Globe arena which was watched than 100 million viewers around the world including, for the first time, viewers in the United States. Graham Norton hosted the commentary on BBC One having taken over from his predecessor Terry Wogan in 2009. Norton paid tribute to Sir Terry who died in January, declaring that this year the contest was ""bittersweet"" for him. ""Eight years ago, when I was lucky enough to get this job of commentating, Sir Terry very kindly and graciously phoned me, and the only bit of advice he had for me was 'Don't have a drink before song nine',"" he said. British contenders Joe and Jake limped home in 24th place out of 26th with their song You're Not Alone."

The latest allegations, which widen the Russian crisis beyond athletics, already mired in scandal, come just 83 days before the start of the Rio Olympics and pose a new challenge to the integrity of the Games and global anti-doping. The new allegations of systematic doping, and an associated cover-up, came in an interview with the New York Times by the former head of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), Grigory Rodchenkov, who claimed to have run a sophisticated doping operation in Sochi. As well as doping 15 medallists, he also described a secret operation, co-ordinated with the Russian security service the FSB, to remove tainted samples from the official Olympic headquarters. :: Russia Banned From World Athletics Over Doping :: Russia Frustrates Doping Tests Before Olympics Rodchenko claimed to have established a secret laboratory, in a room adjoining the main anti-doping lab in Sochi, and to have switched samples by passing them through a hole cut in the wall. WADA and the International Olympic Committee said they will investigate the allegations, but Russia’s deputy sports minister Yuri Nagornych told a press conference in Moscow ""there has not and never has been any kind of doping programme in Russian sport."" Russian track-and-field athletes were banned from international competition last November after the revelation of ""state supported"" doping, and RUSADA was disbanded. WADA was hoping to provide an alternative testing regime by recruiting UK Anti-Doping, but Sky News understands it may consider withdrawing because of the repeated obstruction of its officials. Sky News revealed earlier this week that anti-doping officials had been repeatedly prevented from testing athletes, and WADA has now confirmed the scale of the problem. Its board was told there were just 10 doping control officers for the whole of Russia and that some had been threatened with having their visas revoked if they tried to test athletes. Beckie Scott, chair of WADA's athlete's committee, told Sky News that the agency had been contacted by many athletes who were concerned about doping. ""They are demanding that they be given a chance to compete on a fair and level playing field and that's what we are trying to do here,"" Ms Scott said.   WADA also revealed that UKAD had carried out just 247 testing missions in four months. Of these 99 where ""whereabouts failures"" - the athlete was not available for testing - and 49 contained adverse analytical findings, 47 of them for recently-banned heart drug meldonium. Just 99, or 40% of the total, were completed, clean tests. UKAD’s board has not yet recommended they walk away from Russia, but it is understood they are monitoring the situation. Were they to do so, it would cast major doubt on the chances of Russia’s athletes being readmitted in time for the Olympics. World athletics’ governing body the IAAF is scheduled to make the decision on 17 June. In a statement UKAD said: ""The Board discussed the risks associated with such an arrangement and those risks, and others, are regularly reviewed by the Board, in addition to the progress being made. ""As with any agreement, termination is always a possibility if the circumstances change. At no stage has the UKAD Board proposed withdrawing from this agreement."""

The 22-year-old, from Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, was jailed in 2013 along with Michaella McCollum, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, after they admitted trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5m from Peru to Spain. Reid had been seeking to serve the remainder of her sentence closer to home in Scotland following her conviction. A Peruvian court on Thursday said Reid has shown remorse for the crime, and authorities agreed to release her. Peru's National Office for Migration and the British Embassy in Peru are being informed of the decision so arrangements can be made for Reid to be returned to the UK. McCollum, 23, was freed in March under new legislation on early prison release introduced in Peru last year. Michaella McCollum was freed last month She had served two years and three months. However, it is anticipated she will have to remain in Peru for a considerable period as part of her parole conditions. Reid and McCollum were caught with the haul at Lima airport in August 2013 while attempting to fly to Spain. The pair were caught trying to board a flight with 24lb (11kg) of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage. They claimed they were forced into carrying the drugs but pleaded guilty to charges later that year. McCollum and Reid faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind-closed-doors plea bargain to secure a shorter sentence. Reid's father Billy has previously said the impact of his daughter's crime on his family had been ""horrendous"" and spoke in a video warning of the consequences of drug offences abroad. He said: ""It's horrendous to see your daughter in handcuffs and the living conditions that she has to put up with. Melissa has spent her own 20th and 21st birthdays in prison in Peru. ""She missed the significant event of her only brother's wedding. Events such as Christmas are non-existent for us.

Class War activists and trade unionists, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell, stopped traffic and massed around the entrance to the Oxford Street shop. Waving placards and banners in the air, about 200 demonstrators chanted ""Topshop, shame on you"" as part of an apparent campaign to promote what they described as a genuine living wage. Activists let off a red smoke bomb on Oxford Street during the protest Some of their anger was also directed towards Topshop owner Sir Philip Green, with several protesters wearing masks of his face. The group were forced to move on but marched down Oxford Street where a small number attempted to charge into John Lewis. Scuffles between police and protesters broke out as officers attempted to stop them going inside the store entrance. Protesters wave placard in Oxford Circus Several members of Class War set off smoke bombs which belched out red smoke as shoppers looked on. The group then headed to the Marble Arch branch of Topshop, forcing the store to pull down its shutters. The move left dozens of shoppers locked inside for about 15 minutes. The protesters remained outside the store, continuing to chant and bang drums, before heading back to the Oxford Circus store. A protester wears a mask of Sir Philip Green's face The United Voices of the World union (UVW), which organised the event, claimed two Topshop cleaners had been ""victimised and bullied"" for joining their organisation. Teresa Grey, from the group, said she and her fellow protesters had taken to the streets to ""make their voices heard"". She said: ""Two Topshop cleaners joined our union. For that, one was sacked, the other suspended."" Asked where they were marching to, she said: ""No idea. We're just marching."" A line of police officers was deployed outside the Oxford Circus Topshop The union said in a tweet that Mr McDonnell ""was supporting the @Topshop cleaners - who are @UVWunion members - fight for a living wage"". Aysan Dennis, from protest group Class War, said: ""We want our voices heard. This is a class war."" Asked why she was blocking traffic she pointed at Topshop, saying: ""I don't care. The tax dodgers are the real criminals."" The protest comes after Topshop owner Sir Philip was called to appear before MPs to answers questions about British Home Stores, which went into administration last month."

The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents more than 370 councils, said people should think twice about buying counterfeit cigarettes because they contain far higher levels of toxic ingredients such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, lead and arsenic than their genuine counterparts. They also contain up to 500% more of the toxic metal cadmium than brand-name cigarettes. Manchester, Croydon and Coventry have recently seen raids and prosecutions by councils, with trading standards officers finding illegal hidden stashes. Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's safer and stronger communities board, said: ""Illegal tobacco being sold cheaply through the black market by rogue traders is funding organised criminal gangs, damaging legitimate traders and robbing the taxpayer of more than £2bn that could be spent on schools, hospitals and caring for the elderly. ""No cigarettes are good for you, and fake cigarettes contain even higher levels of cancer-causing toxins than standard cigarettes, so people should think twice about buying them. ""Any shopkeeper thinking of selling illegal tobacco should think again."" A Department of Health spokesman added: ""Smoking is the biggest preventable killer in our country.

Horses and ponies have been Elizabeth II's passion since her first riding lesson when she was around three years old. It was a love she shared with her mother and she has gone on to breed and race horses for more than 60 years. Thoroughbreds owned by the Queen have won four out of the five flat racing classics - the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas, the Oaks and the St Leger - with only the Derby eluding her. Princess Elizabeth spending her seventh birthday on a horse Her horse Dunfermline, ridden by jockey Willie Carson, gave the Queen her most famous victory, triumphing in the Oaks and St Leger in her Silver Jubilee year 1977. In recent years the Queen made sporting history when she became the first reigning monarch to win Royal Ascot's Gold Cup with her thoroughbred Estimate in 2013. She has also notched up more than 20 winners at Royal Ascot - one of the premier events of the racing season. From early childhood the Queen was surrounded by horses and relatives who owned, rode and talked about them. Her first reported riding lesson took place in the private riding school at Buckingham Palace Mews in January 1930. When she was five the Queen Mother led her on Peggy, a Shetland pony given to her when she was four by her grandfather King George V, to a meet of the Pytchley Hounds at Boughton Cover. After she became sovereign in February 1952 the Queen inherited the royal colours: purple, gold braid, scarlet sleeves, black velvet cap with gold fringe. Her first winner as Queen came just a few months later when Choir Boy passed the winning post ahead of the field to claim the Wilburton Handicap at Newmarket that May. Over the following decades she pursued her keen interest in horse breeding, sending her mares to stud farms around the world as well as breeding animals at home. Her passion has also been passed down to her children and grandchildren. Princess Anne is known for her equestrian talents and was the first member of the Royal Family to take part in an Olympic Games. Her daughter Zara Tindall is also a British equestrian and won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. The Queen's horses and ponies, which number around 180, are kept at various royal residences and stables from Sandringham to Balmoral. The monarch takes a keen interest in their breeding and training and is respected for her knowledge of the equine world. But the head of state famously does not bet and appears to get her enjoyment from watching her horses develop and compete. The Queen's cousin Margaret Rhodes, interviewed for a documentary about the monarch's passion for horse racing, said: ""You see I think that early on, when she became Queen, I think that she had to sacrifice within herself an awful lot of emotions and thoughts of the future and everything else. ""But I think with horses it's another world in that it reduces you to just the person in relation to the animal, and you're not a Queen, you're just a human being."""

The presumed head of the Vote Leave campaign said previous leaders such as Hitler and Napoleon attempted a similar goal, albeit using different methods. ""Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,"" he said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph. ""But fundamentally what is lacking is the eternal problem, which is that there is no underlying loyalty to the idea of Europe."" :: EU Questions For PM Or Gove?

Former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper accused him of playing a ""nasty, nasty game"". ""The more he flails around with this kind of hysterical claim, the more he exposes his shameful lack of judgement, his willingness to play the most divisive cynical politics, and the emptiness of his arguments,"" she said.

He added: ""Leave campaigners have lost the economic argument and now they are losing their moral compass."" :: So What Happens If We Leave The EU Former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont told Sky's Murnaghan Programme he did not think Mr Johnson's comments were ""outrageous"". He said: ""I myself referred not so long ago but was very careful to say, 'I'm not comparing people who support Europe to Nazis', but it actually is a fact there were fascist theorists who believed very strongly in a united Europe."" Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""absolutely true"".  He said ""Philip II of Spain, Louis XIV of France, Napoleon and Hitler all wanted to create a single European power.

The club said in a statement that it had been sold to Dr Tony Jiantong Xia's Recon Group, subject to approval by football authorities. The deal is reported to be worth £60m. It ends an unhappy tenure for Mr Lerner, who bought the club for £62.2m in 2006 and first signalled his intention to sell in 2014. He has been the target of bitter protests by fans. Dr Xia - himself described as a former college striker and passionate football enthusiast - will become Villa's new chairman. He has pledged to return to the club's glory days of European football and plans to create a huge fan base in China. Current chairman Steve Hollis had flown to China to complete the deal days after the club's dismal Premier League campaign concluded at the weekend. Villa had long before confirmed their relegation - the first time the team had fallen out of England's top-flight since 1987. Fans have staged walk-out protests during games after 74 minutes of play - a reference to the club's proud history since its formation in 1874, with honours including seven top-flight titles and the European Cup. A club statement on Wednesday said: ""Aston Villa Football Club is pleased to announce that an agreement has been signed today for the sale of 100 per cent ownership by Randy Lerner to Recon Group owned by Dr Tony Jiantong Xia subject to the approval of the Premier League and the Football League. ""Once those approvals have been granted and the new board members approved under the fit and proper rules of both leagues, Dr Xia will become chairman of Aston Villa.""

""He believes that Tony Xia is an excellent choice.""  Dr Xia's privately-owned Recon Group controls five publicly-listed companies on the Chinese and Hong Kong stock exchanges, as well as other private companies, in total employing 35,000 people in 75 countries, the statement said. It added: ""Dr Xia played football as a striker until he finished at college and football has remained his passion. ""Dr Xia decided to buy an iconic football Club in England as the cornerstone of his Sports, Leisure and Tourism Division. ""He became a fan of Aston Villa many years ago and is delighted at the opportunity to become the new owner.

2016-05-18,Andy Burnham has claimed Westminster has failed the north of England as he launched his campaign to become a powerful mayor of Greater Manchester.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160519124336/http://news.sky.com/story/1698480/burnham-westminster-has-failed-the-north,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Andy Burnham has claimed Westminster has failed the north of England as he launched his campaign to become a powerful mayor of Greater Manchester. Declaring he will fight to end the North-South divide, he is demanding better road and rail communications for the North and pledging to integrate health and social care. Mr Burnham unveiled his personal manifesto for the soon-to-be created job, to be elected in May 2017, in a speech to Labour activists and supporters in Salford. His decision to stand, revealed by Sky News as polls closed on election night on 5 May, is part of a potential brain drain of senior Labour MPs and will prompt claims that they see little future under Jeremy Corbyn at Westminster. Ex-minister Huw Irranca-Davies has already turned his back on Westminster for the Welsh Assembly and Mr Burnham faces two former Labour ministers, Tony Lloyd and Ivan Lewis, as rivals for Greater Manchester mayor. Also, two prominent Merseyside MPs, Luciana Berger and Steve Rotheram, have revealed that they are considering seeking the Labour nomination for the new post of Liverpool City Region mayor. In his speech launching his bid, Mr Burnham said: ""Put bluntly, Westminster has failed the North. It has left us with an uneven share of resources, power and life chances. ""I am ready to leave Westminster and devote myself to this new task of re-balancing our country from South to North. ""This is an unprecedented moment when we have a chance to do just that. I am not prepared to let it pass."" Mr Burnham, 46, held three Cabinet posts - Treasury Chief Secretary, Culture Secretary and Health Secretary - under Gordon Brown and was a leading campaigner in the fight for justice after the Hillsborough disaster. In a swipe at his two ex-minister rivals, Mr Lloyd and Mr Lewis, who never reached the Cabinet, Mr Burnham said: ""The Mayor of Greater Manchester is a Cabinet-level job that requires Cabinet-level experience."" On transport, he said: ""Patch and mend and an extra lane on the M62 is not good enough. ""We have put up with outdated, overcrowded rail services for too long. ""So I will make it my business to ensure the Government commits to major investment in brand new high-speed East-West rail across the North. ""Let me be clear: this is the top priority for the country, not Crossrail 2. ""If George Osborne is serious about a Northern Powerhouse, he must put his money where his mouth is.” And on caring for older or vulnerable people, he will pledge: ""As Mayor, I will make it my mission to build here the country's first fully-integrated National Health and Care Service - working to bring social care into the public sector and the NHS; taking Bevan's great vision from the last century and updating it for this."" He also claimed Labour needs to learn lessons from its demise in Scotland, warning his party: ""Let's not make the mistake of Scotland. ""If Labour fails to take this moment seriously, and field its biggest hitters, then we will leave an opportunity for others. I am not prepared to let that happen."""

Her Majesty's gilded procession towards Parliament, and her inability to step foot in the House of Commons are annual fixtures of British democracy. But there was no ceasefire. Instead leading Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, chose to use the Sovereign's moment to go on Sky News to argue for reclaiming sovereignty he argues has been lost to the EU. :: PM Accused Of Watering Down Queen's Speech He focused on what he said was a missing Sovereignty Bill. Certainly some version of a plan to reassert the primacy of UK courts over the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice had been mooted ahead of the final EU renegotiation in February. Few had expected anything in the Queen's Speech. The separate reference to the British Bill of Rights was a repeat of what had been announced last year - proposals, not legislation, to change the current relationship with the separate European Court of Human Rights based in Strasbourg. More than that, IDS claimed that there had been a ""helter skelter"" approach to government in recent months with the Government watering down and jettisoning controversial legislation ahead of the referendum. It is difficult to escape this conclusion. Certainly there were no coincidences that last month's Trade Union Bill compromise emerged just hours before the PM announced a joint referendum initiative with an ex TUC boss, and the unions filled the coffers of the Labour IN campaign by £2m. The rollback on Short Money can be added to the EU ceasefire with Labour too. :: Queen's Speech 2016: The Key Points But the difficulties in pursuing a bold agenda run way beyond European divides. Her Majesty's address did not even mention the word ""academy"" - for the first time in three years. In March compulsory academisation was the fundamental reform announced on the morning of the Budget. The U-turn on that, slipped out on local elections day, arose mainly because of jitters from Conservative MPs. This was also the case with the Dubs amendment on child refugees, and the U-turns on tax credits and disability benefits. The PM does not have a majority large enough to pursue all of the bold measures he would like. :: When's A Policy Not A Policy? Govt U-Turns There was certainly the outline of an interesting agenda announced today. From spaceports, to driverless cars, planning reform, adoption changes, buses, broadband and business rate devolution. ""Lifetime ISA"" sounds almost as surprising from the lips of the Queen this year as ""Northern Powerhouse"" did last year. The PM wants this to be remembered as a ""One Nation"" Queen's Speech - with prison reform, education reform, counter extremism and opportunity for all. It is a narrative of unity the Prime Minister wants as his legacy for the nation. It is the reality of disunity in his own party, however, that has given rise to an unambitious Queen's Speech, designed, primarily to avoid annoying as many voters as possible."

The fate of the plane is not yet known and officials have said it is too early to rule out any possibility, including terrorism. French and Egyptian foreign ministers exchanged condolences over what was described as the ""fall"", suggesting the plane may have crashed near the southern Greek island of Karpathos where the search is taking place. Flight MS804 departed the French capital at 11.09pm (CEST) before vanishing. The flight path of MS804 The airline said the plane lost contact with radar at 2.45am Cairo time (1.45am BST). It was last in touch 10 minutes earlier. :: EgyptAir Flight Disappears: Live Updates Gallery: EgyptAir Plane Loses Contact With Radar Unidentified relatives and friends of passengers who were flying in an EgyptAir plane that vanished from radar en route from Paris to Cairo wait outside the Egyptair in-flight service building where relatives are being held at Cairo International Airport, Egypt At that stage the Airbus A320, which was 13 years old and had logged 48,000 flight hours, was about three hours and 40 minutes into the four-hour journey and flying at 37,000ft. The airline said the plane had been 10 miles into Egyptian airspace, over the Mediterranean Sea, when it disappeared. However, Egyptian civil aviation authority spokesman Ihab Raslan told Sky News Arabia that it was about to enter Egyptian airspace when it disappeared. He said the plane had most likely crashed into the sea. :: EgyptAir Plane: What Could Have Happened? Military search and rescue teams picked up an automated signal from the plane's emergency beacon at 4.26am Cairo time (3.26am BST) - around 80 minutes after it was supposed to land in Cairo. It is thought this may have been triggered on impact. Thirty Egyptians, 15 French, two Iraqis, a Belgian, Kuwaiti, Saudi, Sudanese, Chadian, Algerian, Portuguese and Canadian are among the passengers which also include one child and two babies. Greece has joined special teams from the Egyptian armed forces in the search for the jet and deployed one C-130, an early warning aircraft, a frigate and helicopters. France is also sending boats and planes. All vessels near Karpathos have been alerted to help. Bulk carrier Oceanus reported seeing no debris or fuel. Greek civil aviation authorities said the jet disappeared off its radar two minutes after leaving its airspace. Prior to that, its air traffic controllers spoke to the pilot who reported no problems. Ahmed Abdel, the vice-chairman of EgyptAir holding company, told CNN there had been no distress calls from the plane. The New York Times quoted Ehab Mohy el-Deen, the head of Egypt's air navigation authority, as saying: ""They did not radio for help or lose altitude. They just vanished."" The airline said the plane's pilot had flown 6,275 hours - including 2,101 hours on the same model - while the co-pilot had done 2,766 hours. Commercial airline pilot Chris McGee told Sky News there were only two circumstances that would prevent a pilot from contacting air traffic control: ""One would be if there was human intervention. The second is something has occurred on the flight deck. ""The first thing you are taught is fly the airplane first, handle the problem, and then communicate. So if you have got your hands full that is potentially why you wouldn't talk to air traffic."" A crisis centre offering support to the distressed families with loved ones on board has been set up at Cairo International Airport.

Zafreen Khadam, 32, was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court after she was found guilty of 10 offences under the Terrorism Act. The court heard she had suggested in messages to friends that she was going to Syria and would ""marry"" the infamous IS killer. Detective Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, head of the North East Counter Terrorism Unit said Khadam, from Sheffield, openly supported IS, also known as Daesh. He said his officers reviewed hundreds of hours of video and thousands of social media postings, saying Khadam tweeted up to 20,000 times over one five-week period last year. He said: ""It is clear from the evidence presented that Khadam openly demonstrated support for Daesh and their ideology, using multiple social media accounts to further spread the propaganda of this terrorist organisation. ""Khadam has not disputed posting the information, claiming she did so out of curiosity and the belief that she did not consider it to be terrorist material. ""Yet this material glorified terrorism and delivered powerful messages, encouraging terrorist acts and calling upon others to kill."" Khadam had suggested whe wanted to go to Syria and marry 'Jihadi John' He added: ""Khadam was prolific in her use of social media and showed little regard for the consequences of openly sharing deeply disturbing images and material across a number of digital platforms. ""Much of this material encouraged violent action and was very extreme in the violence it portrayed."" Officers found Khadam had been using 15 social media profiles for posting extreme material. One of her accounts - with the Twitter handle Jihadi Princess - favourited videos, including one that depicted prisoners kneeling in cages in preparation for execution, and which went on to show one person being burnt alive in a cage and another having his throat cut. Another portrayed the use of children by IS, including weapons training and youngsters threatening to kill non-Muslims. Police said analysis of Khadam's activity on the WhatsApp messaging service showed that she sent a number of IS-produced videos and documents to numerous contacts. Khadam had denied the charges, saying she just wanted to understand IS, and did not support it."

The 19-year-old's uncle, Yakubu Nkeki, said she was pregnant and traumatised, but otherwise unharmed. Her father died while she was being held captive, Mr Nkeki said. Manaseh Allan, a Chibok youth leader, told the AFP news agency: ""The girl was found by local vigilantes in Kilakesa village on the edge of Sambisa Forest near Damboa. ""She was brought first to Chibok by the vigilantes who took her to the vice-principal of her school, who immediately identified her as Aisha Ali, which is her name in the school register. ""She was presented to community leaders as Amina Ali but her name as it appears in the school register is Aisha Ali. ""It is common for children in Chibok to be called with one name in school and another at home."" :: On The Front Line Of Battle Against Boko Haram There was international outrage when 276 girls - mostly aged between 16 and 18 - were abducted from their school in Chibok in April 2014. More than 50 managed to escape over the next few months. High-profile figures including American first lady Michelle Obama joined a campaign with the hashtag: #BringBackOurGirls. Hope was briefly raised in April 2015 when the Nigerian military announced it had rescued 200 girls and 93 women from the Sambisa Forest. It later emerged that the Chibok girls were not among them.

Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood withdrew her bid to be first minister Last week Ms Williams had backed Mr Jones' nomination for the post, while on Wednesday Plaid withdrew Ms Wood's name as a rival candidate. Mr Hamilton sparked uproar after claiming both politicians had ""betrayed the interests"" of voters, before adding: ""I'm afraid these two ladies have made themselves political concubines in Carwyn's harem.

Will Geddes, managing director of private security firm International Corporate Protection, urged people to be ""cautious"" about assuming the disappearance was caused by terrorism because the flight had departed from Paris, which has suffered several attacks in recent years.

Ex-Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith accused the Prime Minister of ""tossing aside"" important elements of the legislative programme in his ""helter-skelter pursuit of the Referendum"". Mr Duncan Smith, who dramatically resigned over welfare reform in March, said there was ""increasing concern"" among many Conservatives over the ""jettisoning"" of proposals. Missing from the 21-Bill speech was the Sovereignty Bill, which was promised after the EU renegotiation deal as a way of bringing power back to the UK. :: When's A Policy Not A Policy? Govt U-Turns Mr Cameron had told the House of Commons in February that the measures, designed to tackle the powers of the European Court of Justice, would ""put beyond doubt"" the sovereignty of UK parliament. The Prime Minister said he would look to introduce the measure at the same time as the conclusion of the negotiations, leading politicians to believe it would be in the Queen's Speech. In addition, the long-awaited Bill of Rights was scant on details and only a consultation on proposals, which are to be ""published in due course"".

The Reds seemed well placed to win a first European trophy in 11 years at half-time, when they led 1-0 courtesy of an exquisite Daniel Sturridge strike. But Sevilla equalised 18 seconds after the restart through forward Kevin Gameiro, and went on to add two more goals through right-back and captain Coke to wrap up a third straight Europa League triumph. The third goal proved controversial, after an assistant signalled an apparent offside against Coke, but then lowered his flag. Sevilla players lift the trophy Liverpool also had three penalty appeals waved away in the first half. The result was a bitter blow for the more than 20,000 Liverpool fans who had made it into St Jakob-Park in the Swiss city of Basel - despite an official allocation of 12,000 tickets. A win would have seen the Reds earn a place in the group stages of next season's Champions League, but instead Klopp's men will have to focus on the Premier League and domestic cup competitions next term. The Reds boss said after the game that he hoped his side can learn from the loss. Klopp told BT Sport: ""We did not defend well and were nervous and that shows our development is not as good as we hoped but we will use this experience to be stronger and I am sure we will be stronger if we use it in the right way, but for tonight it is disappointment and frustration. ""Tonight we couldn't reach the level and it is my job to help the boys use these opportunities. ""I am responsible for this performance too, so no criticism for my players tonight."" Liverpool captain James Milner said their second half performance was not good enough. He said: ""I am devastated at losing the game but I think the most disappointing thing is in the second half we didn't show what we are about, we played nowhere near our abilities, that's the biggest thing for me. ""We were ready, we made sure we wanted to do the right things, everyone was switched on, we just didn't show it. ""We have come out and given a sloppy goal away in the first few seconds of the second half and never really got back in the game after that."" It is the second cup final defeat for Liverpool this season, having lost the Capital One Cup final to Manchester City on penalties."

The boy, identified in court only as AB, is severely disabled because of the neurological condition he has had since he was just a few weeks old.  He cannot walk, eat or communicate. The court was told a suction tube inserted in his mouth cannot be removed because he would drown in his own secretion. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust argued it was not in the child's best interests to continue with intrusive, medical interventions like mechanical ventilation because they caused him to suffer.   The judge, Mrs Justice Parker, was asked to decide whether it was in the best interests of the boy to prolong his young life. She said: ""This is not about bringing this little boy's life to an end.""  The parents had earlier told the court they believed their son's condition was improving and they held out hope for a cure. But the judge dismissed this, saying: ""There is no evidence to support the parents' viewpoint. It is wishful thinking.""  The little boy's mother and father released a statement via their solicitor, saying they were ""devastated"" by the judgement. ""They believe that the declaration made by the court effectively condemns their son to death,"" it said. ""They believe that his life is worth saving and this should be preserved. ""They are particularly concerned that a prognosis has been given by the doctors when no firm diagnosis has been made. ""They remain of the view that all possible treatment options should remain open to their son and that the NHS Trust have, to date, not explored all possible options. ""They feel that there is a personal element in this case and cannot understand why the NHS Trust has made an application with respect to their son, when they believe there must be other children in a worse condition."" A statement from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust said: ""Staff have been acting in the best interests of their patient throughout this difficult and tragic case. ""Our teams of nurses and doctors will continue to provide the best possible care for this little boy. ""We will continue to work with the child’s family and to offer support to them through this difficult time."""

The Spectator magazine, which he used to edit, has announced he has won the £1,000 top prize in its ""President Erdogan Offensive Poetry Competition"". The announcement came just hours after Tory grandee Lord Heseltine accused Mr Johnson of stooping to ""obscene"" statements under the strain of leading the campaign to leave the EU. Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan In an interview last weekend, the former London mayor compared the aims of the EU with those of Adolf Hitler, which prompted the former deputy prime minister's attack. Mr Johnson was also accused of being unfit for high office after he spoke of Barack Obama's ""part-Kenyan"" ancestry during the US President's visit to the UK last month. The Spectator says it launched its contest after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan persuaded Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel to order an investigation of a German comedian who broadcast a dirty poem about him. Mr Erdogan has since also been granted an injunction against Jan Boehmermann repeating most of the verse, which a German court said crossed the line between ""satirical criticism and pure abuse"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel and comedian Jan Boehmermann Mr Johnson's prize-winning verse was: ""There was a young fellow from Ankara, Who was a terrific w*******, Till he sowed his wild oats, ""With the help of a goat, But he didn't even stop to thankera."" The former London mayor - whose great-grandfather was Turkish - had accused the German Chancellor of ""an outrageous infringement of free speech ... that smacked of some of the darkest moments in Germany's 20th century history"". He was challenged to come up with an entry for the Spectator contest during an interview for a Swiss magazine and devised a limerick that referred to the theme of the German comedian's original piece of satire. ""If somebody wants to make a joke about the love that flowers between the Turkish president and a goat, he should be able to do so, in any European country, including Turkey,"" he told the magazine. Anti-EU campaigner Mr Johnson is believed to be surprised that the poem had been formally entered into the contest but not embarrassed, believing it is important that the free speech issue continues to be aired."

But critics say they haven't accomplished much from their last one. Political Correspondent Tamara Cohen looks at the few of the major policy U-turns from the past year, and how damaging they have been. :: Tax credits The Conservatives promised during the election campaign to slash a massive £12bn from the welfare budget, but without spelling out where the axe would fall. In George Osborne's emergency Budget last July, he announced he had found £4.4bn of this from tax credits, which subsidise the income of the lowest-paid. The Chancellor said he was making the system more ""affordable,"" but many Tory backbenchers were nervous and the plans were embarrassingly defeated in the House of Lords.

Officials were concerned about how quickly the bill for this weekly benefit was rising. But those affected included 640,000 people who need help dressing and using the bathroom. It also jarred with the offer of middle-class tax breaks in the same Budget, and in the storm which followed Welfare Secretary Iain Duncan Smith dramatically resigned saying the cuts were ""indefensible"".

Damage rating: 9/10 :: Trade union crackdown After an expected victory at the General Election, how better to keep the Thatcherite flame ablaze than with a crackdown on trade unions which organised public sector walkouts under the Coalition. Thresholds for strike action were to rise. Labour party members could no longer be automatically enrolled in unions and there was talk of a ban on mentioning strikes on Twitter and workers on picket line having to wear armbands. What happened? The EU referendum campaign and ministers needing to get Labour supporters and trade union members to turn out and vote to stay in the European Union. Armbands and Twitter bans were dropped, the funding changes were watered down. The Tory Right was unimpressed. Damage rating: 2/10 :: Child refugees David Cameron vowed Britain would fulfil its ""moral responsibility"" last September by taking in 20,000 vulnerable refugees from the camps around Syria to start new lives in Britain. But the charity Save the Children had wanted the Government to aid some 3,000 unaccompanied children who had travelled to Europe already and were living in squalid conditions in Greece and Calais. Labour and the Liberal Democrats backed the call, but ministers stood firm insisting it would only provide a ""pull factor"" for people to make dangerous journeys by sea. That was until Labour peer Alf Dubs got involved - an 84-year-old rescued from the Nazis on the Kindertransport who said the 3,000 must be let in. As it became clear Tory backbenchers were wavering, David Cameron accepted defeat, although would not commit to a specific number. Damage rating: 3/10 :: Forced academisation The Conservative party manifesto talked about ""turning every failing and coasting school into an academy"" - run directly from Whitehall, rather than by local councils. Then in his March 2016 Budget the Chancellor announced every single school would have to become an academy by 2022 ""to give headteachers more control over budgets and the curriculum"". A fierce backlash ensued, as former minister Tim Loughton said he thought Conservatives believed in choice, others worried small rural schools would be forced to close and MPs asked why something not broken needed fixing. As Labour took the heat for poor local election results, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan announced a U-turn. The bill will be in the Queen’s Speech but with a series of concessions. Damage rating: 5/10 :: Fox hunting The Conservatives opposed the ban on fox hunting imposed by Tony Blair's government, and in a boost to their rural supporters, promised MPs would have a free vote. They knew Labour MPs would vote against it, but didn’t bank on the Scottish Nationalists - who have already banned fox hunting in Scotland – voting against the measure applying in England. With a slim majority of 12, it appeared the Conservative party had changed over the past decade with 50 Tory MPs also opposed. Having misread the mood, it was one of the first U-turns in July last year. Damage rating: 4/10"

Four-year-old Rebus was struck by a police 4x4 while involved in a pursuit in the early hours of Wednesday morning in Colnwick, Nottingham, police said. The German Shepherd Belgian Shepherd-cross was given emergency care at the scene but died of his injuries with his handler by his side. Chief Inspector Andy Hall, of the East Midlands Operational Support Service (EMOpSS), said: ""This incident is being fully and actively reviewed, and we await the findings. ""I take the view at this time, however, that it appears to have been a tragic accident. ""I would like to acknowledge and commend the care given to Rebus in his time of need. Not only did an officer provide CPR at the scene, a number of members of the public offered their assistance. ""A valued police dog and a loyal companion, Rebus certainly would have known he was loved. ""Our colleague is devastated and the officer who was driving the vehicle is understandably distressed. They are being supported by their team and they in turn are being supported by their associates. ""Rebus was not only a fine police dog, he was a member of our policing family. His impeccable service was acknowledged at a memorial today in which DCC Sue Fish laid a wreath in his honour."" Rebus joined Nottinghamshire Police as a pup in July 2012, and in his four years of service he helped catch numerous suspects, police said. Since the launch of EMOpSS in May last year he had attended 313 incidents. Three teenage boys were arrested on suspicion of theft following the incident in which Rebus was killed. The two 15-year-olds and a 17-year-old remain in police custody for questioning."

Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, says the complex nature of retirement funds is harming Britons' efforts to save enough for their old age. Mr Haldane said ordinary workers had no chance of making informed decisions about their pension plans when experts and financial advisers ""have no clue either"". Speaking at the New City Agenda annual dinner on Wednesday, Mr Haldane said the process should be simplified. Andrew Haldane warned about the complex nature of pensions He also called for changes to the teaching of maths in schools to reduce what he described as the ""incredible"" levels of innumeracy among British adults. He cited research by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as revealing that 17 million adults in the UK have a standard of maths ""no higher than (that) of a primary school child"". He said the school curriculum should focus on relating it to the ""big financial decisions that, if flunked, can have big social, as well as financial, consequences"". ""Of course, part of the reason so many members of the public find finance difficult is because it is difficult - and, sometimes at least, it is made deliberately so,"" he said. ""There is plenty of evidence, including from the financial crisis, of financial products being made more complex than was necessary and consumers being charged a premium for buying them. ""This damaging cycle persists because of the difficulties consumers understandably face when trying to compare these products."" Mr Haldane described himself as ""moderately financially literate"" but said that, while he struggled to make sense of pensions, ""conversations with countless experts and independent financial advisors have confirmed for me only one thing - that they have no clue either"". He added: ""That is a desperately poor basis for sound financial planning."" His comments come after a report found as many as six in 10 people do not feel they know enough about pensions to confidently decide how to save for retirement."

2016-05-20,The competition regulator says Ladbrokes and Gala Coral may need to sell up to 400 betting shops if their merger is to be cleared.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160520190741/http://news.sky.com/story/1699184/ladbrokes-and-coral-may-have-to-sell-400-shops,"The competition regulator says Ladbrokes and Gala Coral may need to sell up to 400 betting shops if their merger is to be cleared. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the provisional findings of its probe into the proposed £2.3bn tie-up had identified ""concerns in a large number of local areas"". The bookmakers have 4,004 stores between them across the UK and a merger would create the largest high street chain. The CMA said its working group ""identified 659 local areas where it provisionally found that the merger may be expected to result in a substantial loss of competition, which could lead to a worsening of the offer made to customers at both a local and national level"". It added that its only concerns on the deal were over physical stores. Martin Cave, who is chairing the CMA's inquiry, said: ""We’ve provisionally found that the merger between two of the largest bookmakers in the country may be expected to reduce competition and choice for customers in a large number of local areas. ""Although online betting has grown substantially in recent years, the evidence we’ve seen confirms that a large number of customers still choose to bet in shops - and many would continue to do so after the merger. ""For these customers, competition comes from the choice of shops in their local area and it’s they who could lose out from any reduction of competition and choice. ""Discounts and offers of free bets to individual customers are ways betting shops respond to local competition which could be threatened by the merger. ""We’re also concerned that such a widespread potential reduction in competition at the local level could worsen those elements that are set nationally such as odds and betting limits."" The CMA said it was now seeking responses to its provisional findings before coming to a final decision by 19 August - a date it extended by eight weeks because of the scale of the proposed remedies. The regulator added that stores sales would need to be substantially completed before the merger could go ahead. Ladbrokes said: ""We believe this represents a significant step in the merger process. ""Our focus now will continue to be to work with the CMA to progress the merger to focus on finding a suitable buyer or buyers in order to deliver the necessary remedies"". The company's share price surged ahead when the markets opened for business on Friday - up 12% in early trading of the loss-making company's stock. It took Ladbrokes shares to their highest level in two months. Some of the fizz came out of the rally later but the bookmaker still closed nearly 7% ahead on the day. Gala Coral had planned to list on the stock market before agreeing to the merger with its rival."

Published data for 2015/16 showed a slight improvement on the worst deficit forecast, but it will still be the poorest financial performance in a single year. Of the 240 trusts, 157 or 65% recorded a deficit. Earlier this year, a report containing the first nine months' worth of figures said the NHS was heading for a £2.8bn deficit across the year. :: Hunt Tells Junior Doctors: We Heard You If savings could be made in the final three months of the financial year, it was predicted this could be curbed to around £2.4bn. For the whole of the previous year, the NHS overspend stood at £820m. The high costs of employing agency staff has been blamed for damaging the financial position of NHS trusts. Other cash pressures included further increases in the demand for care and continued issues over bed-blocking. A cap on agency spending has been imposed by the Government, while spending curbs on expensive management consultants also came into force over the summer and were expected to have had an impact by the end of the financial year. However, some trusts have said they are having difficulty covering rota gaps and keeping within the agency spending limit. Despite the measures, some £3.64bn was spent on agency over the year - £1.4bn more than planned. NHS trusts have also come under pressure to change the way they record their deficits in their accounts in a move to balance the books. The Department of Health wants to keep the deficit down to within or near Treasury spending limits. According to the Nuffield Trust, trusts had made ""accountancy adjustments"" to bring the deficits down. The measures included reclassifying capital budgets as revenue, claiming for five quarters (15 months) worth of VAT rebates and reviewing accounting policies. Jim Mackey, chief executive of NHS Improvement, said steps taken to curb spending were ""starting to make real progress"". He added: ""When we consider where we were six months ago, NHS providers have done a great job in reducing the planned deficit."""

She described Denis Hennessy as ""a very nice man, always helpful"". The neighbour, who wanted to be known as Rachel, said she had lived near Hennessy for nearly three years. “Every time we asked him for something, he always helped us. I was just so shocked to hear about this”, she said. Hennessy walked around the Palace gardens for 10 minutes ""Surprised and shocked. I couldn't believe it. That's not the Denis we know."" She said Hennessy had lost his job last year, and had been regularly going to the job centre and the library, as well as getting advice from housing authorities. ""He was scared he might be homeless again,"" she said.""He told me he was homeless before. I told him to go to the housing people to help him so he didn't have to go through that situation again."" She said she had no idea he was a convicted murderer. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Hennessy scaled the wall of Buckingham Palace before ""admiring"" the gardens for 10 minutes. Hennessy, of Wembley, north-west London, cut his right hand as he climbed over the top of the wall, which is between 8ft and 10ft high, and set off the alarm. He then walked around the gardens for around 10 minutes towards the Palace, where the Queen was in residence with the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duke of York, before being arrested by armed police. As he was detained, he asked ""is Ma'am in?"" repeatedly, prosecutor Tom Nicholson told Westminster Magistrates' Court. In an interview he told police he had ""walked through the gardens admiring the view"". Hennessy, 41, pleaded guilty to one count of trespass on a protected site and one count of criminal damage. The court heard he was on licence after being convicted of the murder of a homeless man in 1992. Chief magistrate, senior district judge Howard Riddle, sentenced him to four months for trespassing and two months, to run concurrently, for damaging the wires of the alarm system."

In a report that ran to more than 100 pages, the grand jury found that prison staff did not verify what drugs they were using for lethal injections and were unaware when the wrong drugs were administered. As a result, a grand jury had recommended that in future, the state execute prisoners with nitrogen gas rather than lethal injection. ""I regret to advise the citizens of Oklahoma that the Department of Corrections failed to do its job,"" Attorney General Scott Pruitt said in a statement on the grand jury's findings. ""A number of individuals responsible for carrying out the execution process were careless, cavalier and in some circumstances dismissive of established procedures that were intended to guard against the very mistakes that occurred."" In 2014, Clayton Lockett took three quarters of an hour to die, while the following January, Charles Warner was executed with the wrong drug. A third execution, that of Richard Glossip, was halted at the last moment when officials realised the same wrong drug had been supplied. The report says that Steve Mullins, a senior legal adviser in the office of Governor Mary Fallin, recommended that the execution should go ahead despite the drug mix-up. Anita Tramell, the warden of the prison, and her boss Robert Patton, the director of the Department of Corrections, quit their jobs soon after the grand jury began their investigation. But instead the governor ordered a stay of execution until an inquiry could be carried out. All executions in Oklahoma are currently on hold. The grand jury did not recommended that anyone involved in the errors should be indicted. In the Warner and Glossip executions, potassium acetate was supplied instead of potassium chloride. Many states have had problems getting hold of drugs for the lethal injection cocktail because pharmaceutical companies now refuse to supply them. Last week, Pfizer became the last of the big manufacturers to withdraw its products from the execution business."

He was operated on overnight and is expected to make a full recovery. The 49-year-old former France international has declared himself ""fine"" after regaining consciousness. The surgeon who performed the operation told Sky Sports that Ginola was given seven shocks with a defibrillator due to an irregular heartbeat before being airlifted to hospital in Monaco. He was in Mandelieu, west of Cannes, in southern France, for a celebrity golf tournament when he collapsed. Hello world, never slept better. I'm fine, just need to rest a bit. Thank you so much all of you for your magnificent support. The ex-Newcastle and Tottenham player tweeted that he had ""never slept better"" after the surgery. He thanked fans for their support and said: ""I'm fine, just need to rest a bit."" Professor Gilles Dreyfus, who carried out the operation at Monaco Cardio-Thoracic Centre, said Ginola was in ""a catastrophic state"" when he arrived.  But he said his recovery is ""going well"", and he ""does not show any neurological after-effects"".  The surgeon added that Ginola had been ""very lucky"" with the quick response of emergency services. He is expected to remain in hospital for 10 days and has already seen his family. During a seven-year spell in the Premier League Ginola also played for Aston Villa and Everton before retiring in 2002. He has since become a media pundit, and is due to cover the Euro 2016 tournament in France. In January 2015, Ginola announced his intention to run for the presidency of FIFA but withdrew shortly afterwards, having failed to get the backing of five football associations."

It blamed terror attacks in both Paris last year and Brussels in March for dampening demand - with sales revenues falling 6% to £201m. Eurostar said: ""The impact has been particularly evident in international markets with Eurostar reporting a slowdown in travellers from the US and Asia"". It issued the trading update as speculation continued to mount that terrorism may have played a part in the disappearance of an EgyptAir jet over the Mediterranean. Eurostar said it was looking to Euro 2016, hosted by France, to spark a recovery in its fortunes. It reported ""strong forward bookings"" with a surge of ticket sales over the past few weeks. Chief executive Nicolas Petrovic said: ""We have seen an unprecedented demand from football supporters keen to get to the Euros by train. ""With our city-centre to city-centre services and a brand new state-of-the art fleet of trains, we are ideally placed to carry fans from the UK direct to the heart of the action in France"". Eurostar introduced its new fleet of e320 trains at the end of 2015. The trains, which can reach higher speeds of up to 200mph and carry 900 passengers, also allow the company to expand their operations to other countries with different signalling systems. Eurostar is currently trialling the trains on its proposed London to Amsterdam route, which it says will become a ""highly competitive"" alternative to air services between the UK and the Dutch city.  It expects passenger services to begin in late 2017."

An inquest into the death of Mr Alexander, the sole British victim of November's terror attack in Paris, has ruled that he was ""unlawfully killed"". The 35-year-old was the merchandise manager for Eagles of Death Metal, the US rock band playing at the time of the attack. His former girlfriend Helen Wilson described how she tried to save the ""love of her life"", giving him mouth-to-mouth before he died in her arms. Ms Wilson said that she and Mr Alexander had tried to ""play dead"" before a gunman approached them and opened fire. She described how she attempted to protect him by wrapping herself around his body, before feeling a burning sensation in her legs and seeing blood. She said: ""Nick said he had been shot. He couldn't move and was in pain. ""I twisted my body around and gave him mouth-to-mouth. I was telling him not to leave me and I love him."" Ms Wilson, in a statement read to Essex Coroner's Court in Chelmsford, said that Mr Alexander told her he was dying, and passed away as she attempted to revive him. Senior coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray, concluded that he had been unlawfully killed.  Speaking after the inquest, Mr Alexander's sister Zoe described him as a ""strong, gentle, generous and funny man who lived his life to the full"". ""We were blessed to have him in our lives and we miss him beyond measure,"" she said. Ms Beasley-Murray told the family: ""You have not only suffered the tragic loss of Nick but you have also suffered the ordeal of these inquest proceedings, and throughout you have displayed the upmost dignity."""

I know he works in both Egypt and another country in Africa.  ""I guess it was work related. He's been doing this for years in the gold mining industry. This was a regular trip.

Film directors, actors, comedians and artists - and even the Poet Laureate - are named in a letter to The Guardian backing the Remain campaign. The movie directors named include Danny Boyle, Mike Leigh and Richard Curtis, along with writers including spy author John le Carre. Film actors include Benedict Cumberbatch, Bill Nighy, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, Helena Bonham Carter, Jude Law, Juliet Stevenson and Keira Knightley. Three knights of the screen - Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir John Hurt and Sir Patrick Stewart - are named, along with comedians Eddie Izzard, Jo Brand and Steve Coogan, and the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy. Botham, Caine and Campbell back Brexit The artists declare: ""From the smallest gallery to the biggest blockbuster, many of us have worked on projects that would never have happened without vital EU funding or by collaborating across borders. ""Britain is not just stronger in Europe, it is more imaginative and more creative, and our global creative success would be severely weakened by walking away. :: Senior US Diplomat Enters EU Referendum Row ""Leaving Europe would be a leap into the unknown for millions of people across the UK who work in the creative industries, and for the millions more at home and abroad who benefit from the growth and vibrancy of Britain's cultural sector. ""From the Bard to Bowie, British creativity inspires and influences the rest of the world. We believe that being part of the EU bolsters Britain's leading role on the world stage. ""Let's not become an outsider shouting from the wings."" Labour peer and Remain campaigner Baroness Jowell told Sky News: ""The point is, how do we create a creative sector in the 21st century that can compete with the rest of the world? ""We do that by staying as part of the European Union, renegotiating aspects of our membership, but do not withdraw our artists and our creative talent from a single market of 560 million and the funding that comes with it."" The pro-EU letter, which risks being dismissed by Leave campaigners as 'Luvvies for Brussels' and a stitch-up by 10 Downing Street, follows a number of celebrity endorsements for Brexit. England cricket legend Sir Ian Botham hit Brussels for six last month by branding the European Union a ""racket"" and urging Britons to ""reclaim our basic sovereignty"". Veteran movie star Sir Michael Caine was praised by UKIP leader Nigel Farage earlier this year when he hit out at Brussels' ""faceless civil servants"". :: Shadow Minister Calls Voter 'Horrible Racist' Duncan Bannatyne, of TV's Dragons Den and I'm A Celebrity, has used his Twitter account to urge Brexit arguing the UK would be ""better off out of it"". Former footballer Sol Campbell, who played for England, Spurs and Arsenal, has said he backs Brexit because freedom of movement rules mean young British players are ""crowded out"". He said: ""If we want to see more English stars like Harry Kane rise through the ranks we should take back control - and Vote Leave."" And Downtown Abbey creator and Tory peer Julian Fellowes has called for Britain to cut ties with the ""anti-democratic"" EU. It comes as the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau became the latest international voice to warn against Britain leaving the EU, arguing there would be ""nothing easy or automatic"" in negotiating trade deals once outside the bloc. Many Leave campaigners hold up Canada's agreement with the EU as a model for how the UK could trade if it left the bloc. But Mr Trudeau noted this was still to enter force after negotiations lasting more than 10 years. The latest opinion poll has given the Remain vote an 11-point lead over the Leave camp. The ComRes survey for ITV News and the Daily Mail found 52% said they would vote to stay in with 41% backing Brexit and 7% saying they did not know."

Three other women were stabbed during the attack in the car park of a branch of Sainsbury's in Hampton. A man in his 60s was arrested at the scene on suspicion of attempted murder, the Metropolitan Police said. Police and paramedics were called to the store on The Avenue at 10.35am and when officers arrived they found three women with knife wounds, which were not serious. A police forensic investigation is ongoing in the car park A fourth woman found at a property nearby was taken to hospital by air ambulance with life-threatening injuries, a police spokesman said.  Police said a Taser was deployed during the suspect's arrest but it was not discharged. A woman working at a nearby pub said the attack appeared to be unprovoked. ""He only went for the women,"" she said. ""The man ran through and started attacking them. It didn't seem like they knew him; it was completely unprovoked. A witness said one of the victims made it to the police station ""If it had been 10 or 20 minutes earlier there would have been children there because it's right outside a primary school. ""He was caught very quickly just outside the car park. He appeared to be out of it, on drugs or crazy.  ""The woman who was badly stabbed in the back made it up to the police station and raised the alarm. ""She is well-known locally and always goes shopping there all the time."" A member of staff at Tangley Park Children's Centre, which backs onto the scene, said: ""We kept all the children safe and kept them in the building until we knew it was safe. Police arrested the suspect 'very quickly' according to a witness ""It's just such a shock - our parents and children could have been walking to their cars at that time. Sky's Charlotte Lomas, reporting from the scene, said: ""I spoke to a man here who was in the car park at the time of the attack. ""He was putting money in a machine when a young gentleman alerted him to the fact there was a man here with a knife. ""He ran from the scene and was approached by the man he said tried to stab him, but he ran away, got his wife and got out of  the car park as soon as he could."""

Officers found 14 headstones knocked over and smashed at the Blackley Jewish Cemetery on Rochdale Road in Charlestown on Wednesday afternoon. They are now appealing for witnesses or for anyone who has any information to get in contact. Chief Superintendent Wasim Chaudhry from GMP's North Manchester Division said: ""This is a sickening act of criminal damage which we are taking very seriously. ""I believe this was a deliberate and targeted attack and there is no place for such abhorrent behaviour in our communities. ""All decent members of the public recognise that a cemetery is supposed to be a resting place for people who have passed away; a place of sanctity and dignity where families can come and pay their respects. ""So to have those graves desecrated in such a disgusting and disrespectful way will no doubt cause immeasurable anguish to the families and loved ones affected. ""I cannot begin to get into the mind of someone who would commit such an atrocity. ""I know this will cause a lot of anxiety and distress in the local community and we as police officers and my colleagues at Manchester City Council share that distress. ""We will do everything we can to find out who is responsible and bring the full force of the law down on them. ""This has been recorded as a hate crime because of the clear racial motivation and, should we find those who committed this cowardly act, which will allow the courts to impose even harsher punishments."" Chief Supt Chaudhry said extra patrols were being put into the area to act as a deterrent and reassure the community. The same cemetery was previously targeted by vandals in 2014, when more than 40 gravestones were vandalised and sprayed with offensive graffiti. :: Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 3521, 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111"

Her Majesty's gilded procession towards Parliament, and her inability to step foot in the House of Commons are annual fixtures of British democracy. But there was no ceasefire. Instead leading Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, chose to use the Sovereign's moment to go on Sky News to argue for reclaiming sovereignty he argues has been lost to the EU. :: PM Accused Of Watering Down Queen's Speech He focused on what he said was a missing Sovereignty Bill. Certainly some version of a plan to reassert the primacy of UK courts over the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice had been mooted ahead of the final EU renegotiation in February. Few had expected anything in the Queen's Speech. The separate reference to the British Bill of Rights was a repeat of what had been announced last year - proposals, not legislation, to change the current relationship with the separate European Court of Human Rights based in Strasbourg. More than that, IDS claimed that there had been a ""helter skelter"" approach to government in recent months with the Government watering down and jettisoning controversial legislation ahead of the referendum. It is difficult to escape this conclusion. Certainly there were no coincidences that last month's Trade Union Bill compromise emerged just hours before the PM announced a joint referendum initiative with an ex TUC boss, and the unions filled the coffers of the Labour IN campaign by £2m. The rollback on Short Money can be added to the EU ceasefire with Labour too. :: Queen's Speech 2016: The Key Points But the difficulties in pursuing a bold agenda run way beyond European divides. Her Majesty's address did not even mention the word ""academy"" - for the first time in three years. In March compulsory academisation was the fundamental reform announced on the morning of the Budget. The U-turn on that, slipped out on local elections day, arose mainly because of jitters from Conservative MPs. This was also the case with the Dubs amendment on child refugees, and the U-turns on tax credits and disability benefits. The PM does not have a majority large enough to pursue all of the bold measures he would like. :: When's A Policy Not A Policy? Govt U-Turns There was certainly the outline of an interesting agenda announced today. From spaceports, to driverless cars, planning reform, adoption changes, buses, broadband and business rate devolution. ""Lifetime ISA"" sounds almost as surprising from the lips of the Queen this year as ""Northern Powerhouse"" did last year. The PM wants this to be remembered as a ""One Nation"" Queen's Speech - with prison reform, education reform, counter extremism and opportunity for all. It is a narrative of unity the Prime Minister wants as his legacy for the nation. It is the reality of disunity in his own party, however, that has given rise to an unambitious Queen's Speech, designed, primarily to avoid annoying as many voters as possible."

It comes after the world's four largest tobacco firms lost a legal challenge against the Government's new plain packaging rules at the High Court on Thursday. Pictures showing the harmful effects of smoking must now cover 65% of the front and back of every packet of cigarettes, with extra warnings on the top of the pack. Packs containing 10 cigarettes will be prohibited under the ruling because the boxes are viewed too small to contain suitable health warnings. Packaging of hand-rolled tobacco must also be in the same green colour and contain a minimum of 30g of tobacco. The changes include a ban on menthol cigarettes from 2020 and promotional statements such as ""this product is free of additives"" or ""is less harmful than other brands"". Companies have a year to sell old stock and fully implement the changes under the directive. Smoking causes an estimated 700,000 premature deaths each year and it is hoped the new rules will reduce the number of smokers across the EU by 2.4 million. British Lung Foundation chief executive Dr Penny Woods welcomed the measures. ""For too long glitzy, cleverly designed packaging has lured young people into smoking, a habit that takes the lives of half of all long-term smokers,"" she said. ""Australia introduced plain packaging in 2012 and has already seen a decline in smoking rates. ""If just a fraction of the 200,000 children in the UK who start smoking a year are discouraged, thousands of lives will be saved."" But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said the new packaging rules ""treat adults like children and teenagers like idiots"". ""Everyone knows the health risks of smoking and no one starts because of the packaging,"" he said. ""Australia was the first country to introduce standardised packaging and it hasn't worked. ""There is no evidence to suggest that smoking rates have fallen among children or adults as a result of the policy. ""Plain packaging is a declaration of war on consumers because the aim is to de-normalise not just the product but also the millions of adults who enjoy smoking and don't want to quit."""

The tough-talking by the commission president is set to inflame the already rancorous referendum campaign being waged in the UK. :: Celebrities Come Out In Force For Remain Vote In an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, Mr Juncker said: ""Deserters won’t be welcomed back with open arms. ""If the British say 'no' and I hope they don't, (European) community life won’t go on like before. ""The UK will have to accept it’ll be considered a third party and one we won’t suck up to."" He added: ""If the British leave Europe – both us and them – will have to bear the consequences. ""This isn’t a threat, but our relationship won’t be as it is today."" He also said reforms secured earlier this year by David Cameron in a renegotiation of Britain's membership of the EU would be implemented if the UK decided to stay in. However, he warned introducing the package ""will not be easy"". Responding to his comments, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Juncker was ""threatening"" the UK but dismissed his views as ""out of date"". He said: ""I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat. It sounds to me like Mr Juncker is playing that game. ""What else do you expect? His whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels. ""I don't dislike him personally, but politically I think he is somewhat out of date."" Vote Leave chair and Labour MP Gisela Stuart said: ""Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low. ""The referendum offers a once in a lifetime opportunity for the British people to have a say over our future relationship with the European Union. ""They want facts, and reasoned arguments, to inform their decision - and this kind of intimidation is unwelcome and unwarranted."""

Excalibur was expected to submit papers supporting the offer from metal tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House. The two parties are not formally linking their bids, but the Tata management team, headed by chief executive Stuart Wilkie, will work with Liberty House, should it be successful. Liberty has told Sky News before Mr Gupta wanted to turn Port Talbot into a plant that would create recycled steel via electric arc furnaces rather than manufacturing slab steel from raw materials in blast furnaces. Excalibur Steel UK Ltd was previously considering a revised version of a previously rejected turnaround plan to buy the business, and would involve about 1,000 new job cuts. Tata Steel UK -  which includes the blast furnace-powered plant in Port Talbot, as well as sites at Newport and Rotherham - was put up for sale earlier this year after losses grew to £1m a day.  That left 11,000 jobs hanging in the balance - 4,000 of them at the Port Talbot works in South Wales. Tata announced earlier this month that seven bidders had submitted letters of intent, signalling their willingness to bid for parts of the business, but industry sources expect fewer companies to actually put forward an offer today. Aside from Excalibur and Liberty House, the other names reported to be interested are: private equity group Greybull Capital, which recently completed its purchase of Tata's Scunthorpe steel plant; Chinese producer Hebei Iron and Steel; Leeds-based private equity fund Endless; JSW, India's second largest steel producer; and NUCOR, the largest steel-maker in the US. It is understood the bids will be presented to Tata's board of directors in Mumbai on Wednesday."

Now a 198-page appeal has been filed saying that DNA evidence used in the case was flawed and inadmissible. Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were found on a beach on Koh Tao Lawyers say it was not collected, tested, analysed or reported in accordance with internationally accepted standards. The documents add that their questioning and charging was not done with a lawyer present. They said confessions which were later retracted were obtained using torture or abuse. Police in Thailand have denied mishandling evidence, and say the confessions were not extracted under duress. Previously, they have been widely criticised for their handling of the case and the evidence, with some believing the two workers were scapegoats. The mothers of the two convicted killers visited them on death row on Monday, before accompanying the lawyers to court. The defence's head lawyer Nakhon Chompuchat said: ""We have submitted this to the appeal court so they can understand more, so they can see the importance on how death sentence decision needs to be perfectly clear. ""We don't have new evidence, we are basing this on evidence that was presented earlier."" The court is likely to rule on the appeal next year."
2016-05-23,"For years we have been told that we should cut down on the amount of fat we eat, inspiring many people to adopt low-fat diets.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700522/new-advice-on-nations-diet-sparks-health-row,"For years we have been told that we should cut down on the amount of fat we eat, inspiring many people to adopt low-fat diets. Now it seems the story is changing, with a report saying that such eating patterns are having ""disastrous health consequences"". The National Obesity Forum and the Public Health Collaboration have called for a ""major overhaul"" of dietary guidelines, accusing major public health bodies of colluding with the food industry. Their report pushes for a return to ""whole foods"" such as dairy, fish and meat, as well as high fat healthy foods such as avocados, saying that ""eating fat does not make you fat"". Saturated fats do not cause heart disease and full fat dairy foods - including milk, yoghurt and cheese, can actually protect the heart, the authors add. They blame the focus on low-fat diets and snacking between meals for Britain's growing obesity crisis, saying that processed foods labelled ""low fat"", ""lite"" or ""low cholesterol"" should be avoided. People should also stay away from sugar, stop counting calories and those with type two diabetes should eat a fat-rich diet instead of one dominated by carbohydrates. The authors of the report say that food science has been ""corrupted by commercial influences"" in a way that represents a ""significant threat to public health"". They said the recent Eatwell Guide from Public Health England, for example, was produced with a large number of people from the food and drink industry. Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ""As a clinician, treating patients all day every day, I quickly realised that guidelines from on high, suggesting high carbohydrate, low fat diets were the universal panacea, were deeply flawed. ""Current efforts have failed - the proof being that obesity levels are higher than they have ever been, and show no chance of reducing despite the best efforts of Government and scientists."" Dr Aseem Malhotra, consultant cardiologist and founding member of the Public Health Collaboration, a group of medics, said dietary guidelines promoting low fat foods ""is perhaps the biggest mistake in modern medical history resulting in devastating consequences for public health. ""The current Eatwell guide from Public Health England is in my view more like a metabolic timebomb than a dietary pattern conducive for good health.  ""Eat fat to get slim, don't fear fat, fat is your friend. It's now truly time to bring back the fat."" Professor Iain Broom, from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, agreed: ""Our populations for almost 40 years, have been subjected to an uncontrolled global experiment that has gone drastically wrong."" But the report has drawn strong condemnation from other food experts and medical professionals. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England , said: ""In the face of all the evidence, calling for people to eat more fat, cut out carbs and ignore calories is irresponsible. ""Unlike this opinion piece, our independent experts review all the available evidence - often thousands of scientific papers - run full-scale consultations and go to great lengths to ensure no bias."" Professor John Wass, the Royal College of Physicians' special adviser on obesity, said there was ""good evidence"" that saturated fat increases cholesterol. He said: ""What is needed is a balanced diet, regular physical activity and a normal healthy weight. To quote selective studies risks misleading the public."" Professor Simon Capewell, from the Faculty of Public Health, said the report was not peer reviewed and there was no indication of how it had been funded, something he said was ""worrying"". Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said the report did not have the ""robust and comprehensive review of evidence"" required to be taken seriously by the charity."
2016-05-23,A French gardener is going on trial accused of murdering his British former boss and lover.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700711/frenchman-on-trial-over-british-lovers-murder,"A French gardener is going on trial accused of murdering his British former boss and lover. Patricia Wilson, originally from Welwyn Garden City, went missing four years ago and her remains have never been found. The 58-year-old was dropped off at her home in the village of Vabre-Tizac, near Toulouse, on 17 August 2012. Police believe Jean-Louis Cayrou, 55, killed her after she decided to end a brief relationship with him, and that he then disposed of the body. Neighbours alerted police five days after she was last seen, and officers found large amounts of her blood around her property, and in Cayrou's car. The power at the house was cut but there was no sign of a break-in or robbery. Wilson was a former advertising executive who moved to the area with her partner Donald Marcus in 2008. Patricia Wilson's home in the village of Vabre-Tizac, near Toulouse He returned to Britain in 2011 for health reasons and the couple separated. In September 2014 a court heard that an item of the victim's underwear was found in Cayrou's car in the glove box. Frequent trips by the gardener to the neighbouring Tarn region in the following days raised suspicions, along with alleged changes to Cayrou's story during questioning. But his lawyer Jacques Levy said that ""like all innocent people"" he had defended himself badly. He asked: ""There is no other suspect, but have they looked for one?"" The prosecution also says that Ms Wilson had been bombarded with phone calls from Cayrou before her disappearance. Friends reportedly said that Cayrou had been acting violently towards her. Cayrou, who faces life in prison if convicted, denies murder.  His trial, in Rodez, northeast of Toulouse, is expected to last until Friday."

The country's foreign office said in a statement that one of the victims of the attack was a driver named Muhammad Azam, while the identity of the second ""is being verified"". However, a senior commander from the militant group has confirmed Mansour was killed in the strike. Pakistan's Foreign Office said in a statement ""On late Saturday 21st May, 2016, the United States shared information that a drone strike was carried out in Pakistan near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area,"" in which Mansour was targeted. Emergency services in attendance at the scene of the strike ""This information was shared with the Prime Minister and the Chief of Army Staff after the drone strike."" The ministry denounced the attack as a ""violation of (Pakistan's) sovereignty, an issue which has been raised with the United States in the past as well"". It said that a four country group comprising of the United States, China, Afghanistan and Pakistan last met on Wednesday to discuss ways to restart stalled peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban. And that the group had decided ""a politically negotiated settlement was the only viable option for lasting peace in Afghanistan"". When news of the drone strike broke on Saturday, a US official said multiple drones had targeted the men as they rode in a vehicle in a remote area of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan, southwest of the town of Ahmad Wal. A State Department official said both Pakistan and Afghanistan were told about the strike, but did not disclose whether they were notified prior to it being carried out. Gallery: Profile Of Taliban Leader Mullah Mohammed Omar Mullah Mohammed Omar rose to prominence as a Mujahideen commander fighting the Russian occupation around his hometown Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement that Mansour ""has been the leader of the Taliban and actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners"". A spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Sunday: ""The raid was done in agreement with Afghan authorities. It seems to be successful. We are assessing for confirmation."" ""Our hope and understanding is that in the wake of these new developments an Afghan-led peace process would result in bringing lasting peace and stability,"" he said. Mansour was appointed leader of the Taliban in July 2015 following the revelation that the group's founder, Mullah Omar, had been dead for two years."
2016-05-23,"The important thing to remember about ""Project Fear"" - the name sometimes given to the Government's effort to scare (they would say enlighten) people about the consequences of Britain leaving the EU - is that it's not primarily designed to change your mind.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700769/so-whats-fishy-about-treasury-brexit-report,"The important thing to remember about ""Project Fear"" - the name sometimes given to the Government's effort to scare (they would say enlighten) people about the consequences of Britain leaving the EU - is that it's not primarily designed to change your mind. For months, the big worry for the Remain camp has been that many people who, on balance, would probably vote to stay in the EU, simply won't turn up to vote on 23 June. Generally speaking, people are far keener to go out and vote when they believe they are voting for change, rather than just maintaining the status quo. :: Osborne: Brexit Could Kill 820,000 Jobs So while the Leave camp could always count on decent turnout, a low proportion of voters could easily result in a Leave vote. And that's where Project Fear comes along. It is designed to get those who would otherwise stay at home to get out and vote. And when it comes to Project Fear, Monday's Treasury report on the short-term impact of Brexit was always going to be the key document. After all, it's one thing to say (as the previous Treasury long-term analysis did) that you might be a bit worse off by 2030; it's another to say your earnings will fall, your house price will tumble and you may even lose your job in the next two years. No surprise, then, that those are the main headlines surrounding the Treasury's short-term impact analysis today. Like the long-term analysis of last month, this is a tough, weighty tome chock full of equations (for those who care about such things, this time around it's vector regression as opposed to gravity modelling). It is, technically speaking, not a forecast but a scenario analysis, comparing the economy with how it would have been otherwise, all else equal. And that means one has to be a little bit careful with some of the numbers. When the Treasury says growth will be ""hit"" by 3.6% over two years, that means a relative fall compared with how things would otherwise have been. In practice, this means a very mild recession, with the economy contracting by 0.1% for four quarters in a row, compared to the current official forecast for 0.5% growth in the first two quarters and then 0.6% growth in the third. When the Treasury says house prices might be ""hit"" by 10% over two years, this has to be compared with an OBR forecast for house price growth of 10% over that period. In other words, house prices would simply be flat. Similar thing for earnings: that ""hit"" cited in the document would really just mean earnings would be flat. In other words, delve into the small print of the Treasury document and it's actually far less terrifying than you might have thought. Even the ""severe shock scenario"" which the Treasury has also maps out involves a far smaller recession than the 2008/9 slump, with the contraction about similar to the one in the early 1990s and the house price crash smaller than most crashes in UK economic history. :: Do You Have An EU Question For PM? Ask Here It is almost, dare one say, as if the Treasury is presenting the numbers in a way that makes leaving the EU sound even scarier than it would actually be. Which brings me to a few fishy things about its paper. The first is that the document doesn't take any account of the fact that the Bank of England would almost certainly cut interest rates in the event of a recession. That the Government would probably do something to absorb the blow, cutting taxes or temporarily raising spending. These emergency actions would doubtless make the likely recession far shallower than these scenarios imply. Second, and perhaps more suspiciously, the Treasury has simply chosen to ignore what many see as the most likely outcome: that Britain leaves the EU and remains in the European Economic Area (the EEA, or single market), a little like Norway. This is odd given that in its long-term impact analysis last month it mapped out the consequences of three paths: the EEA option, the bilateral agreement option (a bit like Canada) and simply following World Trade Organisation rules. This time around, the ""shock"" and ""severe shock"" scenarios correlate directly with the Canada and WTO paths, but that EEA option is ignored. According to Treasury insiders, this is because many in the Leave camp have implied that in the event of departure they would also leave the single market. :: Treasury Report In Full  For a great economic institution like the Treasury, this is oddly inconsistent, and leaves one wondering whether the short-term impact of leaving the EU and becoming a bit like Norway might actually have been very small indeed. We shall never know. Still, the Treasury has at least steered clear of the more apocalyptic scenarios that some have mentioned if the UK were to leave the EU. Some have speculated that there could be a so-called ""sudden stop"", where foreign investors stop buying UK government debt, as they did in the recent Greek crisis. The Treasury stopped short of including this in its main scenarios. The upshot is that, when you dig into this document, it is far less scary than it looks on the surface. Whether that will make any difference to Project Fear is another matter."

The deal would eclipse the £80m contract handed to Robbie Williams by EMI in 2002 and would also be the most valuable contract ever handed to a female artist, surpassing the £70m record deal Whitney Houston signed with Arista in 2001. Representatives for the singer declined to comment when approached by Sky News. But a Sony Music source told The Sun: ""We've secured Adele, who's without doubt the biggest music star in a generation. This is massive. ""Adele's deal with her original label XL expired and we'd an existing relationship with her in America. ""The deal is being worked on by our Columbia label in the US, but is worth £90m and gives Sony the rights to release her future music exclusively around the world."" The Someone Like You singer is already worth £85m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and the deal with Sony could double her fortune. The contract negotiation was reportedly handled by her manager Jonathan Dickins, who the source said had been working on the deal for a couple of years. Sony also hold the record for giving the biggest recording contract in history, signing a £164m deal ($250m) with Michael Jackson's estate nine months after the singer's death in 2009. Adele's domination of the music world was reaffirmed at the weekend when she was named Top Artist and picked up four other prizes at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday."
2016-05-23,"One of the world's largest insurance companies, Axa, has announced it will stop investing in the tobacco industry.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700837/axa-quits-investing-in-tobacco-companies,"One of the world's largest insurance companies, Axa, has announced it will stop investing in the tobacco industry. The international firm pledge to sell investments worth more than €1.8bn (£1.4bn). It said holding stocks and corporate bonds from tobacco companies conflicts with its position as a health insurer. The insurance giant, which has more than 10 million customers in the UK, says it wants to work with governments around the world to reduce the number of smokers. It said its role was increasingly about prevention, rather than curing smoking-related diseases, given smoking kills some six million people a year, and the figure is expected to rise to eight million by 2030. ""Smoking poses the biggest threat to public health in the world today,"" AXA said. ""Its cost, estimated at €2.1tr per year, equals the combined expenses of war and terrorism."" Axa will sell off its shareholdings in tobacco companies, €200m (£155m), immediately. Axa has €1.4tn of assets under management, so these tobacco-related investments account for just 0.1%. Thomas Buberl, the deputy chief executive of Axa, and head of its health business, said: ""It makes no sense for us to continue our investments within the tobacco industry. ""This decision has a cost for us, but the case for divestment is clear: the human cost of tobacco is tragic; its economic cost is huge. ""As a major investor and a leading health insurer, the AXA Group wants to be part of the solution, and our hope is that others in our industry will do the same.” Last year Axa announced it was divesting all its coal investments, worth £355m, ahead of the UN talks on limiting climate change. It also pledged to triple its investments in green technology."
2016-05-23,"The FA Cup final at Wembley is the grandest stage English football has to offer, but for Louis Van Gaal it was the setting for a farewell.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700309/mourinho-to-test-if-one-man-is-bigger-than-man-u,"The FA Cup final at Wembley is the grandest stage English football has to offer, but for Louis Van Gaal it was the setting for a farewell. Winning the venerable pot was never going to be enough to keep him in his job. It might be the oldest cup competition in the world but it's no longer enough for Manchester United. A record-squalling 12th success was cause for celebrations, but for the fans and more significantly the owners, this was a consolation prize. Van Gaal may have delivered the first trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson left such a void in the Old Trafford dugout but it could not conceal the failings elsewhere in a season of frustration. In his second full season, Van Gaal's United have regressed, finishing fifth and outside the Champions League places regained in his first year. In Europe they were hapless, hustled out of the Champions League and then the Europa League. Leicester's triumph simply added embarrassment to a club and manager who had lavished £250m on underachievement (though United were not alone in being exposed). Nor has there been sufficient style to make up for the lack of substance. Old Trafford has hummed with discontent all season at the cautious style as well as the results. Van Gaal will argue - he's always willing to argue - that he has delivered progress, not least in the emergence of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Cup-winning goal scorer Jesse Lingard. Youth, as the club regularly reminds its shareholders, is in United's DNA. Nevertheless the owners, the Glazer family, have decided to twist rather than stick. Sacking a manager for the second time in three seasons may go against the grain at a club that had the same one for a generation. The Glazers and their senior executive Ed Woodward can argue with substance that Van Gaal was given every chance. He has not been undermined from within, on or off-the-record, and they were desperate for him to succeed and see a succession plan that ended with Ryan Giggs reaching fruition. But ultimately they did not trust that he could meet their targets in the final year of his contract. They are not willing to take the risk of a second successive season outside the Champions League. (That matters for more than simple pride, carrying a financial penalty of around £20m from kit supplier Adidas.) So the club that once appointed managers for life is turning to its fourth in three years, and one who may make the upheaval of recent season seem tranquil by comparison For some senior figures inside United, Jose Mourinho is not the answer they were hoping to come up with. They distrust his combustible nature and are not convinced that he shares the club's creed of youth development. What he does care about is winning, and he is as close to guaranteeing improvement as there is, assuming last season's Chelsea meltdown was an aberration. His ego and pragmatic football may not fit United's romantic self-image, but three seasons of frustration and the demands of the bottom line, have left Old Trafford ready to compromise. Mourinho is also a decent riposte to Manchester City's appointment of Pep Guardiola, his old nemesis from their days at the helm of Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively, but it has been forced by failure. At Old Trafford they say no one man is bigger than the club. Mourinho is about to test that theory."

Mayu Tomita, 20, was repeatedly knifed in the neck and chest as she waited to appear at a small concert venue in Koganei, Tokyo, according to local reports. Tokyo police said a 27-year-old man, Tomohiro Iwazaki, was arrested at the scene by officers, who seized a blood-covered knife. Sources quoted Iwazaki as saying he had stabbed the singer because she had returned a present he had sent her. Tomita was attacked as she waited near a small concert venue. Pic:NHK Prior to the attack on Saturday, she had reportedly complained to police that the suspect had been stalking her online. Female Japanese pop stars often cultivate a girl-next-door image and appear at fan events as well as performing at smaller venues. In 2014, two teenage members of Japanese girl group AKB48 were attacked by a man wielding a saw at one of the band's regular fan events."

""It's just easy"", he tells me. An easy escape. ""It's like weed in a way but you can feel your heart, you can feel your bod,"" he adds. ""Some people can be aggressive, some people you'll try and talk to and it's like talking to a ghost, like they're dead."" Spice is a synthetic marijuana known to cause paranoia and hallucinations when taken. Callum, who is homeless, says he smokes because it's 'easy' For several years it has been available in shops across the UK, a so-called legal high. This week, along with a number of other drugs, it becomes illegal. But experts have told Sky News that, despite the ban, the supply gap can be filled and that sales will simply move underground. They warn that the new law may lead to more vulnerable people being exploited - by putting them in the hands of dealers. You don't need a chemistry degree to make spice, says Dr Oliver Sutcliffe from Manchester Metropolitan University. As a lecturer in psychopharmaceutical chemistry he has studied synthetic cannabinoids in detail. ""The chemistry or the actual process is incredibly simple,"" he said, adding that it would be ""naive"" to not think somebody is prepping for the ban and will fill the gap it leaves. A senior police officer has also warned that sales may simply move to illicit parts of the internet. Commander Simon Bray, the National Police Chiefs Council's lead on New Psychoactive Substances, says dealers may do their work on the ""dark web"". Many of those who are already addicted are sleeping rough. They're unlikely to get spice off the internet, but Sky News has been told they will still be able to get it and that there will be new risks involved. LifeShare works with around 300 men and women from Manchester's homeless community. Support worker Julie Boyle describes spice as an ""epidemic"" and says as many as 80% of her clients smoke the drug. ""I've had clients being raped, clients doing really risky sexual behaviour to access it,"" she says. ""They're already at risk of exploitation - add in an addictive mixture - it's absolutely going to make things worse."" Spice and other ""legal highs"" are being outlawed because of concerns their use can be linked to deaths and are fuelling anti-social behaviour. The Psychoactive Substances Act will introduce a ban on the production, distribution, sale and supply of legal highs that are intended for human consumption. Psychoactive substances are defined as anything ""capable of producing a psychoactive effect"". The ban excludes ""legitimate substances"" such as food, alcohol, nicotine and caffeine. Critics have called the ban unscientific and unenforceable. But Commander Bray says some users of legal highs take them simply because they are legal. The ban may well change this. Police will be able to shut down shops that sell highs such as spice, and will have new powers to seize and destroy psychoactive substances. Offenders face sentences of up to seven years."

Kenny Steck said he faced the bear as it ran towards him - and he heard ""the sound of it breathing, snarling"". The animal sank its claws into his leg and crushed his shoulder blade as he tried to defend himself - before biting at his head. He was left with multiple injuries and needed 30 stitches to his head.  Mr Steck described the attack from his home in Alaska after the ill-fated camping trip at Calahonda Creek in the south east of the state. The attack left Mr Steck with 30 stitches to his head He told how he had been camping with his wife Hannah, and others, on a gravel bar on a ""beautiful day"" when the animal attacked.  He was confronted by the bear after going to get some water just 200 yards away from the base. The family's firearms were back at camp and he did not have bear spray with him. Mr Steck said: ""I remember thinking, this thing is gonna kill me. ""I was facing the bear the whole time. As it was running, I just remember the sounds, really vividly. ""I remember hearing the sound of it breathing, snarling. ""I had lifted up my leg so the bear had clawed a three to four inch section here."" Back at camp, his wife and the others could hear the attack and came running. Hannah said: ""One of its fangs had gone right into his head. ""Running, we were just running to his voice yelling at him and we heard this crashing through the woods and the bear had let Kenny go."" Four of those on the camping trip, including Hannah Steck, were nurses. They started first aid immediately and got him to a boat, where they called the Coast Guard for help. Mr Steck spent four days in the hospital before being released - though he faces months of recovery, walking with crutches.  But Mr Steck said it could have been much worse. ""I feel completely like God had his hand of protection over me during that day. ""I'm going to be able to walk just fine in a couple of months. I'm already using a crutch. I'm going to be able to do things I never thought I would do again."""
2016-05-23,An airline price war is looming this summer after Ryanair said it was to cut fares by 7%.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700846/airline-price-war-looms-as-ryanair-cuts-fares,"An airline price war is looming this summer after Ryanair said it was to cut fares by 7%. The no-frills carrier announced the move following a similar step by its biggest rival, easyJet, as demand for flights continues to be dampened by the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. Ryanair pledged it would win any price war while unveiling its annual results, which showed record profit after tax of £959m. Ryanair said that while passenger numbers rose 18% in the year to March to 106.4 million, it had cancelled more than 500 flights during its final quarter as a result of overseas terrorism and French air traffic control strikes. Average fares fell by an average 1% over the year - helped by falling fuel costs though Ryanair responded to weaker demand by cutting flight costs most aggressively in the second half of the year. The airline said it expected its fuel bill would fall by £154m in the current financial year and that would help it trim fares. Robin Byde, a transport analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ""Ryanair is a major player in many of the markets and airports it flies to. If it cuts prices, other airlines will have to respond to that."" Earlier this month, easyJet said it would look at price cuts so it was ""able to offer its customers even better value fares this summer"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: ""If other airlines want to compete with us on price, then we will lower our prices again. ""If there is a fare war in Europe, then Ryanair will be the winner"". It opens the prospect of a period of falling prices for customers - with flight operators joining holiday firms in shifting summer sun capacity from countries such as Turkey towards Spain and Portugal instead.

2016-05-23,"A submarine that can operate at a depth of 3,000m (10,000 ft) is being deployed in the hunt for the black boxes of a downed EgyptAir flight.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700372/submarine-joins-hunt-for-egyptair-black-boxes,"A submarine that can operate at a depth of 3,000m (10,000 ft) is being deployed in the hunt for the black boxes of a downed EgyptAir flight. The vessel, which has been enlisted from Egypt's oil ministry, has been sent to search the seabed of the Mediterranean, Egypt's President said. Flight MS804 came down at 2.45am local time on Thursday, south of the Greek island of Karpathos and north of the Egyptian coast. It was carrying 66 passengers and crew from Paris to Cairo at the time and is suspected to have crashed into a part of the sea that is several thousand metres deep. The plane's black boxes are yet to be found but emit a signal for four to five weeks after a crash in water. Despite his officials previously saying terrorism was the most likely cause, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi said: ""All the theories are possible. ""There is no particular theory we can affirm right now."" Ships scouring the sea have already found body parts, personal belongings and wreckage from the Airbus 320. The US Navy's Sixth Fleet said one of its patrol aircraft had seen more than 100 pieces of debris identified as having come from an aircraft. They said the data was passed to the Egyptian Navy. EgyptAir Holding Company chairman Safwat Moslem said the priority was finding the passengers' remains and the flight recorders. ""The families want the bodies. That is what concerns us. The army is working on this. This is what we are focusing on,"" he said. It came as the first funerals of the victims took place. Gallery: Pictures Of EgyptAir Jet Wreckage Pictures from Facebook/Egyptian Army Spokesperson Hundreds of family and friends of air stewardess Yara Hani Tawfik gathered at St Mary and St Athanasius Church in Cairo on Sunday morning. Others attended a Coptic cathedral in Cairo to mourn two other victims, Medhat Tanious and Wagih Moris. On Saturday, data showing trouble in the cockpit and smoke in a plane lavatory emerged. It provided a window into the doomed jet's last three minutes before contact was lost, with multiple alarms going off, one after another. Experts said the short time it took to descend 38,000ft into the sea indicated that a sudden, catastrophic event brought it down. Aviation security expert Philip Baum said: ""If they lost the aircraft within three minutes that's very, very quick. They were dealing with an extremely serious incident."" Several other nations, including the UK, are involved in the search of the Mediterranean. The first available audio to have been released indicates there were no problems when the crew checked in with air traffic controllers in Zurich, Switzerland, late on Wednesday night."

Lopez with his head shaved (pic: silive.com) The New York Police Department said Lopez fled on Friday morning after an off-duty detective saw him pushing the corpse in the trolley on Staten Island. He ran off after officers tried to question him after seeing the body underneath a sheet.  Lopez's picture was then circulated widely by police and he was arrested in Manhattan, thanks to a tip, after a brief foot chase. Officers said that he had shaved his head to avoid detection. The medical examiner will determine what caused the death of 26-year-old Aduba Obiamaka, who police believe was Lopez's wife. It was not immediately known if Lopez, who was filmed as he emerged from a local police station on Staten Island, has a lawyer."

More than 100 councils have given people licences to keep deadly predators on their properties, including more than 300 killer cobras, vipers and rattlesnakes. Big cats being kept as pets include 13 tigers, two lions, eight leopards, seven cheetahs and nine pumas; while there are also 10 alligators, nine crocodiles and 17 caimans (a smaller member of the crocodile family). The RSPCA said it was worried that licences focused more on protecting the public from harm, rather than on the animals' well-being. A spokesman said: ""We are deeply concerned about the number of exotic animals, including dangerous wild animals, now being kept as pets. ""People may buy them with little idea of how difficult they can be to keep and the animals are sometimes neglected when the novelty wears off and the commitment hits home. This is why we would encourage anyone thinking of getting an exotic pet to find out as much as possible about the animal's needs and whether they're a realistic pet."" She added: ""Licences for exotic animals classed as Dangerous Wild Animals - such as cobras, ostriches and caiman crocodiles - are granted by local authorities and the details are also held locally. ""There is no centrally-held list to determine how many are kept across the country. ""Exotic animals have specialist needs and this includes the ones listed on the Dangerous Wild Animals Act list."" The data was obtained using freedom of information requests to every council in the UK, to which 363 local authorities replied. In Northern Ireland the Environment Agency gave figures for the whole country. The responses showed that the strange pets could be found in cities including London, Sheffield, Hull, Swansea and Portsmouth. In Cornwall alone the council has given permission for the keeping of pumas, lynxes, ocelots, lemurs, vipers, ostriches and wild cats; while in Central Bedfordshire, there are wolves, alligators, caimans, black widow spiders and venomous snakes kept."

However, the delay meant the return flight could not leave on time and passengers had to stay overnight. An airline spokesman said: ""EasyJet can confirm that flight EZY6895 from Glasgow to Palma on 21 May diverted to Toulouse due to the disruptive behaviour of a group of passengers on board. ""The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always our priority and upon landing the passengers were escorted off the aircraft by police. ""The aircraft then continued to Palma.

2016-05-23,Iraq's Prime Minister has announced the beginning of a military operation to retake the Islamic State stronghold of Fallujah.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160523150446/http://news.sky.com/story/1700501/iraqi-army-begins-operation-to-retake-fallujah,"Iraq's Prime Minister has announced the beginning of a military operation to retake the Islamic State stronghold of Fallujah. Haider al Abadi said on his official Twitter feed: ""Zero hour for the liberation of Fallujah has arrived. ""The moment of great victory has drawn near and Daesh (IS) has no choice but to flee."" He also posted a photo of himself surrounded by the country's military commanders. In a statement, he added: ""The Iraqi flag will be raised high over the land of Fallujah."" Mr al Abadi said the offensive would be conducted by the army, police, counter-terrorism forces, local tribal fighters and coalition of mostly Shia Muslim militias. It is also suspected that there will be air support from a US-led coalition. Local media reported heavy shelling in the city's south. Shia militias, including those backed by neighbouring Iran, may have to stay outside the city's boundaries to avoid tensions with Fallujah's Sunni residents. The operation's launch came a day after Iraq's military warned civilians to leave the city. It is estimated that around 75,000 people remain in Fallujah, compared to a pre-war population of around 300,000. Three escape paths were to be opened for civilians leading to camps west, southwest and southeast of the city. Fallujah is about 40 miles west of Baghdad and has been under IS control since January 2014. The Iraqi army, police and militias have had the city surrounded since late last year, while IS fighters have prevented many of the city's residents from leaving. Residents told Reuters that about 20 families had tried to leave the city's south after receiving the warnings to leave but only half of them escaped - some were caught by IS and others were killed by explosives planted along the road by jihadists. Iraqi ground troops have made gains against IS across the country, recently capturing the town of Rutba, 240 miles west of Baghdad. Taking Fallujah would secure the road which stretches around 300 miles from Baghdad to the Jordanian border and to Haditha, 115 miles northwest of the capital. However, the Islamist militants still control large patches of Iraq's north and west, including the second largest city of Mosul, which Iraqi authorities have pledged to retake this year."

Former Labour shadow minister Chuka Umunna blamed the widening ""cracks in our communities"" on a lack of action since race riots 15 years ago. The Streatham MP also criticised the immigration debate for focusing ""almost exclusively on numbers, with too little attention paid to how we integrate people once they settle here"". He spoke ahead of a meeting of the The All-Party Group on Social Inclusion, which he launched in March with a cross-party plan to improve social integration. The group includes prominent Conservative backbencher David Davis, Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz, former Labour minister David Lammy and Tory peer Baroness Stroud. Mr Umunna, who chairs the group, warned that not enough action had been taken following violent disorder in Oldham, Bradford and Burnley in 2001 and the subsequent Cantle report into their causes. He said: ""Fifteen years after the Cantle Report, lessons have still to be learnt and cracks in our communities have continued to grow. ""In fact, Britain has become a more ethnically segregated as a nation as immigration has risen over the last decades. This illustrates the problem with a national debate on immigration that focuses almost exclusively on numbers, with too little attention paid to how we integrate people once they settle here. ""We're now at a crossroads. If we don't take action to bridge the divides in our communities, they will grow into gulfs and there is a real risk the British people could respond, not by seeking to solve our problems together, but by seeking to blame one another and look to 'Donald Trump style' solutions."" :: Chuka Umunna will be appearing on Sunrise on Sky News at around 7.30am this morning."

Analysis of earnings data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the typical 18-year-old who enters the world of work this year will earn a total of £1m by 2044, when they will be 46. Although they will earn an average of £10,361 in 2016, forecasts suggest they could look forward to an annual salary of £51,679 by middle age. But where you live could have an effect on how soon you achieve seven-figure lifetime earnings. According to Prudential, workers in London will have earned £1m by the time they are 39 - however, people in Wales are only predicted to reach this figure when they are 50. A retirement income expert at the company, Vince Smith-Hughes, added: ""With many people now working until later in life, someone earning the projected average salary over their career can expect to earn a total of over £2m in their lifetime."""

The woman, named locally as care worker Saima Khan, was found with serious injuries at her home on Overstone Road in Luton, Bedfordshire, on Monday evening. Emergency services were called to the property at around 11.30pm, but the 34-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. Detectives are treating her death as murder. Police would not confirm reports that she may have disturbed a burglar when she was stabbed or where her body was found. Neighbours claim Ms Khan, who had young children, suffered knife wounds to her neck and she was found in a pool of blood. Nousheen Dar said she was woken up after family members of the woman were in the road screaming for help. The attack happened on Monday night ""I remember I heard all this noise, I think it was her mum and sister screaming and crying in the street,"" Ms Dar told Luton Today. ""I looked out the window for a few minutes and they were waiting for an ambulance so I woke my husband to see what was going on and if we could help. ""There were a number of neighbours in the street and as soon as we got outside the ambulance turned up. ""I didn’t really know what was going on at the time and the paramedics asked us to move away. ""I did see that she was on the floor in the doorway and there was a lot of blood around her. ""It was horrible and I don't know why it has happened. It seems so random. At the time everyone was just in shock."" Ms Dar added the victim's sister begged paramedics to help her but they could not do anything. Detective Chief Inspector Adam Gallop of Bedfordshire Police said: ""We are treating the woman's death as murder and it's therefore of the utmost importance that anyone with information that could help our investigation gets in touch immediately. ""We are following a number of lines of inquiry and are keeping an open mind as to what led to this tragic incident."" Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111."
2016-05-25,Jose Mourinho has agreed personal terms with Manchester United but Sky sources say some issues remain before a contract is signed.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160525220340/http://news.sky.com/story/1701656/mourinho-and-united-agree-terms-of-contract,"Jose Mourinho has agreed personal terms with Manchester United but Sky sources say some issues remain before a contract is signed. Both parties have reached a deal on Mourinho's contract length and salary, and Sky's Sport Correspondent Paul Kelso says a three-year deal with an annual salary in excess of £10m a year is expected but unconfirmed. However, it is understood they are still in negotiations over several unresolved image rights issues. Both Manchester United and the former Chelsea manager are currently tied into commercial partnerships - and there are fears of a potential conflict as Mourinho's deal with Jaguar could be at odds with the club's seven-year association with General Motors. Chevrolet, a division of GM, are the club's shirt sponsor. Gallery: The Special One's Best And Worst Moments Jose Mourinho introduces himself to English football fans by running wildly down the touchline at Old Trafford after his Porto side knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League in 2004. Porto go on to win the competition There is no suggestion that image rights issues will place the new contract in danger, but Sky sources say there may be considerable work to do before Mourinho's appointment is officially confirmed. They do share some common ground in the form of adidas. Mourinho is a global ambassador for the sportswear giant, while United are currently locked into a £750m, decade-long deal which came into effect last year. Talks between the club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Mourinho's agent Jorge Mendes have been swift and positive - and have mainly taken place by phone and email. Legal teams for both sides are continuing to work through the image rights issues, which are said to be the final hurdle before Mourinho can put pen to paper on his contract. An official presentation confirming Mourinho's appointment could be scheduled for later this week. When he lost his job as Chelsea manager less than six months ago, the west London side had lost nine of their first 16 league games and were only just above the relegation zone. Despite this, the 53-year-old is regarded as one of the best football managers in the world. The self-proclaimed ""Special One"" has won the Champions League twice and league titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain, where he managed Real Madrid. Louis van Gaal's final act as United boss was lifting the FA Cup at Wembley, after his side beat Crystal Palace 2-1 in extra time to win the competition for the first time in 12 years. He had faced growing criticism after United crashed out of the Champions League in the group phase and then failed to qualify for next season, while some fans complained that the team's style of football was dull and unadventurous. Van Gaal was sacked on Monday after details of his severance package, believed to be worth about £5m, were finalised."
2016-05-25,"""Finely balanced"" is how David Cameron described his party when it came to the question of Europe on Tuesday. ""At each others' throats"" would perhaps be a more apt description.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160525220340/http://news.sky.com/story/1701583/is-there-any-way-back-for-pm-after-referendum,"By Elizabeth Rigby, Senior Political Correspondent ""Finely balanced"" is how David Cameron described his party when it came to the question of Europe on Tuesday. ""At each others' throats"" would perhaps be a more apt description. After two weeks of relentless blue-on-blue attacks, the animosity between the Prime Minister and many of his backbenchers are plain to see - and senior figures on both sides are asking whether there is any way back for Mr Cameron after the referendum on 23 June. One Brexit-backing minister told me they were convinced the Prime Minister ""cannot put the party back together"" after what is turning into a mudslinging match between members of the Government. Vote Leavers are angry at the ""high-handed rhetoric"" of their leader and the personal attacks on their leading lights such as Boris Johnson. They are also furious that Mr Cameron and the Chancellor are deploying the government machine to make their case, with the latest Treasury report on the risks of recession a lightning rod for Tory discontent.  On the plus side, the war of attrition seems to be paying off with the public, as the odds for a Remain vote shorten and polls suggesting that voters are moving towards staying in the EU. But what does it mean for Mr Cameron personally? Even his supporters are privately worried about the post-referendum bloodletting. On Tuesday the Daily Mail splashed on threats of a no-confidence vote in the PM after the referendum. One prominent Brexiteer told Sky News there was a 50/50 chance of a vote of no-confidence, which could be triggered if 50 MPs write to Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench committee, formally calling for a vote. Those in Mr Cameron's camp dismiss such warnings, and privately argue that the 30 or so hardcore group of persistent rebels who might like to unseat him will not be able to garner wider support from more moderate Brexiteers. But even if the Prime Minister's backbenchers do not go for the nuclear option, he could find himself presiding over a party that is, in effect, ungovernable. We have already seen a taster of what happens when party discipline breaks down: last week the PM was pushed into making an unwanted amendment to avoid the first defeat on the Queen's Speech vote in nearly 100 years. On Tuesday Mr Cameron seemed to be tiring of the blue-on-blue attacks, as he refused to criticise defence minister Penny Mordaunt for her incorrect assertion that the UK did not have a veto over the EU's membership of Turkey. He also stressed that the Remain camp was a ""broad coalition"" and said it was time for other voices beyond to speak up - a tacit admission perhaps that his war-torn Tories would benefit for a temporary cessation in hostilities. After a bruising couple of weeks, the Prime Minister can at least take comfort in the fact that he looks to be winning the battle with the public, even if the Conservative Party is tearing itself apart. But some of his supporters fear that it could prove a costly victory: ""In fighting to win the referendum (Cameron) could end up killing himself,"" observed one minister."

His appointment is part of a drive to encourage more young people to start up their own businesses and will champion the apprenticeships programme. According to Downing Street, he will carry out a series of roadshows events where he will speak to school leavers and businesses. The move will come as a particular coup for the Prime Minister as Lord Sugar spectacularly quit the Labour Party last year, slamming its economic policies on the way out of the exit door. It is the second time the peer had taken on the role - he was made enterprise tsar by then-prime minister Gordon Brown in 2009 when his appointment was criticised as a ""publicity stunt"". You're hired! Welcome to @Lord_Sugar, new Enterprise Tsar! Championing apprentices & business start-ups https://t.co/PvrBEUVDOA Lord Sugar said on Wednesday: ""I'm delighted to be taking on this challenge. I built successful businesses with the support of hundreds of talented young people who learned their skills on the job - exactly the kinds of skills you learn in an apprenticeship. ""But not enough of our young people know about apprenticeships and what they offer, and too few feel empowered to set up their own business."" Lord Sugar announced he was leaving the Labour Party just after the General Election, denouncing it for ""negative business policies and the general anti-enterprise concepts"". He said he had ""lost confidence"" in the party under Ed Miliband's leadership because it had made a ""policy shift moving back towards what Old Labour stood for"". He said he signed up to New Labour in 1997 when ""true enterprise was being supported by the party"". Before that he had been a critic of the party, writing a letter to the Financial Times in 1992 in which he lambasted Gordon Brown, who had accused him of doing well out of the recession. He concluded the letter by saying: ""Labour offers no route out of recession."" Skills minister Nick Boles said: ""We want every young person in Britain to get on and build a great life for themselves, whether it's by starting an apprenticeship or setting up their own business. ""Lord Sugar has huge credibility among young people and I am delighted that he has agreed to help the government bang the drum for apprenticeships and enterprise."""

But shares plunged 8% as Mr Rowe warned that the strategy - designed to turn around clothing and home sales that remain ""not satisfactory"" - would have a short-term impact on profits. He set out the plans as M&S reported a 4.3% rise in underlying profits to £689.6m for the year to the start of April. However bottom-line pre-tax profits fell 18.5% to £488.8m after one-off costs of £200m including £100m in charges relating to its ailing international business and a £50m insurance mis-selling hit related to M&S Bank. The annual results were the first under Mr Rowe - following the departure of Marc Bolland amid struggling sales. Sales slipped 2.7% in the last quarter of its financial year. Mr Rowe said: ""We are investing to re-establish our price position by sharpening prices and to enhance service by putting more employees into our stores. ""These actions, combined with the difficult trading conditions, will have an adverse effect on profit in the short term. ""We are, however, confident that our commitment to delivering the right product, price and service will help return clothing and home sales to growth."" Mr Rowe said the group would cut prices on around 30% of its clothing ranges, having already slashed price tags on 3.5 million garments in the past few weeks. It will also take out 10% of its product range to simplify the group's offering. He said the group needed to win back ""Mrs M&S"" - its loyal army of women shoppers aged 50 and over, who he said have been ""neglected"" in recent years. M&S, which has carried out a ""forensic review"" over the last six weeks, said it was facing ""difficult and challenging times"" with ebbing consumer confidence, a flat clothing market and slowing online sales. Customers were becoming ""increasingly style and health conscious"" while for many of the 32 million who shop at M&S, it was not their first choice, the group said. M&S said it would ""re-establish style authority"" in clothes while lowering prices though cutting back on one-off promotions, and enhancing the customer experience with ""sharper ranges, better availability and investment in store staffing"". Meanwhile, M&S - which employs 70,000 store staff - also said it was proposing a ""significant"" increase in pay for shop assistants to £8.50 per hour, and £9.65 in greater London. However, plans for the continued phase-out of the group's final salary pension scheme - already closed to new members - will mean long-serving staff are moved to a defined contribution scheme - usually a less generous retirement option. The move affects 11,000 employees."
2016-05-25,A consortium led by former Mothercare and Arcadia executive Greg Tufnell has emerged as a last-minute potential bidder for collapsed retailer BHS.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160525220340/http://news.sky.com/story/1701861/former-mothercare-boss-in-last-minute-bhs-bid,"A consortium led by former Mothercare and Arcadia executive Greg Tufnell has emerged as a last-minute potential bidder for collapsed retailer BHS. Mr Tufnell, brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, reportedly heads the newly formed Richess Group, backed by Portuguese investors. Mr Tufnell was managing director of Mothercare from 1997 to 2000 and previously led Burton, one of the brands owned by former BHS owner Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group. Other potential bidders reported to have expressed an interest in BHS include Matalan founder John Hargreaves, Poundstretcher and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. BHS collapsed into administration in April putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Reports suggest there will be a decision on its future by the end of the week. Administrators Duff & Phelps declined to comment on latest reports. The demise of the retailer leaves the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) – the ""lifeboat"" funded by a levy on other retirement schemes – having to shoulder the burden of a £571m BHS pension black hole. MPs have been sharply critical of previous owners including Sir Philip, who sold the business for £1 to little-known consortium Retail Acquisitions last year. Earlier this week a Commons committee investigating the collapse heard evidence that Sir Philip's Arcadia group had been informed that the head of the consortium, Dominic Chappell, had a history of bankruptcy and no retail experience. Sir Philip - who is due to appear before MPs next month - has hit back at what he calls his ""trial by media"" and calls for him to lose his knighthood."

It takes the total number of jobs cut in the region by Shell since the start of 2014 to nearly 1,000. Paul Goodfellow, Shell's vice president for UK and Ireland, said market conditions ""remain challenging"" and that it was cutting costs and improving efficiency to face up to ""lower for longer"" oil prices. The group has been slashing jobs in response to the sharp downturn price, and also as a result of its £36bn merger with oil and has exploration group BG. Shell had already announced a reduction of 10.300 staff and direct contractor roles since the start of 2015 and that number has now risen to 12,500. The latest cuts to Shell's UK and Ireland upstream division are set to be implemented by the end of this year. :: Oil Plunge Means Tough Times For North Sea Mr Goodfellow addressed staff in Aberdeen ahead of the announcement. He said in a statement: ""Despite the improvements that we have made to our business, current market conditions remain challenging.  ""Our integration with BG provides an opportunity to accelerate our performance in this 'lower for longer' environment. ""We need to reduce our cost base, improve production efficiency and have an organisation that best fits our combined portfolio and business plans."" Mr Goodfellow added that Shell would remain a key employer in the north east of Scotland with around 1,700 employees. Shell cut 250 jobs in the North Sea in 2014 and a further 250 last year. At the end of last year, Shell employed 90,000 people globally while BG employed around 4,600. Earlier this month, Shell reported an 89% fall in first quarter profits to £334m. Annual profits for 2015 were down 80% to £2.6bn."

Mirra is the first action sports athlete to be diagnosed with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), reports ESPN's Magazine. The 41-year-old star - who once held the record for the most X Games medals - died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in February. Lauren Mirra told ESPN's Magazine about her husband's deteriorating condition in the months leading up to his suicide. Mirra was one of the most decorated athletes in X Games history She said she began to notice changes last summer in the father-of-two's moods which ""quickly started to get worse"". ""Fatigue, definitely, both physically and emotionally,"" she said. ""And forgetfulness, moodiness. ""He would repeat conversations and topics to the point where it was obvious to the person he was talking to but not to him. ""He would dwell on a subject and not want to move on from it."" A neuropathologist told ESPN that Mirra's brain was indistinguishable from those of former football and hockey players who have suffered from CTE. Mirra, of Greenville, North Carolina, endured a number of concussions during his BMX career. But he also fractured his skull when he was hit by a car as a teenager and did some boxing after retiring. Mirra won a medal every year between 1995 and 2008 and chalked up 14 gold medals in total. His one-time record of 24 career medals was broken in 2013 by Bob Burnquist. :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

The US Justice Department's rare decision means Dylann Roof, who allegedly opened fire inside a church in a racially motivated attack last June, will face two death penalty trials. In a short statement, attorney general Loretta Lynch said: ""The nature of the alleged crime and the resulting harm compelled this decision."" As well as facing nine counts of murder in state court, the 22-year-old has been charged with 33 federal crimes - including obstruction of religion, firearms offences and hate crimes. Ms Lynch said her department had thoroughly considered ""all relevant factual and legal issues"" in its decision to seek capital punishment if he is convicted. Federal executions are exceedingly rare in the US. Only three have been performed in the past 50 years, and none have taken place since 2003. According to his lawyers, Roof would be prepared to plead guilty if he did not face the death penalty. The shootings during a Bible study session at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston sparked a nationwide debate about race in America. At the time, Ms Lynch said: ""To carry out these twin goals of fanning racial flames and exacting revenge, Roof further decided to seek out and murder African-Americans because of their race."" Roof's state trial is expected to begin in January, and a date for the federal case has not been set. Not all of the victims' families believe Roof should face the death penalty if he is convicted, mainly because of their religious views. But Steve Schmutz, a lawyer representing three families, said his clients ""support whatever decision the US government is making in this case, and I'm sure they support this decision""."

The UK's foreign aid budget has soared by 144% in 10 years - hitting £13.2bn in 2014, figures show, as David Cameron arrives in Japan for the annual meeting with other G7 leaders. According to the progress report, Britain is the only country to honour its pledge to give the United Nations' target of 0.7% of national wealth in international aid. Germany and France give 0.4% of GDP while Canada gives less than 0.3%. The US, whose foreign aid budget has risen 68% in the last decade, gives less than 0.2% of its wealth, as do Japan and Italy. The Government insists that it is ""overwhelmingly in the national interest"" to pledge the money for overseas development projects. But the disclosure has led to claims Britain's largesse is making the UK look ""stupid"" and the Government should concentrate on spending at home. Conservative MP Philip Davies told The Daily Telegraph: ""We are clearly the mugs of the world. ""The Prime Minister might think it makes us look compassionate to spend more and more money when we’re in debt - to hand it over to some fantastically corrupt countries around the world. ""I personally think it makes us look stupid."" Fellow MP Peter Bone said the UK should ""learn a lesson from other countries that put their populations first and decide to spend money at home"". The foreign aid budget is on course to exceed money spent on police, prisons, immigration and border control together by 2020, rising to £16.3bn. Last year Mr Cameron announced £5m of aid would go to Caribbean Islands to improve fishing."

A new report from the think-tank has warned a Brexit could see public finances take a £20bn to £40bn hit in 2019/20. It has also questioned claims by Vote Leave that the UK would save £350m a week from EU contributions. But Vote Leave dismissed the IFS as a ""paid-up propaganda arm of the European Commission"" - it received around 11% of its funding in 2014 from the EU. The campaign claimed: ""The IFS is not a neutral organisation. It would face an £800,000 deficit if we vote Leave."" :: PM Says Tories Can Come Together After EU Row The IFS report states: ""Claims that we would have an additional £350m a week to spend are wrong. ""They imply that, following a UK exit, other EU countries would continue to pay a rebate to the UK on contributions it was not making. ""Such claims also imply we would simply stop all existing EU subsidies to farming and poorer regions (such as Cornwall and west Wales)."" The IFS concludes that the UK's net contribution to the EU budget of £8bn a year could be used to help public finances - but a fall in national income of 0.6%, compared to what it would have been if the country stayed in the union, would offset this direct effect. According to its report, the Government would need to find the equivalent of £5bn in public spending cuts, £5bn worth of savings from social security spending and roll out tax rises worth £5bn if it wants to balance the books by the end of this parliament. :: Quiz The PM Or Gove: Join Our EU Audience Paul Johnson, IFS director and an author of the report, said: ""Getting to budget balance from there, as the Government desires, would require an additional year or two of austerity at current rates of spending cuts."" He dismissed claims the think-tank was a ""propaganda arm"" of the EU telling Sky News they were ""outrageous"" and the organisation had undertaken independent research for 30 years. This scenario is based on gross domestic product being 2.1% to 3.5% lower over the period, as predicted by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to return the UK to a surplus by 2020, with the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast stating that the UK would have a budget surplus of £10.4bn in 2019/20 and £11bn the year after. :: Carney Accused Of Brexit Debate Propaganda Vote Leave campaigner Andrea Leadsom MP said: ""It's no wonder people are being turned off this debate given the continuous campaign to do down the British economy from EU-funded organisations. ""So many of these studies are based on entirely negative assumptions about our economy and the future decisions a UK government outside the EU would make, but ignore the pressing need of EU countries to continue trading with the UK. ""They also ignore the very real risk of what will happen if we vote In: more money and power to a Brussels interested only in propping up an ailing Eurozone."" :: Sky News is hosting two special programmes before the referendum. David Cameron will face live questions in the first big television event of the campaign, at 8pm on Thursday, 2 June. And then on Friday, 3 June it will be the turn of ""Leave"" campaigner, Michael Gove - also at 8pm."
2016-05-25,"The Treasury's long-term analysis of the economic costs of Brexit was never going to be ""Project Fear"". It was always Monday's Treasury Shock Doc on ""the immediate economic impact of leaving the EU"" that was going to contain the most hair-raising horror.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160525220340/http://news.sky.com/story/1701051/treasurys-shock-eu-doc-will-have-consequences,"The Treasury's long-term analysis of the economic costs of Brexit was never going to be ""Project Fear"". It was always Monday's Treasury Shock Doc on ""the immediate economic impact of leaving the EU"" that was going to contain the most hair-raising horror. Unemployment up between 500,000 and 820,000. Growth hit by 3.6% to 6%. Real incomes hit by £800 for someone on the average wage. Inflation up, food prices up as the pound slides. That is the projection of a severe Brexit shock. It is clearly spuriously precise. It suggests that the Chancellor genuinely believes that a vote to leave will cause a financial crisis short of 2008 but akin to the early 1990s. How? Because EU exit with an uncertain Article 50 negotiation will trigger global markets to notice what it has previously ignored - Britain's record current account deficit - and therefore attack the pound. This, combined with uncertainty over the policy arrangements post-Brexit, creates a fog of uncertainty that impacts household consumption and business investment. I have covered economics and politics for 17 years, and never have I seen a Prime Minister and Chancellor willing to talk about a possible sterling depreciation, let alone actually predict a 12% slide in the pound (15% in a severe shock). Never have we had the residents of Downing Street happily predicting a recession.  They have opened up a flank of attack from the Leave campaign - that their talking down of the economy will be responsible for any post-Brexit vote pause or slump in the pound and the economy. This will add to the difficulties in healing Conservative wounds on 24 June. Some senior Tories now believe the PM and Chancellor are actively damaging the economy to win their vote. The key development on Monday, though, was an omission. HM Treasury did not forecast the economic impact of the least bad (in their terms) Brexit option - the EEA or so-called ""Norwegian"" option. In theory, this makes the forecasts even scarier than otherwise. The Treasury's view is that Vote Leave's chairman, Michael Gove, has ruled out staying in the Single Market - the same EEA option - so it is not on the table. This is a direct result of Vote Leave deciding they want to quit the Single Market as well as the EU. The Leave side, meanwhile, are not actually putting up counter arguments, let alone an alternative plan and projection for the post-Brexit world. Instead, the rebuttals focus on the motives and competence of those making any Remain argument. It is a facsimile of the Scottish referendum campaign's post-truth politics. In that case Project Fear was probably proven to be far too timid, given the collapse in the oil price and likely immediate destruction of an independent Scotland's public finances, at a time of an oversized banking sector with no central bank. Now the IMF becomes the ""EU-funded"" IMF, as if David Cameron is somehow beholden to Brussels (in fact, behind closed doors they have been at each other's throats over the eurozone crisis for six years). Some 284 economists who have now signed a letter expressing similar concerns about Brexit (eight economists signed a pro-Brexit report) as the Bank of England are dismissed as the same people who supported the euro. The signing up of highly respected ex-Bank of England Governor Sir Charles Bean to describe the forecasts as ""reasonable estimates of the likely size of the short-term impact of a vote to leave"" was a major impact. The unemployment numbers, at first look, sounded rather high. Professor Bean wrote the set text on unemployment studied by thousands of economics students. Ultimately, though, it is anyone's guess what the numbers would be. What we do know is that right or wrong, the vast bulk of the economic consensus is with Remain. The point of this Treasury report is as a piece of marketing to signpost the undecided voter towards the reality of economic consensus on the EU and the Single Market. Other issues might well be more important - democracy, security, and immigration, for example. A consensus can often be wrong, too. So the Treasury has not been cautious here. But it is not wildly out of step either. There will be consequences either way come 24 June."

Akhunzada was one of Mansour's two deputies, and it is believed he was selected at a meeting in Pakistan. Little is known about him, although he is said to be around 60 and a respected religious scholar. New Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhunzada According to AFP, the insurgents struggled to find a successor after the two main contenders backed out of the race. One of them was Sirajuddin Haqqani, a guerrilla commander who is regarded by US officials as the organisation's most dangerous warlord. A Taliban spokesman said Akhunzada was appointed by ""unanimous agreement"" in the supreme council, with all members pledging allegiance to him. The news came as at least 11 people were killed in a suicide bomb attack on a minibus carrying appeal court staff in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Mansour was killed on Saturday The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack, which was carried out during the morning rush hour. Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said the bomber detonated an explosives vest as he walked past the minibus. Mr Danish said the dead included court employees and civilians, and four other people were injured. In a statement, the Taliban said the bombing was in ""revenge for the killing of six innocent prisoners in Kabul"". The scene of the suicide bombing in Kabul This was a reference to the hanging at a Kabul prison earlier this month of six Taliban members convicted of terrorism. The strike against Mansour, which had been authorised by President Barack Obama, took place on Saturday afternoon in a remote area of Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. A Pentagon spokesman said Mansour was overseeing plans to target US personnel and troops assisting and training Afghan armed forces. Pakistan has described the drone strike as a ""violation"" of its airspace and sovereignty."
2016-05-25,Five top model agencies face accusations by the competition regulator that they colluded to fix prices charged to fashion brands and retailers.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160525220340/http://news.sky.com/story/1701992/top-model-agencies-facing-price-fix-claims,"Five top model agencies face accusations by the competition regulator that they colluded to fix prices charged to fashion brands and retailers. The claims against the agencies and their trade body, the Association of Model Agents (AMA), follow an investigation launched in March last year by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). It alleges that FM Models, Models 1, Premier, Storm and Viva together with the AMA breached competition law. The agencies are among the most high-profile in the industry. Premier has represented Naomi Campbell while Storm has Jourdan Dunn on its books and previously looked after Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne. Models 1 represents Sophie Dahl and Yasmin LeBon. The CMA claims that the agencies shared confidential, competitively sensitive information including in some instances ""a common approach to pricing"". It said the agencies used the AMA and its council ""as a vehicle for price coordination"". This included circulating emails known as ""AMA alerts"" to encourage model agencies to reject fees being offered by specific customers and to negotiate a higher fee. Model agencies typically charge around 35% of the invoice - so would earn £350 for every £1,000 paid by a customer for a modelling job. Higher prices would ultimately be passed on to shoppers. The CMA's findings come after it reportedly raided modelling agencies' offices, interviewed staff and seized computer hard drives as part of the investigation last summer. Stephen Blake, senior director of the CMA's cartels and criminal group, said: ""The allegations concern prices charged to a range of customers, including high street chains, online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands. ""The CMA alleges that these five model agencies sought to achieve higher prices in negotiations with their customers by colluding instead of competing. ""These are provisional findings only and no conclusion can be drawn at this stage that there has been a breach of competition law. ""We will carefully consider any representations from the parties before deciding whether the law has been broken."" Sky News attempted to contact all the agencies and the AMA but was either told there was no comment or had yet to receive a reply."

The official is part of the Egyptian investigative team and has personally examined the remains at a Cairo morgue.  He said all 80 pieces brought to Cairo so far are small and that ""there isn't even a whole body part, like an arm or a head"". The official added that ""the logical explanation is that it was an explosion"" but no traces of explosives have been found. However, another forensics official said only a tiny number of remains had arrived so far and it was too early to specify whether there had been a bomb on board. Gallery: Pictures Of EgyptAir Jet Wreckage Pictures from Facebook/Egyptian Army Spokesperson All 66 people on the plane were killed when the Airbus 320 crashed in the Mediterranean on 19 May while en route from Paris to Cairo. Egypt's president said on Sunday a submarine had been deployed in the hunt for Flight 804's black boxes. The aircraft came down at 2.45am south of the Greek island of Karpathos and north of the Egyptian coast. Ships and planes from Britain, Cyprus, France, Greece and the United States are also taking part in the search for debris. Funerals have been held for some of the crash victims and on Tuesday family members arrived at Cairo's morgue to give DNA samples to help identify the remains. Egyptian authorities have said they believe terrorism is a more likely explanation than equipment failure, and some aviation experts have said the erratic flight reported by the Greek defence minister suggests a bomb blast or a struggle in the cockpit."

The 55-year-old and the Albanian men were detained at Chichester Marina in West Sussex. Spanish authorities had issued a European Arrest Warrant for the Briton who is now in custody. He was held on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration and the Albanians on suspicion of entering the UK illegally. They have also been detained pending Home Office consideration of their cases. The arrests come a month after the National Crime Agency revealed migrants trying to reach the UK are paying up to £13,500 to people smugglers. Investigators suspect that, as well as the main Channel crossing between Calais and Dover, criminals are using less busy ports including Tilbury, Hull and Newhaven in East Sussex. The desperation of some migrants to reach Britain was highlighted last month when two Iranian men were found floating in a poorly-equipped dinghy in the English Channel. A light on their mobile phone alerted a passing ship in the Dover Strait - one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world - before they were picked up. A Sussex Police spokesman said: ""The (Chichester) arrests were made by Sussex Police after Hampshire Police alerted us about the yacht arriving at the marina. ""The case is now being investigated by the Home Office Immigration Enforcement."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""The security of our border is paramount. ""We work with our partners to detect and deter people who attempt to reach the UK illegally, while targeting the criminal gangs behind illegal entry attempts."" Chichester Marina has more than 1,000 berths and according to its website enjoys a ""marked air of peace and tranquillity""."

""At each others' throats"" would perhaps be a more apt description. After two weeks of relentless blue-on-blue attacks, the animosity between the Prime Minister and many of his backbenchers are plain to see - and senior figures on both sides are asking whether there is any way back for Mr Cameron after the referendum on 23 June. One Brexit-backing minister told me they were convinced the Prime Minister ""cannot put the party back together"" after what is turning into a mudslinging match between members of the Government. Vote Leavers are angry at the ""high-handed rhetoric"" of their leader and the personal attacks on their leading lights such as Boris Johnson. They are also furious that Mr Cameron and the Chancellor are deploying the government machine to make their case, with the latest Treasury report on the risks of recession a lightning rod for Tory discontent.  On the plus side, the war of attrition seems to be paying off with the public, as the odds for a Remain vote shorten and polls suggesting that voters are moving towards staying in the EU. But what does it mean for Mr Cameron personally? Even his supporters are privately worried about the post-referendum bloodletting. On Tuesday the Daily Mail splashed on threats of a no-confidence vote in the PM after the referendum. One prominent Brexiteer told Sky News there was a 50/50 chance of a vote of no-confidence, which could be triggered if 50 MPs write to Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench committee, formally calling for a vote. Those in Mr Cameron's camp dismiss such warnings, and privately argue that the 30 or so hardcore group of persistent rebels who might like to unseat him will not be able to garner wider support from more moderate Brexiteers. But even if the Prime Minister's backbenchers do not go for the nuclear option, he could find himself presiding over a party that is, in effect, ungovernable. We have already seen a taster of what happens when party discipline breaks down: last week the PM was pushed into making an unwanted amendment to avoid the first defeat on the Queen's Speech vote in nearly 100 years. On Tuesday Mr Cameron seemed to be tiring of the blue-on-blue attacks, as he refused to criticise defence minister Penny Mordaunt for her incorrect assertion that the UK did not have a veto over the EU's membership of Turkey. He also stressed that the Remain camp was a ""broad coalition"" and said it was time for other voices beyond to speak up - a tacit admission perhaps that his war-torn Tories would benefit for a temporary cessation in hostilities. After a bruising couple of weeks, the Prime Minister can at least take comfort in the fact that he looks to be winning the battle with the public, even if the Conservative Party is tearing itself apart. But some of his supporters fear that it could prove a costly victory: ""In fighting to win the referendum (Cameron) could end up killing himself,"" observed one minister."

Tom Billings, from Oxford, had been spending eight weeks travelling in North America and was visiting Vancouver in November 2013. The 22-year-old seasoned traveller was last seen on 25 November in the city and was reported missing a week later after he failed to return to his accommodation. Investigators with the Vancouver Police Department said information indicated that Mr Billings had gone to the mountains on the North Shore, where he was believed to have become lost or injured. Mr Billings had been staying in Vancouver when he went missing A large search operation following his disappearance failed to find any trace of him. On 11 April this year, a hiker on Cypress Mountain spotted human remains and reported the discovery to police. North Shore Search and Rescue then returned to the area and Mr Billings' remains were recovered. The Coroners Service confirmed it was Mr Billings through DNA identification. No foul play is suspected in his death, police said. Mr Billings' father Martin issued an emotional appeal for help in finding his son during a news conference in Vancouver in December 2013. He said he had last exchanged emails with his son, who had recently graduated from university, when he was in Seattle.

A day after joining Jeremy Corbyn on the Labour In for Britain battlebus, the former party leader called on young people to register to vote in the 23 June poll. His rehabilitation, just a year after his bruising defeat in last year's general election, has led to speculation – which neither he or Mr Corbyn have denied - that he could return to the Shadow Cabinet. :: Everything You Wanted To Know About The EU But speaking at a Remain event in north London, Mr Miliband had a reminder of the unpredictability of top-level politics when reality TV star Joey Essex challenged him about the French ""nicking our fish"". The celebrity, who has appeared on the campaign trail with Nigel Farage, was among an invited audience in north London to hear the former Labour leader warn young voters they needed to register in order to stop the UK quitting the EU. Mr Miliband had one of his most uncomfortable moments in last year's general election campaign when he was interviewed by Russell Brand at the comedian's home. Attacking Leave campaigners in his Remain speech, Mr Miliband said: ""I think you see elements from the Leave campaign based on prejudice. ""When Nigel Farage says on television to Peter Mandelson 'you are rubbing our noses in diversity', I think that's an offensive remark."" Mr Miliband said immigration was good for Britain and the ""flip side"" was that young British people could travel and work freely across the EU. Asked about concerns mass migration was pushing down wages, Mr Miliband said: ""We would do far, far more damage to people on lower incomes by leaving the European Union. Economically we would do damage. ""The loss of workers' rights will do damage."" The ex-Labour leader said 1.5 million of the six million 18 to 24-year-olds eligible to vote on 23 June are not registered, nor are a quarter of the eight million 25 to 35-year-olds. ""Today is a call to arms to all young people to register to vote,"" he said. ""Let's be clear about the danger: a decision not to vote is a decision to let someone else decide your future. ""Young people can decide this referendum. If they don't use their vote, the danger is this referendum will be lost."" Asking his question, Joey Essex said he was voicing concerns made to him by friends who work at Billingsgate fish market about French trawlers. Mr Miliband appeared to dodge the question by initially asking four young voters who had already spoken to answer Mr Essex's question, then said it was important for EU nations to work together. But his attempt to woo young voters was mocked by Leave campaigner and Tory MP James Cleverly, who said EU membership was damaging for young people. ""Ed Miliband's cynical attempt to convince young people otherwise will fool no-one,"" said Mr Cleverly. ""After his failed efforts to court the youth vote via Russell Brand last year, you'd think he would know better."" :: EU In or Out? David Cameron live on Sky News - Thursday at 8pm  :: EU In or Out?

An air rifle was used to carry out the slaughter of wildlife in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, between Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon.

A spokesman for Hampshire Police said a seventh duck had been shot in the head but was rescued by a member of the public and taken to a local vet. It is expected to live. PC Geoff Hill of Farnborough police station, said: ""It is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to kill, injure or take any wild bird.

A Los Angeles judge also said the Hollywood star should not try to contact Amber Heard before a hearing on 17 June. Heard, 30, said in a sworn declaration the phone thrown by the Oscar-nominated actor had hit her in the cheek and eye during a fight last Saturday.  Her court filing - which included a photos of her bruised face - said the actor was high and drunk when the incident occurred. ""I live in fear that Johnny will return to (our house) unannounced to terrorise me, physically and emotionally,"" she wrote in the court papers. The Texas-born actress filed for divorce on Monday, blaming irreconcilable differences and saying the pair had separated a day earlier.  Depp is in Portugal for a performance with his band Hollywood Vampires Judge Carl Moor rejected Heard's request that Depp attend a year's worth of anger management classes. The judge also denied her bid for the protective order to extend to her dog, a Yorkshire terrier named Pistol. Gallery: Heard Files For Divorce Saying She Lives 'In Fear' Of Depp Amber Heard has said in a sworn declaration that her estranged husband Johnny Depp threw a mobile phone at her during a row, striking her cheek and eye Heard's filing states that in another incident in April Depp skipped her birthday party and showed up later high and drunk and pushed her to the floor. After that incident, Heard wrote that she did not see the Pirates of the Caribbean star for another month. Last Saturday's alleged confrontation would have taken place after Depp's 81-year-old mother, Betty Sue Palmer, died in Los Angeles following a long illness. Los Angeles police confirmed they went to Depp and Heard's residence on Saturday. But the person who reported the alleged domestic violence asked the officers not to take a report and did not provide evidence. ""Officers' investigation determined that a crime did not occur,"" Los Angeles police officer Aareon Jefferson said on Friday. Laura Wasser, a lawyer for Depp - who is in Portugal for a performance with his band Hollywood Vampires - declined to comment on the restraining order. Depp, 52, married Heard in February 2015, after they had been dating for three years. Earlier, the actor asked a judge to reject Heard's claim for spousal support. The pair, who do not have children together, met on the set of the film The Rum Diary in 2011. Depp was previously in a long-term relationship with French singer Vanessa Paradis, with whom he has two children. They split in 2012."

2016-05-29,Eight Russians are among 23 athletes at the London Olympics who have tested positive for doping after a fresh analysis of samples.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160529213046/http://news.sky.com/story/1703563/russians-among-23-london-olympics-cheats,"Eight Russians are among 23 athletes at the London Olympics who have tested positive for doping after a fresh analysis of samples. The confirmation of the positive tests was made by the Russian Olympic Committee. It did not identify the athletes or what disciplines they were in, but said they came from three different sports. Anna Chicherova last week failed a retest from a 2008 sample Russia remains under investigation after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report suggested ""systematic"" doping in the country. Its track and field athletes are currently suspended from competing, and the Olympic powerhouse could be without a full team at the upcoming Rio Games. It was on Friday the International Olympic Committee (IOC) revealed 23 competitors, spanning five sports, had tested positive after new analysis of 265 samples. The IOC said it is continuing to re-analyse the samples with the latest technology, adding that more results could be revealed in the next few weeks. It will not name the athletes or the sports until second samples have been tested, a process which can take several weeks. The athletes concerned are being informed of the test results, after which proceedings against them can begin. The current re-testing programme targeted athletes who could be eligible to compete this summer. Those found to have breached anti-doping rules will be banned from taking part. It was also revealed that one more sample from the 2008 Beijing Games had shown ""abnormal parameters"" and would be investigated. The samples were re-examined after intelligence-gathering that began last August, the IOC said in a statement. It has been working with the WADA in that period. Last week, it announced that 31 athletes could be banned from competing at Rio de Janeiro this summer, after re-examining hundreds of samples from the 2008 Games. Fourteen of those athletes were Russian, and so will come as little surprise the latest announcement involved competitors from the country. One of the 14 Russians who tested positive was high jumper Anna Chicherova, who won bronze in 2008 and gold in 2012. She vowed to clear her name after learning she had tested positive. ""It's the most complete shock. I can't explain how it could have happened. I was always sure what supplements and medicines I was using,"" she said. The latest revelations come as a further blow to the sporting event's image. Concerns about doping have plagued the build-up to this year's Games, due to be held in Rio in August."

In a blistering letter, seen by Sky News, the Justice Secretary and former London mayor claim the Prime Minister’s failure on his pledge to curb immigration is ""corrosive of public trust"". The attack marks a dramatic escalation of the ""blue-on-blue"" Tory civil war triggered by the referendum campaign and confirms the Leave campaign plans to fight almost entirely on immigration between now and 23 June. The move also coincides with a furious attack on Mr Cameron's opponents by former Prime Minister Sir John Major, who accuses the Leave campaign of deliberately telling voters ""untruths"" they know to be false. In their letter to Mr Cameron, Mr Gove and Mr Johnson appear to ridicule his immigration pledge, declaring: ""Voters were promised repeatedly at elections that net immigration could be cut to the tens of thousands. ""This promise is plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU and the failure to keep it is corrosive of public trust in politics. ""It's government policy that 'EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here.' But the EU did not agree to letting the UK implement that policy during the renegotiation of our membership."" In another attack on Mr Cameron, pro-Leave Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has publicly predicted a leadership challenge against the Prime Minister even if he wins the referendum by a narrow margin. Asked if MPs would demand a leadership contest,  Mr Bridgen said in a radio interview: ""I think that's probably highly likely. Given the exaggerated claims that the Prime Minister has made, there probably would be 50 colleagues who would be very dissatisfied with the Prime Minister's performance."" In his attack on the Leave campaign, Sir John accuses its leading figures of ""inaccuracies and falsehoods"", ""shameless distortion of the truth"" and ""a fraud on the British people"" with claims such as £350m a week paid to the European Union. ""They have - knowingly - told untruths about the cost of Europe,"" he writes in the Mail on Sunday. ""They have promised negotiating gains that cannot - and will not - be delivered. ""They have raised phantom fears that cannot be justified, puffing up their case with false statistics, unlikely scenarios and downright untruths. To mislead the British nation in this fashion - when its very future is at stake - is unforgivable."" Another former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has told voters agonising over whether to back Brexit: ""If you're not sure, don't do it!"" Writing in The Sunday Times, Mr Blair says Brexit would be a ""betrayal of the British interest"" that would lead to ""a long agonising process of disengagement"" with ""heavy financial costs"". And in a boost for the Remain campaign, a poll of more than 600 economists by Ipsos MORI for the Observer suggests 88% believe an exit from the EU and the single market would most likely damage Britain's growth prospects over the next five years. :: EU In or Out: David Cameron Live, Sky News 8pm Thursday; Michael Gove Live 8pm Friday"

Jahangir Khan boasted in rap lyrics about his lavish criminal lifestyle but failed to mention conning pensioners out of their savings.  The 23-year-old and three accomplices would pose as police officers and bank officials to con people across the Midlands, Hertfordshire, Wiltshire and Northamptonshire. In early 2014 the group made in excess of 1,300 'phishing' calls to landline numbers. They raided 84 people's bank accounts after persuading victims to hand over their details  - the oldest victim was a 92-year-old woman. West Midlands Police have now released a transcript of rap lyrics found on Khan's phone where he boasts of being the ""real don""  and ""da underground's finest"". The lyrics also allude to Rolex watches, speeding around in high-powered cars, and his claimed popularity with the ""honeys"". Jahangir Khan and Arafa Begum Detective Constable Dan Chappelow, said: ""Khan clearly saw himself as a respected kingpin of the criminal world … in his mind he was 'da underground's finest' who drew respect from men and a magnet for adoring women. ""The truth is that Khan is a coward who spent his time phoning elderly people and tricking them into parting with bank cards and PIN numbers with scare stories that their accounts had been compromised. ""His crimes are a million miles away from the lifestyle depicted in his rap.""  Detectives from the force's Economic Crime Unit arrested the 23-year-old from Perry Barr, Birmingham, and found photos of him showing off designer watches, jewellery and clothes − paid for with cash from victims' bank accounts. CCTV showed Khan taking victims' money from a cash point and using a stolen card at a convenience store. Mohammed Miah and Motahir Rahman Khan's accomplice Mohammed Miah, 21, from London, was jailed for three years and two months.  Arafa Begum, from Nechells, Birmingham, was sentenced to eight months, suspended for 21 months, and ordered to do 150 hours of community service. Motahir Rahman, 24, from London, was sentenced to 10 months, suspended for 21 months, and also ordered to do 150 hours of community service."

But on Saturday afternoon, Mr Sanune had been on a trip to Lake Sirio in Chaiverano with other asylum seekers when he decided to dive into the water following a meal. Witnesses told the La Stampa newspaper that he never surfaced. His body was recovered by divers a few hours later. Silvana Perrone, head of the Isola di Ariel association which runs the migrant centre, said his death was ""absurd"". She added: ""He escaped the sea and died in this way. I'm lost for words."" The news comes as the Italian coastguard said it had rescued 668 migrants from smugglers' boats in the Mediterranean Sea off the Libyan coast. It brings the total number of rescued migrants to 13,000 people this week, officials said."

Minh Quang Pham, who was born in Vietnam, admitted three counts of terrorist activity based on his support for the group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Prosecutors said he was directed by al Qaeda to detonate a bomb in Heathrow's arrivals area. Pham denied ever intending to carry out his plot and no attack ever occurred. The 33-year-old was said to have worked as a graphic artist on al Qaeda's magazine, Inspire. The plot was said to involve setting off a bomb in Heathrow arrivals Prosecutors said he left a pregnant wife in Britain to spend several months training with the terror group in Yemen. He was detained at Heathrow on his return in 2011, with police finding items including a live round of ammunition. Pham pleaded guilty to one count of providing material support to AQAP, one count of conspiring to receive military training from AQAP, and one count of possessing and using a machine gun in furtherance of crimes of violence. During a hearing in New York he admitted making a ""terrible mistake"" that he regretted. In a letter to the judge he renounced all acts of terrorism and extremist ideology. But District Judge Alison Nathan said she believed the US government's contention that Pham planned to carry out ""a horrific suicide bombing"" at Heathrow. She said he deserved an ""exceptionally severe sentence"" after becoming a trusted asset for the terrorist group. Scotland Yard said it provided key evidence that helped put Pham, who is also known as Amin, in jail."

Greybull Capital will announce that it has finalised the takeover of the Tata Steel unit, which employs around 3,000 people at its base in Scunthorpe. Sources confirmed this weekend that a £400m financing package required to complete the deal was in place – and that it was being provided entirely by private sector institutions, meaning that a mooted Government loan of up to £100m would not be part of the deal. A statement confirming the change of ownership has been provisionally earmarked for next Wednesday, although the timetable remains subject to change, according to insiders. The business will be immediately renamed British Steel, and Greybull believes that with a union agreement on pension costs and restructured deals with major suppliers in place, it can be profitable within a year. The sale of Tata's long-products unit, which manufactures steel for use in the rail and construction industries, will come as the Indian-owned company continues to discuss the disposal of the rest of its British operations with prospective buyers. A proposal tabled this week by the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, to restructure the £15bn British Steel pension scheme has triggered fresh speculation that the company may decide to retain its 11 UK steel plants rather than offload them. The pension proposals, which would cut the benefits paid to thousands of steelworkers and have sparked controversy over the possible precedent set for other struggling companies, are subject to a four-week consultation. Several bidders remain interested in acquiring the Tata Steel UK operations, although sources suggested that reports in the Indian media that a shortlist of three suitors had been determined were wide of the mark. The initiation of an auction of its British interests by Tata Steel has plunged the Government into a major industrial crisis, with Mr Javid standing accused of ignoring the steel sector’s plight and then acting in desperation to resolve it. Labour shadow ministers met Tata Steel executives on Friday to discuss the situation, with Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, saying: ""Steel can have a bright future if we take the right decisions now. ""We'll keep the pressure up on the Tory Government to do what is necessary to save our steel."" In total, the long products business being acquired by Greybull, initially announced on 11 April, will see 4,800 workers employed by the new British Steel. The majority are based in Scunthorpe, with the rest split between two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington and a design consultancy in York along with a mill in Hayange, France."

Monica O'Connor, 28, died when a huge wave capsized their boat off the coast of the island of Koh Samui on Thursday. Her husband Tim is believed to have escaped unharmed. The Angthong Discovery Tour boat was carrying 32 tourists and four crew when it overturned after hitting rough waters and strong winds. A search operation has resumed for missing British man Jason Parnell, 46, who was celebrating his first wedding anniversary with his wife Puja when the crash happened. British man Jason Parnell, pictured with wife Puja, is still missing Mrs Parnell is also believed to have survived the crash. A German man and a woman from Hong Kong were also among the dead, according to authorities. Some passengers were thrown from the boat, while others became trapped underneath. At least one person was pulled to safety after rescuers used an axe to smash through the hull. Sanan Seekakiaw, the captain of the boat, has been taken into police custody and faces a possible charge of reckless endangerment causing death. He said he had asked all the tourists to wear a life vest, but claimed some had taken them off during the journey. Travel agent Amm Pontfuk, who works for Angthong Discovery, said the boat had not sailed in the days before the accident because of the rough conditions. ""The wind blew very, very strong and it made the boat go under the waves and flip,"" she said. A statement from the Foreign Office said: ""We are supporting the family of a British woman who has sadly died following a boat accident near Koh Samui, Thailand. ""We are also supporting the family of a British man who is missing following the same incident. ""We remain in contact with local authorities in Thailand for further information."" It is believed that other British people were also on board but they are thought to have been released from hospital following treatment."

A review of mental health services by the Children's Commissioner found nearly a quarter of a million children were referred for specialist treatment last year. But more than a quarter of those were refused, mainly on the grounds that their illness was not yet serious enough to merit help. The report found some suicidal children are being turned away from support Commissioner Anne Longfield has accused Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), the NHS body responsible for young people's mental health services, of ""playing Russian roulette"" with young lives. She also said the waiting times for accessing some services was far too long. ""We know that the longer you leave it, the more dangers there are to children,"" she told Sky News. ""If there are serious conditions - we're looking at potential suicide, psychosis, very serious conditions - then the longer you leave it, the more of a lottery you're playing with children's health."" Average waiting times ranged from 14 days in a trust in northwest England to 200 days at one in the West Midlands. An NHS England spokesman said: ""While the data in this report does not substantiate the conclusions drawn, it is clearly the case that CAMHS services need to expand and the additional £1.4bn pledged will help us to do that."" A spokesman for the Government said the new funding would help deal with the significant demand for help. ""No-one should have to wait too long for mental health care, or be sent away in need,"" the spokesman said. ""This investment is just beginning, and is creating new joined-up plans to improve care in the community and schools to make sure young people get support before they reach a crisis point."" The Commissioner's report is based on data obtained from 48 of England's 60 child and adolescent mental health service trusts."

The material allegedly depicted young girls. The charges carry up to 20 years in prison on each count. Prosecutors say Salling has agreed to turn himself in next Friday, after which he would appear in court. He has been free on bail since he was detained five months ago at his home in the Sunland neighbourhood of Los Angeles.

It was always Monday's Treasury Shock Doc on ""the immediate economic impact of leaving the EU"" that was going to contain the most hair-raising horror. Unemployment up between 500,000 and 820,000. Growth hit by 3.6% to 6%. Real incomes hit by £800 for someone on the average wage. Inflation up, food prices up as the pound slides. That is the projection of a severe Brexit shock. It is clearly spuriously precise. It suggests that the Chancellor genuinely believes that a vote to leave will cause a financial crisis short of 2008 but akin to the early 1990s. How? Because EU exit with an uncertain Article 50 negotiation will trigger global markets to notice what it has previously ignored - Britain's record current account deficit - and therefore attack the pound. This, combined with uncertainty over the policy arrangements post-Brexit, creates a fog of uncertainty that impacts household consumption and business investment. I have covered economics and politics for 17 years, and never have I seen a Prime Minister and Chancellor willing to talk about a possible sterling depreciation, let alone actually predict a 12% slide in the pound (15% in a severe shock). Never have we had the residents of Downing Street happily predicting a recession.  They have opened up a flank of attack from the Leave campaign - that their talking down of the economy will be responsible for any post-Brexit vote pause or slump in the pound and the economy. This will add to the difficulties in healing Conservative wounds on 24 June. Some senior Tories now believe the PM and Chancellor are actively damaging the economy to win their vote. The key development on Monday, though, was an omission. HM Treasury did not forecast the economic impact of the least bad (in their terms) Brexit option - the EEA or so-called ""Norwegian"" option. In theory, this makes the forecasts even scarier than otherwise. The Treasury's view is that Vote Leave's chairman, Michael Gove, has ruled out staying in the Single Market - the same EEA option - so it is not on the table. This is a direct result of Vote Leave deciding they want to quit the Single Market as well as the EU. The Leave side, meanwhile, are not actually putting up counter arguments, let alone an alternative plan and projection for the post-Brexit world. Instead, the rebuttals focus on the motives and competence of those making any Remain argument. It is a facsimile of the Scottish referendum campaign's post-truth politics. In that case Project Fear was probably proven to be far too timid, given the collapse in the oil price and likely immediate destruction of an independent Scotland's public finances, at a time of an oversized banking sector with no central bank. Now the IMF becomes the ""EU-funded"" IMF, as if David Cameron is somehow beholden to Brussels (in fact, behind closed doors they have been at each other's throats over the eurozone crisis for six years). Some 284 economists who have now signed a letter expressing similar concerns about Brexit (eight economists signed a pro-Brexit report) as the Bank of England are dismissed as the same people who supported the euro. The signing up of highly respected ex-Bank of England Governor Sir Charles Bean to describe the forecasts as ""reasonable estimates of the likely size of the short-term impact of a vote to leave"" was a major impact. The unemployment numbers, at first look, sounded rather high. Professor Bean wrote the set text on unemployment studied by thousands of economics students. Ultimately, though, it is anyone's guess what the numbers would be. What we do know is that right or wrong, the vast bulk of the economic consensus is with Remain. The point of this Treasury report is as a piece of marketing to signpost the undecided voter towards the reality of economic consensus on the EU and the Single Market. Other issues might well be more important - democracy, security, and immigration, for example. A consensus can often be wrong, too. So the Treasury has not been cautious here. But it is not wildly out of step either. There will be consequences either way come 24 June."

The child is believed to have crawled through a public barrier into the Gorilla World enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden on Saturday afternoon, and tumbled into the exhibit's moat. Zoo director Thane Maynard said the lowland gorilla - a 17-year-old male named Harambe weighing around 180kg - ""went down and got him"". Witnesses said the gorilla dragged the boy around the enclosure for around 10 minutes before the zoo's response team shot and killed the primate, local media reported. The child was taken to hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, media quoted the police as saying. The zoo's dangerous animal response team decided to shoot rather than tranquilise the gorilla because a tranquiliser would not have taken effect immediately, Mr Maynard said.

""It seemed by our own dangerous animals response team to be a life-threatening situation. They saved that little boy's life,"" Mr Maynard said. ""We are all devastated that this tragic accident resulted in the death of a critically-endangered gorilla. ""This is a huge loss for the zoo family and the gorilla population worldwide."" The zoo, which houses 11 gorillas, prides itself for its work in protecting endangered species. It has been part of successful captive breeding efforts in recent years in the effort to save the endangered Sumatran rhino. Thousands of people have taken to social media to lambast the boy's mother for not keeping a closer eye on him. One Twitter user wrote: ""So a beautiful, innocent gorilla has to die because neglectful parents can't control their kids? Mankind sucks :( #Harambe #CincinnatiZoo""."

The victims were at Parc Monceau in the northwest of the city when the thunderstorm struck. They had tried to take shelter under a tree, but were hit by lightning.

Fire service spokesman Eric Moulin said an off-duty fire officer ran to the scene after the lightning struck, administering first aid, including heart massage, and helping direct rescuers to the area. ""Without his help in those initial moments the situation would have been much worse,"" Mr Moulin said, adding that it was a timely reminder of the need to know first aid. Jean-Louis Laurens, who lives near Parc Monceau, said it was rather rare to see such a storm hitting the French capital. He described the weather event as ""dramatic"". The torrential rain also interrupted play at the French Open."
