2016-03-06,Chancellor George Osborne is facing a rebellion in his own party over plans to relax Sunday trading laws.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160307044055/http://news.sky.com/story/1654269/osborne-faces-revolt-over-sunday-trading-hours,"Chancellor George Osborne is facing a rebellion in his own party over plans to relax Sunday trading laws. David Burrowes, the Conservative MP for Enfield Southgate, claims dozens of ministers and parliamentary private secretaries (PPSs) are prepared to join the revolt or abstain unless the Government waters down the plans. ""There are 23 Conservatives who have signed up to stop the Government's plan to deregulate Sunday trading for large shops and more lined up to oppose or abstain including ministers and PPSs,"" he said. ""Government should recognise the strength of opposition for a plan that was not in our manifesto and should at least agree a compromise which restricts deregulation to tourist zones."" Mr Osborne announced plans to give local authorities the power to extend Sunday opening hours in his first Budget after being returned to office last year. But he faces a potential defeat over the plans just a week before his next Budget statement. The Government has a working majority of 17 so is vulnerable to any rebellion if opposition MPs unite against it. Labour's leadership has urged the SNP, the third biggest party in the Commons, not to back the plans. The SNP originally opposed the legislation, but it has since welcomed additional protections for employees brought forward by the UK Government. Jeremy Corbyn and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale have written a joint letter calling on First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon to rule out her 54 MPs supporting the move. In the letter, Mr Corbyn and Ms Dugdale said Labour was ""strongly opposed"" to the Bill, which would ""lead to the gradual erosion and diminution of workers' pay and rights across the UK"". The Sunday Telegraph reported that at least two ministers were considering whether to quit in order to vote against the Sunday trading extension."

The Airlander 10 is a cross between an airship and an aeroplane. It generates lift aerostatically through being filled with helium, and aerodynamically thanks to its unique-looking wing shape. Because it's heavier than air, the 20-ton craft can land without tethers on most surfaces, including water. Hybrid Air Vehicles, the makers of the Airlander 10 and based in Bedford, anticipate commercial uses such as leisure cruises, persistent, airbone research and for cargo to hard-to-reach places. The Airlander 10 is a cross between an airship and an aeroplane It can carry up to 10 tons and could be fitted to transport 48 passengers, flying for five days continuously, cruising at 80 knots (92mph). The Airlander 10 was originally developed from 2009 for the US Army, which abandoned the project. Hybrid Air Vehicles has plans for a 50-ton version of the Airlander. Company spokesman Chris Daniels told Sky News: ""It's not an airship. It's a mix between an aeroplane, an airship with a bit of helicopter thrown in. ""It uses the latest materials, it's got the latest fly-by-night technology, avionics and computer software. ""It's very much an aircraft for the 21st century."" But aviation expert David Learmount questioned whether there will be a big demand for it. He told Sky News: ""We are not talking about a mass market products here. ""We're talking about something highly specialist. It will be very useful for those who need it. ""But the number of companies and organisations that are going to need something as specialist as this is not large in number."""

Louis Pedro Verdasca dos Santos Costa was remanded in custody after being charged with three offences, including unlawfully being on an aircraft. The 38-year-old is accused of breaching security on the Heathrow perimeter before gaining access to the BA engineering base at Hatton Cross on Saturday. He was spotted climbing into the cabin of an empty Boeing 747 aircraft, before fleeing to the flight deck and locking himself behind the high-security cockpit doors, it is claimed. After struggling to breach the bomb and bulletproof doors, fire brigade officers were eventually able to break into the cockpit. A source, who asked not to be named, said: ""It was a very difficult and complex situation and in the end the fire brigade had to be called to the plane and carried out a long and very protracted operation to get into the cockpit from outside. ""It is a terrifying situation when you think about it. Here is a man who not only has managed to go air-side at one of the world's busiest airports but he has successfully got to a Boeing 747 jet liner and found it open and was able to climb aboard. ""Then he has got onto the flight deck and barricaded himself in using the plane's own anti-terrorist equipment."" Police confirmed there was an incident at Heathrow on a stationary aircraft, and said it is not believed to be terror-related. British Airways said it had no comment to make on the incident ""as a man has been charged and will be appearing in court"". A statement issued by Heathrow Airport said: ""Safety and security are always our main priority and we take incidents involving either very seriously indeed. ""Individuals illegally entering the air-side environment potentially endanger their own lives and those of others. We are working with the police following an incident on Saturday. ""We keep security under constant review."""

Mr Robertson has been described as around 5ft 10in tall, with a medium build and short grey hair. He wears glasses and may have been carrying a large rucksack. Rescue teams are conducting air and ground searches in an attempt to find him. More than 80 volunteers, along with specialist search officers, rescue dogs and an HM Coastguard helicopter are being used in the search. Anybody with information is urged to contact Cathcart Police Office on 101."

The cause of death was congestive heart failure, according to a statement from her office. She will be buried at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, next to her husband, former US President Ronald Reagan. He died in June 2004. The former B movie actress married Reagan in 1952 when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild. Nancy Reagan: President's Guardian And Soulmate Nancy Reagan was one of my heroes. She served as First Lady with unbelievable power, class and grace and left her mark on the world. (1/2) She was California's first lady from 1967-75 while her husband was governor of the state and US first lady from 1981-89. They had two children together, Patti and Ron. During her time in the White House, she led the ""Just Say No"" anti-drugs campaign. She was fiercely protective of her husband and became even more so following the assassination attempt against him outside a Hilton hotel in Washington DC in 1981. Her consultations with an astrologer, who recommended which days were best for him to leave the White House, influenced the US president's schedule. Her star-gazing led to clashes with her husband's chief of staff, Donald Regan, and a power struggle that ended with the latter's resignation. She was also criticised for spending too much during her time in the White House, including on fine china. Mrs Reagan was devoted to her husband and cared for him during his nearly decade-long battle with Alzheimer's. She broke with fellow Republicans in recent years to back stem cell research as a way to search for a cure for the disease. Gallery: Nancy Reagan: A Life In Pictures As Nancy Davis, Reagan appeared in 11 feature films. In 1950, she appeared in The Next Voice You Hear, directed by William Wellman for MGM, with James Whitmore and Gary Gray. President Barack Obama sent his condolences to Mrs Reagan's family, adding it was ""prayerful that she and her beloved husband are together again"". Former President Jimmy Carter also paid tribute to the woman whose husband ousted him from the White House. He said: ""President Reagan has been reunited with his wife and partner but America and the Reagan family have lost a woman of grace and strength."""
2016-03-06,"There are plans to make the UK the ""most dementia-friendly"" society in the world by 2020.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160307044055/http://news.sky.com/story/1654223/dementia-shake-up-health-checks-for-over-40s,"By Rebecca Williams, Sky News Reporter There are plans to make the UK the ""most dementia-friendly"" society in the world by 2020. The Government has outlined a number of commitments, aimed at raising awareness and improving diagnosis rates, including: • Introducing an Ofsted-style ratings system for diagnosis and quality of care across the country. • Carrying out mental health checks with people aged 40 and older, rather than with people over 65 as is currently done. • Aiming to get 10% of people diagnosed with dementia involved in research. Dementia affects 850,000 people in the UK, resulting in the loss of brain cells.  Paul Seymour was diagnosed at the age of 54 after realising he couldn't remember his granddaughter's name. Paul Seymour's family says his condition deteriorates each month He told Sky News: ""She ran into my arms shouting: 'Pappi, Pappi' and my mind went blank. I burst into tears. I think everyone had a cry. I said to my wife, Tracey: 'Something's not right and I don't know what it is'."" With a mortgage to pay, Mr Seymour is still working, but his family say his condition deteriorates each month. They don’t believe the Government's plans offer enough support for people who, like him, are diagnosed at a young age. They insist all the help is instead aimed at the elderly.  There are a number of care homes in the UK that specialise in dementia care. At Blossom Fields nursing home in Bristol they have a ""memory lane"", a full-sized model of a 1950s street. There is a post office, a pub and a grocery store. The aim is to encourage residents to reminisce about their past. The Government has invested many millions of pounds in dementia care and research in recent years. However, some feel more is needed if the latest targets are to be achieved. Professor Nigel Hooper from Alzheimer’s Research UK said: ""We welcomed the previous announcements, particularly the announcement of the Dementia Research Institute, but we still have a long way to go. ""We still have a lot of hurdles to tackle. We still need more funding to get us to where we want to be in 2020."""
2016-03-06,John Longworth's declaration of war against his former employers is a spectacular coup for the Leave campaign in the EU referendum battle.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160307044055/http://news.sky.com/story/1654682/bcc-chiefs-departure-is-coup-for-leave-camp,"John Longworth's declaration of war against his former employers is a spectacular coup for the Leave campaign in the EU referendum battle. But it will dismay the Remain campaign, for whom the whole soap opera of his suspension and allegations of gagging and bullying have been a public relations disaster. Mr Longworth is gagged no longer. At the very moment the BCC announced his resignation, he told Sky News he had quit because he wants to be ""free to be able to express my own views"". No doubt we won't have to wait long for a blockbuster attack on Brussels, perhaps flanked by his two Leave campaign cheerleaders, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox. No doubt few people outside the business world had heard of Mr Longworth before this row blew up. They have now! It all began on Thursday when he defied his BCC bosses, who are determined to stay resolutely neutral, by declaring in a Sky News interview that Britain would be better off outside the EU. That provocative statement triggered an emergency board meeting on Friday at which the BCC's president, Nora Senior, instigated his suspension and then wrote to members informing them. Over the weekend, the outspoken London mayor backed claims that Downing Street or someone in government had bullied the BCC into the suspension. It was ""absolutely scandalous"", said Mr Johnson, who claimed Mr Longworth had been ""crushed by the agents of Project Fear"", a claim emphatically denied by No 10. The BCC intends to remain neutral, and emphasised that it is a ""non-partisan organisation"" in the statement announcing his departure. Ms Senior also said ""no politician or interest group"" had any influence on Mr Longworth's suspension. She didn't include civil servants or Whitehall special advisers in her denial, though. Mr Longworth will have known about the neutrality of his employers. Did he deliberately provoke his own exit? Only he knows. But he will certainly feel liberated now, and Remain campaigners will be jubilant."

The weapons haul was uncovered in Carnfunnock Country Park, in County Antrim, after police were alerted on Saturday afternoon. Officers found several small plastic barrels buried in a wooded area of the park. Police say the items will be subjected to a 'detailed forensic analysis' Police say they contained bomb-making components, including partially-constructed devices and a small quantity of explosives. The find comes after a prison officer was wounded when a car bomb exploded under his van in east Belfast on Friday. Detectives investigating the attack have arrested three men and one woman, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Detective Chief Inspector Gillian Kearney said the items found on Sunday will be ""subjected to a detailed forensic examination"". ""Until this has been completed, it is too early to link these items to any particular grouping, but we are following a number of lines of inquiry,"" she said. ""I would ask the public to remain vigilant, wherever they are and whatever they are doing. If people report suspicious activity to police, we will act on it to keep people safe. ""We apologise that the park will remain closed for some time while a full clearance operation is carried out, but I hope people will understand the need to put public safety first."" Sky's Ireland Correspondent David Blevins said the discovery came after police mounted a ""major security operation"". ""They have now confirmed that when they went searching they found a number of small barrels containing partially constructed bombs, other bomb making components and explosives,"" he said. ""They are describing it as a terrorist hide. So it's a success for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. ""There has been a wave of security alerts over the last three days: a couple in west Belfast yesterday, and of course this follows Friday morning's attempted murder of a prison officer when a booby trap bomb partially exploded under his van in east Belfast, causing him serious leg injuries."" Police have warned the public that dissidents are planning acts of violence in the run-up to the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Dublin. The chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, Mark Lindsay, said: ""There are murderous republican gangs who think the best way to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising is to visit misery on the family of a police officer and society. ""They are aggressively targeting officers, prison officers and soldiers in a worrying escalation. For them, success is measured in casualty numbers and anguish. ""Their cause is worthless and pointless. They are a throwback in time, relying on out-dated rhetoric in their attempts to justify everything this entire community doesn't want."""
2016-03-06,An Iranian billionaire tycoon has been sentenced to death after being convicted of corruption.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160307044055/http://news.sky.com/story/1654513/billionaire-tycoon-sentenced-to-death,"An Iranian billionaire tycoon has been sentenced to death after being convicted of corruption. Babak Zanjani, 41, was accused of fraudulently pocketing $2.8bn (£2bn) after a months-long trial which in a rare move was held in public. Prosecutors claim he owed the money to Iran's government from oil sold on behalf of the oil ministry. Zanjani, who denied any wrongdoing, insisted the only reason the money had not been paid was that sanctions had prevented a transfer. By his own admission, Zanjani arranged billions of dollars of oil deals for years through a network of companies in countries such as Turkey, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. The defendant, whose fortune is estimated at $10bn-$14bn (£7bn-£9.8bn), was convicted of fraud and economic crimes, while two associates were also found guilty of ""corruption on earth"". Iranian President Hassan Rouhani That is the most serious offence under the country's criminal code, meaning they too will face the death penalty - but all three can appeal against the verdicts. During the rule of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Zanjani found ways to channel hard currency to Tehran. This was despite financial sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic's banks as punishment for its nuclear programme. Zanjani, who was arrested in 2013, said he was tasked with circumventing sanctions to get money back to Iran in return for commissions paid by Mr Ahmadinejad's government. The administration of President Hassan Rouhani has alleged that corruption and the payment of illegal commissions thrived under Mr Ahmadinejad's rule. In January, a nuclear deal was agreed between Iran and Western powers which paved the way for more foreign trade in the country's oil sector. Mr Rouhani's oil minister Bijan Zanganeh urged investors to deal directly with his ministry and avoid third parties."

Hackers have infected a number of Macs with ""KeRanger"" malware which demands owners pay one bitcoin (about £280) for their files to be unencrypted. Users began unwittingly downloading the malicious programme as they tried to install popular software called Transmission, which is used to transfer data on BitTorrent. The ""ransomware"" stays quiet for three days after infecting each computer - and then starts to make documents, photographs, videos and other precious files inaccessible. Cyber security experts believe the ""KeRanger"" virus was loaded onto the Transmission website on Friday - meaning affected Apple users could start receiving ransom demands from Monday unless they immediately install an updated version of the software. Ryan Olson from Palo Alto Networks, which uncovered the threat, told the Reuters news agency: ""This is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom."" An Apple spokesperson has said the technology giant has also taken steps to prevent further infections, by revoking a digital certificate which had enabled the ransomware to be installed onto Macs in the first place. Ransomware has long been known to target users of Microsoft Windows, often generating hundreds of millions of pounds a year in revenue for cyber criminals."

Stephen was 15 when he was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2010. He died four years later in May 2014, after his ""bucket list"" campaign went viral, and overwhelming public support raised millions of pounds for the charity.

Mrs Sutton has also taken up the mantle of updating Stephen's original campaign page on Facebook, Stephen's Story. ""I didn't use social media prior to Stephen passing away. If I wanted to contact a friend, I'd pick up the phone or text them. But the reaction to Stephen's passing was astonishing and so positive, so I felt compelled to continue his blog.""

At the start of the trial he pleaded guilty to two of the child sex charges - and was promptly sacked by his Premier League club Sunderland, his £60,000 weekly wages immediately stopped. The 28-year-old later told jurors his glittering career was finished and it was all his fault. He also had to listen to his partner Stacey Flounders, the mother of his baby daughter, tell the court she had initially stood by him, but from now on they would remain just friends. She said Johnson had originally told her the girl was 16, but later confessed she was 15, below the legal age of consent. He also cheated on her with ""quite a few"" other women, she said. Johnson admitted grooming the girl for sex and kissing her passionately in his black Range Rover after parking it in a remote spot between their homes. He denied two counts of sexual activity with a child - a jury acquitted him of one charge but found him guilty of the other. The player said he had hoped the encounter would go further and had urged her to ""be more forward"" in messages they exchanged on social media. But the 28-year-old insisted it stopped at the kiss because he knew it was wrong and he was thinking of his family. The girl, a fan who idolised Johnson, claimed he went further, touched her intimately and engaged in a sex act with her. She had felt compelled to go along with it. They accused each other of lying about what had happened during the meeting on 30 January last year. Prosecutor Kate Blackwell QC said Johnson had been brought down by ""sexual desire, excessive arrogance and an unwarranted level of expectation"". She said it was a classic case of grooming, grooming in its purest form. She said: ""He has abused his revered position in society ... and acted in a way he knew was both legally and morally wrong."" Johnson met the girl when she was still 14. She was one of several fans who hung around the ground after matches hoping to see or chat to him. When she invited him to be her friend on Facebook he accepted and they began exchanging messages. In a first meeting in his car he gave her two signed football shirts and they chatted and listened to the radio. But he later got her to agree to the second meeting after telling her ""you owe me"" and asking for ""a thank-you kiss and more."" Even Johnson's own barrister Orlando Pownall described the player's behaviour as ""reprehensible"" and accepted the prosecution case was ""very strong on moral grounds"". But, he said, the girl had admitted telling lies, asking her friends to keep details from the police and accepted she was an attention seeker who was prone to exaggeration. During the trial Sunderland officials were criticised for allowing Johnson to carry on playing for 10 months after he said he told them he had admitted kissing the schoolgirl. They sacked him only after he formally pleaded guilty to two charges on the eve of the trial last month. During that time he earned just under £3m and helped the club avoid relegation. However, after the verdict Sunderland said the suggestion the club knew Johnson intended to change his plea just before the start of the trial so he could continue playing was ""utterly without foundation"". ""The club never placed any pressure or demands on Mr Johnson to play football during this process,"" they said in a statement. ""Decisions in relation to the pleas and the conduct of the trial have been left entirely to Mr Johnson and his highly experienced and skilled legal team. Mr Johnson has admitted in evidence that he changed his plea 'on legal advice'. ""The club only became aware of the change of plea, in relation to two of the four counts on the indictment, on the first day of the trial, after hearing it reported through the media. ""The club was not advised in advance that Mr Johnson would plead guilty to any offence. ""Had the club known that Mr Johnson intended to plead guilty to any of these charges, then his employment would have been terminated immediately. ""Indeed, upon learning of the guilty plea on 11 February 2016, the club acted quickly and decisively in terminating Adam Johnson’s contract without notice."""

The singer, famous for her hits Tik Tok, Die Young and Timber, choked up as she was honoured for her stance against harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth. The pop singer last month lost the first round of her legal action to be freed from her contract with hitmaker Dr Luke. He denies her claims and says she is smearing him to get out of her contract. ""As many of you know I am going through some personal things that have been really intense and hard lately and I just want to say thank you for the support I have received,"" Kesha told the audience at the Human Rights Campaign Nashville in her hometown on Saturday. Dr Luke has said all the allegations are 'completely untrue' The singer, who was born Kesha Rose Sebert, stepped away from the microphone to compose herself, prompting the audience to cheer her on. Making a sworn statement in August, Kesha said the producer, born Lukasz Gottwald, raped her a decade ago after giving her a pill that rendered her unconscious. She says he forced her to ""take drugs and alcohol in order to take advantage of her sexually while she was intoxicated"" and bullied her to lose weight. Dr Luke's attorneys point out that Kesha said he ""never made sexual advances at me"" during sworn questioning in another lawsuit in 2011. Her legal team says she was too afraid to speak out. A number of celebrities have voiced support for Kesha, including Lady Gaga, Adele and Taylor Swift, who gave $250,000 for her legal fees."

There were violent clashes involving supporters from the two teams ahead of the North London derby on Saturday afternoon. Tensions were higher than usual ahead of the game - which ended 2-2 - as both sides are involved in the Premier League title race. One fan could be seen with blood streaming down his face, while mobile phone footage shows mounted police surrounded by rowdy fans throwing cans. Oliver Barr, 23, a Fulham fan at the game, said some Tottenham fans had lined the road between the south stand of White Hart Lane, which seats the away fans, and High Road, as well as the route taken by police escorting Arsenal fans.

""After regaining some degree of control, the police managed to gather all of the away fans into a double-layered cordon of officers outside of the away end but you could clearly see coins and other objects being thrown between the two sets of fans as mounted officers encouraged Spurs fans to move to their seats."" The Metropolitan Police said four men had been charged: Hakan Gulesin, 26, from Hackney, with a public order offence before the game; George Davies, 22, from Page Hill, Herts, with criminal damage during the match; Michael Tyrrell, 30, from Doncaster, with criminal damage during the match; and Mason D'Vaz, 21, of Waltham Forest, with a public order offence related to throwing a coin before the match. All four will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 21 March. Another man, 61, was arrested after the match for being drunk and disorderly, and was given a fixed penalty notice, police said. It comes after 10 fans were arrested when the sides met in the Capital One Cup in September after Arsenal fans ripped off hoardings and smashed seats in the away end."

Residents were evacuated from their homes in the Gelvin Gardens area of the city of Derry, in Londonderry, as the device was made safe. It is believed to be a pipe bomb, according to the Derry Now news website.  Detective Sergeant Brian Reid said the device, discovered at around 5pm on Sunday, was seized for forensic examination. A day earlier, explosives and bomb-making equipment were discovered in Carnfunnock Country Park, in County Antrim, after a report from the member of the public. The weapons haul was found in Carnfunnock Country Park, County Antrim Officers found several small plastic barrels buried in a wooded area of the park containing bomb-making components, including partially constructed devices and a small quantity of explosives. Detective Chief Inspector Gillian Kearney said the items would be ""subjected to a detailed forensic examination"". ""Until this has been completed, it is too early to link these items to any particular grouping, but we are following a number of lines of inquiry,"" she said. Both finds come after a prison officer was wounded when a bomb exploded under his van in east Belfast on Friday. Three men and a woman have been arrested over the attack, for which a group calling itself the New IRA has reportedly claimed responsibility. In a statement to the BBC the dissident republican group said the 52-year-old officer was targeted because he was involved in training other guards at HMP Maghaberry, near Lisburn. The married father of three was said to be one of a number on a list of potential targets and the attack arose from a dispute over the treatment of dissident republican inmates. Police have warned the public that dissidents are planning acts of violence in the run-up to the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland."

The London Mayor said the route will be the longest substantially segregated bike route in a European city. When it opens on 30 April cyclists will be able to travel from Westminster to Blackfriars, the City, Tower Hill, Canary Wharf and Barking - just under 12 miles - on either tracks separated from vehicles or on low-traffic streets. To mark the announcement, Mr Johnson released figures showing a 73% increase in the number of cyclists in Vauxhall, central London, since a superhighway opened in November. :: Boris Gets Special Salute On Cycle Highway Mr Johnson said the new superhighway will be 'magnificent' He said that journey times for motor vehicles on all but one of the six main roads into Vauxhall are back to what they were before the construction work - or are quicker. Mr Johnson visited Victoria Embankment to check on the progress of the latest superhighway, which has been called ""Crossrail for Bikes"" after the under-construction rail route which will also stretch across the capital. He said: ""In 2013 I stood on this very spot on the Embankment and promised that we would soon behold a magnificent cycle superhighway. ""Many doubted it would ever get beyond the artist's impression. A noisy minority fought hard to stop it happening. ""But in opinion polls and public consultations, large majorities of ordinary Londoners, most of them not cyclists, said they wanted this project and what it represents for a cleaner, safer, greener city. TfL figures show cycling in London is up by 10% in the last year ""I apologise to motorists temporarily inconvenienced by the construction works on the Embankment, and I thank them for their patience in putting up with it - but the end is now in sight. ""I am immensely encouraged by the evidence from Vauxhall showing that now the scheme there is finished, the flow of traffic in the area is also returning to normal."" The Vauxhall superhighway is made up of a two-way protected cycle track across Vauxhall Bridge and through Vauxhall Cross gyratory. Transport for London (TfL) research found that 3,394 cyclists a day are using Vauxhall Bridge during the morning and evening peak periods (7-10am and 4-7pm), compared to 1,967 in February 2015. TfL said that the general rise in London cycling over the same period was 10%."

Three other hostages managed to escape unhurt after a six-hour stand-off which started when 33-year-old Wayne Williams, who belonged to the Finks outlaw motorcycle club, shot three men at a sign-making business on the outksirts of Sydney on Monday morning. The 43-year-old was killed and his two brothers injured in the shooting Mick Bassal, 43, died at the scene and his two brothers were wounded - one seriously - when Williams opened fire. Both injured men were taken to hospital where one underwent surgery. The pair are said to be in a stable condition. Heavily armed officers surrounded the premises in an industrial area of Ingleburn, a suburb 25 miles southwest of Sydney, after reports of gunfire. Workers at nearby businesses were told to stay inside and roads were blocked off in the area. Police negotiators were brought in to try to end the siege. But shortly after 5pm armed officers entered the building and found three people hiding. Heavily armed police had surrounded the premises During their search the police found Williams' body. He is thought to have shot himself. Announcing the end of the siege, Detective Inspector Mark Brett, of New South Wales Police, said: ""The matter has been resolved. ""Shortly after 5pm today specialist police entered the unit where they located three persons hiding in that unit. ""A further search of the unit located a male deceased. ""It's believed the person died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound."" The case has now been handed over to the murder squad."

The Government believes the legislation, which comes into force in England on 6 April, could save councils and charities up to £33m a year. Owners who have failed to microchip their pets beyond this date will be guilty of a criminal offence and could face a fine of £500. Animal welfare minister George Eustice said the policy will ""also help to tackle the growing problem of strays roaming the streets"". According to DEFRA, more than 102,000 stray or stolen dogs are picked up on the streets every year - placing a burden on local authorities. Christopher Barnard, from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, told Sky News: ""There'll be a much quicker turnover of dogs in our care, and it will help us locate the owners of dogs that usually, if they weren't microchipped, we wouldn't be able to find."" Microchipping technology helped them reunite 542 lost dogs with their owners in 2015, the charity says. The procedure for microchipping, which involves injecting a rice grain-sized chip into the back of a dog's neck, is quick and cheap - costing as little as £10. Since the law was announced in 2013, some animal shelters and charities have been offering the service for free to those who need it. Dogs Trust, which took care of more than 47,000 unclaimed and unwanted dogs nationwide in 2015, has described microchipping as a ""small but essential piece of technology"" - and said it was vital that the national database is kept up to date."

2016-03-07,Is your favourite football team playing badly? It could be due to poor air quality.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160308015555/http://news.sky.com/story/1654975/study-links-football-performance-to-air-quality,"Is your favourite football team playing badly? It could be due to poor air quality. German scientists have cross-referenced the form of top-flight footballers with air quality from outside each stadium in the country. They found that for each 1% increase in air pollution molecule concentration, the number of passes made by each player in a game decreased by an average of 0.2%. The negative effects of pollution also seem to increase with age, most noticeably affecting players aged 30 and over. Defenders and midfielders are the positions most likely to be affected, as they are ""more attached to the game and exert a larger number of passes"", the researchers said. Researchers said the conclusions were drawn from an in-depth study of almost 3,000 matches, across 32 different stadiums, over a 12-year period. The team from the Institute for the Study of Labour in Bonn said the findings show that pollution has a wide affect on society. They said that high pollution levels are likely to be particularly harmful to those in low-skilled manual jobs. Their report said: ""Our analysis highlights that economic consequences of environmental pollution are not limited to adverse impacts on population health. ""Even moderate concentrations of particulate matter commonly experienced in developed countries negatively affect the productivity of a selective group of professional soccer players, young and male athletes, to a considerable extent. ""Our findings hence complement previous empirical evidence on air pollution’s negative effects on the productivity of low-skilled agricultural and factory workers in countries with higher levels of pollution."" The team said air pollution costs the EU between £46bn and £154bn each year. Their findings have been published in a report due to be presented to the Royal Economic Society's annual conference in Brighton later this month."

""They’re just playing games"" is one former Admiral’s take on it. In defence of NATO, several European countries asked for help with the migration crisis, and it has responded. Ever since, the EU has grasped onto it, to the detriment of any other plan.  Médecins Sans Frontières - one of the larger aid organisations operating in the region - has reacted dismissively. ""This is a humanitarian crisis, but again we see a military response which has shamefully so far been the only serious response from Europe, NATO or the British government,"" it said.  Arguably, even this criticism falls short of the truth. A military response can offer much, but only if it is done right and not relied upon as the magic solution.  Six naval ships, covering thousands of miles of coast, will have some effect but it will be limited.  In a bizarre jerk of the knee, the maritime group has officially begun operations before the rules of engagement have been finalised. What happens if a ship intercepts and rescues a migrant boat? Does it take them on to Greece or back to Turkey? And then what? If the EU wants to implement a serious military response, then here is what it should do: The operational command, currently based at Northwood on the edge of London, should relocate to Izmir - a major NATO base on the Turkish coast and crucially, inside the area of operations. Thousands of NATO troops should be deployed to the source of the problem: the Turkish coastline. This would need Turkey’s blessing and co-operation, but as a fellow NATO member, why should that be impossible to come by? Deployed in large numbers, the soldiers could then patrol the Turkish coast, as a visible and close deterrent. Their task: to smash the smuggling rings through intelligence gathered from the sea and air. They must be given the power to arrest and detain suspects. At sea, the six NATO vessels should be bolstered immediately by other member states. From Samothrace in the north, to Rhodes in the south, there are at least 12 Greek islands of significant size close to Turkey. Even a doubling of the current deployment would only allow for one ship to be assigned to each of those islands.  The air component must be enhanced too. Airports on the Greek islands of Lesbos and Lemnos and at Izmir should be brought into play. Surveillance drones and intelligence-gathering aircraft, doing such important work in the skies above Iraq, Syria and Libya, would bring invaluable oversight to this arena. There are enough assets elsewhere in the system to avoid any need to draw on resources currently directed at anti-IS operations.  This is just one part of a bigger plan. Equal attention must be given to the humanitarian response. Efforts must be mirrored on that front. The military focus should be the criminal gangs; the aid focus on the migrants. On all my visits to Lesbos, I have seen no sign of EU management. The work being done by the agencies shouldn’t be underestimated - last year they were overwhelmed; this year, and it is still early days, they seem to be better organised and ready. But I have never seen anything to suggest the EU is leading from the front. That must change. The work of the charities is vital, and their expertise must be taken advantage of at every stage, but the EU needs to take this problem by the scruff of the neck and lead from the front - on the ground, in Greece, not from Brussels. Safe, clean camps must be established across Greece and Turkey. I would suggest many small ones rather than a few large ones - more manageable, less likely to get out of control. Does this all sound rather dramatic? Maybe. But the window of good weather is coming and it is brief – seven months maybe. Last summer can be explained away as an unexpected crisis. No such excuses can be offered this time around. Hit it hard and hit it properly."

Hackers have infected a number of Macs with ""KeRanger"" malware which demands owners pay one bitcoin (about £280) for their files to be unencrypted. Users began unwittingly downloading the malicious programme as they tried to install popular software called Transmission, which is used to transfer data on BitTorrent. The ""ransomware"" stays quiet for three days after infecting each computer - and then starts to make documents, photographs, videos and other precious files inaccessible. Cyber security experts believe the ""KeRanger"" virus was loaded onto the Transmission website on Friday - meaning affected Apple users could start receiving ransom demands from Monday unless they immediately install an updated version of the software. Ryan Olson from Palo Alto Networks, which uncovered the threat, told the Reuters news agency: ""This is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom."" An Apple spokesperson has said the technology giant has also taken steps to prevent further infections, by revoking a digital certificate which had enabled the ransomware to be installed onto Macs in the first place. Ransomware has long been known to target users of Microsoft Windows, often generating hundreds of millions of pounds a year in revenue for cyber criminals."

John Longworth's comments suggest he believes Downing Street could have pressured the BCC to suspend him after he made comments in support of the UK leaving the EU during an interview on Sky. Mr Longworth announced he had resigned from his role on Sunday after claims that Number 10 had nobbled the organisation's board to force him out. A Number 10 spokeswoman admitted there had been a conversation between an official and the business group but refused to give a ""blow-by-blow"" account of discussions and denied there was any pressure for Mr Longworth to be suspended. :: BCC Chief's Departure Is Coup For Leave Camp Speaking to Sky News, Mr Longworth disclosed that Government departments regularly tried to put pressure on business leaders. He said: ""What I can say is, of course, that Government departments, including Number 10, from my experience, actually contact business representatives all the time and express their views, sometimes very strong views and strident views. ""But I have to say in my experience it has never affected my judgement. I have always represented business views without fear or favour."" He said he would certainly consider joining the Leave campaign and added: ""I am certainly going to speak out on the issue because that is the very reason I have resigned."" Meanwhile, a Sky Data poll has shown that 60% of people think the Remain campaign is using more scaremongering techniques - 40% think Leave is. It also suggested 52% of the 1,478 people asked though the tactic was ineffective, with just 48% saying it was effective. :: Everything You Wanted To Know About The EU Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Sky News earlier that claims that Downing Street put pressure on the BCC were a conspiracy theory. ""People who want to leave Europe, to vote no in the referendum, are seeing conspiracy theories everywhere now because they don't want to answer the basic question, which is, if you leave Europe where are you going? ""They have to start answering these questions instead of coming up with rather bizarre conspiracy theories that here the British Chambers of Commerce have flatly denied,"" he said. :: So What If We Did Leave The EU? Mr Longworth was suspended for speaking out in support of Brexit because it did not reflect the group's view - the majority are in favour of remaining in the EU and the organisation was to remain neutral. The business group has denied being influenced by politicians or interest groups. A BCC spokesman said Mr Longworth has accepted that his sympathy for the Out campaign was ""likely to create confusion"" over the group's official stance. :: Team In And Team Out First the BCC comes under pressure to dump John Longworth. The it comes under pressure to say that it didn't come under pressure. Boris Johnson had described the BCC's decision to suspend Mr Longworth as ""absolutely scandalous"" and said he had been ""crushed by the agents of Project Fear"". Speaking to Sky News on Monday he said: ""I think it's very sad that somebody like John Longworth, who has given a lot of time, a lot of thought to the needs of British business and industry should be basically pushed out for saying what he thinks."" Leader of the House of Commons Chris Grayling, who is part of the Vote Leave campaign, told Sky News: ""The fact that a prominent business figure has stood up and said 'I believe Britain should leave the EU' is a view we should be listening to and certainly the way the BCC has approached this in terms of just forcing him out has been wholly unacceptable and in my view has brought that organisation into some degree of disrepute.""  UKIP MP Douglas Carswell tweeted: ""Well done Downing Street. You got your man. This is what Project Fear looks like. Nasty people in Number 10."""

The initiative, which is costing the taxpayer almost £3.5m, urges people to eat better, exercise more and to shed the pounds. Dawn Walker, 51, has already made a number of lifestyle changes. A few years ago, she started going to the gym to lose weight. She told Sky News: ""For me I wanted to keep fit, I didn't want to have a gradual deterioration in my health and fitness levels and get overweight. So looking ahead to when I am older, I just feel if I am fit well, I will keep being fit."" Evidence suggests living healthily in midlife can double your chances of being healthy over the age of 70. The NHS spends more than £11bn each year treating illnesses caused by smoking, poor diets and inactivity. TV and online adverts are part of the latest initiative, called One You. One You app There is also a new online quiz offering guidance. Those taking part are asked if they drink, if they smoke and whether they feel ""flabby or fat"". Recommendations are then made, such as joining a slimming club or downloading an app to monitor the amount of exercise you do.  Professor Kevin Fenton at Public Health England said: ""Many adults say we know what we should be doing, but we are busy looking after our children, our parents, and are busy at work so the campaign provides online tools to make better choices.""

Kate Andrews from the Institute of Economic Affairs told Sky News: ""If you're going to spend £3m of public money, you have to have a good reason for doing so, and promoting lifestyle habits to those who have been making their own decisions for decades doesn't seem like a very good use of that money."" As part of the campaign, the supermarket ASDA is providing a free blood pressure check service at its stores and in-store pharmacies."

Everything plays into that decision: every meeting, every statement and every speech. So when the PM strode into the Brussels summit this morning to talk to other Leaders about the migration crisis, he quickly turned his answer to talk about Britain having ""the best of both worlds"". What he means is that he can come to the table and outright reject EU proposals for the UK's involvement in plans for sharing out refugees. Anything that might sway that pen towards the Leave box must be quickly snuffed out. :: PM Push For Migrants To Be Sent Back To Turkey EU state Migrant quotas There is ""no prospect"" of Britain joining a common European Union asylum system he told reporters. ""We have an absolutely rock-solid opt-out from these things,"" he said. He talked about the UK's ""special status"". The other EU leaders also worry about impacting the UK vote, but with 3,000 migrants a day arriving on Greece's shores, they have bigger worries and they can delay no more. What's been described as a ""humanitarian crisis"" is intensifying on the Greek/Macedonian border where 14,000 migrants, many genuine refugees, are experiencing the worst of both worlds: the horror of fleeing war in Syria and the squalor of Europe's makeshift camps and barbed-wire fences. A report in the Financial Times suggests the European Commission is preparing proposals to centralise the asylum system so that the EU can give member states quotas of migrants to alleviate the pressure on Mediterranean countries, in particular Greece. :: Everything You Wanted To Know About The EU However, if the EU pressed ahead with this it would be seen by Eurosceptics as another sovereignty grab – another sign the club is pulling together. Mr Cameron doesn't want to give the Leave camp material for its own ""Project Fear"". Indeed, as the PM suggests, the UK has an ""opt-out"" from any new system to control immigration and he is well aware the UK is not the only nation opposed to the quota idea, but the EU could apply other pressures. The Commission is also currently exploring changes to the ""Dublin Regulation"". :: What If The UK Quits The EU? This agreement ensures that refugees have to claim asylum in the first EU country they step foot in and can be deported back there. The UK has transferred 12,000 asylum seekers back to other EU countries under this arrangement since 2003.  Details around how this system changes in the future are due to be published this month and could form part of the negotiations, with Britain, which is very keen to keep this particular Brussels regulation. The UK Government says it is more than playing its part by pledging to take 20,000 refugees from camps that neighbour Syria, providing over £1bn in aid and today deploying a Royal Navy vessel to the Mediterranean as part of NATO’s first intervention into the crisis. ""We will have our own asylum approach, our own way of doing things,"" said Mr Cameron on his way in to the meeting.  This may play well back in the UK – but it doesn't sound so good to leaders such as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who is calling for a united solution."

Louis Pedro Verdasca dos Santos Costa was remanded in custody after being charged with three offences, including unlawfully being on an aircraft. The 38-year-old is accused of breaching security on the Heathrow perimeter before gaining access to the BA engineering base at Hatton Cross on Saturday. He was spotted climbing into the cabin of an empty Boeing 747 aircraft, before fleeing to the flight deck and locking himself behind the high-security cockpit doors, it is claimed. After struggling to breach the bomb and bulletproof doors, fire brigade officers were eventually able to break into the cockpit. A source, who asked not to be named, said: ""It was a very difficult and complex situation and in the end the fire brigade had to be called to the plane and carried out a long and very protracted operation to get into the cockpit from outside. ""It is a terrifying situation when you think about it. Here is a man who not only has managed to go air-side at one of the world's busiest airports but he has successfully got to a Boeing 747 jet liner and found it open and was able to climb aboard. ""Then he has got onto the flight deck and barricaded himself in using the plane's own anti-terrorist equipment."" Police confirmed there was an incident at Heathrow on a stationary aircraft, and said it is not believed to be terror-related. British Airways said it had no comment to make on the incident ""as a man has been charged and will be appearing in court"". A statement issued by Heathrow Airport said: ""Safety and security are always our main priority and we take incidents involving either very seriously indeed. ""Individuals illegally entering the air-side environment potentially endanger their own lives and those of others. We are working with the police following an incident on Saturday. ""We keep security under constant review."""

Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said recent terror attacks in Paris, the bombing of a Russia-bound passenger plane over Egypt and the attempt to bring down another airliner in Somalia, demonstrated a broadening of the terror group's ambition. The Assistant Commissioner said that in the UK over the past few years, the Islamist group has called on would-be jihadis to attack police and the military, but now their plans had evolved to attack ""Western lifestyles"". Mr Rowley said: ""In recent months we've seen a broadening of that, much more plans to attack Western lifestyle, and obviously the Paris attacks in November. Going from that narrow focus on police and military as symbols of the state to something much broader. Mark Rowley: 'IS has big ambitions for spectacular attacks' ""And you see a terrorist group which has big ambitions for enormous and spectacular attacks, not just the types that we've seen foiled to date."" He warned that ISIS was now attempting to get supporters who have received military training in Syria into northern Europe to stage attacks. The counter-terror boss said the ""shared effort to look for any possible links of those networks or other networks that have reached the UK is obviously a massively high priority"". Earlier this year, Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe announced plans for a large scale increase in the numbers of armed police in London because of the increasing concerns about the possibility of a Paris-style marauding gun and bomb attack. Authorities are also now launching a push to alert the public to official ""Run, Hide, Tell"" advice in the event of such an attack. Scotland Yard is urging members of the public to sign up to the force's Twitter Alerts service. Mark Rowley said the alerts would be activated in the event of a marauding attack and give members of the public vital, quick information on where an incident is unfolding and the best options to try to remain safe. Over the last three years the number of terror-related arrests has risen by 57% compared to the previous three years. Around half lead to a charge. Last year just over three-quarters (77%) of those arrested were British nationals, 14% were female and 13% were aged 20 and under. Scotland Yard has seen more than 20 families and around 50 young people go through family court proceedings over concerns about radicalisation in the past year."

The trip to the French Alps last week was the first time the family have been on holiday together, and they have released six photographs to mark the event. The images show a relaxed William and Kate holding their two children and engaging in a snowball fight. One picture captures the moment a snowball hurled by Kate hits William in the chest. Determined not to be caught out a second time, the Duke is seen in another image playfully grappling with his wife and knocking a snowball from her hand. Charlotte is seen smiling broadly as she is held up by her father, with a wintry backdrop to the image. The family are also pictured together with the Duke and Duchess crouching down as they hold their children, while another image shows William putting his arm around Kate. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ""This was their first holiday as a family of four and the first time either of the children had played in the snow. ""It was very special and fun short holiday for the family, and they are grateful that John Stillwell (Press Association royal photographer) was able to capture the moment so well. ""The Duke and Duchess hope people enjoy the photos."""

After months of negotiations,  88% of members of the Aslef union backed the four-year wage deal. It includes above-inflation pay rises backdated from April last year, and a £500 bonus to drivers and other staff connected with the introduction of the night service. The night tube was due to start running last September, but ground to a halt with a  series of strikes over pay and conditions. It will roll out on the Central, Piccadilly, Jubilee, Victoria and Northern lines first. Aslef officer Finn Brennan said: ""Aslef members on London Underground have voted by a huge majority to accept the improved offer on pay and night Tube. ""Last year management tried to force through changes to rosters that would have meant unlimited increases in weekend and night shifts with a pay rise of just 0.5%. ""[Our members] have achieved an above-inflation pay rise and real improvements in conditions that will give drivers, and other grades, much more flexibility and control over their work/life balance in the future."" Last week, 84% of members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) also voted in favour of the offer. Steve Griffiths, London Underground's chief operating officer, said: ""I'm pleased that Aslef members have voted to accept our offer. This is a fair and affordable pay deal, which includes complete protection of employee work/life balance. ""We continue to focus on the recruitment and training of part-time drivers to deliver the night Tube for London as quickly as possible."""

Investigators say a telephone tip led them to the home of a family acquaintance, 29-year-old Amanda Hellman, on Wednesday night in Vestal, near the girls' home in Binghamton. Authorities say Hellman abducted the girls on their way to school and held them against their will at her house 10 miles away.

The Prime Minister was handed a two-day-old lamb by a little girl during a tour of a North Wales farm after claiming farmers could lose as much as £330m on lamb and beef exports if voters backed Brexit. He warned British farmers could ""suffer enormously"" if the UK opts to leave in the 23 June referendum. Brothers Richard and David Williams - who own Tyfos farm in Llandrillo, near Corwen, Denbighsire - showed the PM around as he put agriculture at the heart of his latest appeal for voters to keep Britain in the EU. Mr Cameron said: ""Farmers are faced with bureaucracy, inspections, the payment system and it's very important we deal with those issues but there's a bigger issue which is a market of 500 million people who we can sell some of the best meat in the world to."" He spoke of the consequences of leaving Europe: ""You'd have to meet all their rules and you wouldn't have any say on what they are and that doesn't make you any more sovereign or more powerful."" When asked if there was a Plan B in the event of Brexit, the PM said: ""Of course we have to be ready, we have just produced a document on the alternatives."" Mr Cameron added that more than 90% of UK lamb and beef exports, worth around £605m, currently go to the EU. The farming sector contributes £9.9bn to the UK economy and employs nearly half a million people. If farmers had to rely on World Trade Organisation rules rather than EU membership to secure access to the European market, Mr Cameron claimed they could be faced with tariffs costing £240m a year for beef and £90m for lamb. Earlier, Boris Johnson called on voters to ignore the ""pessimists and merchants of gloom"" and back a UK exit from the EU. He claimed the EU was an ""anachronism"" that ""wastes our money massively"" and ""subverts democracy in this country"". But in his speech in Wales, Mr Cameron accused Brexit campaigners of promoting a vision of life outside the EU that was ""too good to be true"", and warned a vote for leave would put jobs and trade in danger."

In other words, it has promised to reach a fiscal surplus by 2020. But now, having cancelled contentious proposals to change how pensions are taxed, will the Chancellor raise more mundane duties to pocket come cash? Alison Steed, a personal finance expert, says: ""There are so many different things and so many different ways we are taxed throughout the day - it starts before you even leave the house. ""Because it is so much a part of the fabric of our life, you tend to forget that you are actually paying all this money to the Government. ""The only time you are made aware of it are times like the Budget. The only way the Government can actually raise money is to put taxes up."" So pints and petrol could soon cost us a few more pence. A litre of fuel currently costs around £1. Of that, duty is 57.95p, but when VAT is added - another 17p - three quarters of what you pay at the pumps is just tax. According to the RAC, adding 1p to the price of petrol would bring in an extra £462m in tax revenue. Adding just 2p to fuel could mean an extra £924m for the Treasury's coffers. That's a very tempting tax take for a Chancellor in need of cash. This time last year, beer duty was cut by one penny for the second time. Now may be the moment the Treasury reverses that trend. Alcohol duty varies, but for 500ml of each - roughly amounting  to 9p for beer, 18p for cider and £1.32 for wine. Andrew Watters, tax expert at Thomas Eggar, said: ""Like any politician, he's going to be trying to work out how to get money from peoples' pockets with the least pain and the least finger pointing."" Nobody wants to pay a penny more for a pint or a litre of petrol. But the Chancellor may come to the conclusion we can't afford not to. :: Watch George Osborne's Budget live on Wednesday from 11am on Sky channel 501, Virgin Media channel 602, Freeview channel 132, and Freesat channel 202."

Tyrone Williams, 31, and Chauntyll Allen, 42, said they made the discovery after being seated on Wednesday at Joe's Crab Shack in Roseville, Minnesota. They said the image, which was embedded under glass at the decorative table, was apparently meant to be a joke. The photo had a speech bubble from one of the black men being hanged that read: ""All I said was I didn't like the gumbo."" Mr Williams has vowed never to return to Joe's Crab Shack Mr Williams told a news conference hosted by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP): ""We just instantly felt sick and confused."" They said the manager at the restaurant apologised and offered them a free meal. But they have vowed never to return to Joe's Crab Shack.

The Death Penalty Information Center lists Burleson's hanging as a legal execution. Joe's Crab Shack has locations across the US But Ms Allen said lynchings of African Americans during that period were often dressed up as legal executions.

Office of Rail and Road (ORR) data analysed by the Press Association reveals that 5,250 trains were late from July to September 2015. The figures - which amount to an average of 57 trains running significantly late each day - do not include trains that ran more than two hours late. The Caledonian Sleeper was the worst operator, according to the data The data shows the worst operator was the Caledonian Sleeper, which runs overnight services between London and Scotland. Some 3.7% of its services suffered disruptions of between 30 and 119 minutes. First Hull Trains had 2.7% of its services running late, while Virgin Trains East Coast had 2.6% running late. Grand Central had 2% of its services delayed. James MacColl from the Campaign for Better Transport said ""far too few"" passengers understand when they are due to be compensated for late running services. ""With record numbers of people now relying on the railways - and technology like electronic tickets becoming more widespread - this needs to change,"" he said. ""With big investment going into the railways, it's also essential that the whole industry works together to minimise disruption and keep the trains running on time."" Rail Minister Claire Perry said: ""We are investing record amounts in our railways to make journeys better for passengers, and the rail industry must ensure their customers receive the best possible service at all times. ""This includes making sure the network is robust and that delays caused by planned works are kept to a minimum. ""If passengers are hit by significant disruption, we do have a generous compensation scheme and we are working with the ORR to make sure that the claim process is quick and hassle free."" The Rail, Maritime and Transport union described the figures as ""shocking"", adding that staff and fleet shortages coupled with ""chronic under-investment in infrastructure"" has led to major delays. A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said timetables are a ""promise to passengers"". ""Train operators and Network Rail are working hard together every day to deliver a better, more punctual railway and to give people better information when things do go wrong,"" he said. ""The rail industry has cut the number of incidents causing delays every year, but a busier network means that incidents can have a greater knock-on effect."""

The vessel is believed to have suffered a failure during an exercise and is presumed to have sunk. The US military is said to have been observing the submarine off North Korea's eastern coast earlier this week and American spy satellites were also later watching the navy search for it. ""The speculation is that it sank,"" an unidentified US official told the US Naval Institute's news website. ""The North Koreans have not made an attempt to indicate there is something wrong or that they require help or some type of assistance."" The reports emerged as Pyongyang threatened retaliation against US and South Korean forces taking part in annual joint military drills. The drills are part of eight weeks of joint military exercises The North has warned it would launch a ""blitzkrieg"" in the Korean peninsula amid a simulated amphibious landing by Washington and Seoul involving thousands of troops. About 55 US marine aircraft and 30 US and South Korean ships, including ones which carry attack jets, took part in the assault on beaches near Pohang city in the South. The North has reportedly warned of a ""pre-emptive retaliatory strike at the enemy groups"" involved in the exercise which it sees as preparations for an invasion. Pyongyang said it would respond with an ""operation to liberate the whole of South Korea including Seoul"" with an ""ultra-precision blitzkrieg"". North Korean state media boasted of the nation's right to launch a ""pre-emptive nuclear attack"" and issued a final warning to Washington. ""A nuclear war against the DPRK would bring a final ruin to the US,"" said an article in the North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said it was ""absolutely outrageous"" to condemn people who raised concerns about the influx of large numbers of migrants as racist. He said the scale of Europe's migrant crisis meant such anxieties were entirely reasonable. ""Fear is a valid emotion at a time of such colossal crisis,"" the UK's most senior cleric told Parliament's The House magazine. ""This is one of the greatest movements of people in human history. Just enormous. And to be anxious about that is very reasonable."" He added: ""There is a tendency to say 'those people are racist', which is just outrageous, absolutely outrageous."" The Archbishop said it was essential the ""genuine fear"" some people felt was listened to. ""In fragile communities particularly - and I've worked in many areas with very fragile communities over my time as a clergyman -  there is a genuine fear: what happens about housing?"" he said. ""What happens about jobs? What happens about access to health services?"" He said British people had shown they were able to deal ""brilliantly"" with such challenges. ""Fear is justified, I wouldn't want to criticise that for a moment, but so is hope wholly justified, because we have the capacity,"" he added. ""We're those kind of people, we always have been."" He said the Church would remain neutral in the EU referendum debate, but was highly critical of Europe's response to the refugee crisis. Figures released last month showed 323,000 more people arrived in the UK in the year to September 2015 than left - a 172,000 net increase from within Europe and 191,000 from outside Europe. The Government has said it remains committed to getting net migration below 100,000 by the next election in 2020. There were also 38,878 asylum applications, up 20% on the previous year. Kate Smart, director of the charity Asylum Welcome, said it is ""a normal, human reaction"" to be worried about how to cope with the influx of refugees. She added: ""He (Archbishop of Canterbury) is quite right to say that you need to address the concerns that people have here about the difficulties they are facing in their own lives, and hopefully that will make them more sympathetic towards people who are wanting to come here and find a place of safety."""

But in a letter to staff, Jean-Bernard Levy said the ""financial context was challenging"" and negotiations with the French government to secure the company's financial position were continuing. Plans for the power station in Somerset, first announced in 2013, have been plagued by delays and uncertainty over funding. Earlier this month, EDF's chief finance officer Thomas Piquemal resigned over his concerns that the decision on investment at Hinkley Point C was being made too soon, potentially threatening EDF's financial position. But Andrea Leadsom, a minister in the Department of Energy and Climate Change, insisted his resignation would have ""no impact"" on the timing of EDF's final decision on investment for the project. Mr Levy said in his letter: ""I am sure that this project is a good project for the group and that in the near future, all the conditions will come together for it to be definitely launched. ""We are currently negotiating with the French state to obtain commitments allowing us to secure our financial position. ""It is clear that I will not engage EDF in this project before these conditions are met. ""We have already gained agreement that the full dividend for 2015 is to be paid to the state in shares and not in cash, which represents €1.8bn of additional capital for EDF. ""These discussions are ongoing and I am defending our group for the present and especially the future."" French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week that the French government had complete confidence in Mr Levy."

The 28-year-old posted a lengthy rebuttal on her Facebook page about what she considers to be misreporting of her positive drugs test. In December the International Tennis Federation and WTA alerted players five times to the list of banned substances for 2016. But in announcing her positive test this week, the Russian player mentioned only her failure to click on a link in an email which carried the documents on 22 December. The Russian insisted the four other missed opportunities for finding out about the ban were not ones she could necessarily have been expected to take. :: Andy Murray: Sharapova Should Be Suspended She posted images of a detailed ""wallet card"" which showed the banned substances. In the Facebook post, Sharapova wrote: ""I make no excuses for not knowing about the ban. ""I already told you about the December 22, 2015, email I received. Its subject line was 'Main Changes to the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme for 2016'. ""I should have paid more attention to it. But the other 'communications'? They were buried in newsletters, websites, or handouts."" Sharapova also wrote about an email from 18 December which required her to click through several links to find the relevant information about meldonium. :: What Is Meldonium? Gallery: Maria Sharapova: Memorable Moments The then 17-year-old Sharapova announced her arrival on the world stage by beating Serena Williams in straight sets to win Wimbledon in 2004. She texted her mother: ""I feel gr8"" She wrote: ""There was also a 'wallet card' distributed at various tournaments at the beginning of 2016, after the ban went into effect. ""This document had thousands of words on it, many of them technical, in small print. Should I have studied it? Yes. But if you saw this document ... you would know what I mean. ""Again, no excuses, but it's wrong to say I was warned five times."" The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has revealed there have been 99 positive tests for meldonium since the drug was added to its banned list in January. Sharapova revealed during a news conference on Monday that she had been taking the drug legally for 10 years for health reasons on the advice of her family doctor. Despite several sponsors, including Porsche and Nike, distancing themselves from the tennis ace, her racket sponsor Head issued a statement backing the athlete. The company's chairman and chief executive Johan Eliasch said WADA should have allowed some usage of the drug on medical grounds."

Buckingham Palace has lodged a formal complaint with the press watchdog over a report in The Sun that claimed Her Majesty supported Brexit. When asked by Sky News about the Queen's apparent backing for his stance, Mr Johnson said: ""I think the most important thing is that she is completely above politics, isn't she? She should have nothing to do with it. ""She shouldn't be dragged in and I certainly don't know what her views are."" He was speaking after delivering a speech at a Vote Leave campaign event in Dartford, Kent, the London Mayor's first public address of the EU referendum campaign ahead of the 23 June vote. In his speech Mr Johnson called on voters to ignore the ""pessimists and merchants of gloom"" and back a UK exit from the EU. He claimed the EU was an ""anachronism"" that ""wastes our money massively"" and ""subverts democracy in this country"". Mr Johnson said: ""I think the prospects are win-win for all of us. ""I think it is time to ignore the pessimists and the merchants of gloom and to do a new deal that would be good for Britain and good for Europe too. ""It is time to burst loose and of all those regulations and get out into a world that is changing and growing and becoming more exciting the whole time. ""If we hold our nerve and we are not timid and we are not cowed by the gloomadon-poppers on the Remain campaign and we vote for freedom and for the restoration of democracy, then I believe that this country will continue to grow and prosper and thrive as never before."" He claimed that if the British public were asked to join such a union now they would steer well clear. ""Why would we join such a woefully unreformed Europe? Would anybody in their right mind join the EU as it is today? I don't think so, Mr Johnson claimed. ""I don't think people in this country would want to do it."" Reacting to the speech, Labour MP and ""In"" campaigner Chuka Umunna told Sky News: ""This wasn't a positive speech at all, it was a rant containing a set of views which were flawed in my view and anachronistic. ""He spent most of his speech talking down what Britain has managed to achieve in Europe over the last few decades."" Mr Umunna also said he found it ""extraordinary"" that Mr Johnson ""ignored"" the role the EU has played in areas such as peace, respected for human rights and democracy. Prime Minister David Cameron also hit the campaign trail on Friday, warning British agriculture would be hit if the UK votes to leave the EU. Mr Cameron accused Brexit campaigners of promoting a vision of life outside the EU that was ""too good to be true"", and warned a withdrawal would endanger trade and jobs."

David McDermott is suspected of being a member of a Liverpool-based gang involved in a conspiracy to import 16 holdalls full of high-quality cocaine, weighing 400kg. The haul was found at Tilbury docks in Essex in May 2013, hidden in a container of frozen Argentine beef. The 42-year-old, from Ormskirk, West Lancashire, was arrested at a house in the Burma Hills area of Accra, during a joint operation by National Crime Agency (NCA) officers and the Ghanaian Bureau of National Investigation. Extradition proceedings to bring him back to Britain are due to begin next week. Dave Allen, head of the NCA's International Crime Bureau, said: ""McDermott was the last man outstanding in a plot to smuggle a huge quantity of cocaine which would have ended up on the streets of Merseyside. ""He will now be returned to the UK to stand trial."" Six people have been jailed for a total of 64 years over the haul."

During an interview with Fox Business Network, Jesse Hughes said he considered it suspicious that some security guards at the Bataclan concert hall did not arrive for work on the night of the shooting in which 90 people were killed by Islamist gunmen. He said: ""It seems rather obvious that they had a reason not to show up."" Hughes performed with the band at a tribute gig last month The singer had also said he thought it strange that when he first arrived at the venue one of the security guards did not look at him. He said: ""I immediately went to the promoter and said 'Who's that guy? I want to put another dude on.' ""And he goes 'Well, some of the other guards aren't here yet,' and eventually I found out that six or so wouldn't show up at all."" Now Mr Hughes has posted an apology on the band's Facebook profile in which he blames his accusations on post-traumatic stress and pleads with France and Bataclan staff to forgive him. ""I humbly beg forgiveness from the people of France, the staff and security of the Bataclan, my fans, family, friends and anyone else hurt or offended by the absurd accusations,"" he said. ""My suggestions that anyone affiliated with the Bataclan played a role in the events of November 13 are unfounded and baseless – and I take full responsibility for them. A STATEMENT FROM JESSE HUGHES: ""I've been dealing with non-stop nightmares and struggling through therapy to make sense of this tragedy and insanity. I haven't been myself since November 13. ""I realise there's no excuse for my words, but for what it's worth I am sincerely sorry for having hurt, disrespected or accused anyone."" Last month Eagles Of Death Metal played for survivors of the massacre in a gig at the Olympia venue, a few miles from the Bataclan."

Tony Smith, 46, spotted the dead rodent in a bush near a children's playground while working close to Hackney Downs in London. He believes it weighs more than 25lb - and is ""about 4ft"" long including its tail, although this would easily put it on a par with the largest known rat species in the world. ""This is the largest rat I've ever seen in my entire life,"" he said. He took a photograph of his friend James Green, an electrician, holding up the supersize rat to the camera. Mr Smith added: ""I've got a cat and a Jack Russell and it was bigger than both of those."" He said bins are often left open near the estate where he has been working so ""these little fellas have a pretty good diet"". Some have cast doubts the rat is as big as it appears in the photo, however. Hackney Council pic showing how an object can look bigger than it is They include Hackney Council, which has posted images showing how the eye can be deceived. One shows a member of staff holding a soft toy close up to the camera and then just in front of his face. In the first picture the toy looks huge - but in the second, which shows its actual size, it looks quite small. Referring to the giant rat, the council tweeted: ""It's probably not that big. Our pest control team are checking it out though."" Guinness World Records says the world's biggest rat is believed to be the slender-tailed cloud rat found on Luzon, an island in the Philippines, which has a body length of up to 3ft 3in. According to the British Pest Control Association (BPCA), there are two species of rat in Britain - the common brown rat or the rarer black rat. Its website says: ""The brown rat is the larger of the rats in Britain, often weighing over half a kilo and measuring about 23cm (9in), without counting the tail."" The BPCA's latest figures show there were 196,012 pest control call-outs involving rats in the UK in 2013-14 - a drop of 30% on the previous year."

There are booby-trapped devices everywhere. One is outside the old library and another two at the entrance to what appears to be a medical station treating the injured. The bombs are packed into kitchen pots and pans and other household appliances and are a variety of sizes. Among the cache there was at least one rigged suicide vest and a batch of pressure plates stacked next to barrels stuffed with explosives. An artillery shell from Latakia There are artillery shells from Latakia, a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al Assad. There are also rockets still in their casings. This will be used as proof that the Syrian leader is in league with the IS fighters and is funding and supplying them. Al Shaddadi is now a ghost town, less than a fortnight after the armed group making up the Syrian Democratic Forces marched in, in the wake of a multitude of coalition airstrikes. Key installations like the IS police station are reduced to rubble. A makeshift gallows is still rigged up outside some 15ft up an electricity pylon. :: IS Documents Identify Thousands Of Jihadis ""This is where they used to hang people so others could see them,"" one Syrian activist told us. Al Shaddadi is geographically and strategically important because of its oil and gas facilities and its location. It's the last major town before the IS headquarters of Raqqa. Taking it from the terror group is being seen as an important military success for those attempting to topple the terror group and reduce its stranglehold on parts of Syria. We were one of the first outsiders into the town after IS fighters fled less than two weeks ago and it was a chilling insight into life under the terror group. The group's black slogans are hung around the town. Each shop has its stamp on the exterior, every house is denoted by a black IS number. Inside there are unfinished meals in some and the remnants of IS fighters' lives scattered all around. Among the debris we found a salary slip showing the fighter had been paid $125 per month. There were military reports showing he'd fought in Raqqa, Al Hasakah in northern Syria as well as Anbar province in Iraq. A lot of personal information shows he had eight wives and he bought one woman as a sex slave and she had four children. It even gives detail about his blood type and his shoe size. A large building was turned into what became known as the ""rape house"", where they took women for sex. In it, rigged bombs are left attached to light switches. There were leaflets showing how the women should dress in all-covering black material from head to toe. One lone family still sheltering in one house told us if any woman showed flesh they would be prodded with electrical sticks as punishment. No woman was allowed outside unless accompanied by a male relative. In the backyards of many of the fighters' homes, they had built bunkers, some made comfortable with cushions and mattresses. In the back room of one house we found a much more elaborate structure with a 20ft-deep shaft complete with an oxygen supply which led to a long tunnel they were attempting to build. Soldiers of the Syrian Democratic forces made up mostly of the Kurdish YPG led us to a dark, unlit room where they had gathered pieces of archaeological treasure. They believe they date from 6,000 to 8,000 years ago and may have been used by the IS group to fund their military campaign."
2016-03-13,Thousands of people in parts of Derbyshire and Leicestershire have been told they can use their water supply again.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160313025028/http://news.sky.com/story/1658269/tap-water-still-too-dangerous-for-hundreds,"Thousands of people in parts of Derbyshire and Leicestershire have been told they can use their water supply again. Around 3,700 properties in postcodes DE11, DE15, DE65, DE73 and the LE65 area were told on Friday they should not use water for drinking, washing or preparing food until further notice. The warning triggered mass panic-buying of bottled water, leaving shops with empty shelves. Postcodes affected by Severn Trent water problems But Severn Trent has now said that since 3pm today the number of properties that must not use tap water has dropped to 241. The water company said the warning was a precaution as a result of ""a problem with higher than normal levels of chlorine"" at one of its service reservoirs in Castle Donington. Around 24,000 bottles of drinking water have been distributed at Sainsbury's in Swadlincote, and at Tesco in Ashby-de-la-Zouch today with Severn Trent saying it gave more to people who needed it. Owen Pritchard, who lives in Chellaston, told Sky News he only found out about the warning through a friend who had seen a news report about it. He realised something was wrong when he used his dishwasher, adding: ""The smell from the dishwasher was extremely strong of chlorine. ""It smelt a little like a swimming pool,"" he said. Another resident told Sky's Tom Parmenter in Ashby on Saturday morning she only found out about the problem towards the end of Friday after drinking water all day. She said: ""I don't do Twitter, I don't really do Facebook, I don't listen to the news so I drank water all day yesterday so did all my family. ""I was very disappointed by Severn Trent as they texted two of my neighbours and they didn't text us. I'm not an elderly person - I can go on the website - but if you don't know there's anything wrong, you don't know to look. Elderly people who don't do the internet perhaps wouldn't know at all."" Local MP for Ashby Andrew Bridgen said lessons needed to be learned. He told Sky News: ""We have had a communication problem. Obviously the message got out, through the media and social media, but not everyone has access to that. A lot of people claim they've heard it from their neighbours. ""In the good old days we used to have people going around with megaphones informing people of things like this and perhaps that isn't a bad idea. Perhaps we need to review how we get things like this out to the people."" Severn Trent said anyone who had drunk the water but did not notice a strong chlorine taste or smell was unlikely to have been harmed."

Tests will begin on a small number of roads within months before pilots are carried out on 70mph carriageways later this year. The first trials are expected to be carried out on roads in Milton Keynes, Bristol, Coventry and Greenwich. The Chancellor believes automated vehicles could lead to the most ""fundamental"" change to transport since the invention of the petrol engine. He hopes they will revolutionise motoring by 2020, and put the UK at the forefront of the new technology. Mr Osborne said: ""At a time of great uncertainty in the global economy, Britain must take bold decisions now to ensure it leads the world when it comes to new technologies and infrastructure. ""That's what my Budget next week will seek to do."" He added: ""Naturally we need to ensure safety, and that's what the trials we are introducing will test. ""If successful, we could see driverless cars available for sale and on Britain's roads, boosting UK jobs and productivity."" Driverless cars, which can alert motorists to accidents and traffic jams, could eventually prevent 95% of crashes, according to the Treasury. ""Truck platooning"" tests will also be carried out on motorways, where lorries travel in tightly-packed convoys to improve fuel consumption by reducing drag. The automated juggernauts are set to take to UK roads this year. A driver in the lead vehicle would control the steering, acceleration and braking of the convoy. But the drones would have a driver in each cab as a safety measure. A stretch of the M6 near Carlisle has reportedly been earmarked as a test route. In Germany, a driverless lorry developed by Daimler was tested on a public road last October. Last month, a Google driverless car was involved in a collision with a bus in California. The US tech firm's automated cars have been involved in more than a dozen collisions, but in most cases the vehicles were rear-ended. :: Watch George Osborne's Budget live on Wednesday from 11am on Sky channel 501, Virgin Media channel 602, Freeview channel 132, and Freesat channel 202."

Here's what you need to know:",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160313025028/http://news.sky.com/story/1656532/doctors-strike-the-key-questions-answered,"Doctors are unhappy at plans to change their pay and conditions, leading to a series of strikes. Here's what you need to know: :: What's happening? The 38,000 junior doctors who work in England and are members of the British Medical Association (BMA) will strike for 48 hours from 8am on Wednesday 9 March. They will still provide emergency care, but consultants will plug the gaps left in routine services. :: Why are they striking? They are unhappy with Government proposals to impose a new contract, which would result in more junior doctors working at weekends. The Government says this would make weekend care safer, but junior doctors say the Government is stretching resources too thinly and should invest in more staff. Doctors are concerned they will be under pressure to work longer hours, risking patient safety. They are also angry about the redefining of unsocial hours which will result in less time qualifying for premium pay. :: What progress has been made in talks? The Department of Health claims 90% of the contract issues had been agreed, but sticking points remain. The BMA wants doctors working on Saturdays to be paid at 50% above the basic rate. But the Department of Health has offered 30% top-up from 5pm and all-day top-ups for those working more than one Saturday in four. Doctors are also concerned about the policing of working hours and time off guarantees between night shifts. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says he will impose the contract from August after a rejected final offer last month. The BMA plans to take legal action. :: What impact will the strike have on the NHS? Junior doctors will still provide emergency care, but this first 48-hour strike will be a major test of hospital contingency plans, disrupting the flow of patients at a busy time of year. Around 5,200 operations and procedures are expected to be cancelled, with outpatient clinics also disrupted. Hospitals are being told to reschedule patients with new slots within a few weeks. :: Aren't doctors already well-paid? Junior doctors are classed as those who have completed their training but are not yet consultants, with a starting salary of £22,636, increasing to £30,000 within four years. Income can be topped up by supplementary payments; up to £40,000 initially, rising to £56,000. Doctors in specialist training typically earn between £30,002 and £47,175. :: What if I have an operation coming up? Further 48 hour strikes are planned, starting at 8am on 6 April and 8am on 26 April. Hospitals are making plans for those days and will contact patients to reschedule appointments or operations where necessary."

Violence broke out at the University of Illinois after an announcement was made that the rally would be postponed. Punches were later thrown between supporters of the Republican presidential front runner and protesters. Five arrests were made and two police officers were injured. Footage posted on Twitter showed a bloodied officer following clashes at an intersection two blocks from the cancelled rally. The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America! Following the postponement, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter: ""The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!"" University staff had petitioned administrators to cancel the rally, citing concerns about a ""hostile and physically dangerous environment"". In announcing the cancellation, the Trump campaign said he met with law enforcement officials after arriving in Chicago.  The statement added: ""For the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight's rally will be postponed to another date. ""Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace."" However, Chicago police denied they were consulted and claimed they had the resources to cope. Superintendent John Escalante said: ""The Chicago Police Department had no role, we were not consulted or provided an opinion as to whether or not the event should be cancelled. ""In fact we did assure the Trump campaign that we had more than adequate resources outside the UIC pavilion and we guaranteed them we could provide safe access and exit for Mr Trump."" Protester Jedidiah Brown, who stormed the stage, told Sky News that Trump supporters told him to ""Go back to Africa"". ""I'm American I  don't know other countries,"" he said. ""They spat on us, they threw bottles at me, it was a very troubling experience. We were peaceful. Even when I jumped on stage I was peaceful."" Earlier in the day Mr Trump was interrupted by protesters several times at a rally in St Louis, Missouri. The billionaire resumed his campaign on Saturday with a rally in Ohio, reiterating his belief that organised ""professionals"" were behind Friday's disturbance.

He said: ""When you have a campaign that disrespects the voters, when you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence, when you have a campaign that's facing allegations of physical violence against members of the press, you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discord."""

The Duke of Cambridge has been called a part-time royal after it was reported he had carried out 87 appearances in the UK last year and 35 on overseas trips, compared to his grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh, who carried out 250. It had been claimed the Duke, who works as an air ambulance pilot, is prevented from carrying out more engagements on his days off because of European red tape, something that was denied by the Civil Aviation Authority. Pictures of William, Kate, Prince George and Princess Charlotte on a skiing trip in the Alps also provoked anger. But in an interview with ITV News, the Duke shrugged off the criticism. Asked about the claims, he said: ""It's part of the job."" When he was pressed on whether he is frustrated by the allegations, William, who is making a number of public and media appearances as part of his campaign against illegal poaching, said it takes a long time to plan this conservation initiative. He said: ""Well, these sorts of things take a lot of time, they take a lot of planning and a lot of knowledge building, a lot of conversations. ""I didn't want to get to 45 or 50 and sit back and say 'I could have said something about that issue but I didn't because I worried about what people thought or what people said'."" The Duke said he wants to have ""truly made a difference"" in tackling poaching. Gallery: William, Kate And Family Go Skiing The Duchess of Cambridge throws a snowball at Prince William during a short private break skiing in the French Alps He said: ""I want to turn round and turn to my children and my friends and talk to other people my age and having known we have truly made a difference, we have fixed something, we have given hope to the future. ""That should give everybody a lift and realise there is hope that we can fix stuff."" Speaking at Buckingham Palace, William issued a stark warning about the future of the world's most iconic animals as he launched an ambitious project to close wildlife smuggling routes. He said the world had just five years to turn around the poaching crisis threatening animals like the rhino and the elephant. Leading figures from conservation charities, airlines and shipping organisations have signed up to William's initiative to stop traffickers."

The force had been granted £700,000 by the Home Office last January to commit further resources to the investigation, but that money would have run out by the end of this month. Alan Billings, South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner, has said the latest instalment will allow work to continue until October - enabling the team ""to be strengthened with experienced detectives who will follow up new leads"". Ben was 21 months old when he disappeared on 24 July 1991 after travelling to the Greek island of Kos with his mother and grandparents. He would now be 26 years old, and there have been several possible sightings and a plethora of theories about what happened to the youngster. Gallery: Key Events: Disappearance Of Ben Needham Ben Needham was just 21 months old when he disappeared on July 24 1991 on the Greek Island of Kos. He was on holiday with his mother, Kerry, and grandparents, Eddie and Christine Needham ""I fully support South Yorkshire Police in their ongoing pursuit of the facts,"" Dr Billings said. ""They have worked hard in facilitating the Greek authorities' investigation into Ben's disappearance. They have unearthed many new witnesses and have been able to rule out other lines of inquiry. ""Along with the Chief Constable, I remain committed to finding Ben. We remain hopeful that this will lead to a resolution one way or another."" Last May, Ben's family appeared alongside police on Greek television to make an emotional appeal for information - prompting dozens of calls. His mother, Kerry Needham, had said: ""Please end the pain my family are suffering. I know he's out there somewhere, please call the detectives and put an end to it."" During the broadcast, she described the heartbreak she had felt when DNA tests carried out on young men who had come forward to the police were unsuccessful. In 2012, land was excavated near the farmhouse where Ben vanished, but no trace of the little boy was found. The Home Office's Special Grant Funding was first requested by South Yorkshire Police in order to follow up leads that Ben's family believed had never been properly investigated."

Clayton Williams, 19, said he cried and felt scared and lost after fatally knocking down PC Dave Phillips with a stolen pick-up truck and tried to call his relative Shirley Williams. The defendant also agreed that following the collision he fled the scene, dumped the vehicle, had a shower at his aunt's house, got rid of his clothes which were burnt and gave his phone away. Williams had earlier led police on an 80mph chase after stealing a Mitsubishi in a burglary on 5 October last year. Father-of-two PC Phillips was deploying a stinger device to stop Williams, who allegedly deliberately drove at the policeman using the vehicle as a ""weapon"" in a ""merciless and cowardly act"". Williams denies murdering the officer who was killed almost instantly from ""catastrophic"" injuries in Wallasey, Merseyside. He has admitted the burglary where the car was stolen and aggravated vehicle taking. Father-of-two PC Phillips died last October He told the jury he had no intention of harming anyone but was trying to drive round the stinger spikes when he hit the officer at 50-80mph. He had been released on licence from jail three weeks earlier after serving half of a nine-month sentence, for leading police on another pursuit in a car and crashing into a lamppost. Williams said he fled the scene because he feared returning to jail and insisted he did not see PC Phillips crouching to deploy the stinger until the last seconds. Prosecutor Ian Unsworth QC accused Williams of lying and that the officer was ""clearly visible"" to him, shown on video footage by a pursuing police car. Williams said seconds after hitting the officer, he tried to phone his grandmother. He said: ""I just needed someone in my family to cuddle up to."" He continued: ""I'm only a young boy. I have not got it in me to take someone's life. You are making me out to be something I'm not. ""I was scared. I needed someone, I needed my nan or someone. It's hard being chased and just come out of jail."" Mr Unsworth asked the defendant why he did not turn himself in. Williams said: ""I didn't know who to contact. At the time I just felt like a lost little boy. I just needed someone to talk to."" The trial continues."

Snapchats uploaded by Hamilton were reviewed by Auckland City Police She added that Hamilton would face no further action for allegedly using a mobile phone while driving a vehicle, which has been illegal in the country since 2009. Despite this, her statement added: ""We would like to reiterate our earlier statements that police take the issue of mobile phone use whilst driving or riding very seriously.

One of his Mercedes cars was also impounded by French authorities in December 2007 when he was caught speeding at 121mph on a motorway."

Last month, the author received a note from Chrissy Hart, in which she said ""cancer threatened to take everything from my daughter, and your books turned out to be the fortress we so desperately needed to hide in"". Mrs Hart's daughter died last week. On Twitter, the novelist wrote: ""I think I wanted to write because words were always my safe place. I only wish words could bring her back to you."" At an event in London where remarkable letters are celebrated in front of a live audience, Mrs Hart's moving correspondence was read aloud by the actress Carey Mulligan. ""You taught her that for every chemo she has to go through, there will be the opportunity to fly across a lake on a hippogriff,"" the mother had written. ""For every time her heart seizes with fear of pain, there will be me chasing it away with a patronus charm. Your words built a castle for her to move into when the prognosis got worse."" Mrs Hart also said the books had made her understand more about being a mother. ""I might not have the physical ability to block her from what will take her away from me, but I can be loving and gentle like Molly, stoic in my affection like Minerva, protective and loyal like Hermione, and waiting to welcome her home like Lily,"" she added. In the final paragraphs, Mrs Hart admitted that cancer may take her daughter away from her in a matter of weeks, but wrote: ""For every child that is taken too early, people will come together, huddling close in a big group, wands held high to light the dark sky with the love they felt. ""You built Hogwarts as a home for her to return to. And for me. For that I shall remain forever gratefully yours."""

The technology will work with the PlayStation 4 console and it will immerse the headset wearer in 360-degree virtual worlds. Its launch comes in a big year for virtual reality with Facebook's long-awaited Oculus Rift available in the US on 28 March for $599 and the HTC Vive released on 5 April for $799. Both require high-end PCs in order for the technology to be used.

Andrew House, the president and group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, admitted the release of the headset was ""a bit later than the timeframe we previously stated"". ""We wanted to take the time needed to launch with a broad variety of content and a sufficient supply of hardware"", he added. Also included in the £349.99 bundle are headphones and cables. But what customers won't get for their money is a camera which they will need and is sold separately for about £40. The bundle also does not include Move controllers, costing about £20 each, which are required for any sort of motion-control games. Tech website engadget.com said: ""It's highly likely what was announced today is just the base configuration for folks who already have those bits collecting dust.

2016-03-14,"Despite being in a tight fiscal corner, the Chancellor has found £1.5bn over the Parliament to fund extended opening hours for over 800 secondary schools. We will discover precisely how when the Budget Red Book is published.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160316103612/http://news.sky.com/story/1660601/eu-vote-and-tory-rebels-clip-osbornes-wings,"Despite being in a tight fiscal corner, the Chancellor has found £1.5bn over the Parliament to fund extended opening hours for over 800 secondary schools. We will discover precisely how when the Budget Red Book is published. But this is not a typical Budget announcement, and nor is the legislation to compel all secondary schools to become self-governing academies. Indeed, many of the Budget week announcements are notable for being fiscal small fry - costing tens of millions a year, or in the case of the schools reform, £300m a year. That should come as no surprise if, as is now widely expected, Mr Osborne misses the second of three of his fiscal rules - on debt as a proportion of GDP falling in every year. During the Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne breached his own welfare cap. This breaching of the ""supplementary debt target"" can be blamed on cancelled sales of bank shares owing to market volatility, but might still offer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn an opportunity to attack the Chancellor in his debut Budget response. :: High Speed Rail Links To Get Budget Backing Veteran watchers of fiscal shuffling detect some degree of cash being shifted around to reflect new, lower forecasts for inflation. In theory, government departments require less cash to reflect lower inflation, or at least cash can be taken away without qualifying as a ""real cut"". This could explain at least some of the £4bn in extra departmental cuts signalled by the Chancellor on Sunday for 2020. Meanwhile, Nicky Morgan's department appears to have been allowed to hold on to the cash, which qualifies as this increase in real spending. The bigger picture though is that we have a constrained tinkering Budget after what I referred to as the ""big, bold and brutal"" Budget last July. Tight Treasury coffers is the fundamental constraint preventing giveaways - indeed, a 1% smaller economy in cash terms, a lower stock market and reduced earnings have had consequences all the way through the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast. But it is the EU referendum and rebellious Tory backbenchers that are the political constraint, having already shot across Number 11 bows by stopping the Chancellor's Sunday trading plans announced in the last Budget. The result will be stasis, however the Chancellor tries to dress it up. Indeed, we have already seen a row back on pension reforms - and this week, Opposition funding reforms too. It is worth remembering, Mao's Little Red Book stole headlines last November off the fact that the Government could not get the tax credit cuts, the Chancellor's single biggest deficit reduction measure, through Parliament. But now, the natural difficulty of running Government with a small majority is exacerbated by the fundamental split in the Parliamentary Conservative Party over the EU referendum. In the Chancellor's own Tatton constituency at the weekend, both Leave campaigns turned out to drum up support, including the former MP from the neighbouring constituency Nicholas Winterton. Opinions were mixed on the EU in a part of leafy Cheshire ordinarily very supportive of George Osborne. The Chancellor's own mentor Lord Howard said that he ""hated"" being on the other side of the EU referendum debate, but Mr Osborne's ""remarkable"" economic record should make him a strong candidate for next Tory leader. Mr Osborne will say in his Budget speech: ""The Budget I'll deliver today will put the next generation first. And at its heart will be a bold plan to make sure that every child gets the best start in life. ""Now is the time for us to make the bold decisions and the big investments that will help the next generation, and that is what my Budget today will do."" His friends are adamant that it will not be a boring Budget nor a ""Brexit Budget"". There will be further moves on tax thresholds, some punter friendly moves on beer duties and a tough decision on fuel duty. But this Budget is as notable for what has been left out of the Red Book, as what is to be announced."

The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills committee wants to quiz Mr Ashley over the treatment of workers at the sportswear giant and have said he could be in contempt of Parliament if he fails to attend. Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United football club, last week accused the MPs of being “deliberately antagonistic” after they called on him to agree a date to appear before them or face action. Now after meeting to decide on their next course of action, the committee has decided to escalate the stand-off by ordering him to appear on a set date at Westminster. A spokesman said: ""At its meeting this morning, the Business Committee decided to issue a summon to Mike Ashley to give evidence to it on Tuesday 7 June 2016 at the Palace of Westminster. ""As indicated in the Chair's previous letter, should Mr Ashley not agree to appear on 7 June, the Committee reserves the right to take the matter further, including seeking the support of the House of Commons in respect of any complaint of contempt."" In the earlier letter, committee chair Iain Wright turned down an offer for the committee to meet at the company's centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire and said Mr Ashley had not accepted any alternative dates suggested by the committee. But in his reply, Mr Ashley accused the MPs of creating a ""media circus"" and added: ""I was disgusted to learn that you have adopted a stance that is deliberately antagonistic."" It is thought no one has been charged with contempt of Parliament for more than 50 years. Speaking in the Commons last week, the shadow leader of the house Chris Bryant said the House could ""force him to attend"". ""He may be the 22nd richest man in Britain but he is running a modern-day sweatshop and this House will get to the truth,"" he said. Sports Direct has been the subject of sustained criticism over the use of controversial ""zero hours"" contracts. Last December it defended the way it treats its workforce after a Guardian investigation into working conditions among its warehouse staff."

""Indiana Jones is one of the greatest heroes in cinematic history and we can't wait to bring him back to the screen in 2019,"" Disney chairman Alan Horn said in a statement. It will come 11 years after the fourth movie in the franchise, 2008's Indiana Jones And The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The other films in the series are Indiana Jones And The Temple of Doom (1984) and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (1989). Ford's action-hero archaeologist 'Indy' was recently declared the greatest movie personality of all time, beating Ian Fleming's James Bond into second place. Ford, 73, also took third place in the poll for his role as Han Solo in the Star Wars films, voted for by readers of Empire magazine. There had been speculation that Shia LaBeouf, who played Jones' sidekick in Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, might take up the hero's whip. But in October, the films' series producer declared the role would only ever be played by Ford. Frank Marshall said: ""We are not doing the Bond thing where we're going to call somebody else Indiana Jones."" In November, Spielberg had said he would love to make a fifth Indiana Jones before Ford turns 80. The Hollywood director told French radio station RTL he was keen to create another adventure for the archaeologist. ""I am hoping one day to make it to a fifth Indiana Jones,"" he said, adding: ""I would hope to make it before Harrison Ford is 80 and I get much older."""

The ubermyth of all myths is about the EU banning bendy bananas. It's actually not totally a myth. Commission Regulation 2257/94 says bananas must be ""free from malformation or abnormal curvature"". It's not the same as bendy. 46. Then there's the one about children under eight years old not being allowed to blow up balloons. It's not really true. But the EU says the following warning must go on balloons. ""Warning! Children under eight years can choke or suffocate on uninflated or broken balloons. Adult supervision required. Keep uninflated balloons from children. Discard broken balloons at once."" 47. 2.05m EU citizens (non-UK) work in the UK - that's 6.5% of the workforce. 48. It's increased from 2.7% in 2003. 49. Margaret Thatcher negotiated a rebate for Britain in 1984 after telling the EEC: ""I want my money back"". The deal was reached because then 80% of the budget went on the Common Agricultural Policy and comparatively the UK had a very small farming industry. 50. She has been claimed by both sides as EU supporter and detractor. Other dead people invoked in the battle for votes are Emmeline Pankhurst and Boudicca - Brexiteers apparently. 51. But Mrs Thatcher did campaign to stay in the EEC in 1975. 52. The three, living, former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown all support in. 53. God is neutral on the EU argument. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: ""I don't think there is one correct Christian view."" 54. As is the Queen. 55. However, Jeremy Clarkson has, surprisingly, come out as an advocate of remaining in the EU. 56. As has actress Emma Thompson - although she did upset people by calling Britain a nation of caking-eating rain miseries. 57. And the US wants us to stay - well Barack Obama said so. 58. But Sir Michael Caine wants the UK out. 59. As does Boris, Michael Gove and, of course, Nigel Farage. 60. The other major EU countries want the UK to stay too, according to a study last month of voters in Germany, France, Poland, Ireland, Spain and Sweden by the University of Edinburgh and a German think-tank. 61. Although in September 2014 a German Marshall think-tank poll suggested all major EU countries wanted the UK in - apart from France, where research suggested 52% wanted Britain to go. 62. Russia's Vladimir Putin wants us out - there have even been suggestions he was preparing to fund anti-EU movements in the UK. He is pro anything that weakens the EU. 63. Leaving the EU will not affect the UK's right to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. 64. We have a good track record of wins mind you. Ireland has won a record seven times, Sweden six and Luxembourg, France and the United Kingdom five times. 65. 1.26m UK citizens live in the 27 other EU countries - most 381,025 in Spain - the fewest ,54, in Estonia. They could lose health and residency benefits if the UK votes out. 66. 700,000 British citizens who have lived outside the UK for 15 years cannot vote in the referendum. Expat and Second World War veteran, 94-year-old Harry Shindler, lives in Italy and is one of them. 67. A group of expats is preparing legal action against the Government on the issue - they say it could delay the referendum. 68. A third of voters are undecided, a third have already decided in and a third already decided out. 69. Women make up the biggest group of undecideds. 70. It could take longer than two years to properly divorce the EU - there's a lot more than record collections to divvy up. 71. The rules for the break up are set out in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. 72. The results of the EU referendum on 23 June will be announced at Manchester Town Hall. 73. One million more women will vote than men. 74. All the votes will be counted and the side with more than half will be the winner. 75. Unlike the Scottish Independence referendum, 16 year olds will not be able to vote. 76. There are 24 official languages in the EU, English is the most widely spoken - 51% of adults do so. 77. Germany has more McDonald's restaurants than any other country in the EU. 78. The EU has an annual budget of more than £110bn. 79. It is often lambasted for waste - according to auditors it misspent £5.5bn in 2013 - according to Full Fact, that's enough to build 66 hospitals. 80. It once spent £6.4m on a project to promote ""intercultural dialogue"" which featured Donkeypedia - a blogging donkey called Asino. 81. Half of the Conservative Party are in favour of leaving the EU. 82. The majority of Labour MPs will vote to remain. 83. All eight of the Liberal Democrats will vote to stay in. 84. The EU country with the highest life expectancy is Spain (83.2 years) and the lowest is Lithuania (74.1 years). 85. Germany is the biggest user of mobile phones in the EU. 86. A YouGov poll for The Times in January found 28% of UKIP supporters would vote to stay in the EU. 87. Seven Cabinet members back the campaign to leave the EU, 23 back the campaign to remain. 88. The Confederation of British Industry, representing firms employing nearly 7m people, claims eight in 10 firms back the remain campaign. 89. British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU. 90. Two thirds of European footballers playing for UK clubs would not automatically get a work visa if the UK voted to leave the EU, according to a Guardian analysis. 91. There are 161 players from the EU and European Economic Area playing in the Premier League. 92. Of the 28 EU leaders, three are women: Poland's Beata Szydlo, Germany's Angela Merkel and Lithuania's Dalia Grybauskaite. 93. Only 19 countries are in the Euro. 94. EU referendum campaign groups have a spending limit of £7m. 95. The official voting campaign period begins on 15 April. 96. Technically MPs could block the UK leaving the EU because all the legislation to leave needs to go through Parliament. 97. According to Open Europe (Eurosceptic think-tank) the EU rule that costs the UK the most is the Renewable Energy Strategy, which costs £4.7bn a year. 98. There are now more than 40,000 legal acts in the EU. 99. The biggest religious denomination in the EU is Catholicism. 100. 100 days left to the EU referendum."

Three clubs, MK Dons, Northampton Town and Bristol City, are looking into whether their players were involved in the drunken incident. The images appear to show MK Dons midfielder Samir Carruthers, 22, relieving himself in full view of racegoers while in an executive box at the prestigious course. A player poured the contents of a glass over the balcony. Pic: Daily Mail Another picture appeared to show Northampton Town's James Collins urinating into a long glass before pouring its contents over the balcony, as Carruthers and Bristol City defender Luke Ayling look on grinning. The players were joined in the exclusive private box by reality TV star Jessica Hayes and glamour model Katie Salmon, who were photographed flashing their breasts to the crowds. Glamour model Katie Salmon showed her breast. Pic: Daily Mail In a tweet, Cheltenham Racecourse said: ""In regards to images of inappropriate behaviour from yesterday, we have cancelled their booking for today."" A spokesman for the Milton Keynes football team said: ""The club is aware of pictures circulating in the national media of one of its players at the Cheltenham Festival. ""The club has commenced an internal investigation into the matter."" As did Jessica Hayes, who has appeared on reality TV. Pic: Daily Mail Northampton Town FC said it has ""launched an investigation into claims that forward James Collins, currently on loan from Shrewsbury Town, was involved in a drunken incident at Cheltenham racecourse. ""As a club we take any such claims extremely seriously, and we expect the highest standards of behaviour at all times. ""We are unable to comment further until this investigation has been completed."" Bristol City FC said: ""We are aware of the disappointing images from the Cheltenham Festival that have been printed in various national newspapers this morning. Carruthers joined MK Dons in 2014 ""We will be speaking to the players concerned and will take appropriate action where necessary."" The four-day Cheltenham Festival is one of the highlights of the horse racing season, with Zara Phillips among the well-heeled guests at this year's event.

A narrative verdict was delivered at the inquest into the deaths of Captain Thomas Clarke, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, Corporal James Walters, Flight Lieutenant Rakesh Chauhan and Lance Corporal Oliver Thomas in Afghanistan in April 2014. The inquest in Oxford had heard that the Lynx ""disintegrated"" on impact in a remote valley known as ""the bowling alley"" in Kandahar Province. Coroner Darren Salter said: ""The radar altimeter was set below the authorised minimum, it did not alarm in time to prevent the aircraft being accidentally flown into the ground. The Lynx crashed in a remote Kandahar Province valley (file pic) ""It was contributed to by undermanning and unsatisfactory training in the squadron. That led to potential fatigue and skill fade."" The coroner recommended the Ministry of Defence reviews manning levels and the impact this has on strain for service personnel as he delivered a narrative conclusion at Oxford Coroner's Court, lawyers Irwin Mitchell said. The coroner also said flight data recorders should be put into newer aircraft after concerns were raised that a safety alarm had not sounded as the helicopter plummeted to the ground. Last year, an MoD inquiry ruled out enemy fire or a technical problem with the aircraft and said there was evidence to suggest the pilot may have descended rapidly to allow his colleagues to experience weightlessness. Speaking after the verdict, families of those killed in the crash said they felt ""let down"" by the Ministry of Defence and that ""significant question marks"" remain over what caused the accident. In a statement read outside the court, the family of Lance Corporal Thomas said: ""The Ministry of Defence, and those involved, had a duty of care to their employees and passengers, and in our opinion they did not provide Oliver with this by their failure to adhere to the rules and procedures set out, and as a family we feel very let down."" The family of Captain Thomas Clarke said they would never know for certain what caused the tragedy. ""We recognised that his role in the Army Air Corps, as a helicopter pilot, could be dangerous, but he was always the consummate professional, whose flying and leadership skills were held in high regard by his peers and senior officers,"" they said. ""There are still significant question marks over how this accident happened. Expert opinion has differed quite widely so we will never be certain as to the cause."""

The body of Mick Collings, 53, was driven to Kirkleatham Crematorium near Redcar, accompanied by members of motorbike clubs from across the country. The tribute brought roads near the crematorium to a standstill, as the Triumphs, Harley-Davidsons and Suzukis thundered through. Some had photos of Mr Collings fixed to the windshield of their bikes. The crematorium was so full that hundreds were left standing outside in the rain as tributes were read inside the building. Mr Collings left a widow, Lynn, and was a keen member of the Teesriders Motorcycle Club. Mick Collings and the Didcot power station after its collapse Club chairman Joe Johnson said before the funeral that Mr Collings had been ""a really good guy"" and ""one of those blokes that everything he did was 100%."" Club committee member Craig Ransom said: ""We are all devastated, he was a good friend, someone you would be proud to call a friend. ""He is going to leave a massive hole in the club, but most of all he will leave a hole in Lynn's life. ""This is something we always do for a biker funeral, to give respect to that person. ""It's an escort, a procession, it's their final ride so we all ride together."" The decommissioned building known as 'Didcot A' was being prepared for demolition at the time of the collapse last month. Five people were injured and more than 47 others were treated for dust inhalation in the accident. Mr Collings' fellow demolition workers Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, and Chris Huxtable, from Swansea, are still missing."

The man's car was blown up in a busy street in the western district of Charlottenburg about 8am local time. ""Our investigators are working on the assumption that it was an explosive device that caused this,"" said Carsten Mueller, Berlin police deputy chief spokesman. ""[The] explosion occurred inside or on the vehicle."" Police do not believe there was a terrorist motive to the explosion. Gallery: Residents Warned To Stay Inside After Bomb Exploded Police suspect a bomb caused the explosion that killed a man while he was driving through the German capital. Pic: Berlin police Nobody else was injured despite heavy traffic at the time of the blast, Mr Mueller said. The scene was sealed off while bomb experts checked the vehicle but no further explosives were found. Nearby residents were told to close their windows and stay off their balconies. Images from the scene showed the wreckage of the car - a silver Volkswagen Passat - on the wide road. Its windows were blown out and front end smashed in. The vehicle was heading towards the city centre when it exploded. Detectives were still trying to determine the dead man's identity, Mr Mueller said."

The three young men flee but the attacker chases them and takes a second shot before running back to the moped, which is ridden off towards Norwood. A 20-year-old suffered a gunshot wound to his upper thigh during the attack, which happened at around 7pm on Sunday, 7 February. The rider of the moped was described as wearing a light-coloured helmet, while the gunman was wearing a black, full-face helmet with white flashings and dark trousers with white stripes on the leg.

The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said it had become aware of the apparent plans during a visit to Egypt and Tunisia earlier this month. It said it had been told the force would train the Libyan army and provide security for the government. Libya's newly-formed UN-backed Government of National Accord, currently based in Tunisia's capital Tunis, is also set to request airstrikes against Islamic State targets, according to the MPs. But a Government spokesman said what the committee had been told on their recent visit was ""wrong on a number of counts"". He said: ""There are no plans to extend airstrikes to Libya nor are there plans to send British troops to provide security on the ground in Libya. ""It is therefore also wrong to suggest the Defence Secretary will agree any UK contribution this week."" In a letter to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, committee chairman Crispin Blunt said: ""We heard that the GNA's (Government of National Accord's) likely first formal action will be to request that the UK and its allies conduct airstrikes against ISIL (IS) targets in Libya."" Mr Blunt said the ""pre-emptive deployment of UK military forces is now a matter for the House of Commons"" and he urged Mr Hammond to make a statement to Parliament on the issue. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was expected to agree Britain's contribution to the force at a conference in Europe this week, the committee added. Libya descended into chaos after dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was deposed in 2011 which allowed extremist organisations, including IS, to gain significant ground. It left the country deeply divided and ruled by two parliaments: an internationally recognised body based in the eastern city of Tobruk and a rival government, backed by Islamist-allied militias, that controls Tripoli. Western countries have agreed that action is needed to push out IS jihadists from Libya, but world powers have said they wanted a national unity government to request help before formally intervening. On Saturday, Libya's UN-backed unity government said it was taking office, with the US describing the new body as ""the only legitimate government in Libya"". The Government of National Accord said the majority of the previous, internationally backed government in the country's east had endorsed it. But there are concerns over its chances of successfully operating in Tripoli. Italy has agreed to lead a UN-mandated international stabilisation force, but the sticking point has been getting credible backing from a national authority."

2016-03-16,In the end it was not a boring Budget.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160317124225/http://news.sky.com/story/1661104/sugar-tax-the-big-rabbit-in-osbornes-budget,"In the end it was not a boring Budget. For sport-lovers there was Olympic-level fiscal gymnastics designed to keep at least one of George Osborne's fiscal rules intact. He broke the supplementary debt target for debt to be falling in every year. He has already breached the terms of his welfare cap (and that breach is confirmed today as larger). But the story of this Budget is an epic effort to contort the public finances to hit a surplus at the end of the Parliament. Corporation tax revenues are shuffled between years in the several billion, and £3.5bn of unspecified departmental spending cuts pencilled in for 2019/20. No wonder the Chancellor warned of ""storm clouds"". Such bad weather has already hit the public finances with an increase in forecast borrowing since November of £35.6bn over seven years. But within that bigger picture there was plenty of reforming radicalism. :: Key Points: Budget Announcements At A Glance The sugar tax was the big rabbit, the Easter Bunny. But the tax will not be applied to chocolate or fruit juice or cakes or biscuits - just fizzy drinks. And it has such an impact that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says it will increase inflation by 0.25%. Redistribution of a kind in business taxation, with nearly a million small businesses benefiting from reductions and cancellation of business rates. The cost will come from profit-shuffling corporation tax-avoiding large multinationals, recommended by the OECD. On personal tax, some genuine radicalism with the lifetime ISA - a type of flexible pension savings vehicle a little like the American 401k. But the more significant pensions reforms were parked earlier in the month. And frozen fuel duties will stave off any further backbench rebellions. The shadow of Europe loomed large, though. And it was a further piece of political sport that enabled the Chancellor, much to the annoyance of eurosceptics, to harness the OBR forecast towards his case for the UK to stay in the European Union. The general story of financial storm clouds also will be deployed in this direction, too. So - a Chancellor contorting himself to maintain credibility while borrowing more. And using fiscal pain to his advantage re Europe."

So in the spirit of one hundredness, here are 100 things about the EU and the 23 June referendum to help you celebrate the big day: 1. There are 28 members … but you knew that right? 2. And seven institutions (brief list: European Council, European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union, Court of Justice of EU, European Central Bank, Court of Auditors). 3. No country has officially left the EU - the nearest is Greenland in 1985 but that was when it was the European Economic Community (EEC). 4. The EU was officially born on 1 November 1993 when the Maastricht Treaty came into force. 5. But the EEC was created in 1955. 6. By founder members France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Netherlands, Germany. 7. And funded by American spies … well the US intelligence agencies funded groups building momentum for a united Europe. 8. The EU is now 4.325m km2. 9. And its population is 508.2m. 10. It's the world's biggest economy: IMF figures EU $18.5trn,  US $17.9trn, China $11.4trn. 11. The stars on the flag don't really stand for anything like the number of countries but the fact they are in a circle is supposed to represent unity. 12. It dates back to the Council of Europe in 1955. 13. But was adopted by the EEC in 1985. 14. Netherlands currently has the EU presidency. 15. There are 751 MEPs. 16. 73 of them are from the UK. 17. 37% are women. 18. The longest serving is 70-year-old German Hans-Gert Pottering who has been MEP since the first European Parliamentary elections in 1979. 19. The last time the UK voted on membership was 1975 - 67.2% voted to stay. 20. There was a turnout of 65%. 21. The first European Council President Herman Van Rompuy wrote a book of haikus (Japanese-style poems). He wrote this one about the trio presidency of the EU: Three waves roll together into harbour. The trio is home. 22. The current European Council President is former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. 23. The UK joined the EEC in 1973. 24. The most recent EU members are Bulgaria and Romania (2007). 25. The EU won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012. 26. Speaking of which, the UK has the greatest number of Nobel laureates of any EU country. 27. Brexiteers say EU regulation costs the UK £33.3bn every year. 28. Inners say that membership of the EU is worth £3,000 a year to each household. 29. Actually, Full Fact, says the UK paid £13bn to the EU in 2015, got back £4.5bn. 30. That's a net of £8.5bn. 31. Which is 1.27% of Government spending. 32. Kirkholt Working Men's Club in Rochdale is the most Eurosceptic pub in the country,Sky Data shows. The pub's in the electoral ward of Balderstone and Kirkholt  - Simon Danczuk's Rochdale parliamentary constituency. 33. Camp In claims three million jobs depend on the UK remaining in the EU but actually those jobs are just linked to trade with the EU. 34. However, 44.4% of UK exports do go to the EU. 35. Germany is the UK's biggest trading partner. 36. 41% of the EU's budget goes on farmers, the Common Agricultural Policy to be precise. 37. It used to be 80% in the 1980s. 38. The EU has space projects. Chiefly Galileo, Europe's rival to the US' GPS. Only 12 of the total planned 30 satellites have been launched. It is scheduled to be completed in 2020 (13 years late) and costs are reported to be 12.8bn euros (three times over-budget). 39. Every month European Parliament decamps to Strasbourg for votes and speeches ... 40. It costs £93m - and makes a lot of people angry … 41. 1,000 politicians, officials and translators make the move on two specially chartered trains … 42. 2,500 plastic trunks of additional stuff make the 300-mile journey in five lorries. 43.

But the EU says the following warning must go on balloons. ""Warning! Children under eight years can choke or suffocate on uninflated or broken balloons. Adult supervision required. Keep uninflated balloons from children. Discard broken balloons at once."" 47. 2.05m EU citizens (non-UK) work in the UK - that's 6.5% of the workforce. 48. It's increased from 2.7% in 2003. 49.

2016-03-16,The US state of Ohio has been given another chance to execute a killer after botching its first attempt to put him to death.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160317124225/http://news.sky.com/story/1661182/death-chamber-survivor-faces-second-execution,"By Sky News US Team The US state of Ohio has been given another chance to execute a killer after botching its first attempt to put him to death. Romell Broom's 2009 execution had to be called off after the team tried unsuccessfully for two hours to find a suitable vein. The 59-year-old has said he was pierced with needles at least 18 times, with pain so intense he cried and screamed. The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled 4-3 that the state can have another go. Tryna Middleton, 14, was raped and stabbed to death by Broom Broom was sentenced to die for raping and fatally stabbing 14-year-old Tryna Middleton after abducting her in Cleveland in 1984 as she walked home with friends.  In Wednesday's decision, the high court rejected arguments by the death row inmate's lawyers that a second execution would amount to cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy. Prosecutors said double jeopardy does not apply because lethal drugs did not enter Broom's veins while executioners unsuccessfully tried to hook up an IV. No new execution date has been set for Broom Justice Judith Ann Lanzinger agreed, saying the execution did not begin since the drugs were not administered. Justice Judi French wrote in a dissent. ""If the state cannot explain why the Broom execution went wrong, then the state cannot guarantee that the outcome will be different next time."" No new execution date has been set. But a second execution is likely to be years away as the case will undergo a federal appeal. Broom maintains he is innocent of Tryna's murder. Three months after the teenager's killing the mother of an 11-year-old girl thwarted Broom's attempt to abduct her daughter. He was arrested and also charged with Tryna's death."
2016-03-16,George Osborne has defended his credibility following his eighth Budget as the highly regarded Institute of Fiscal Studies prepares to give its verdict on his announcements.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160317124225/http://news.sky.com/story/1660913/osborne-defends-credibility-after-budget,"George Osborne has defended his credibility following his eighth Budget as the highly regarded Institute of Fiscal Studies prepares to give its verdict on his announcements. Speaking on Sky News, the Chancellor said it was ""not fair"" to suggest he had only introduced the sugar tax to distract from the dire state of the nation's finances. Mr Osborne was forced to admit he had broken one of his fiscal rules and Government debt will rise as a proportion of GDP this year - while economic growth forecasts have been revised down sharply. But he has insisted the country can still be in surplus by £10bn by 2019/20 - despite a £55bn black hole in the nation's finances after growth and income revisions. Mr Osborne told Sky News: ""People can judge me and this Government by what's happened to the British economy. Five years ago the British economy was in a total mess, in crisis, today it's growing more strongly than other major economic countries."" However, Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson put the chances of Mr Osborne hitting his surplus target at 50:50, saying the Chancellor would need to find big tax rises or make significant cuts. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""Within his very tight rule he will probably get away with this, this time round. But there's only about a 50:50 shot that he's going to get there."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Budget was the ""culmination of six years of his failures"" and had ""unfairness at its very core"". One of the more high-profile announcements was a sugar tax on soft drinks, which will raise £520m for school sports and longer school days. At the same time the Chancellor said fuel duty would be frozen for the sixth year running along with the levy on beer, cider and whisky. Key Points: Budget Announcements At A Glance Chef Jamie Oliver, a vocal campaigner for a sugar tax, said the Chancellor's announcement that he will tax the soft drinks industry was ""amazing news"". But Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said the move was ""extremely"" disappointing. Defending the Government's austerity drive, the Chancellor said this had enabled the Government to give tax cuts to millions of families with the personal allowance rising to £11,500 next year and the higher 40p rate going up to £45,000. Gallery: Key Points From The Budget 2016 Unveiling changes to business taxes Mr Osborne announced corporation tax would fall to 17% by April 2020. On education, Mr Osborne announced maths could be made a compulsory subject for students until the age of 18. In a move that outraged Tory eurosceptics, Mr Osborne also used his set-piece speech to argue the UK will be ""stronger, safer and better off"" inside a reformed EU. The Chancellor warned against putting at risk the hard work taken to make the economy strong again by quitting the bloc. The ISA limit will be increased to £20,000 a year while lifetime ISAs will be introduced from April 2017 for people aged under 40, which would be topped up by the Government by £1 for every £4 saved until they reach the age of 50. Insurance premium tax is to be increased by 0.5% to generate £700m for flood defences. In help for the oil and gas industry, which has been hit by falling global prices, Mr Osborne said he was ""effectively abolishing Petroleum Revenue Tax"". In a sideswipe at the Scottish nationalists, he said: ""We are only able to provide this kind of support to our oil and gas industry because of the broad shoulders of the United Kingdom."" Mr Osborne said he would introduce additional spending cuts totalling £3.5bn by 2020 - lower than the £4bn expected. Forecasts for UK economic growth have been downgraded. In 2015 it has been reduced from 2.4% to 2.2%, from 2.4% to 2% in 2016, from 2.5% to 2.2% in 2017, from 2.4% to 2.1% in 2018 and from 2.3% to 2.1% in both 2019 and 2020. Meanwhile, forecasts for national debt as a proportion of GDP have been revised upwards in each of the coming years - from 81.7% to 82.6% in 2016/17 and in subsequent years through to 2020/21 when it rises from 71.3% to 74.7%. The deficit - the amount the Government spends above what it brings in - is forecast to fall next year to 2.9%. In 2017/18, it falls to 1.9%, then it falls again to 1.0% in 2018/19. This compares with forecasts for public sector net borrowing in the November 2015 Autumn Statement of 2.5% in 2016/17, 1.2% in 2017/18 and 0.2% in 2018/19. :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,011 Sky customers by SMS on 16th March 2016.

2016-03-16,Dog owners who deliberately train their dogs to be more aggressive will face harsher sentences under new guidelines for judges.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160317124225/http://news.sky.com/story/1661305/owners-of-killer-dogs-face-14-years-in-prison,"By Ashish Joshi, Sky News Reporter Dog owners who deliberately train their dogs to be more aggressive will face harsher sentences under new guidelines for judges. The owner or person in charge of a dangerously out of control dog where a victim dies faces between six and 14 years in prison if they are deemed to have ""high culpability"". This is where the dog is being used as a weapon or is a banned breed. People who are already disqualified from owning a dog will also face the toughest penalties. The Sentencing Council is publishing new guidelines for how courts should approach dangerous dog offences. The guidelines are needed because changes were made to the Dangerous Dogs Act in made in 2014. For the first time, the Act includes attacks on private property as an offence - and this covers incidents such as a guest being injured by a dog in someone's home, or a postal worker being attacked in a front garden. Under the guidelines, there will be sharp jumps in maximum sentences, with the harshest punishment for an offence where someone is killed increasing from two to 14 years. The guidelines will help judges to assess how much blame can be attached to dog owners, with some people deliberately training dogs to be dangerous, while other offences may involve a momentary lapse of control over a dog by an otherwise responsible owner. District Judge Richard Williams, a member of the Sentencing Council, said: ""We know that the majority of dog owners are responsible and ensure their pets do not put anyone in danger, but there are some irresponsible owners whose dogs do put people at risk of injury and in some cases even death."" Malcolm Richardson, national chairman of the Magistrates Association, said: ""Because no two cases are the same, magistrates appreciate having as flexible a range of guidelines at their disposal as possible. It helps them to do their job of steering justice fairly."" There is also a new guideline to cover an offence - introduced in 2014 - relating to incidents where assistance dogs are injured or killed. James White, of the charity Guide Dogs, welcomed the recommendation, saying: ""Sadly, every year we hear of more than 100 guide dogs being attacked by other dogs."" The guidelines will come into force in courts in England and Wales from July. Last year figures showed that the number of people taken to hospital after dog attacks has soared by 76% in the past decade. As of May, at least 21 people, including 13 children, had died in England and Wales in the past 10 years from dog attacks."

Joe Corre intends to perform the ritual in Camden on 26 November to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Sex Pistols' first single Anarchy In The UK. The founder of lingerie brand Agent Provocateur said it would be a protest against the way punk's legacy has been ""appropriated"" by the establishment. The focus of his anger is Punk London, an event celebrating the history of punk music and made possible by a £99,000 Lottery grant. The Sex Pistols: Steve Jones, Johnny Rotten, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook Among the organisations backing it are the British Film Institute, the British Museum, the Design Museum, Rough Trade, and the Roundhouse. According to Corre, it also has the support of the Queen, who was mocked by the Sex Pistols in their 1977 hit God Save The Queen, released to coincide with her Silver Jubilee. He said: ""The Queen giving 2016, the Year of Punk, her official blessing is the most frightening thing I've ever heard. ""Talk about alternative and punk culture being appropriated by the mainstream. ""Rather than a movement for change, punk has become like a f****** museum piece or a tribute act."" Corre also bemoans a ""general malaise"" which he says has ""now set in amongst the British public"". Westwood (left) and McLaren (centre) ""People don't feel they have a voice anymore. The most dangerous thing is that they have stopped fighting for what they believe in. ""They have given up the chase. We need to explode all the s*** once more."" Corre has not said what he will be burning although he has invited other punk faithful to join the protest. The Sex Pistols only produced four singles and one album but are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of music. The subjects addressed in their anti-establishment songs included the music industry, fascism, the British Royal Family and the Holocaust."

Chris Stephenson, an academic at Bilgi University in Istanbul, says he was summarily dismissed after he visited a courthouse to support three scholars charged with terrorism offences. Speaking moments before his departure from Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport, he said there was ""no offence, no trial, just an administrative decision to deport me after 25 years of residency in Turkey … this is very scary and wrong"". He later tweeted: ""I am being deported at the airport. Tomorrow an application will be submitted to the administrative court for my return."" There was no immediate comment from Turkish officials. Off to the cells. Britain's Foreign Office said it was providing assistance to a British national arrested on Tuesday. Mr Stephenson's lawyer said his client had been resident in Turkey since 1991, is married to a Turk and has a 13-year-old daughter. He was one of more than 1,000 academics who recently signed a petition criticising military action in the southeast. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Turkey would ""redefine"" terrorism and terrorists so that legal action could be undertaken against anyone supporting terrorism, including academics and journalists. The next day, three Turkish scholars were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences. Mr Stephenson said the invitations in his bag were issued by the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party. A reference to Kurdish self-determination as well as a small picture of a barricade were deemed by the prosecutor to constitute terror propaganda, he said.

A ceasefire broke down in July, unleashing some of the worst violence in the history of the conflict.

2016-03-16,"UK taxpayers could lose more than £20bn if George Osborne presses ahead with the sale of the Government's remaining stake in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), according to an official forecast published on Wednesday.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160317124225/http://news.sky.com/story/1661144/taxpayers-face-20bn-loss-on-rbs-share-sales,"By Mark Kleinman, City Editor UK taxpayers could lose more than £20bn if George Osborne presses ahead with the sale of the Government's remaining stake in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), according to an official forecast published on Wednesday. An analysis by Sky News of figures published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggests that the Treasury could recoup a total of just £23.6bn from the disposal of its RBS stake, barely half the £45.5bn injected into the bank to prevent its collapse in 2008. In its Economic and Fiscal Outlook released to coincide with the Chancellor's Budget statement, the OBR said it expected ""proceeds [from RBS] to total £21.5bn between 2016-17 and 2019-20, with nothing in 2020-21"". A £2.1bn stake in the lender was sold last August, but its crystallisation of a £1bn loss for taxpayers has prompted demands for an inquiry.  Sources suggested that the forecast implied that the taxpayer's 73% shareholding could be reduced to zero by the end of this parliament. The Treasury said on Wednesday that it expected to recoup £25bn from RBS share sales before the end of 2019-20, a figure which includes £1.2bn from the bank's redemption of an instrument enabling it to resume paying dividends after a decade-long absence. Recent volatility in equity markets generally, and bank shares specifically, has damaged Mr Osborne's hopes of successfully disposing of the stakes taken by the Government in 2008. RBS shares closed on Wednesday at 234.3p, compared to the 502p average cost of the holding bought by the then Labour government nearly eight years ago. In last November's Autumn Statement, the Treasury predicted it would generate £30.8bn from selling RBS stock by 2020-21, but the omission of an objective for 2020-21 in Wednesday's Budget suggests he may be seeking to undertake a more rapid disposal of the Government's stake. The Chancellor has already been forced to postpone plans for an offering of Lloyds Banking Group shares to ordinary investors, although he reiterated that he hoped to do so during the next financial year. Mr Osborne also confirmed that he was seeking to sell the remnants of the Bradford & Bingley loan book in a series of transactions aimed at recouping ""sufficient proceeds for B&B to repay the £15.65bn debt to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and, in turn, the corresponding loan from the Treasury"". The OBR said: ""Relative to our November forecast, we expect the Government to receive about £4bn less in 2015-16, reflecting the net effect of the postponed Lloyds share sales and the earlier receipt of the RBS DAS payment. ""We then forecast that the Government will receive about £11bn more over the rest of the Parliament, with the additional UKAR sale more than offsetting the effect of the lower RBS share price."""

In a statement, his sister Nancy said: ""The Sinatra family mourn the untimely passing of their son, brother, father, uncle Frank Sinatra Jr of cardiac arrest while on tour in Dayton, Florida."" The 72-year-old had travelled there to perform his Sinatra Sings Sinatra show, where he did renditions of his father's greatest hits. Sinatra Jr was famously kidnapped at gunpoint as a teenager, by young men who were demanding a ransom of $240,000 (£168,000). Two days later, he was released unharmed after the money was paid - and the criminals behind the kidnap plot were later jailed. Sinatra Jr was kidnapped aged 19 in a bid to extort money from his father In the years before his father's death in 1998, Sinatra Jr served as the iconic singer's musical director and conductor. He was Sinatra Sr's middle child, and in interviews, described seeing the likes of Dean Martin and Sammy Davies Jr perform from the wings of the stage. In a recent interview with The Daytona Beach News-Journal, he said he never felt ashamed for failing to achieve the dizzying fame enjoyed by his father. He said: ""I think in my generation, when I came along in the early 1960s, the type of music that was in vogue in society in those days had moved on to another type of music. ""I was trying to sell antiques in a modern appliance store."" Sinatra Jr is survived by his son, Michael."

Kathryn Smith, 23, made the comment after social services had raised the prospect of taking Ayeeshia Jane Smith - also known as AJ - into care, jurors were told. Smith and Ayeeshia's stepfather Matthew Rigby are both accused of killing the child, who died from a heart laceration. The wound was caused by a foot stamp at the family home in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire on 1 May, 2014, prosecutors claim. A post-mortem examination identified a catalogue of other current and historic injuries which the prosecution said were deliberately inflicted. Health visitor Sarah Shaw claimed during a home visit on 29 April, 2013, she saw damage to Smith's front door, caused by her then partner Joshua Collier, and the young mother was very clearly upset. Ayeeshia's mother Kathryn Smith Ms Shaw said: ""She got angry, swearing and stating to us to 'just take AJ away' because that is what we were going to do anyway and 'because I am such a crap mother'."" The experienced health worker and qualified children's nurse described Smith, then living in supported housing in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, as ""young and vulnerable"". At the time Smith had also recently had a termination of a pregnancy and Mr Collier was the father, said John Butterfield QC, representing Smith. Smith told Ms Shaw her then boyfriend verbally abused her and kicked her in her stomach, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Jurors heard Derbyshire social services kept Ayeeshia on a safeguarding plan under the ""emotional abuse"" category. The baby was taken into foster care in June 2013. Ayeeshia's stepfather Matthew Rigby Ayeeshia was returned to Smith's care in October that year and shortly afterwards social services became aware of her dating 22-year-old Rigby. In January 2014, it emerged Smith lied to Ms Shaw about the fact Rigby had damaged the front door of her flat, when initially blaming it on other residents. The health visitor also asked about a cut on Ayeeshia's bottom lip and another under her chin. Smith told her the toddler had a cold-sore coming, while the child's natural father Ricky Booth said the child tripped during a contact visit at his home that weekend. Ms Shaw told the jury: ""Both cuts and scabs looked bright red in colour, fresher than the weekend.""

Peers voted down plans to force existing trade union members to ""opt in"" if they wanted to contribute to their organisation's political fund - reversing the current requirement of opting out. In what has been described as ""a compromise"", this change will only apply to new trade union members - as recommended by a cross-party amendment in the upper house which was passed by 320 votes to 172, a majority of 148. Unions will be given a 12-month transition period to introduce the opt-in scheme. Government proposals to introduce a pilot programme of electronic balloting when trade unions vote for industrial action were also rejected. The defeats have prompted calls for the Government to scrap the controversial reforms altogether. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""This is an important result for the six million trade union members across the UK. But it's a bad day for the Government. ""The Government has tried to force this bill through Parliament, ignoring objections from all sides of the house. Once again, peers have rightly held them back. ""The Government needs to think again and withdraw this damaging and divisive bill."" Baroness Smith, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, said the ""resounding defeat"" showed that the Government had made a poor effort in making its case for an overhaul of trade union finances. Of the measures passed, she said: ""Those proposals would certainly not be pain-free for the Labour Party but they suggest a proportionate, reasonable and practical compromise. ""A compromise that would allow the Government to fulfil its manifesto commitment without placing unrealistic demands on the trade union movement."" She called on MPs to respond ""in an equally reasonable way when the issue comes to the floor of the House of Commons after Easter"". A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: ""While we will continue to work with members of the House of Lords and try to address their concerns, we are determined to ensure that all manifesto commitments are delivered in full."""

The 39-year-old was taken to hospital with arm and leg injuries and he was ""extremely fortunate"" to have escaped more serious harm. The officer, from the Met's Roads and Transport Policing Command (RTPC), was on patrol in Kennington Park Road, SE11, at around 2.45pm on Wednesday when he tried to stop a black Vauxhall Meriva. A police spokesman said: ""The vehicle appeared to deliberately run over the officer who had got off his bicycle. ""He was struck by the car and ended up on the bonnet before falling to the ground. ""The suspects drove off at speed in the direction of Peckham, via Camberwell Green Road."" The officer has now been released from hospital and is recovering at home. The car was found abandoned less than a mile away in Frederick Crescent. Detective Sergeant Ranjit Sekhon, from the RTPC, appealed for people who saw the incident or the car speeding away afterwards to contact police. He added: ""I would also like to speak with anyone who saw two men running from the car after it was parked in Frederick Crescent. ""It is extremely fortunate that the officer, who was attempting a routine traffic stop, was not more seriously injured. ""It is important that we speak with as many people as possible to piece together the moments leading up to the collision."" Two men, aged 22 and 23, have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. They remain in custody at a south London police station."

Almost 700 people have been denied admission to the country since Operation Sovereign Borders was launched in September 2013. Under it, asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat are turned back to their country of departure or sent to remote Pacific island camps. A boat with suspected asylum seekers is escorted to Christmas Island They are not allowed to resettle in Australia even if they are found to be genuine refugees. The conservative government claims the measures help prevent deaths at sea. :: EU Meets Over 'One In, One Out' Deal Under the previous Labour administration, at least 1,200 people died trying to reach Australia by boat between 2008 and 2013. The detention centre at Christmas Island Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said: ""Tomorrow (Friday) marks 600 days since the last successful people-smuggling venture to our country and the government's absolutely determined to make sure that it stays that way."" He added that 25 boats carrying 698 people had been turned back and ""safely returned to their country of departure"" since the policy was introduced. Civil rights groups have criticised conditions at the camps, while doctors have said the detention of children in particular has left some struggling with mental health problems. Protest against Australia's asylum seeker policies Amnesty International has also called for an independent review into claims that Australian authorities paid people smugglers US$30,000 to return 65 asylum-seekers to Indonesia. Mr Dutton said he was ""very proud"" the number of children in detention had fallen from almost 2,000 in June 2013 to just 29, and he was working to bring it down further. Allegations of rape and other forms of abuse at one camp in Nauru were raised at a parliamentary inquiry last year. A doctor who assessed inmates there said living conditions were unsafe and put vulnerable women and children at ""considerable"" risk."

According to a Government source, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will outline ""the next stages of reform to English education"" during a speech in central London this afternoon. She will also address how it will work to have a school system made up entirely of academies, as was announced on Wednesday during the Chancellor's Budget. It is, as yet, unclear what the changes will be - but teachers fear the reforms will bring increased pressures on the profession. Jerry Glazier, executive member of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), told Sky News: ""They are failing to address the excessive workload of teachers and they are failing to value the profession - and that is having a profound impact on the supply of teachers."" A series of education reforms have been announced in recent days - including plans to turn all schools into academies, extend normal school hours to 4.30pm, and look at teaching mathematics to all children up to the age of 18. Dan Abramson, the head of King's College Mathematics School, told Sky News he welcomed a greater emphasis on his subject. ""It is still the case in the UK that it is OK to say 'I'm not good at maths' and I have a problem with that. It's not OK to say 'I can't read'. We need to change that,"" Mr Abramson added. But Sebastian Monnet, a student at the college, said: ""I don't think it's a good idea. People give up maths because they don't enjoy it - and it is unlikely that in those two years they are going to start concentrating and excelling at it if they wanted to drop it in the first place. ""And if that happens, we are just wasting good maths teachers that are scarce on these students who aren't going to do particularly well in mathematics."" At Huntington School in York, head teacher John Tomsett likes the Government's sentiment but questions where the resources will come from. ""We really need great mathematicians and you can't magic them up by nothing, but you can't magic up teachers to teach them to 18,"" he said. ""It is hard enough finding really good maths teachers as it is. It is one of the key crisis shortage subjects in this country."""

The force had been granted £700,000 by the Home Office last January to commit further resources to the investigation, but that money would have run out by the end of this month. Alan Billings, South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner, has said the latest instalment will allow work to continue until October - enabling the team ""to be strengthened with experienced detectives who will follow up new leads"". Ben was 21 months old when he disappeared on 24 July 1991 after travelling to the Greek island of Kos with his mother and grandparents. He would now be 26 years old, and there have been several possible sightings and a plethora of theories about what happened to the youngster. Gallery: Key Events: Disappearance Of Ben Needham Ben Needham was just 21 months old when he disappeared on July 24 1991 on the Greek Island of Kos. He was on holiday with his mother, Kerry, and grandparents, Eddie and Christine Needham ""I fully support South Yorkshire Police in their ongoing pursuit of the facts,"" Dr Billings said. ""They have worked hard in facilitating the Greek authorities' investigation into Ben's disappearance. They have unearthed many new witnesses and have been able to rule out other lines of inquiry. ""Along with the Chief Constable, I remain committed to finding Ben. We remain hopeful that this will lead to a resolution one way or another."" Last May, Ben's family appeared alongside police on Greek television to make an emotional appeal for information - prompting dozens of calls. His mother, Kerry Needham, had said: ""Please end the pain my family are suffering. I know he's out there somewhere, please call the detectives and put an end to it."" During the broadcast, she described the heartbreak she had felt when DNA tests carried out on young men who had come forward to the police were unsuccessful. In 2012, land was excavated near the farmhouse where Ben vanished, but no trace of the little boy was found. The Home Office's Special Grant Funding was first requested by South Yorkshire Police in order to follow up leads that Ben's family believed had never been properly investigated."

Government health agencies are investigating how the condition canine babesiosis affected four dogs that have never travelled outside England. One dog is reported to have died of the disease, and the others have been taken seriously ill. The outbreak has been traced to an area of Harlow in Essex, but it is feared the disease could spread elsewhere, despite measures to contain it. Babesiosis attacks the blood cells of dogs. The symptoms include fever, lethargy, pale gums and general weakness, and if left untreated it can be fatal. Vets have needed to perform emergency blood transfusions to combat the disease. Harlow Council said: ""It is important that dog owners have their pets protected with anti-tick treatment and regularly check their dogs for ticks. Further advice is available from local vets."" Councillor Mark Wilkinson said the area was popular with dog walkers, and added that the the alert was ""purely precautionary"". ""Further tests are going to be carried out on the land once the weather improves, and if necessary further advice will be issued,"" he said. ""The council is also in contact with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and is seeking any further advice from them."" The website PetMD.com advises owners to do a thorough body check of their dog to find ticks, which are visible to the naked eye but can be drawn to dark, hidden areas of the animal's body such as ears, groin and between the toes. Signs of ticks include dogs excessively scratching or licking a particular area. To remove a tick, owners are advised to use tweezers to grip the tick by the head and pull it straight out, and not to twist, burn or apply anything to the skin. The tick can be killed once it has been removed by putting it in a small amount of alcohol, rather than squashing it. There are concerns the tick could also be carried by wild animals."

The television star was released from hospital last week after being told that the tumour was incurable. On 7 March, Daniels' wife Debbie McGee said the family had been inundated with ""wonderful messages "" of support from fans and friends. The tumour was found when the entertainer fell and was rushed to hospital suspected of suffering a stroke. On his wedding day with McGee Daniels was at his Berkshire home with McGee when he died in the early hours of Thursday. A statement from his publicist said: ""One of our most beloved entertainers, Paul Daniels, has passed away at the age of 77. It is with incredible sadness that  I can confirm that Dad, @ThePaulDaniels, passed away over night. pic.twitter.com/XhZepFJ4DW ""The TV star, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour earlier this year, passed away peacefully at home with Debbie at his side in the early hours of this morning. ""Debbie and the family would like to thank everyone for their support and asks that their privacy be respected at this sad time."" Daniels' son Gary tweeted to confirm his father's death alongside a picture of a crying white rabbit in a magician's black top hat. :: Read the tributes to Paul Daniels here One of the most popular magicians of the 20th century, his success was unrivalled in the magic and entertainment world. His wit, charm, and magic skills earned him a reputation which meant that he performed for Princes William and Harry, Prime Ministers John Major and James Callaghan, Prince Rainier of Monaco and others. Born in South Bank, Middlesbrough as Newton Edward Daniels, the TV personality's interest in magic began aged 11 when he read a book called How To Entertain At Parties. After serving as a conscript with the 1st Battalion, the Green Howards, in Hong Kong he started working in clubs where he developed his famous catchphrase: ""You'll like this ... not a lot, but you'll like it."" He made his television debut on Opportunity Knocks in 1970 where he came second. ITV gave him his own show in 1978 and he moved to the BBC the following year with The Paul Daniels Magic Show which attracted 15 million viewers in the UK and ran until 1994. Daniels also starred in his own stage show called It's Magic which became one of London's longest-running magic shows in the 1980s. It was at this time that he met his second wife McGee, whose role as his assistant became a major feature of his act and the couple married in 1988. In 1987 Daniels hosted a controversial Halloween live special where he replicated a trick called the Iron Maiden. It was deliberately staged to look as though it had gone wrong and that he had been killed. Dozens of people complained to the BBC when the credits rolled but he later made an appearance between programmes to show he had successfully escaped from the device. Daniels was known for his outspoken views on everything from the Conservative Party to climate change. He was dismissive of modern illusionists, describing David Blaine as ""not very original"". In 2012 Daniels cut off his left index finger and the tip of his ring finger while using a circular saw in his garden. He drove himself to hospital where the index finger was reattached. In his later years, Daniels and his wife toured the country with magic and comedy shows, entertaining old fans and new generations alike with his skills. He had three sons with his first wife Jacqueline Skipworth. His youngest son Martin regularly appeared on his TV shows and is now an entertainer himself."
2016-03-17,The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 0.5% marking seven years at which they have remained at the historic low - and warned of the impact of uncertainty over the EU referendum.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160318023726/http://news.sky.com/story/1661692/eu-vote-warning-as-bank-rate-left-on-hold,"The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 0.5% marking seven years at which they have remained at the historic low - and warned of the impact of uncertainty over the EU referendum. All nine members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep rates at the same level they have been since March 2009, when they were cut to try to help nurse the economy back to health from recession. Continued low interest rates have boosted borrowers who have benefited from rock-bottom mortgage rates but savers have suffered. Analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown finds that they have lost out on about £160bn in interest compared with rates in 2008. Announcing its latest decision, the MPC said uncertainty over the EU referendum was likely to have been a key factor in the recent fall in the pound and warned that this uncertainty could also delay some spending decisions and weigh on demand in the economy in the short term. However it said that overall the outlook for the UK economy was little changed from the time of the Bank's quarterly inflation report last month and maintained its stance that the next move in rates would be a rise rather than a cut. The announcement comes a day after the independent Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded its growth forecasts for the UK for every year until 2020. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve has also said it is leaving interest rates on hold amid slowing global growth and turbulence in financial markets - while also saying it expects to see fewer rate hikes this year than previously expected. The Bank of England's rates decisions target inflation at 2% but the latest reading of 0.3% for January was well below that, and also a little lower than Bank officials had expected. It said it saw continued growth in advanced economies though emerging markets looked set for a slowdown. The Bank's referendum warning comes after governor Mark Carney clashed with a eurosceptic MP earlier this month when he warned that quitting the EU posed the ""biggest domestic risk to financial stability"".  Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The MPC's decision to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5% today – marking the seventh anniversary of rates being at this record low – was unsurprising given the softness of recent activity indicators and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook. ""The combination of referendum uncertainty and fiscal austerity will keep rates on hold for a while yet – albeit not for as long as markets think."""

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said revisions to productivity forecasts set out by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) would have repercussions for everyone and not just the public finances. These changes had resulted in £56bn lost ""down the back of the sofa"" according to the OBR's Budget predictions compared to its previous expectations at the time of the Autumn Statement in November. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""That loss largely arises from changes in assumptions about future productivity growth feeding in to lower economic growth over the rest of the Parliament. If the OBR is right about that we should all be worried. ""This will lead to lower wages and living standards, not just lower tax revenues for the Treasury."" Productivity - measuring economic output per hour worked - is a key measure because it is seen as the driver of income growth. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said the nation's shared prosperity depends on it. Now it has proved to be a crucial factor in the official outlook for the economy and, in turn, the public purse. :: Key Points: Budget Announcements At A Glance Setting out the IFS analysis, Mr Johnson took Chancellor Osborne to task saying he had ""made rather too much"" of an extra £27bn ""found down the back of the sofa"" by the OBR in November. Since then, mainly due to the lower productivity forecast, it had lost £56bn resulting in a net loss of £29bn over the two fiscal announcements, he said. Gallery: Key Points From The Budget 2016 The analysis raised questions about how the Chancellor continues to expect that he will achieve a Budget surplus by the 2019/20 financial year, saying it appeared to be based on ""shuffling of money"" as well as a ""wholly unspecified"" spending cut of £3.5bn. In the longer term, public finances are kept on track ""only by adding yet another year of planned austerity"" with spending in 2020/21 now set to be £10bn less than planned. Mr Johnson said the Chancellor was ""running out of wriggle room"" to achieve his self-imposed target of achieving a surplus by the time of the next general election. But he added that the target was ""economically irrelevant"" because public finances will still be in much better shape than they were and the deficit nearly eliminated. ""That will represent a huge turnaround over the decade,"" Mr Johnson said. :: Sugar Tax The Big Rabbit In Osborne's Budget Elsewhere the IFS gave a mixed verdict on the Chancellor's measures to tackle tax avoidance, saying they may also reduce incentives for genuine investment. Meanwhile the case for a sugar tax was described as ""a sound one in economic terms"" though it as a ""curious structure"" and cuts to capital gains tax follow in the tradition of ""confused and indecisive chancellors"", according to the IFS. Separate analysis by the Resolution Foundation found that Mr Osborne's Budget changes to income tax thresholds would boost the incomes of the richest fifth of households by an average £225, and the poorest fifth by just £10. Earlier, the Chancellor defended his credibility ahead of the much-anticipated IFS report, saying it was ""not fair"" to say his high profile announcement of a sugar tax on soft drinks had been introduced to distract from weak economic figures. Mr Osborne told Sky News: ""People can judge me and this Government by what's happened to the British economy. ""Five years ago the British economy was in a total mess, in crisis, today it's growing more strongly than other major economic countries."""

The father, identified as Ghazi H, is demanding justice over the murder of 21-year-old Shilan. He claims she was murdered by relatives after rejecting an arranged marriage to her cousin. Ghazi, 50, said his family had fled Iraq and headed to Germany when his daughter was just three years old. She had grown up as a self-confident young woman with German citizenship, studying property management at a college in Hanover. He wrote: ""It is with the deepest sense of loss and pain that I announce the loss of my daughter. ""She died in a pool of her own blood, as a victim of a treacherous tradition."" Honour killing victim Shilan Ghazi claimed two of his brothers, Numan and Hassan, had tried to arrange a forced marriage for Shilan to her cousin Sefin while he was away in Iraq. On his return he said Shilan told him she did not love the 22-year-old and did not want to marry him. ""She begged me to do something and so I cancelled the engagement,"" he said. ""[But] Numan and his son Sefin... refused to accept it. They were determined to take revenge to ensure honour was preserved."" Shilan was shot in the head three times during a wedding ceremony in Hanover on 13 March. The gun has been recovered and German police have reportedly issued an arrest warrant for Sefin. ""What they did was a terrible crime, against an innocent victim. They seem to forget that we are living here in Europe,"" Ghazi said."

Works by celebrated artists, including the Glasgow Boys, Allan Ramsay and Sir David Wilkie are among the exhibits on show at Buckingham Palace. George IV entering the Palace of Holyroodhouse by Sir David Wilkie More than 80 works from the Royal Collection cover the 18th and 19th centuries and depict a wide range of subjects varying from Spanish street scenes to romantic Highland views. The exhibition also includes the first known image of the 18-year-old Queen Victoria as reigning monarch, portrayed four months after her accession. Wilkie's oil sketch is a study for his 1838 painting The First Council of Queen Victoria, which Victoria liked initially but later described as ""one of the worst pictures I have ever seen, both as to painting and likeness"". Sir David Wilkie's Blind Man's Buff (L) and The Penny Weddihng Victoria's disapproval of Wilkie was not enough to curb his success as Principal Painter in Ordinary, a role to which he was appointed in 1830, serving under William IV and Victoria. He took over the role from Ramsay, the first Scot to be appointed to the post and who was commissioned to paint George III's State Portrait following the king's accession in 1760. The exhibition also features images of Balmoral and Lochnagar painted shortly after the royal acquisition of the Highland estate. Victoria's own favourite Scottish artist John Philip is also featured - she and Prince Albert exchanged his paintings as gifts. The Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace Exhibition curator Deborah Clarke of the Royal Collection Trust said: ""This exhibition brings together a large group of significant works that have not been seen together in London before. ""It is a fascinating reflection of the monarchy's long association with artists from Scotland, an interest that has continued until the present day."" Scottish Artists 1750-1900: From Caledonia to the Continent is on show at the Queen's Gallery until 9 October."

But, altogether in 2015, there was a fall of 3% - to 280 people - in the number of people arrested in connection with terrorism-related investigations. According to a Home Office report, that overall fall is connected with a drop in the number of people arrested in connection with domestic terrorism. Also, in the same study, the number of women arrested has also risen, with 45 female suspects held last year, up from 15 on 2014. Statisticians say that figure continues the ""upward trend"" revealed in recent years. In contrast, there has been a small rise in arrests linked to international terrorism, which now accounts for more than three-quarters (79%) of all arrests.

2016-03-17,Australia has hailed its controversial policy of turning back asylum-seeker boats after no vessels reached the country in 600 days.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160318023726/http://news.sky.com/story/1661467/australia-hails-600-days-of-no-asylum-boats,"Australia has hailed its controversial policy of turning back asylum-seeker boats after no vessels reached the country in 600 days. Almost 700 people have been denied admission to the country since Operation Sovereign Borders was launched in September 2013. Under it, asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat are turned back to their country of departure or sent to remote Pacific island camps. A boat with suspected asylum seekers is escorted to Christmas Island They are not allowed to resettle in Australia even if they are found to be genuine refugees. The conservative government claims the measures help prevent deaths at sea. :: EU Meets Over 'One In, One Out' Deal Under the previous Labour administration, at least 1,200 people died trying to reach Australia by boat between 2008 and 2013. The detention centre at Christmas Island Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said: ""Tomorrow (Friday) marks 600 days since the last successful people-smuggling venture to our country and the government's absolutely determined to make sure that it stays that way."" He added that 25 boats carrying 698 people had been turned back and ""safely returned to their country of departure"" since the policy was introduced. Civil rights groups have criticised conditions at the camps, while doctors have said the detention of children in particular has left some struggling with mental health problems. Protest against Australia's asylum seeker policies Amnesty International has also called for an independent review into claims that Australian authorities paid people smugglers US$30,000 to return 65 asylum-seekers to Indonesia. Mr Dutton said he was ""very proud"" the number of children in detention had fallen from almost 2,000 in June 2013 to just 29, and he was working to bring it down further. Allegations of rape and other forms of abuse at one camp in Nauru were raised at a parliamentary inquiry last year. A doctor who assessed inmates there said living conditions were unsafe and put vulnerable women and children at ""considerable"" risk."

The cluster of stars around 170,000 light years from Earth is the largest group of very massive stars ever identified. They were discovered by an international team led by astronomers from Sheffield University. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit in 1990 and is nearing the end of its life, but is still proving useful. The cluster is called R136, and measures a few light years across. Gallery: Hubble Space Telescope's 25th Anniversary Unbeatable: Twenty-five years have passed since the Hubble Space Telescope was launched.This Eagle Nebula is a tall, dense tower of gas sculpted by ultraviolet light from massive, hot stars It sits in the Tarantula Nebula inside the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. It is extremely large, hot and bright stars whose energy is radiated mainly in the ultra violet. Nine of the stars are more than 100 times the mass of the Sun - and were described as ""monster"" on the Hubble Twitter account - while dozens are 50 times larger. But while they are huge, none of them are larger than R126a1 - also in the Tarantula Nebula - which is the most massive star in the known universe and 250 times larger than our Sun. Back in 2010 Professor Paul Crowther from Sheffield University helped discover the existence of four stars within R136, each more than 150 times the mass of the Sun. They exceeded the generally accepted upper-mass limit for stars, surprising scientists. The discovery of five more huge solar masses could pose questions about how they all formed. Saida Caballero-Nieves, also from the university, said: ""There have been suggestions that these monsters result from the merger of less extreme stars in close binary systems. ""From what we know about the frequency of massive mergers, this scenario can't account for all the really massive stars that we see in R136, so it would appear that such stars can originate from the star formation process."" Prof Crowther said: ""Once again, our work demonstrates that, despite being in orbit for over 25 years, there are some areas of science for which Hubble is still uniquely capable."" Data from the Hubble is still being analysed, as the team looks for binary star systems in R136 that could produce huge black hole binaries."

2016-03-17,Today marks 100 days until the referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Union.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160318023726/http://news.sky.com/story/1659788/100-things-about-eu-with-100-days-until-vote,"Today marks 100 days until the referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Union. So in the spirit of one hundredness, here are 100 things about the EU and the 23 June referendum to help you celebrate the big day: 1. There are 28 members … but you knew that right? 2. And seven institutions (brief list: European Council, European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union, Court of Justice of EU, European Central Bank, Court of Auditors). 3. No country has officially left the EU - the nearest is Greenland in 1985 but that was when it was the European Economic Community (EEC). 4. The EU was officially born on 1 November 1993 when the Maastricht Treaty came into force. 5. But the EEC was created in 1955. 6. By founder members France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Netherlands, Germany. 7. And funded by American spies … well the US intelligence agencies funded groups building momentum for a united Europe. 8. The EU is now 4.325m km2. 9. And its population is 508.2m. 10. It's the world's biggest economy: IMF figures EU $18.5trn,  US $17.9trn, China $11.4trn. 11. The stars on the flag don't really stand for anything like the number of countries but the fact they are in a circle is supposed to represent unity. 12. It dates back to the Council of Europe in 1955. 13. But was adopted by the EEC in 1985. 14. Netherlands currently has the EU presidency. 15. There are 751 MEPs. 16. 73 of them are from the UK. 17. 37% are women. 18. The longest serving is 70-year-old German Hans-Gert Pottering who has been MEP since the first European Parliamentary elections in 1979. 19. The last time the UK voted on membership was 1975 - 67.2% voted to stay. 20. There was a turnout of 65%. 21. The first European Council President Herman Van Rompuy wrote a book of haikus (Japanese-style poems). He wrote this one about the trio presidency of the EU: Three waves roll together into harbour. The trio is home. 22. The current European Council President is former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. 23. The UK joined the EEC in 1973. 24. The most recent EU members are Bulgaria and Romania (2007). 25. The EU won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012. 26. Speaking of which, the UK has the greatest number of Nobel laureates of any EU country. 27. Brexiteers say EU regulation costs the UK £33.3bn every year. 28. Inners say that membership of the EU is worth £3,000 a year to each household. 29. Actually, Full Fact, says the UK paid £13bn to the EU in 2015, got back £4.5bn. 30. That's a net of £8.5bn. 31. Which is 1.27% of Government spending. 32. Kirkholt Working Men's Club in Rochdale is the most Eurosceptic pub in the country,Sky Data shows. The pub's in the electoral ward of Balderstone and Kirkholt  - Simon Danczuk's Rochdale parliamentary constituency. 33. Camp In claims three million jobs depend on the UK remaining in the EU but actually those jobs are just linked to trade with the EU. 34. However, 44.4% of UK exports do go to the EU. 35. Germany is the UK's biggest trading partner. 36. 41% of the EU's budget goes on farmers, the Common Agricultural Policy to be precise. 37. It used to be 80% in the 1980s. 38. The EU has space projects. Chiefly Galileo, Europe's rival to the US' GPS. Only 12 of the total planned 30 satellites have been launched. It is scheduled to be completed in 2020 (13 years late) and costs are reported to be 12.8bn euros (three times over-budget). 39. Every month European Parliament decamps to Strasbourg for votes and speeches ... 40. It costs £93m - and makes a lot of people angry … 41. 1,000 politicians, officials and translators make the move on two specially chartered trains … 42. 2,500 plastic trunks of additional stuff make the 300-mile journey in five lorries. 43. The Strasbourg building - the Louise Weiss - has been criticised for its complex design … as has the EU. 44. There's lots of myths about the EU … 45. The ubermyth of all myths is about the EU banning bendy bananas. It's actually not totally a myth. Commission Regulation 2257/94 says bananas must be ""free from malformation or abnormal curvature"". It's not the same as bendy. 46. Then there's the one about children under eight years old not being allowed to blow up balloons. It's not really true. But the EU says the following warning must go on balloons. ""Warning! Children under eight years can choke or suffocate on uninflated or broken balloons. Adult supervision required. Keep uninflated balloons from children. Discard broken balloons at once."" 47. 2.05m EU citizens (non-UK) work in the UK - that's 6.5% of the workforce. 48. It's increased from 2.7% in 2003. 49. Margaret Thatcher negotiated a rebate for Britain in 1984 after telling the EEC: ""I want my money back"". The deal was reached because then 80% of the budget went on the Common Agricultural Policy and comparatively the UK had a very small farming industry. 50. She has been claimed by both sides as EU supporter and detractor. Other dead people invoked in the battle for votes are Emmeline Pankhurst and Boudicca - Brexiteers apparently. 51. But Mrs Thatcher did campaign to stay in the EEC in 1975. 52. The three, living, former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown all support in. 53. God is neutral on the EU argument. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: ""I don't think there is one correct Christian view."" 54. As is the Queen. 55. However, Jeremy Clarkson has, surprisingly, come out as an advocate of remaining in the EU. 56. As has actress Emma Thompson - although she did upset people by calling Britain a nation of caking-eating rain miseries. 57. And the US wants us to stay - well Barack Obama said so. 58. But Sir Michael Caine wants the UK out. 59. As does Boris, Michael Gove and, of course, Nigel Farage. 60. The other major EU countries want the UK to stay too, according to a study last month of voters in Germany, France, Poland, Ireland, Spain and Sweden by the University of Edinburgh and a German think-tank. 61. Although in September 2014 a German Marshall think-tank poll suggested all major EU countries wanted the UK in - apart from France, where research suggested 52% wanted Britain to go. 62. Russia's Vladimir Putin wants us out - there have even been suggestions he was preparing to fund anti-EU movements in the UK. He is pro anything that weakens the EU. 63. Leaving the EU will not affect the UK's right to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. 64. We have a good track record of wins mind you. Ireland has won a record seven times, Sweden six and Luxembourg, France and the United Kingdom five times. 65. 1.26m UK citizens live in the 27 other EU countries - most 381,025 in Spain - the fewest ,54, in Estonia. They could lose health and residency benefits if the UK votes out. 66. 700,000 British citizens who have lived outside the UK for 15 years cannot vote in the referendum. Expat and Second World War veteran, 94-year-old Harry Shindler, lives in Italy and is one of them. 67. A group of expats is preparing legal action against the Government on the issue - they say it could delay the referendum. 68. A third of voters are undecided, a third have already decided in and a third already decided out. 69. Women make up the biggest group of undecideds. 70. It could take longer than two years to properly divorce the EU - there's a lot more than record collections to divvy up. 71. The rules for the break up are set out in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. 72. The results of the EU referendum on 23 June will be announced at Manchester Town Hall. 73. One million more women will vote than men. 74. All the votes will be counted and the side with more than half will be the winner. 75. Unlike the Scottish Independence referendum, 16 year olds will not be able to vote. 76. There are 24 official languages in the EU, English is the most widely spoken - 51% of adults do so. 77. Germany has more McDonald's restaurants than any other country in the EU. 78. The EU has an annual budget of more than £110bn. 79. It is often lambasted for waste - according to auditors it misspent £5.5bn in 2013 - according to Full Fact, that's enough to build 66 hospitals. 80. It once spent £6.4m on a project to promote ""intercultural dialogue"" which featured Donkeypedia - a blogging donkey called Asino. 81. Half of the Conservative Party are in favour of leaving the EU. 82. The majority of Labour MPs will vote to remain. 83. All eight of the Liberal Democrats will vote to stay in. 84. The EU country with the highest life expectancy is Spain (83.2 years) and the lowest is Lithuania (74.1 years). 85. Germany is the biggest user of mobile phones in the EU. 86. A YouGov poll for The Times in January found 28% of UKIP supporters would vote to stay in the EU. 87. Seven Cabinet members back the campaign to leave the EU, 23 back the campaign to remain. 88. The Confederation of British Industry, representing firms employing nearly 7m people, claims eight in 10 firms back the remain campaign. 89. British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU. 90. Two thirds of European footballers playing for UK clubs would not automatically get a work visa if the UK voted to leave the EU, according to a Guardian analysis. 91. There are 161 players from the EU and European Economic Area playing in the Premier League. 92. Of the 28 EU leaders, three are women: Poland's Beata Szydlo, Germany's Angela Merkel and Lithuania's Dalia Grybauskaite. 93. Only 19 countries are in the Euro. 94. EU referendum campaign groups have a spending limit of £7m. 95. The official voting campaign period begins on 15 April. 96. Technically MPs could block the UK leaving the EU because all the legislation to leave needs to go through Parliament. 97. According to Open Europe (Eurosceptic think-tank) the EU rule that costs the UK the most is the Renewable Energy Strategy, which costs £4.7bn a year. 98. There are now more than 40,000 legal acts in the EU. 99. The biggest religious denomination in the EU is Catholicism. 100. 100 days left to the EU referendum."

2016-03-17,Iain Duncan Smith is battling to head off a growing Tory rebellion in a Commons vote on the Budget next week against cuts in benefits to disabled people.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160318023726/http://news.sky.com/story/1661319/bid-to-stop-tory-revolt-over-disability-cuts,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Iain Duncan Smith is battling to head off a growing Tory rebellion in a Commons vote on the Budget next week against cuts in benefits to disabled people. After protests at proposed cuts worth £4.4bn, the Work and Pensions Secretary has written to Conservative MPs stressing that consultation with disability groups will continue. Iain Duncan Smith has written to Tory backbenchers But less than 24 hours after George Osborne's Budget, Tory rebels are writing to the Chancellor claiming the Government will be defeated if it tries to push the changes through. :: Osborne Defends Credibility After Budget The threatened rebellion is over a squeeze on personal independence payments (PIPs) which opponents claim could see up to 640,000 people affected by tighter rules and lose up to £100 a week. The proposals follow a review by health professionals found people were being awarded points for aids and appliances already in homes or provided by the NHS and councils. In his letter, Mr Duncan Smith told MPs: ""Last week, we published our response setting out our thoughts on how we should continue to take into account the use of aids and appliances. ""As the Chancellor said this morning, we will now take this response forward, continuing our discussions with disability groups and colleagues."" :: Budget At A Glance But Tory MP Andrew Percy, who organised the rebels' letter, said: ""If a measure is put before the House of Commons I think it is fair to say that it is unlikely to get the support of the House of Commons, given how much concern there is on this matter."" And he wrote on Twitter: ""If I can be honest, I'd rather have a penny or two on fuel if it protects PIP."" Another Tory MP, Johnny Mercer, also publicly expressed reservations about the plans, saying on Twitter: ""Concerned by proposed changes to PIP. Not sure right direction."" And in further embarrassment for the Government, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, Zac Goldsmith, has resigned as patron of a charity for the disabled after it called on him to quit over his support for cuts. The millionaire MP resigned in response to demands from the Richmond AID charity, which works in his southwest London constituency. :: The Chancellor's Sugar Tax Rabbit Earlier, in a bid to defuse the row, Mr Osborne said he was ""always happy to listen to proposals about how to improve on that"". ""But we have got to control our disability budget and make sure help goes to the people who need it most,"" he added. Conservative party member and campaigner Graeme Ellis resigned his position and brought down the website of the Conservative Disabilities Group, an affiliate of the party, in protest at the cuts. He told Sky News that he felt the Chancellor was ""robbing the vulnerable to pay the rich"" by simultaneously cutting disability benefits and raising the 40p income tax threshold. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: ""Up to 600,000 disabled people could lose over £100 a week. ""I think that's unacceptable and the reason it's unacceptable is because that's paying for a cut to Capital Gains Tax for the richest 5% in our country."""

Firefighters rescued Dr Sheppey from her burning second-floor flat on Crowland Terrance, Islington, but she later died in hospital. Tributes have been paid to the popular children's doctor, who was a consultant paediatric anaesthetist at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. Dr Jane McNeill, clinical director for perioperative medicine and consultant anaesthetist, described Dr Sheppey as a ""very valued colleague and an important part of our department with a joie de vivre that will be so missed.

In a statement, his sister Nancy said: ""The Sinatra family mourn the untimely passing of their son, brother, father, uncle Frank Sinatra Jr of cardiac arrest while on tour in Dayton, Florida."" The 72-year-old, who was his second child with Sinatra Sr's first wife Nancy Barbato Sinatra, had travelled there to perform his Sinatra Sings Sinatra show, where he did renditions of his father's greatest hits. Sinatra Jr was famously kidnapped at gunpoint as a teenager, by young men who were demanding a ransom of $240,000 (£168,000). Two days later, he was released unharmed after the money was paid - and the criminals behind the kidnap plot were later jailed. Sinatra Jr was kidnapped aged 19 in a bid to extort money from his father In the years before his father's death in 1998, Sinatra Jr served as the iconic singer's musical director and conductor. In interviews, described seeing the likes of Dean Martin and Sammy Davies Jr perform from the wings of the stage. Speaking to The Daytona Beach News-Journal, he said he never felt ashamed for failing to achieve the dizzying fame enjoyed by his father. He said: ""I think in my generation, when I came along in the early 1960s, the type of music that was in vogue in society in those days had moved on to another type of music. ""I was trying to sell antiques in a modern appliance store."" Sinatra Jr is survived by his son, Michael."
2016-03-17,Qualified Teacher Status is to be scrapped under government reforms and replaced with a tougher training process that will see headteachers decide when trainees are ready to be accredited.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160318023726/http://news.sky.com/story/1661700/qualified-teacher-status-to-be-scrapped,"Qualified Teacher Status is to be scrapped under government reforms and replaced with a tougher training process that will see headteachers decide when trainees are ready to be accredited. The new system will allow those who progress faster to win the new accreditation earlier - a process likened to learning to drive, where motorists sit their test as soon as they are ready. The change should also make it easier for headteachers to recruit experts from other fields, such as musicians or coders and allow them to quickly become professional teachers. :: Osborne: Schools To Stay Open For Longer Training will be centred around a teacher's performance in the classroom in an attempt to place the qualification route on a par with other professions such as law and accountancy. New teachers will win the accreditation when they can prove their credentials in behaviour management and subject knowledge. The measures are unveiled in a White Paper, which sets out the Government's plans for education for the next five years. The 125-page Educational Excellence Everywhere document also includes plans to: :: Consult on scrapping the Ofsted separated grading for quality of teaching, learning and assessment, and refocus on performance and outcomes :: Scrap parent governors and pay professional ones :: Allow the Secretary for Education to run an academy if the trust in charge pulls out :: Make it easier for parents to complain direct to the Department for Education :: Transform all schools into academies by 2020 :: Build 500 free schools to help tackle the places crisis and put councils in charge of admissions. Launching her vision for the future, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ""We have not only the best qualified workforce in history, but also a workforce that is increasingly focused on constant self-improvement, that is driven by the evidence and which like other professions is breaking new boundaries, sharing what works, challenging one another and unleashing greatness."" Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""We welcome plans to replace existing Qualified Teacher Status with a new system in which teachers will complete an extended period in classrooms before being accredited by school leaders. ""We believe this will help to ensure the highest standards and that it will be good for both new teachers and for schools. We look forward to working with the Government on the detailed plans."" But Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said: ""This White Paper does little to address the real issues facing education today: teacher shortages - particularly in the key subjects of maths, English and science, of a crisis in school places, of a widening attainment gap between the disadvantaged and the rest, and exam chaos with the new SATs and GCSEs not yet finalised with only weeks to go."""

The television star was released from hospital last week after being told that the tumour was incurable. On 7 March, Daniels' wife Debbie McGee said the family had been inundated with ""wonderful messages "" of support from fans and friends. The tumour was found when the entertainer fell and was rushed to hospital suspected of suffering a stroke. On his wedding day with McGee Daniels was at his Berkshire home with McGee when he died in the early hours of Thursday. Paying tribute to her husband, she said they had had a ""fairytale life"" together. It is with incredible sadness that  I can confirm that Dad, @ThePaulDaniels, passed away over night. pic.twitter.com/XhZepFJ4DW His wife of 28 years told the BBC: ""The way to describe Paul was that, yes he did television shows and people knew who he was and he did shows for royalty and we flew around the world. ""You know we had a fairytale life and we were so happy together. ""But Paul as a person was like in the village, in the queue for the post office, either doing tricks on them or making them all laugh. ""And he was as happy doing that as he was walking on stage at the Palladium or doing a TV show or doing a show for the Royal Family. He loved people. He was interested in everybody."" She added: ""Our life has been full of laughter and that's what it's been the last few weeks. Up until the last 48 hours when he slipped into a sleep."" Daniels' son Gary tweeted to confirm his father's death alongside a picture of a crying white rabbit in a magician's black top hat. :: Read the tributes to Paul Daniels here One of the most popular magicians of the 20th century, his success was unrivalled in the magic and entertainment world. His wit, charm, and magic skills earned him a reputation which meant that he performed for Princes William and Harry, Prime Ministers John Major and James Callaghan, Prince Rainier of Monaco and others. Born in South Bank, Middlesbrough as Newton Edward Daniels, the TV personality's interest in magic began aged 11 when he read a book called How To Entertain At Parties. After serving as a conscript with the 1st Battalion, the Green Howards, in Hong Kong he started working in clubs where he developed his famous catchphrase: ""You'll like this ... not a lot, but you'll like it."" He made his television debut on Opportunity Knocks in 1970 where he came second. ITV gave him his own show in 1978 and he moved to the BBC the following year with The Paul Daniels Magic Show which attracted 15 million viewers in the UK and ran until 1994. Daniels also starred in his own stage show called It's Magic which became one of London's longest-running magic shows in the 1980s. My Dad passed away and meteor flashes in the sky. What an exit. It was at this time that he met his second wife McGee, whose role as his assistant became a major feature of his act and the couple married in 1988. In 1987 Daniels hosted a controversial Halloween live special where he replicated a trick called the Iron Maiden. It was deliberately staged to look as though it had gone wrong and that he had been killed. Dozens of people complained to the BBC when the credits rolled but he later made an appearance between programmes to show he had successfully escaped from the device. In his later years, Daniels and his wife toured the country with magic and comedy shows, entertaining old fans and new generations alike with his skills. He had three sons with his first wife Jacqueline Skipworth. His youngest son Martin regularly appeared on his TV shows and is now an entertainer himself."

Romell Broom's 2009 execution had to be called off after the team tried unsuccessfully for two hours to find a suitable vein. The 59-year-old has said he was pierced with needles at least 18 times, with pain so intense he cried and screamed. The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled 4-3 that the state can have another go. Tryna Middleton, 14, was raped and stabbed to death by Broom Broom was sentenced to die for raping and fatally stabbing 14-year-old Tryna Middleton after abducting her in Cleveland in 1984 as she walked home with friends.  In Wednesday's decision, the high court rejected arguments by the death row inmate's lawyers that a second execution would amount to cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy. Prosecutors said double jeopardy does not apply because lethal drugs did not enter Broom's veins while executioners unsuccessfully tried to hook up an IV. No new execution date has been set for Broom Justice Judith Ann Lanzinger agreed, saying the execution did not begin since the drugs were not administered. Justice Judi French wrote in a dissent. ""If the state cannot explain why the Broom execution went wrong, then the state cannot guarantee that the outcome will be different next time."" No new execution date has been set. But a second execution is likely to be years away as the case will undergo a federal appeal. Broom maintains he is innocent of Tryna's murder. Three months after the teenager's killing the mother of an 11-year-old girl thwarted Broom's attempt to abduct her daughter. He was arrested and also charged with Tryna's death."

For sport-lovers there was Olympic-level fiscal gymnastics designed to keep at least one of George Osborne's fiscal rules intact. He broke the supplementary debt target for debt to be falling in every year. He has already breached the terms of his welfare cap (and that breach is confirmed today as larger). But the story of this Budget is an epic effort to contort the public finances to hit a surplus at the end of the Parliament. Corporation tax revenues are shuffled between years in the several billion, and £3.5bn of unspecified departmental spending cuts pencilled in for 2019/20. No wonder the Chancellor warned of ""storm clouds"". Such bad weather has already hit the public finances with an increase in forecast borrowing since November of £35.6bn over seven years. But within that bigger picture there was plenty of reforming radicalism. :: Key Points: Budget Announcements At A Glance The sugar tax was the big rabbit, the Easter Bunny. But the tax will not be applied to chocolate or fruit juice or cakes or biscuits - just fizzy drinks. And it has such an impact that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says it will increase inflation by 0.25%. Redistribution of a kind in business taxation, with nearly a million small businesses benefiting from reductions and cancellation of business rates. The cost will come from profit-shuffling corporation tax-avoiding large multinationals, recommended by the OECD. On personal tax, some genuine radicalism with the lifetime ISA - a type of flexible pension savings vehicle a little like the American 401k. But the more significant pensions reforms were parked earlier in the month. And frozen fuel duties will stave off any further backbench rebellions. The shadow of Europe loomed large, though. And it was a further piece of political sport that enabled the Chancellor, much to the annoyance of eurosceptics, to harness the OBR forecast towards his case for the UK to stay in the European Union. The general story of financial storm clouds also will be deployed in this direction, too. So - a Chancellor contorting himself to maintain credibility while borrowing more. And using fiscal pain to his advantage re Europe."

The move comes after US President Barack Obama criticised the Prime Minister for his actions over Libya. The American leader said European nations, including the UK, had joined the US military action to prevent a massacre in the north African state back in 2011, but then failed to prevent the country becoming a ""mess"" following the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. President Obama has criticised the failure to avoid Libya becoming a 'mess' Mr Obama put some of the blame for chaos in Libya on Mr Cameron becoming ""distracted"" by other priorities There have also been claims - denied by the Government - that the UK could send 1,000 ground troops to the conflict-hit north African state as part of an international force of 6,000. The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said it had been told, during a visit to the region, that the force would train the Libyan army and provide security for the newly-appointed national unity government. Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord, currently based in Tunisia's capital Tunis, is also set to request airstrikes against Islamic State targets, according to the MPs. A Government spokesman said what the committee had been told was ""wrong on a number of counts"". Mr Cameron has also told MPs any plans to send ""conventional forces"" for training in Libya would be put before Parliament for debate. Appearing before the committee in February, Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood said the UK was prepared to ""advise, assist, support and train"" a national unity government in taking on IS, adding: ""We are not going in there to hold and take ground."" On extending the invitation to the PM to give evidence, the chairman of the select committee Crispin Blunt told Sky News: ""It is an issue that is extremely profound, it has gone on for quite a long time. ""I think that he deserves a proper opportunity to be able to give a decent explanation as to the decisions that he took and the decisions we are faced with now as a country, given the rather fragile state of the political reconciliation such as it is in Libya."""

The 39-year-old was taken to hospital with arm and leg injuries and he was ""extremely fortunate"" to have escaped more serious harm. The officer, from the Met's Roads and Transport Policing Command (RTPC), was on patrol in Kennington Park Road, SE11, at around 2.45pm on Wednesday when he tried to stop a black Vauxhall Meriva. A police spokesman said: ""The vehicle appeared to deliberately run over the officer who had got off his bicycle. ""He was struck by the car and ended up on the bonnet before falling to the ground. ""The suspects drove off at speed in the direction of Peckham, via Camberwell Green Road."" The officer has now been released from hospital and is recovering at home. The car was found abandoned less than a mile away in Frederick Crescent. Detective Sergeant Ranjit Sekhon, from the RTPC, appealed for people who saw the incident or the car speeding away afterwards to contact police. He added: ""I would also like to speak with anyone who saw two men running from the car after it was parked in Frederick Crescent. ""It is extremely fortunate that the officer, who was attempting a routine traffic stop, was not more seriously injured. ""It is important that we speak with as many people as possible to piece together the moments leading up to the collision."" Two men, aged 22 and 23, have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. They remain in custody at a south London police station."

He was central to the escape of the most wanted man on the continent, and ran international money transfers to fund terror cells. A shadowy figure known only by a false name, he was close to the top of the most wanted list himself - and yet Mohammed Belkaid's life before he discovered terrorism was a litany of petty crime and failure. And in a moment of good fortune for the Belgian and French security services, he led them to the most wanted terrorist in Europe, Salah Abdeslam. Belkaid was a hapless thief. In April 2013 he was arrested in Ikea, Stockholm, trying to steal a shopper's wallet. Caught on camera he was found with a knife, convicted and fined. A year later he was in trouble again. This time over another petty theft that earned him a short jail stint and expulsion from Belgium in March 2014. A month later he crossed into Syria, personnel records from the so-called Islamic State that have been obtained by Sky News have revealed. Belgian authorities did not know he was connected to Abdeslam - because they did not know that he was ""Samir Bouzid"" - a wanted terrorist who funded members of the Paris plot and travelled with Abdeslam to Budapest. When he was killed by a sniper last Tuesday, Abdeslam's finger prints were found in is flat. From that moment the authorities knew they had hit gold. Already in a high state of alert they readied for a breakthrough. That came when the fugitive from the Paris attacks was spotted in Molenbeek. By nightfall, Abdeslam was in police custody - trapped in a family home where he was captured with another alleged conspirator. This is a body blow to the so-called Islamic State. The death cult's ""heroes"" are not supposed to get captured. They are supposed to die behind their rifles or go out with a bang taking others with them. But Abdeslam appeared to go meekly - wounded in the leg but otherwise not resisting arrest. For Islamic State this is a coward's end. For the intelligence services his capture is a moment to savour. As he was dragged limping from his safe house they will have been rubbing their hands together and planning how to use him as a weapon - a vast source of intelligence on his masters in Raqqa. A bigger failure even than his dead comrade."

A Florida jury found that the Gawker website had violated his privacy by publishing a video of him having sex with his former best friend's wife in 2012.  After deliberating for six hours, the jury handed Hogan $60m for emotional distress and $55m for economic damages.  He could be in line for an additional payout when the jury reconvenes on Monday to consider punitive damages and other matters. ""This is a victory for everyone who has had their privacy violated,"" Hogan's attorney, David Houston, told reporters. Gallery: Wrestling History's Biggest Star Hulk Hogan is one of the biggest names in wrestling history Gawker publisher Nick Denton said the website, which is known for celebrity gossip, will appeal the verdict. The two-week case pitted arguments over a celebrity's right to privacy in the internet age against the freedom of the press, which is protected in the US Constitution. Hogan's lawyers noted that he was unaware the encounter was being filmed when it took place over a decade ago and that the footage wasn't newsworthy. They said Gawker did not warn Hogan, the woman in the video or her husband, DJ Bubba The Love Sponge Clem, who recorded the footage, that it was being published. Hogan, real name Terry Bollea, testified that he still suffered from the humiliation of the video going viral. It was alleged that Gawker's value increased by $15m after the post, although the website contended that it made $11,000 in advertising revenue. Gawker's lawyers, meanwhile, called into question whether the sex tape was a stunt and pointed out it had already appeared on at least two other websites. It was never conclusively determined who leaked the video to the media. Hogan, who had sought $100m in damages, wept as the damages were awarded."

The Liberal Democrat leader said changes to the funding of public sector pensions outlined in the Budget were a ""vicious attack"" on already-stretched services. Departments face contributing more to the overall cost from 2019, effectively saving the Treasury around £2bn a year, because of a reduction in the ""discount rate"". This is being reduced from 3% above CPI inflation to 2.8% from 2019. The figure is reviewed every five years, and reflects the Government's estimate for the rate of economic growth over the medium term. This affects ""unfunded"" public sector schemes, including those for the NHS, the Army, police, teachers and civil servants. The Lib Dems said that meant a £649m bill for the health service, £426m for schools, £314m for the armed forces, £101m for the police and £10m for fire services. Mr Farron said: ""Even by George Osborne's standards, this is a vicious attack on our health service, schools and public services. ""He made grand promises about funding the NHS and is now making secret cuts by the back door. ""David Cameron said he would do whatever it takes to fill the NHS black hole, and we’ve now discovered that actually means cutting £650m just to help the Chancellor's budget-day balance sheet. ""George Osborne cannot pull the wool over people's eyes. ""Choosing to ask schools, hospitals, and forces to pay £2bn extra in pension contributions has a real cost, and vital services will have to pick up the bill. ""The Conservatives simply cannot be trusted to protect the services communities rely on up and down the country."""

Stephen Crabb goes from running one of the very smallest Whitehall departments, the Welsh Office, to the one administering one with the biggest budget. Until now, he had been mainly notable for being the first bearded Cabinet minister since the fourth Earl of Onslow in 1905. He is about to become famous, and perhaps not in ways he had imagined. The Earl of Onslow had a beard. So does Stephen Crabb. :: PM Puzzled By IDS Resignation In his in-tray is sorting out the mess over disability welfare. In the sharpest abandonment of a Budget measure in history, George Osborne has kicked in to the long grass the cuts to the Personal Independence Payments. But the saving is still scored as the Government's biggest single deficit reduction measure. Will Mr Crabb fight the Treasury? Will he come up with other welfare cuts? The Government very recently passed other controversial disability cuts, a £30 a week cut to those assessed as capable of work but claiming Employment Support Allowance. Three Conservative MPs rebelled, but many more, enough to sink the Government's majority, were concerned. :: IDS Takes Aim AT Osborne Stephen McPartland, the backbencher who helped sink the Government's tax credit cuts, has already started penning an alternative White Paper. There is a more general issue in this area. Over years, the successive forecasts of savings in disability welfare, never materialise, however radical the policy. Then there is Iain Duncan Smith's landmark Universal Credit reform, now rolled out to three-quarters of job centres. The reform combines in and out of work benefits in to one payment and is designed to save the taxpayer £2.6bn a year in reduced error and fraud. It is also supposed to increase incentives to work. :: What Are Personal Independence Payments? But critics say much of the original work has been undermined by tinkering to its structure, undermining work incentives. There have also been issues with IT and implementation, some of which are about to be publicly aired, after the Department for Work and Pensions this week lost an attempt to block a Freedom of Information request. Above all, what of the fractious relations between the department and HM Treasury? The departments scrape past each other like tectonic plates, exploding into seismic rows ahead of Budgets and Autumn Statements. Will Mr Crabb defend his budget against what Mr Duncan Smith described as ""salami-slicing"" and protect the money needed for genuine welfare reform? Will the Chancellor decide his welfare reform capital is already burnt up. :: Those Extraordinary Letters Between PM And IDS And then, finally, it will be a miracle if the affable Mr Crabb, does not become a figure of protest, as examples of benefit removal pepper the newspapers. Whatever Labour's internal problems, they are laser-focused on welfare cuts, and forging unholy alliances with the SNP, DUP and a new generation of centrist Tories. Mr Duncan Smith, the former soldier, had to be tough to withstand the opprobrium heaped on him. Mr Crabb has to work out what he can get through Parliament. He has to count the pennies, and count the votes."

Experts have revealed that the mountain is officially one metre taller than previously thought. According to a new Ordnance Survey (OS) calculation, it stands at 1,345m rather than 1,344m - the height recorded when the mountain was last measured in 1949. Surveyors say the change is not down to geological movements. In other words, Ben Nevis has not grown. Rather, it is the result of improvements in technology that allow for a more accurate reading. Back in 1949, it took a team of seven surveyors 20 nights to measure the mountain.  The new measurement was calculated by positioning a survey grade GPS receiver at the summit of Ben Nevis for just two hours. The exact height of the mountain was found to be 1,344.527m, meaning it can now be rounded up to 1,345m officially. ""What is amazing is how close the surveyors in 1949 were,"" said OS geodetic consultant Mark Greaves, who was the first person to discover the change. ""The measured height has changed by centimetres, but those centimetres mean we now need to round up rather than down. So that's why Ben Nevis will now be officially known as 1,345m."" Field surveyor Angus Hemmings added the process involved in making the new calculation had given him a ""greater sense of respect"" for the 1949 surveyors. ""Each day they hauled 200lbs of equipment up Ben Nevis and its surrounding mountains,"" he said. ""They also had to wait till night, because strong lights were shone from the trig pillars of the other mountains on to Ben Nevis, which enabled them to collect their data. ""It took the surveyors 20 nights because they only had three clear nights in that period to get it right. ""To do the best possible job it had to be run with military precision, everything they did had to be timed to perfection. Their effort and accuracy is remarkable."""

Tributes have been paid to the popular children's doctor, who was a consultant paediatric anaesthetist at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. Dr Jane McNeill, clinical director for perioperative medicine and consultant anaesthetist, described Dr Sheppey as a ""very valued colleague and an important part of our department with a joie de vivre that will be so missed.

Europe's most wanted man was ""caught alive"" on Friday after being wounded in dramatic police raid in Belgium's capital Brussels. ""The battle against terrorism does not end tonight, even though this is a victory,"" Mr Hollande told a news conference in Brussels with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. The French leader said more people were involved in the November attacks than previously thought, adding that authorities would track down everyone who in any way allowed, organised or facilitated the attacks. He said Paris would also request Abdeslam's extradition from Belgium ""as rapidly as possible"". A suspect is dragged into a car after a raid in Molenbeek Announcing the capture, Belgium's asylum minister Theo Francken declared, ""We got him"". Abdeslam, 26, suffered leg injuries before being arrested, during a major police operation in the Molenbeek suburb. Television footage showed armed security forces dragging a man wearing a hooded top out of a building and to a car. At least 10 shots were heard, grenades launched and police helicopters hovered overhead, while fire engines waited in the street. Footage showed masked, black-clad security forces training their weapons towards upper windows of an apartment block. White smoke could be seen rising above the building, as police with snarling dogs drove crowds in the streets back away from the scene. About three hours after Abdeslam's arrest, two blasts were heard, before a further suspect - who was still holed up - was detained. In all, Abdeslam was one of five people arrested in the series of raids, which came after a tip-off to police. Two of the suspects, including Abdeslam, were injured. Three of those arrested are being held on suspicion of sheltering Abdeslam and an accomplice. Mr Hollande and Mr Michel left a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on migration amid news of the raid. The shootout comes after Belgian authorities said that fingerprints in a Brussels apartment raided earlier this week belonged to Abdeslam. A man shot dead in that raid is believed to have been an accomplice of Abdeslam, Belgian prosecutors said on Friday. Sky's Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said that Abdeslam could prove to be ""a goldmine of intelligence"". Survivors of the attack at the Bataclan venue in Paris reacted to news of the arrest. Lydia Berkennou said: ""I don’t know why, but deep down in my heart, I knew one of them was him. ""I knew because I didn’t think he would’ve managed to go back to Syria … I knew he was hiding somewhere."" Back in November it was reported that Abdeslam had reportedly returned to Brussels with a suicide vest. A police source had told The Sunday Times of fears ""there is a walking bomb"" in the Belgian capital. The source said Abdeslam may have become ""trapped and desperate"" since fleeing the bloodshed which killed 130 people. After the Paris attacks, reports emerged of a row between Abdeslam and his brother Brahim, on the night before the massacre. One of their friends told a French documentary he heard one of the brothers telling the other that he was ""not going"" without money.  Gallery: Gallery: Paris Attacks Fugitive Captured Alive In Belgium The most wanted fugitive from November's Paris attacks has been captured ""The other one said: 'No, you’re going!' ""He said to him: 'If I don't have any dosh, I’m not budging. Without dosh I’m not going',"" the friend told the documentary. It is unclear whether they were fighting about going to Paris.  Brahim, 31, eventually blew himself up outside a cafe, injuring 15 people, during the co-ordinated attacks. Abdeslam was also filmed outside a cafe on the night of the massacre, pointing his gun at two women hiding under outside tables. The women can be seen running for safety after Abdeslam's gun does not go off. Terror expert Dr David Lowe told Sky News: ""These people are not working on their own - we are looking at terror cells in operations ""You have to be very very careful before you make the move … you want to gather as much evidence as possible. ""We’re talking about people who are quite willing to use firearms or explosive devices so … it’s a dangerous situation to have."""

The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) is calling for a national publicity campaign by the train companies to increase awareness of the compensation available. It also urged operators to ensure compensation forms are written in plain English and that staff are given better training to provide information on obtaining the rebates. The regulator made the recommendations after consumer group Which? launched a so-called ""super-complaint"" over the issue in December. The ORR said its investigation found that progress is being made, with some companies using new technology to improve how customers get compensation. However, it said passengers' awareness of their rights was not high enough and that the information they receive needs to be improved. ORR Chief Executive Joanna Whittington said: ""We want all passengers to be able to claim the compensation they are entitled to. The information they receive needs to be better and the process must be clearer and simpler. ""Today, we have made a number of recommendations to help achieve improvements straight away.

2016-03-18,The self-proclaimed quiet man of British politics has turned up the volume.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160319192107/http://news.sky.com/story/1662787/ids-takes-aim-at-osborne-leadership-ambitions,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent The self-proclaimed quiet man of British politics has turned up the volume. The former Scots Guard has identified his enemy - George Osborne - and sought to destroy him. The bombshell resignation of Iain Duncan Smith after nearly six years as Work and Pensions Secretary stunned MPs, but not those who know him well.  ""It has been a pretty bumpy ride all the way through,"" one of his closest friends told Sky News. ""He has had umpteen run-ins with the Treasury. ""The Treasury resents having such a senior figure in a high spending Whitehall department like welfare. ""The Treasury has wanted him out for some time. The real tension is more between Iain and George Osborne, than Iain and David Cameron."" :: PM Says He Is Puzzled By IDS Resignation Mr Duncan Smith's blistering resignation letter makes a number of savage attacks on the Chancellor. They reinforce the view of what Mr Duncan Smith's close friend says about his growing frustration about his battles with Mr Osborne. In this first salvo, Mr Duncan Smith writes: ""You are aware that I believe the cuts would have been even fairer to younger families and people of working age if we had been willing to reduce some of the benefits given to better-off pensioners but I have attempted to work within the constraints that you and the Chancellor set."" So, constraints set by the Chancellor. He then says the latest welfare cuts are ""a compromise too far"" and ""not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers"". A Budget that benefits the higher paid. Then this blast: ""I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest."" :: What Are Personal Independence Payments? Political, rather than in the national interest. And then: ""Too often my team and I have been pressured in the immediate run up to a budget or fiscal event to deliver yet more reductions to the working age benefit bill. ""There has been too much emphasis on money saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced."" Money-saving exercises and no vision. Just a few weeks ago, Mr Duncan Smith was one of half a dozen or so Cabinet ministers who announced they would be campaigning for the UK to leave the European Union, after the Prime Minister suspended Cabinet responsibility for the referendum campaign. Now, clearly spitting with rage at his treatment by the Chancellor, Mr Duncan Smith will be a bitter and dangerous opponent of the Remain campaign, free to speak out without any thought of his future career. Cabinet resignations are usually the result of a personal crisis rather than differences over policy. But not this one. :: Those Letters In Full For the Cameron-Osborne Tory government, this resignation is as potentially explosive as Nigel Lawson quitting as Chancellor in 1989. And we all know what happened after that. It was the beginning of the end for Margaret Thatcher's premiership. A year or so later, she was out. This time Mr Cameron has already pre-announced his resignation, however. But Mr Duncan Smith has just fired a volley of gunfire at Mr Osborne's leadership ambitions. With both barrels. And almost certainly scored a direct hit."

The suspect was spotted in Hill Street in the city centre after officers responded to reports of a disturbance on Friday morning. Witnesses reported seeing a man wearing a balaclava near the private school St Aloysius College and the Glasgow School of Art. He reportedly threatened a lollipop man and tried to attack a janitor. Glasgow School of Art said the janitor had been left ""shaken, but unharmed"" after confronting the man. A spokeswoman said: ""The Glasgow School of Art can confirm that a member of our staff did encounter the individual described, whilst parking his car near to a GSA building."" Police said a man had been arrested and no members of the public were believed to have been injured. ""One officer sustained a minor injury during the arrest,"" a spokesman said.

In his scathing resignation letter, Iain Duncan Smith said proposed cuts to disability benefits were a ""compromise too far"". He complained of pressure from the Treasury to ""salami slice"" welfare and an unwillingness to spread the burden of spending cuts. Mr Duncan Smith concluded that the party leadership had abandoned the austerity principle of ""all in this together"" in its latest budget. :: IDS Takes Aim At Osborne Leadership Ambitions In his letter of reply, Mr Cameron hit back against the charges, saying the proposals in the latest budget had been ""collectively agreed"". ""I regret that you have chosen to step down from the Government at this moment,"" the Prime Minister wrote. ""Together we designed the Personal Independence Payment to support the most vulnerable and to give disabled people more independence. ""We all agreed that the increased resources being spent on disabled people should be properly managed and focused on those who need it most."" :: Personal Independence Payment Explained He added: ""That is why we collectively agreed - you, No 10 and the Treasury - proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago. Today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months. ""In the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign."" Mr Duncan Smith's announcement came hours after the Treasury signalled it was planning a humiliating climbdown over cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). In the face of a Tory rebellion in a Commons vote on the budget next week, Government sources said the Treasury wanted to kick the proposals ""into the long grass"". : Osborne Defends Credibility After Budget Opponents claimed the cuts, which were expected to save around £1.3bn a year, could affect up to 640,000 people, with many losing as much as £100 a week. In his letter, Mr Duncan Smith wrote: ""I have for some time and rather reluctantly come to believe that the latest changes to benefits to the disabled and the context in which they've been made are, a compromise too far. ""While they are defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit, they are not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers. They should have instead been part of a wider process to engage others in finding the best way to better focus resources on those most in need. ""I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self-imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest."" The Work and Pensions Secretary had been at loggerheads with Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne since announcing he would join the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union. His letter indicates the row over PIP cuts were the final straw. Sky's Chief Political Correspondent Jon Craig said: ""There's clearly been an enormous bust-up between himself and the PM. ""The Government's whole welfare strategy, no doubt Labour will say, is in tatters. When a senior minister quits like this, there are enormous ramifications. It's a shattering blow for Mr Cameron."""

Lawyers for Paul Worthington told a hearing he is being intimidated on a daily basis and that if he is requested to appear it should be via video-link. Toddler Poppi Worthington was found with serious injuries at her home in Barrow, Cumbria in December 2012. In January this year a family court ruled that her father Paul had, on the balance of probabilities, abused his daughter shortly before her death. Mr Worthington, 48, has never been charged and denies any wrongdoing against his daughter. After the ruling he fled his home and has effectively been in hiding ever since. Poppi Worthington was 13 months old when she died The original inquest in October 2014, by then Cumbria coroner Ian Smith, lasted just seven minutes and called no evidence. It was later judged ""irregular"" in the High Court. Following the judgment, senior coroner for Cumbria David Roberts quashed the inquest and ordered a new one. The fresh inquest will investigate and ascertain ""how, when and where"" Poppi came by her death, which includes consideration of Poppi's medical cause of death and ""by what means"" it came about. Mr Roberts told the hearing that he was ""anxious to address the case"", which was in the interests of everyone, not least Poppi. Decisions now need to be made on evidence and witnesses but it is thought the full inquest will begin this autumn and last a week."

Children who do not fit into the more typical ""at risk"" categories, could be being overlooked, the report conducted by children's charity Barnado's found. The study, titled ""It's not on the radar"", urges parents, teachers and young people to look beyond the high-profile cases in Rotherham, Rochdale and Oxford, in which most of the perpetrators were male and the victims were white girls. It emphasises that the victims of child abuse are ""not solely white British"" and that there are ""multiple models of exploitation"". ""If frontline professionals focus on the CSE (child sexual exploitation) model prevalent in the media, such as groups of offenders, or the more 'traditional' boyfriend/girlfriend model, those who are being exploited using different models may not be recognised,"" it says. Boys and girls targeted by older women and lesbian girls who are being exploited are among the so-called ""hidden groups"" identified in the study. It documents one case in which a teenage girl was found in the house of an older woman who was exploiting her. The report said: ""No questions were asked as to why the girl was at the house. Had this been a house belonging to an older male, it is likely that the response would have been different."" Other scenarios identified in the report which could result in victims being missed were a failure to recognise a child's learning difficulties and a focus on one ethnic community to the detriment of others. It stressed that victims come from all ethnic and faith backgrounds. ""Cultural and religious views and practices, particularly those that prize a female's virginity or a male's heterosexuality, may prevent victims from speaking out due to a fear of retribution or rejection from families,"" it said. It also emphasised the importance of challenging ""the perception that some children are 'safer' than others due to their conservative or protective family environment"". Barnardo's chief executive, Javed Khan said: ""This horrific form of child abuse can affect any child or young person. Assumptions must not be made when trying to identify sexual exploitation as each victim has their own vulnerabilities. ""Recognising the diversity of victims will help ensure they are identified and get the right support."""

Tickets for the band's three-night residency at the Roundhouse in Camden went on sale for £65 at 9am on Friday. But within two hours they were being touted online - reportedly for as much as £3,000. The official website was inundated with users, who were informed they were in a queue of up to 20,000 people - for the 1,700 capacity venue. Some users complained that they suddenly dropped down the queue, by more than 16,000 places in some cases. I was in position 5 of the queue and then moved to 16,300 for #Radiohead??? What!!! @RoundhouseLDN The Roundhouse's official Twitter account asked users to ""please be patient"" as the website was ""experiencing huge demand,"" but by 11am organisers confirmed the gigs were completely sold out - leaving thousands of fans disappointed. In an attempt to thwart ticket touts, tight restrictions had been applied to the sale. Tickets were limited to two per person and the lead purchaser will be asked for photo ID on the night of the concert. Queue for #Radiohead tickets at #roundhouse has now reached Beijing pic.twitter.com/gyWR6CqVpO But some determined resellers appeared to have found ways to get round the rules. Ticket resale website StubHub! - where tickets were on offer at £1,000 on Friday - warned purchasers that they would have to meet their seller on the night and go into the Roundhouse with them. The band's lead singer Thom Yorke vented his frustration on social media, tweeting: ""I'm as f***** off as you are. and am only human."" Worked out based on position in the queue, rate of progress etc I’ll be able to buy Radiohead tickets after they walk off stage this May."

The Boeing 737-800, operated by budget airline flydubai, crashed while trying to land at Rostov-on-Don airport early on Saturday. The plane was pulverised into tiny fragments, but experts managed to find both of the flight recorders undamaged. The plane crashed in Rostov-on-Don airport The Investigative Committee of Russia said it was probing three possible causes of the crash: pilot error, technical failure or bad weather conditions. Flydubai CEO Ghaith Al Ghaith warned it was ""too early"" to determine why flight FZ981 crashed. ""An investigation is being conducted in cooperation with the Russian authorities and we are waiting to see the results,"" he told a news conference. A strong wind warning was in place and it was reportedly raining hard at the time of the crash. Vasily Golubev, governor of the Rostov region, said: ""By all appearances the cause of the air crash was strongly gusting winds approaching hurricane weather."" He said the plane crashed about 250 metres (800 feet) short of the runway. The aircraft had been forced to abandon an initial attempt to land, Russia's emergency ministry said. Other flights had been diverted to Krasnodar airport, 300km (186 miles) south of Rostov-on-Don, due to the poor weather. The aircraft was in a mid-air holding pattern and had been circling around the area for about two hours before making another attempt to land.  Its wing hit the ground on its second landing attempt and burst into flames, the Rostov region's emergency ministry said. Grainy CCTV footage showed the aircraft going down at a steep angle and exploding in a huge fireball. Some Russian aviation experts said the steep descent seemed to indicate that the crash was not caused by the strong wind. ""It was an uncontrollable fall,"" Sergei Kruglikov, a veteran Russian pilot, told Russian state television. Most of the 55 passengers on board the airliner, which was flying from Dubai, were Russian, most likely returning from holidays. Eight Ukrainians, two Indians and one Uzbek were also on the flight, the airline confirmed. Four children were among the dead. FlyDubai said the crew included five men and two women. The pilots were from Cyprus and Spain, while the cabin crew included two Russians and citizens of Seychelles, Colombia and Kyrgyzstan Flydubai has a good safety record. This crash is its first since it began operating in 2009."

Adrian Ismay suffered leg wounds after the device detonated under his prison van as he set off for work on 4 March. The married father-of-three was released from hospital some days later, but suffered a fatal heart attack on Tuesday. A post-mortem examination confirmed the cardiac failure was linked to the injuries he suffered in the attack. Suspect Christopher Robinson, from Aspen Park in Dunmurry, west Belfast, had previously been charged with attempted murder in connection with the bomb attack. Gallery: Prison Officer Injured After Device Detonates As He Drives To Work A bomb disposal robot was used as police investigated the area following the attack Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Richard Campbell said on Friday that after liaising with the Public Prosecution Service the 45-year-old has now been charged with murder. He is due to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court later today. A dissident Republican group referred to as the New IRA claimed to have carried out the bomb attack. It happened in the Hillsborough Drive area and also forced the evacuation of houses and a massive police search. Mr Ismay, 52, was a long-serving officer based at Hydebank Wood Young Offenders Centre in south Belfast, who worked as a trainer for new recruits to the Northern Ireland Prison Service. Police have warned the public that dissidents are planning acts of violence in the run-up to the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland."

The Walter Mitty Hunters Club HQ told Sky News: ""It's an insult to all those who have worked hard, felt the pain, and in some cases, lost people close to them. ""There is also an abuse of charity resources, for example, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) charities where people will make up a service career to gain an advantage. ""In turn, the real people in need of help have to wait longer or don't get it at all. It's getting worse and needs to stop."" They argue that a US-style stolen valour law, where those wearing military uniforms for financial gain face prison time, would solve the problem. But a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""There are currently no plans to introduce legislation along the lines of the USA's Stolen Valour Act. ""It is already an offence to make a false claim of service if it amounts to fraud or a similar offence such as obtaining services dishonestly."" Over the last few months, Sky News has spoken to a number of people exposed by the group. One, who claimed to have served in the prestigious Special Air Service, simply told us he did nothing illegal. Another, who claimed to be ""Special Forces"", admitted putting ""ice cream on"" on his service history but told us he feels unjustly treated by online hunters. A view backed by former SAS soldier Phil Campion, who said: ""I do a 100% understand where this stolen valour thing comes from. ""But to gang up and expose people, and do it to the degree of mickey taking that they've done, banter or not banter, for me, takes it a step too far sometimes."" Using military intelligence techniques, the group is made up of a number of anonymous administrators. When they receive a tip off, they investigate, confront and then name those they believe to be guilty of fakery or exaggeration."

Around 200 attack helicopter pilots and instructors received overpayments of up to £30,000 each and faced action to claw back the money, despite officials accepting they acted ""in good faith"". In a June 2014 letter, the Army warned MoD officials that 15 pilots directly cited the payment row as the deciding factor in their decision to leave the Army. The Army also raised concerns that the loss of experienced pilots and instructors risked impacting morale and had the potential to threaten frontline capabilities in Afghanistan, according to newly released documents. In the letter, senior Army figures also pointed out that the cost of training one pilot far exceeded the total £829,000 debt. At the time the document was written it took four years to train an attack helicopter pilot at a cost of £3.5m. The cost of training an instructor was £8.5m. It takes four years to train an Apache helicopter pilot The documents released under the Freedom of Information Act branded rules that governed how pilots' pay was calculated ""complicated and contradictory"". The authors of the letter added that administrators had ""inconsistently interpreted"" the policy over a period of ""many years"", with some confusion over the system arising as far back as 2002. An Army spokeswoman said the process to recover the overpay was continuing and each pilot's debt was being considered ""on a case-by-case basis"". She said she was not aware of any resignations linked to the debt occurring since 2014. She added: ""We have apologised and explained the circumstances of the overpayments to all of those affected. ""In accordance with standard Government practice, arrangements have been made to revert their pay to the correct levels and all affected personnel are now receiving the correct pay. ""The overpayment of salary has resulted in an amount of debt owed by individual personnel."""

Alexandre Brans, who was wiping blood from his face, said: ""The metro was leaving Maalbeek station when there was a really loud explosion. ""It was panic everywhere. There were a lot of people in the metro,"" the 32-year-old said. The cause of the explosion has not yet been confirmed, but it coincided with a suspected suicide attack at Brussels Airport, which killed 14 people. VRT said the blast went off on a carriage on an underground train which had stopped at the station. Authorities shut metro, train, tram and bus services in the Belgian capital following the bomb blasts and the country raised its terror alert to the highest level in the wake of the attacks. Major rail stations were set to reopen on Tuesday afternoon with an increased military presence, Reuters news agency reported. Eurostar said no trains would be running to or from Brussels Midi. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said: ""What we feared has happened. In this time of tragedy, this black moment for our country, I appeal to everyone to remain calm but also to show solidarity."" Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said authorities feared suspects involved in the deadly attacks could still be at large. Mr Michel said there was no information on whether the attacks were related to the arrest of a Paris terror suspect last week. The UK, Netherlands and France announced that security at transport hubs and on borders would be increased in the wake of the explosions. Police in the Netherlands said an international train from Brussels to Amsterdam was halted at a station one stop from Amsterdam's Schipol Airport as officers searched passengers and the train. An extra 225 Belgian troops will be sent to Brussels, according to the Belga news agency. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attacks."

The Government has ditched proposed Budget cuts to disability benefits just days after they were announced, leaving a £4.4bn black hole over the course of the Parliament. A bitter row erupted within the Tory party after Iain Duncan Smith resigned as work and pensions secretary, saying the Chancellor's planned welfare cuts were ""indefensible"" and a ""compromise too far"".  :: Ten Iain Duncan Smith Resignation Takeaways In his first appearance in the Commons since he replaced Mr Duncan Smith, former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb confirmed the planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) disability benefit would be shelved. ""I am absolutely clear that a compassionate and fair welfare system should not just be about numbers,"" he said. ""Behind every statistic is a human being and perhaps sometimes in Government we forget that."" :: Cameron Stands By Osborne And Praises IDS He added that the money that would have been saved if the Government pressed ahead with the PIP cuts would not come from the welfare budget. ""After discussing this issue over the weekend with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, we have no further plans to make welfare savings beyond the very substantial savings legislated for by Parliament two weeks ago,"" he said. Mr Crabb said it would be ""absurd"" to say the Government would ""never, ever, ever"" cut welfare in the future - but he insisted it would not fill the black hole with further welfare cuts. Shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith welcomed the ""wholly inevitable U-turn"" on the proposed PIP cuts. But he said the Government's ""deliberate targeting of disabled people to pay for tax cuts in the Budget"" had been ""exposed so mercilessly"" by Mr Duncan Smith's explosive resignation. The Prime Minister has attempted to calm the conflict in the party by praising both the Chancellor and Mr Duncan Smith. But the Chancellor still came under fire from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who criticised the ""enormous hole"" in his Budget plans.  ""For the first time in my memory in Parliament, a Government's budget has fallen apart within two days of its delivery,"" he said."

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, the senior officer in charge of Operation Midland said: ""It is absolutely right that we assessed carefully the allegations made to us in October 2014 and did not dismiss them prematurely. ""Our initial inquiries supported the need for a thorough investigation to seek any evidence that might corroborate or disprove the allegations. ""Investigations of non-recent allegations are extremely challenging and complex for all of those involved."" Operation Midland was set up in November 2014 and centred on the allegations of a single witness, a man known as ""Nick"", who claimed he and other boys had been abused by a group of prominent politicians and military figures more than 30 years ago. The homes of former army chief Lord Bramall and the late former home secretary Lord Brittan were raided during the course of the investigation but there were no arrests. Lord Bramall was cleared in January It faced criticism after it was revealed in January that 92-year old Lord Bramall would face no further action over the historical allegations. Scotland Yard admitted one of its senior officers had appeared to ""pre-empt"" the conclusion of Operation Midland when describing the allegations made by ""Nick"" as ""credible and true"". The decision to close the controversial operation comes as former MP Harvey Proctor was told he would face no further action over the Met's investigation into historical abuse claims. The 69-year old, who has always maintained his innocence, was twice interviewed under caution as part of the investigation. He said in a statement: ""I have been advised that the Metropolitan Police Service has informed my solicitors that they intend to take no further action with regard to my involvement with Operation Midland."" Mr Proctor has called for Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and other senior officers to resign over their handling of the investigation.  Last month, Scotland Yard asked former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques to examine the way historical sexual allegations against public figures are investigated. Mr Proctor has also called for ""Nick"" and the news site ExaroNews, which has published a series of articles on Operation Midland, to be prosecuted for allegedly ""seeking to pervert the course of justice""."

""We stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people,"" Mr Obama said after dozens died in explosions at the Belgian capital city's airport and the subway system. ""We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend and ally Belgium in bringing to justice those who are responsible,"" he added. He said Tuesday's explosions were another reminder the world must unite in ""fighting against the scourge of terrorism"". Three Mormon missionaries serving in Paris were seriously injured in the blasts, said the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They were identified as 66-year-old Richard Norby, 20-year-old Joseph Empey and 19-year-old Mason Wells. Secretary of State John Kerry, who spoke by telephone from Cuba with the Belgian foreign minister, said the US was trying ""to determine the status of all American citizens in Brussels"". The Brussels embassy warned Americans to stay where they are and ""take the appropriate steps to bolster your personal security"". Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, said the explosions ""bear all the hallmarks"" of an Islamic State group attack. His staff said he received a preliminary briefing on Tuesday from US officials. The US Department of Homeland Security said it was closely monitoring the unfolding events and ""would not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people"". The Justice Department said the FBI was co-ordinating with other US government agencies and its Belgian counterparts. Also reacting to the attacks, Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump said Brussels was ""a disaster city"" where assimilation and immigration policies had failed. He told cable television networks the blasts underlined the need for authorities to crack down on extremists by any means possible, even waterboarding. Mr Trump - who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US - reiterated his belief that the US should close its borders ""until we figure out what's going on"". He told NBC: ""Belgium is no longer Belgium. Belgium is not the Belgium you and I knew from 20 years ago, which was one of the most beautiful and safest cities in the world. ""Belgium is a horror show right now. Terrible things are happening. People are leaving. People are afraid. This all happened because, frankly, there's no assimilation."" Democratic presidential front runner Hillary Clinton said the Brussels attacks will ""only strengthen our resolve to stand together as allies and defeat terrorism and radical jihadism""."

It was another four years before the UK was hit by the 7/7 tube train and bus bombs, but the inevitability he - now Lord Stevens - recognised is now even more pronounced. Brussels airport devastated after the blast Islamic extremists, al Qaeda, ISIS, have long had Britain in their sights for its support of military action in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Government, police and security service MI5 have all warned that there will be terror attacks in Britain. But for occasional reductions and brief rises, the UK has been on the second-highest state of terror alert - severe, with an attack highly likely - since August 2006. After the Mumbai attacks of 2008, the perceived threat here and elsewhere has been of multiple strikes on busy travel centres such as railway stations and airports, with mass casualties almost guaranteed. The murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, in 2013 raised fears of more radicalised individuals carrying out random attacks, especially those who've returned after military training in Syria. Earlier this month, police counter-terror chief Mark Rowley warned that our Western ""lifestyle"" itself is likely to be a target of ""enormous and spectacular"" attacks by ISIS suicide bombers and gunmen, like the November assaults on a football match, rock concert, restaurant and bars in Paris. But none of that has happened and, by any measure, Britain's police and intelligence services have done a remarkable job. So far. More armed police are being trained to deal with the threat of marauding gunmen. The number of terror suspects arrested continued to rise, up 57% in the past three years compared to the previous three. Around only half are charged and face a court, a statistic that angers civil liberty groups. Law enforcers say it's a price that must be paid in the difficult task of trying to dismantle suspected terror plots before they come to fruition. Parents and religious leaders are being urged to identify and report concerns over teenagers being radicalised. Many families and young people are being subjected to family court proceedings over fear of radicalisation. Unlike much of Europe the UK hasn't scrapped its border controls to allow free movement between our neighbouring countries and it's much more difficult to get into Britain the kind of lethal weapons used in terror attacks elsewhere. All of this has helped keep the UK relatively unscathed from terror. If - when - it does happen there is official advice that is no less relevant today than it was when Lord Stevens issued his warning 15 years ago: Run, Hide, Tell - get away if you can, and call the police."

All public transport has been closed in the Belgian capital following blasts at the city's Zaventem airport and at a Metro station. The airport said no flights would run at all on Tuesday. Eurostar also confirmed its services to and from Brussels had been suspended - with early trains from the UK to Brussels terminating at Lille. The company said on its Twitter feed: ""No trains are currently running to or from Brussels Midi. Brussels customers are advised to postpone, and not come to station"". :: Get Live Updates Here The apparent suicide attacks also prompted a growing number of European nations to announce reviews of their security procedures - with neighbouring Germany, France and the Dutch government all confirming heightened border checks. The suicide attack on the airport took place in a pre-security check-in area. Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester airports were among those confirming additional measures in the UK to help provide reassurance for passengers - with police forces nationwide bolstering transport security. It was a similar picture across the EU. Travellers reported delays and a heavy police presence at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport while the Thalys train service - which travels between France, Belgium and the Netherlands - has been suspended. The Dutch prime minister advised citizens against travelling to Belgium. Deutsche Bahn halted its high-speed rail service from Germany to Brussels with trains stopping at the border city of Aachen. France said 1,600 additional police officers would be placed on border protection and transport network duties. The attacks happened as air services were getting back to normal following two days of disruption across the EU, caused by French air traffic controller strikes. While flights in and out of Brussels are suspended - with incoming planes in the air being mostly diverted to Paris and Amsterdam - other major airports across Europe reported little disruption to wider departure and arrival times, despite tighter security.

Norwegian John Martin, 48, beat and strangled Natalia Strelchenko on the couple's second wedding anniversary in August last year. Justice Laura Cox sentenced him to serve at least 17 years for what she described as a ""brutal, sustained and unprovoked attack"".  Ms Strelchenko was found with serious head and neck injuries at their home in Newton Heath, Manchester. During the trial, a friend who had been staying at the couple's home described how Martin flew at Ms Strelchenko ""like an animal"". Both Martin and Ms Strelchenko fell down the stairs before he delivered repeated punches to her body, the court heard. When the female guest pleaded with him to stop, Martin said: ""I want to kill her."" Norwegian John Martin has been jailed for at least 17 years The husband claimed that he had no recollection of the killing after taking a mix of alcohol and diazepam, which he claimed to have mistaken for anti-depressants. When police arrived at their home on 30 August, Martin repeatedly said: ""Kill me, kill me please, I have nothing to live for, I do not deserve to live"". His words were caught on an officer's bodycam. Ms Strelchenko, who had attended the prestigious St Petersburg State Conservatory, died a short time later in hospital. She had 76 injuries including 45 separate marks to her head and neck having suffered repeated blows to the front of her face. Mrs Justice Cox said Martin had intended to kill his wife, although she accepted that he had been suffering from a moderate to severe depressive episode at the time of the attack. ""You were, as witnesses have described, unable to live with her and unable to live without her and I have no doubt that you would not allow her to be free,"" she told the court. Before sentencing, the court heard that Martin had been convicted at Oslo District Court in 2012 for four offences relating to assaults against Ms Strelchenko for which he was sentenced to a prison term of 90 days. Prosecutor Mr Rob Hall said that Martin had assaulted and threatened Ms Strelchenko with violence on two occasions in November 2012."

The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills committee wants to quiz Mr Ashley over the treatment of workers at the sportswear giant and have said he could be in contempt of Parliament if he fails to attend. However, he has told Sky News he intends to challenge the formal order to appear before MPs which he slammed as an ""abuse of the Parliamentary process"". Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United football club, was last week ordered to face the cross-party panel of MPs on 7 June. Committee chair Iain Wright turned down an offer for the MPs to meet Mr Ashley at the company's centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Mr Ashley said on Monday that Sports Direct had ""nothing to hide"" and he was ""not willing to stand idle while this company is subjected to public vilification"". ""Come here and see it for yourself. You will have to apologise once you've been here,"" he said. Referring to the summons by MPs, he went on: ""The current intention is not to go, because they ought to come here and see it for themselves. ""They would make a lot more informed decision if they were able to see it for themselves and then I don't think they would actually need to want to see me and carry on the media circus.

Sports Direct has been the subject of sustained criticism over the use of controversial ""zero hours"" contracts. Today the firm announced all staff and agency workers were being paid the national minimum wage ""at a cost of around £10m"", and that it would pay over 25s at least £7.40 an hour - the national living wage plus 20p - as pledged by Mr Ashley in December. It added there were currently no workers on ""zero hours"" contracts at its Derbyshire warehouse - but said such agreements were in place at its stores. Last December, it defended the way it treats its workforce after a Guardian investigation into working conditions among its warehouse staff."

Apple has refused to unlock the phone, thought to contain evidence relating to the massacre, resulting in a fierce legal battle between the two sides. A highly anticipated hearing over whether Apple should be forced to comply has been cancelled in light of the FBI's surprise announcement.  In a filing late on Monday, federal prosecutors said ""an outside party"" had come forward over the weekend with a possible method for unlocking Syed Rizwan Farook's encrypted phone. If viable, ""it should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple"", according to the filing. US Justice Department spokeswoman Melanie Newman said the government was ""cautiously optimistic"" that the possible method will work. The US government has obtained a court order requiring Apple to write new software to disable passcode protectors, which they can use on the phone. But Apple is fighting the order, warning that the software could fall into the hands of hackers and threaten the security of all encrypted devices. It says the demand violates its constitutional rights, harms its brand and threatens the trust of its customers to protect their privacy.  Numerous tech giants including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo, have publicly backed Apple alongside civil liberties groups and privacy advocates. Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik murdered 14 people and wounded 22 others in San Bernardino, California, in December. They were killed hours later in a gun battle with police. It was the deadliest terror attack in the US since 9/11."

Zach Mouzoun, who arrived at the airport on a flight from Geneva about 10 minutes before the first blast, told France's BFMTV: ""It was atrocious. The ceilings collapsed. There was blood everywhere, injured people, bags everywhere. We were walking in the debris. It was a war scene."" Video and images on social media showed smoke rising from an airport building and shattered windows. :: Sky Reporter Describes Moment Explosions Hit Confused and shocked passengers fled the terminal as they were evacuated by armed police. Footage also showed ceiling tiles littered across the floor and strewn black luggage belts, cases and bags at a check-in desk. According to reports, the first blast took place near a counter where customers pay for overweight baggage - and the second near a Starbucks at the airport. Anthony Deloos, who works for the baggage handling firm Swissport, said he ""jumped into a luggage chute to be safe"". The terror follows the dramatic arrest of Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam in the Belgian capital on Friday - four months after November's terror in the French capital that left 130 people dead. Authorities have said it is unclear if he is linked to Tuesday's suspected coordinated attacks. Security at key locations and transport hubs has also been stepped up across the UK, Netherlands, France and Germany. British Prime Minister David Cameron's spokeswoman said one British national had been injured in the attacks. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced the Eiffel Tower will be lit up this evening with Belgium's national colours. One of Islam's leading institutions, Al Azhar, condemned the ""heinous"" attacks as a violation of ""the tolerant teachings"" of the religion."

Here are ten things to takeaway: 1) Arbitrary welfare cap The welfare cap should go…Mr Duncan Smith said the cap was ""arbitrarily lowered"" following the General Election putting the Department of Work and Pensions ""under tremendous pressure"". 2) Balancing books on backs of the poor The Government is balancing the books on the backs of struggling working people and the vulnerable. He said the cuts to welfare had ""gone too far"" to the extent the ""unfairness"" was in danger of dividing society. He finally chose to resign after realising the Treasury ""juxtaposed"" the £1.3bn a year Personal Independence Payment curbs with tax cuts for middle earners. 3) Cuts will still come from welfare Mr Duncan Smith says the £4.4bn cut will still need to happen, the money will still need to be saved from the Department of Work and Pensions.

He said: ""This is not some secondary attempt to attack the PM or about Europe."" 6) Pensioners need to take some of the pain The Government needs to cut benefits to pensions, says Mr Duncan Smith. He said: ""We have a triple lock on pensions which I was proud to do six years ago but with inflation running at 0% we really need to look at things like this"". 7) This is not personal  This is not about him or EU. He said: ""This is not personal ... I have no personal ambitions. If I never go back into Government again, I will not cry about that.

Thousands of people left flowers or gifts in front of the artwork in Brixton following the Starman singer's death in New York on 10 January. Bowie was born in Brixton and now Lambeth Council has announced it is making plans for a more permanent memorial to the artist. It said it is in contact with his family to discuss renaming Tunstall Place, where the mural can be found on the side of the Morleys department store, and the possibility of a statue. Councillor Lib Peck, leader of Lambeth council, said in a statement: ""It is ultimately the family's decision as to what may be appropriate. Gallery: David Bowie: A Life In Pictures 1964: Davie Jones and the King Bees - George Underwood, Roger Bluck, Bob Allen (Drummer), David Bowie, Dave Howard ""We must respect that and be patient. Lambeth residents have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of affection visibly demonstrated by floral tributes, messages and people visiting the Bowie mural to pay their respects to this unique 'Brixton boy'. ""We are also in contact with the Bowie fan club and other Brixton organisations who want to honour the memory and legacy of this extraordinary artist. ""We will share any word we get from his family that will determine what we do next."" The council added that any flowers which remain next to the mural will be removed next week. Morleys has said it will preserve messages on the brick wall and drawings and cards will be stored in the council archives."

Europe's largest floating power station is near completion. When the £6.5m solar farm goes fully online, it will help power water treatment works on the outskirts of London. But its existence depended on beating a deadline on a government cuts to solar subsidies.  Nick Boyle is the CEO of Lightsource, which built the installation and will sell the electricity it generates to Thames Water. He told Sky News: ""The panels and the wires work optimally at a cooler temperature. ""One of the biggest advantages here is the water keeps the panels cool, keeps the wires cool, and actually increases the efficiency of the installation. ""Plus in an area such as this - this is built up London - space is at a premium, and this is utilising space that wasn't being utilised for anything else than water treatment, which it can still do."" Each panel is mounted onto an air-filled float, which are joined together to make rafts. Deep divers have fixed 177 anchors to the bottom of the reservoir and cables carry the power ashore and onto the treatment centre a few kilometres away. Floating solar farms are becoming popular wherever things are a bit cramped. Japan already has one water based solar plant and is currently building the world's biggest. The first was built in the UK in 2014,  in Berkshire, and another is under construction in Manchester. ""This plant will qualify for the renewable obligations certificate,"" Mr Boyle told Sky News. ""But in order to do that, it had to be built by the 31 March 2016. If this was being built a day after that - or being connected a day after that - it wouldn't be possible."" Others argue that after a period of generous subsidy, solar technology should be able to stand on its own two feet. Douglas Stewart, the CEO of Green Energy UK, told Sky News: ""There are two sides to this. ""One is you need to kick-start the industry. You need to put incentives into place to get people to take risks. ""But by the same token, you can't burden the public with the costs associated with it. And tariffs are passed onto the public."""
2016-03-22,"All jobs should allow flexible working ""as a default"" in order to eliminate the gender pay gap, according to MPs.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160322153604/http://news.sky.com/story/1664303/mps-employers-must-do-more-for-working-mums,"By Richard Suchet, Sky News Reporter All jobs should allow flexible working ""as a default"" in order to eliminate the gender pay gap, according to MPs. The Women and Equalities Select Committee says not enough is being done to help women return to work after having children. The committee is urging the Government to take action to ensure that flexible working is offered to all employees, unless there is a strong business case. Conservative MP Maria Millar, who chairs the committee, told Sky News: ""It is not that women are choosing to go into low-paid working, but it's often the only sort of working that is available flexibly. ""So we see in the care sector that 80% of workers are women because it can offer the sort of flexible jobs that fit around family commitments. But what that actually means is that many of those women are not using all of their skills. ""As a country we face a productivity crisis and if we're going to increase our productivity we have to make sure those women are using their skills better. ""If the Government is serious about long-term, sustainable growth it must invest in tackling the root causes of the gender pay gap."" The committee is also calling for fathers to be offered three months non-transferrable, well-paid paternity leave so that men and women are able to share childcare more equally. The Government has pledged to ""eliminate the gender pay gap within a generation"" but the 19.2% difference in pay for full and part-time workers has remained the same for four years. Women aged between 50 and 57 face a differential of 27%. Laura Weston, 38, gained 12 years' experience managing digital content teams for some of the UK's biggest brands before she decided to take a three-year break to bring up her children. When she was ready to return to the workplace and continue building her career, she suddenly felt penalised for her decision. ""It was really frustrating going for jobs after a three-year career break,"" she said. ""I found that if I was going for jobs that weren't quite up to my skillset - a little bit less than what I was able to do - they wrote me off because I was over-qualified. ""Whereas if I was going for the jobs at the appropriate senior level, they would obviously look at somebody who was currently working and choose them instead. So it's very difficult to get back in. ""My husband wasn't allowed the flexibility and so you are carrying all the childcare on your own as well as trying to hold down a job and it all just gets a bit much."" Laura has now managed to find flexible permanent employment through the Back2Businessship scheme, a programme designed to help mothers get back into work. After a three-month placement at the PR and communications firm Golin, she was appointed as Marketing Director. The Fawcett Society, which promotes gender equality and women's rights has welcomed the report by the Women and Equalities Committee. Chief Executive Sam Smethers said: ""We particularly welcome the recommendation that all jobs should be flexible by default but we think that this should be backed up with additional regulation as a requirement on employers. ""A dedicated period of well-paid leave for fathers would also be transformational for many families and enable mums and dads to share care as they choose to."" TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""If we don't tackle problems like occupational segregation, the motherhood pay penalty and barriers to more equal parenting, the gender pay gap will take decades to close."" But there are signs that attitudes are changing. A number of financial services firms announced today that they have signed up to a voluntary charter committing them to increase diversity in the workplace. Virgin Money, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland are among the companies to sign up."
2016-03-22,Mike Ashley has become one of the most talked about businessmen in Britain while hardly ever talking about himself.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160322153604/http://news.sky.com/story/1664218/sports-direct-warehouse-is-ikea-on-steroids,"By Paul Kelso, Sports Correspondent Mike Ashley has become one of the most talked about businessmen in Britain while hardly ever talking about himself. As private as he is successful, the founder of Sports Direct has done only a handful of interviews in his time at the helm of the company, and of Newcastle United, the club he bought in 2007. So it was unexpected, and highly unusual, to find the man worth £3.5bn holding open the door for Sky News and a select group of media at his vast warehouse at Shirebrook in Derbyshire. The huge facility, Britain's largest warehouse with the exception of the cargo terminal at Heathrow, is the heart of the Sports Direct empire. Built on a former coalfield, it's now a model of modern industry with up to 5,000 staff a day working in four shifts 24/7, and like its predecessor, it attracts concern from unions and politicians. After years of rapid growth that took it into the FTSE 100 of Britain's largest companies, Sports Direct has endured six months of sustained criticism from the City, business leaders and MPs. The company has become a lightning rod for concern over the increasing use of zero-hours contracts in the UK labour market, and Ashley the face of what many see as the unacceptable side of capitalism. Media reports of working practices, including the revelation that staff were effectively being paid less than the minimum wage, has wiped 40% off the share price and put Ashley on the back foot. His response was to invite the media to Shirebrook and answer questions, explaining repeatedly that there was almost nothing he would not rather have been doing. On the warehouse floor the scale and industry is striking. Shirebrook is IKEA on steroids, with more than a million pairs of shoes alone stored on site. Scores of staff, mainly men and women in their 20s and largely from Eastern Europe, rattle from aisle to aisle pushing cages filled with items to be despatched to shops or online customers. There were none of the Tannoy messages that are reported to be used to harangue staff - he insisted the system was switched on - but the focus on productivity is obvious. League tables of the most efficient pickers are published on the canteen wall, and Ashley stresses that this is a competitive, bonus-driven environment. His passion for his business, and the complex mix of logistics, deal-making and price-cutting that defines the discount retail sector, was also obvious. He accepts that the company ""isn't perfect"" and showed off a new exit facility which speeds up the time it takes for staff to be searched on departure. That used to take up to 45 minutes, time for which staff were not paid. And he announced concessions. He said all Shirebrook staff were now paid the minimum wage, at a cost of £10m, and in future all over-25s will earn the new living wage, plus 20p, worth £7.40 an hour. Addressing his political and City critics however he was entirely unapologetic. He called the business select committee, which has summonsed him to Parliament, a ""joke"", and said he would like to ""box Ed Miliband's ears"" after the Labour leader attacked ""the Sports Direct economy"" at the last election. And shareholders seeking to hold him to account while still owning shares were hypocrites. ""If you don't like me, don't own the stock. Customers come first, Sports Direct staff second, shareholders third."" It is a message the City may have to get used to. From now on, in a swing that he knows the company cannot continue with its reputation tarnished, he will host annual open days for shareholders and the media. Just don't expect him to enjoy it."

Tia's grandmother Christine Bicknell, 50, of Croydon, also denies a charge of racially aggravated harassment. Christine Bicknell, Tia Sharp's grandmother, at Croydon Crown Court The dispute occurred on 18 April last year outside a Lidl store in Wallington, south London. Prosecutor Duncan Cooke said the argument began after Selvete Selmani parked in a mother and baby parking space, despite not having children with her. During the assault Sharp punched and kicked Ms Selmani and grabbed her by the hair, Mr Cooke said. He claimed that during the attack Sharp swore at Ms Selmani and said ""go back to your own country"". But during her evidence, Ms Selmani said she did not hear Sharp say anything referring to her being a ""foreigner"". Stuart Hazell was jailed for life for the murder of Tia Sharp, 12, in 2013 A witness, Philip Walters, told the court he had been behind Bicknell's car in the carpark when she had stopped and Sharp got out. He told jurors: ""She got out of the car very quickly, aggressively screaming and shouting and hit the woman in the face."" He said he did not hear what Sharp said to Ms Selmani, who appeared to be in a ""state of shock"". The trial continues."

The Metropolitan Police commissioner says customers should be given incentives to tighten their passwords and update anti-virus software instead. He said banks could make people more security conscious by refusing to reimburse people who had failed to protect themselves. ""If you are continually rewarded for bad behaviour, you will probably continue to do it but, if the obverse is true, you might consider changing behaviour,"" he told The Times. GCHQ says that 80% of cybercrime - which costs £1bn a year - could be prevented by more complex passwords and updated security software. According to a survey by Norton Cybersecurity last year, two in five (44%) UK consumers have fallen victim to cybercrime but about the same number (42%) do not change their passwords after such an attack. ""The system is not incentivising you to protect yourself,"" Sir Bernard said. ""If someone said to you: 'If you've not updated your software, I will give you half back', you would do it."" Police are set to include cybercrime estimates in their official crime statistics for the first time in July and Sir Bernard said this change could see crime figures double. He added: ""It's hard to get the evidence (to prosecute offenders). ""There are jurisdictional issues - if your attacker was in Estonia, the money went through America to Africa, that's a real challenge. ""If you're very lucky, all your victims are in the UK but they are unlikely all to be in Croydon."""

In a new report, the all-party Foreign Affairs Select Committee calls on David Cameron to step up efforts for a long-term ceasefire in Syria's civil war. The MPs also launch a scathing attack on the Turkish government, claiming its actions against the Kurds are undermining the global battle against IS. In its report, the committee calls for UK to give greater priority to the immediate fight against IS, warning it cannot wait until a comprehensive peace settlement is reached in Syria. Crispin Blunt MP, the committee's chairman, told Sky News: ""The tragic events in Brussels only serve to underline the urgency of the fight against IS."" The former Army captain and ex-minister added: ""If the Syrian regime and opposition forces are able to agree a mutual purpose to reclaim Syrian territory jointly from IS, they can begin a positive founding narrative of a new Syria. ""This should ultimately allow for the resolution of the hard issues around the future of the leaders of the current Syrian government. ""It would be absolutely counter to our interests, and those of the Syrian people, if these talks were to collapse - and the UK might bear a share of the responsibility if the perceived client, the Syrian opposition, were the party responsible for any failure."" In their criticism of Turkey, the MPs said Syrian Kurdish forces have proved important allies in the fight against IS, but Turkey has conducted airstrikes against Kurdish forces in northern Syria and reopened the conflict with Kurds within its own borders. ""The shameless actions of the Turkish President, in furthering his own domestic agenda, cannot be allowed to continue,"" added Mr Blunt. ""The UK appears to be turning a blind eye to Turkey's brutal suppression of the Kurds - almost certainly in return for Turkish co-operation on EU migration priorities. ""The UK should spearhead raising with Turkey their behaviour on the Kurdish issue, their airstrikes against the Syrian Kurds, their suppression of internal dissent and freedom of speech, and their destructive role in the political process."" In their report, the MPs suggest the priority should be to reach a preliminary agreement which allows the Syrian regime and opposition forces to focus on tackling IS. The committee said the cessation of hostilities between opposing sides in Syria, which came into force in February, represents a significant step forward in resolving the crisis. However, the report went on to say that if the peace talks in Geneva are to succeed, both the Syrian regime and opposition forces will have to compromise."

He added: ""The year ahead may well be the toughest we have faced since 2008. ""In many ways we have more to do than ever before with complex challenges to our working practices across product, marketing and systems. ""It may well feel like walking up the down escalator, with a great deal of effort required to stand still. ""It will not be the first time we have felt this way, and our experience is that the effort put into improving the business in tough times can pay handsome rewards when conditions improve."" The company named its objectives for 2016 as developing the brand, upgrading the Directory, investing in its online business and ""profitable new retail space"" and to control costs ""without detracting from the quality of our products and services"". It also noted changes such as just 37% of online orders being placed on desktop computers last year – down from 95% five years ago. Also, just 45% of orders were delivered to a customer’s home last year – with the rest being delivered for collection from a store. This was around half of the 87% of orders being delivered to homes in 2010. The result comes just two months after the High Street giant blamed ""unusually warm weather"" in November and December as it posted a 0.5% fall in full-price sales in a trading update covering the key Christmas period."

Tracy Anderwald, 34, had suffered a seizure and blacked out in the pool at her sister's home in Portland, Texas. Daughter Allison realised she had not lifted her head out of the water for five minutes, jumped into the water and pulled her mother to the shallow end of the pool where she turned her over so her head was not submerged. Ms Anderwald's sister Tedra Hunt said she was walking over to the house when Allison ran to tell her what had happened. She told ABC News: ""The doctors explained to us that had Tracy been underwater any longer, she probably wouldn't be with us right now. ""It is truly amazing that this little girl, who's actually also pretty small for her age, was able to save my sister."" Doctors were initially concerned Ms Anderwald may have suffered neurological damage after being under the water, but she woke up in hospital in Corpus Christi on Saturday, a day after the seizure, and was released on Tuesday. The two sisters are hoping the video of Allison will help raise awareness of the importance of teaching children how to swim and what to do in an emergency. Ms Anderwald told ABC News: ""Allison's been swimming since she was two-and-a-half. She's our little mermaid and my little hero."""

Almost 60% of banks which responded to the survey by the British Bankers' Association said any departure from the 28-nation bloc would have a negative impact on their organisation, while 25.7% of them saying the impact would be ""significant"". Fifty-five per cent thought remaining in the EU would be in their organisation's best interests, with just 1% saying a departure would be good for their business. Anthony Browne, BBA chief executive, said: ""Our survey shows there is almost no appetite from banks for the UK to leave the EU. ""The single market is of crucial importance to the UK banking industry, which employs over half a million people, contributes over £31bn in tax a year, and is the country’s biggest export industry."" Just over 50% of the association's 147 voting members responded to the survey, representing 90% of the UK banking sector workforce. Mr Browne said, however, that, because 63% of respondents had said their bank does not hold a position on whether or not the UK should remain in the EU, the BBA would also remain neutral in the debate. The United Kingdom will vote on Thursday, 23 June on whether it should remain in the European Union."

The complete walkout - the second of two planned strikes for England - is scheduled for 26 April and will include everyone up to consultant level. Previous industrial action by junior doctors has seen emergency cover provided. The British Medical Association (BMA) blamed the move on ""the continued refusal by the Government to step back from its decision to impose a new contract on junior doctors from August this year and resolve the dispute by re-entering talks"". But the Department of Health (DoH) has condemned the move as ""desperate and irresponsible"" and claimed it would ""inevitably put patients in harm's way"". The dispute centres on weekend pay and whether Saturdays should attract extra 'unsocial' payments. A 48-hour strike starting on Wednesday 6 April at 8am, where junior doctors provide ""emergency care only"", will go ahead as planned, the BMA said. But the walkout scheduled for later in the month will change from providing 48-hour emergency care only to a ""full withdrawal of labour"" by junior doctors between the hours of 8am and 5pm on both 26 and 27 April. Dr Johann Malawana, chairman of the BMA's junior doctor committee, said: ""No junior doctor wants to take this action but the Government has left us with no choice. ""In refusing to lift imposition and listen to junior doctors' outstanding concerns, the Government will bear direct responsibility for the first full walkout of doctors in this country. ""The Government is refusing to get back around the table and is ploughing ahead with plans to impose a contract junior doctors have no confidence in and have roundly rejected. ""We deeply regret the disruption to patients and our message to patients is clear; this action is wholly avoidable but the Government must choose talks over imposition."" In a statement, the Department of Health said: ""This escalation of industrial action by the BMA is both desperate and irresponsible - and will inevitably put patients in harm's way. ""If the BMA had agreed to negotiate on Saturday pay, as they promised to do through ACAS in November, we'd have a negotiated agreement by now. ""Instead, we had no choice but to proceed with proposals recommended and supported by NHS leaders."""

The - unlucky - winners were made even more angry by the discovery that they had won less money than those with three winning numbers.   Unlucky for some - a five-number win with a paltry payout Lottery organiser Camelot earlier revealed that more than 4,000 punters had matched five of the six balls and won just £15 each. In contrast, 7,879 ticket holders with four numbers won £51, while the 114,232 people who matched three balls only won £25. Some players took to Twitter to point out the discrepancy, adding that the minimum win is set at £25. Leon Howell tweeted: ""So getting 5 numbers in the national lottery tonight bagged you #15 but 3 numbers got you #25......thenationallotteryrobbery."" Matt Needham wrote: ""3 numbers tonight = #25. 5 numbers tonight = #15. The national lottery is an actual joke!!!!"" Conor King added: ""Match 5 numbers with odds of over 1 in 144,000... Win #15. The UK lottery is officially a joke."" A Camelot spokesperson said: ""We had an unprecedented 4,082 Match 5 winners tonight.  ""This is because five of the six main numbers drawn was a multiple of seven - 07, 14, 21, 35 and 42 - and clearly this is a popular set of numbers. ""To put it into context, the four Lotto draws before this one had 55, 36, 61 and 38 Match 5 winners - so over 4,000 Match 5 winners is highly unusual. ""It is a lottery at the end of the day, and is down to the numbers drawn and the number of people who match with those numbers. As a result, we do sometimes see unusual situations like this.""

A consultation was launched late last year after the Financial Policy Committee, which is part of the Bank of England, recommended it should be granted the power to direct regulators to require lenders to restrict buy-to-let loans. The powers included allowing the FPC to cap the maximum loan-to-value ratio (the size of the loan relative to the value of the property), as well as the costs of debt servicing relative to rents. The FPC, whose role is to identify and head-off possible risks to the financial system, has had similar powers over residential mortgages since April last year. George Osborne told the Treasury Select Committee on Thursday that it was ""highly likely"" the FPC would be given the powers over the buy-to-let mortgage market ""later this year"". He said: ""The Bank of England and the Financial Policy Committee have identified potential systemic risks in the large increase in the buy-to-let market. ""The measures I have taken in the last couple of fiscal events - on additional stamp duty, on changes to mortgage interest relief - have been done in the knowledge the Bank of England has concerns about a bubble emerging in this market. ""It is highly likely we will give the FPC powers over the buy-to-let market. It is possible we can do that later this year."" The Chancellor used the Budget to impose a 3% hike in stamp duty on additional properties, with moves also announced to curb tax relief on buy-to-let mortgage interest. The news came as the British Bankers' Association reported that £13.2bn of mortgage borrowing was approved in February - lower than in January but 33% higher than at the same time last year. The number of mortgage approvals in February was also 26% higher than a year ago. The BBA's chief economist Richard Woolhouse said: ""It appears that borrowers are continuing to try to get ahead of the increases in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second home buyers scheduled to come into effect next month."""
2016-03-25,"The chief suspect in the Paris attacks has claimed he ""didn't know"" about the Brussels terror plot, according to his lawyer.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160325023511/http://news.sky.com/story/1666012/paris-suspect-didnt-know-of-brussels-plot,"The chief suspect in the Paris attacks has claimed he ""didn't know"" about the Brussels terror plot, according to his lawyer. The denial by Salah Abdeslam comes amid mounting evidence of strong links between the extremists that carried out this week's Belgium bombings and those behind the atrocities in the French capital last November. Meanwhile, it has been reported the authorities suspect a second bomber was involved in the deadly attack on Maalbeek metro station. Defence lawyer Sven Mary is representing Abdeslam :: IS Using Brothers 'To Plan Attacks In Secret' Abdeslam, who was captured in Brussels last week after four months on the run following the bombing and shooting rampage in Paris that left 130 people dead, has also said he will no longer fight extradition to France. Defence lawyer Sven Mary said his client, a French citizen, wanted to return as ""quickly as possible"" to ""explain himself"". As investigations continue into the Brussels attacks, local media have reported police examining CCTV footage believe another man was involved in the bombing on the metro and could be on the run. It had previously been thought a lone suicide bomber, Khalid El Bakraoui, had carried out the devastating strike. The suspect was captured by surveillance cameras in the metro on Tuesday carrying a large bag alongside Khalid, although it is not known if he was also killed in the attack. Khalid's brother, Ibrahim, was one of two suicide attackers who targeted Brussels airport the same day. It has emerged his accomplice, who also blew himself up, was Najim Laachraoui, 24, identified as the bomb maker in the Paris terror attacks. Belgium has been accused of ignoring warnings that Ibrahim was a ""foreign terrorist fighter"". He was caught in June last year at the Turkish-Syrian border and deported to the Netherlands, but was allowed to walk free after the Belgian authorities failed to establish any terror links, Turkey said. The latest developments come as the manhunt continues for another suspect dressed in a light-coloured jacket and a hat. Dubbed the ""man in white"", he was pictured alongside Ibrahim El Bakraoui and Laachraoui, moments before they detonated their suitcase bombs. Prosecutors have revealed his explosive device, which failed to detonate, was the largest of them all. Belgian counter-terror officials have raised the prospect that other suspects linked to the attacks may also still be at large. At least 31 people were killed and 270 injured in the suicide bomb attacks at Zaventem Airport and Maalbeek station on Tuesday morning. Among the dead were a student and a mother of young twins.  Four Britons were among those hurt in the blasts, and worried relatives have said they are ""desperately"" searching for David Dixon, originally from Hartlepool but living in Brussels, who has not been heard from since the metro explosion. The UK's Home Secretary, Theresa May, is meeting her EU counterparts in Brussels later for emergency talks about the bombings. An EU statement said the meeting is ""intended to show solidarity with Belgium and discuss the actual state of play in the fight against terrorism""."

Marsha Gay Reynolds surrendered to federal authorities at JFK International Airport on Wednesday, although it was unclear how she had arrived in New York, federal officials said. She is expected to appear in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday, US Attorney's spokesman Thom Mrozek said. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials asked Reynolds to step aside for a random security screening on Friday, according to authorities. Nearly 70lbs of cocaine was allegedly found in her luggage She went to a secondary screening area, but dropped her bag, ditched a pair of Gucci heels and fled barefoot down an upward-moving escalator, LAX airport police said. Reynolds was charged with cocaine possession with intent to distribute. Mr Mrozek said prosecutors believe that Reynolds was a runner-up in Miss Jamaica World 2008. New York University lists a Marsha-Gay Reynolds as having been on the school's 2004 women's track and field team. On Friday, she had arrived at an LAX checkpoint in Terminal 4 wearing jeans, heels and a black suit jacket, with her ""known crew member badge"", according to an FBI affidavit. It was unclear whether she was on duty at the time. When she was chosen for random security screening, TSA officer Jamie Samuel said she became nervous and began looking around, before making a call on her mobile phone. Mr Samuel said Reynolds was talking in a foreign language as she was moved to the secondary screening area, according to the affidavit. Once inside, TSA officer Charles James asked for her identification. ""At this time, Reynolds dropped her carry-on luggage, removed her shoes and began to run away,"" the affidavit said. Eleven packages of cocaine wrapped in green cellophane and labelled ""BIG Ranch"" were found inside one of the bags Reynolds left behind. The cocaine weighed more than 68lbs and could be worth as much as $3m."

But that didn't fully explain his apparent disinterest in the whole judicial process. His big problem is that he has no self-awareness; not of the consequences of grooming a schoolgirl for sex, not of the shame he should be enduring, nor of what lies ahead of him in prison. There was a moment during a court break when he turned to a friend and said: ""I hope this is finished by Friday, it's a bit boring now."" Another time, in the dock, the judge rebuked him for his ""discourteous behaviour"" when he saw him chatting and laughing with a security guard. In the witness box he was asked to study a photograph - from his mobile phone - of his own ""nether regions"", as his barrister described them, and discuss the issue of shaved pubic hair. Not a hint of embarrassment at the indignity. Even I squirmed a bit. In his daily walk in and out of court past a phalanx of cameras there was no sign of remorse. He often strode yards ahead of his betrayed partner Stacey Flounders, even on the day she was brave enough to give evidence on his behalf. He admitted in his own evidence that he was not an emotional man, but even so... After the trial it was reported his family and friends threw a farewell party for him at his home two weekends ago. Nothing wrong in that, but did he really have to let one of his guests be photographed walking out barefoot at dawn and swigging from a bottle of booze? Johnson's fall from grace - from star England footballer to jailed paedophile - is as big as any I've witnessed in my years of crime reporting. I can't help feeling a little bit sorry for him, but he's doing everything he can to stop me."

The Chancellor said the firms would be better placed spending the next two years focusing on how to reduce sugar in their products and should not ""waste time"" on mounting a legal challenge. Giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Osborne said he was happy the tax was legally sound and would robustly defend any action. :: Sugar Tax: The Budget White Rabbit He said: ""Many companies are doing the right thing and reducing the sugar content in their drinks and that is to be applauded. ""Other companies are saying either this sugar tax isn't going to happen or they are going to challenge it in the courts. ""I would say, if they want to have an argument about the sugar tax, bring it on. ""We are going to introduce a sugar tax. It's not a threat or a promise, it's the way it's going to be. ""And I think it is the right thing for this country. I think it will make a huge improvement to childhood health."" :: 10 Iain Duncan Smith Resignation Interview Takeaways Mr Osborne announced measures that will see a tax of 18p-24p per litre on sugary drinks in his Budget last week to come into effect in 2018. The Institute for Fiscal Studies released new analysis showing that more than 90% of households consume more ""added sugar"" than recommended, and that soft drinks accounted for 17% of those purchases. :: Osborne Admits Disability Cuts Were A Mistake Families with children consume around 50% more of their added sugar from soft drinks than childless households.  The Chancellor was giving evidence after measures in his Budget started to unravel when he was forced into a climbdown over £4.4bn cuts to Personal Independence Payments. The move triggered the resignation of work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, pitching the Conservatives into a civil war. Mr Osborne admitted: ""Clearly, if we are going to make reforms to disability benefits we have to go about it in a better way than we did. ""It did not command support, as was perfectly obvious, and that's where I think the lessons need to be learned.""  However, he repeatedly dodged questions over whether Mr Duncan Smith had, as he had claimed, put up a fight to ensure the cuts to the disability benefits were not included in the Budget. The Chancellor insisted that the decision was made collectively based on research carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions after a significant increase in the cost of disability benefits to Government. He said: ""It was a collective decision-making process as evidence by the fact the announcement was made by the DWP."" Mr Osborne added he was sorry Mr Duncan Smith had gone but because of the nature of their jobs there were always going to be arguments. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves pointed out to Mr Osborne that he had failed to hit his own welfare cap in any single year and was £20.8bn short of hitting it. She asked Mr Osborne if the cap was still government policy and asked if there would be further welfare cuts at the Autumn Statement. The Chancellor said the welfare cap was still the policy but refused to rule out making any welfare caps at the Autumn Statement despite repeated questions from Ms Reeves. He suggested that the plans to clampdown on EU migrant benefits could help to fill the £1.3bn annual gap left by the climbdown on Personal Independence Payments."

Ibrahim El Bakraoui was one of two men in dark tops who blew themselves up in the departure hall on Tuesday morning. His thoughts were found on a computer which was dumped in a rubbish bin on a street near the militants' hideout. In the note - revealed by prosecutors - El Bakraoui described himself as ""always on the run, not knowing what to do anymore, being hunted everywhere, not being safe any longer"". And he added that ""if he hangs around, he risks ending up next to the person in a cell"" - a reference to suspected Paris bomber Salah Abdeslam, who was arrested in Brussels last week. The note was recovered following a raid on an apartment in the Brussels district of Schaerbeek on Tuesday night. At the property, security forces found a nail bomb, an Islamic State flag, 15kg of the same kind of explosives used in the Paris attacks and bomb-making chemicals. An unused explosive device was also discovered at the airport. :: How Brussels And Paris Attackers Are Linked El Bakraoui and an unidentified second man carried out attacks at the airport, while a third man in a hat pictured alongside them on CCTV fled the scene and is on the run. Investigators were tipped off about the apartment by a taxi driver who had driven three ""suspicious"" individuals to the airport - and was told not to touch their luggage upon arrival. He directed police to a house in Schaerbeek, where he had picked them up. Security experts believe Tuesday's blasts were probably being planned before 26-year-old Abdeslam was detained on Friday. At least 31 people were killed and around 300 others injured in two blasts at the airport, and a third explosion - carried out by El Bakraoui's brother Khalid - at a metro station in the Belgian capital."

But they're missing one key ingredient: alcohol. This is one of London's few ""dry bars"", serving booze-free cocktails for the health conscious. ""Alcohol is a drug,"" says one customer sipping on a coconut concoction. ""For me, all drugs are destructive to your health… if we can phase it out of society, we can have a healthier population all round."" Officials want to see more of these premises - all stocked with low alcohol beverages, or alcohol-free options. The Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 councils, is putting pressure on drinks makers to offer UK venues ciders, wine and spirits which are at a lower strength. It is also calling for the Government to extend tax breaks already in place for low-alcohol beer to other drinks, too - and argues doing so will help cut the nation's health bills while benefiting the hospitality industry. ""We're all drinking too much,"" says Redemption's founder, Catherine Salway. ""There's a gap in the market because people are eating healthier and drinking healthier… but why every time you socialise, should it be at the expense of your health?"" Alcohol abuse costs the NHS an estimated £3.5bn a year. The LGA believes weaker drinks will help people live healthier lives and control drinking levels, in turn tackling costly excessive drinking. They also believe stocking alcohol-free alternatives would ""revitalise"" pubs. With as many as 30 closing a week, they argue Britain's drinking culture has changed, and that social venues could capitalise on it. Research from Alcohol Concern shows one in five adults in the UK don't drink, and the number of young people who are teetotal is on the rise. But there is little impetus for drinks manufacturers to change. Addictions and alcohol expert Sally Marlow acknowledges ""the industry is not responsible for the nation's health, they are responsible to shareholders"" - which means they look for products with high profit margins, and not those that offer a social good. Many alcoholic drinks have got stronger over the years, not weaker. One study found wines across the world have a higher alcohol percentage today compared to 20 years ago. But changing the industry and our own tastes will mean breaking the habit of decades, if not a lifetime."

John Lund, of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, said there is ""significant concern"" at the scale of the attack and because wolves usually eat what they kill. There are an estimated 330 wolves in Wyoming. Pic: File ""It's extremely rare in that severity,"" said Mr Lund. He said the pack suspected of the slaughter has nine wolves. ""It appears to be sport killing,"" he told CNN. A wolf rolls in snow after killing and eating an elk in Yellowstone in 2011 Mr Lund said about 7% of the local elk population, estimated at around 1,100, has been lost to wolves this winter. He added there have been no reports of wolves attacking humans. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department can do little to prevent such kills because wolves are a protected animal. Elk are the most common food source for wolves in Wyoming Once nearly extinct, the animals were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s. There are estimated to be about 330 wolves in Wyoming. Wyoming's wolves benefit from a federally guaranteed endangered species status, which means they can't be hunted. Environmental groups say that if control was passed over to the state, Wyoming would allow wolves to be shot on sight. Wolves have remained off the endangered species list in Montana and Idaho since 2011."

Phillip Johnathan Harrison told police in Brisbane, Australia, he was worth £6.3bn after he was stopped driving an Audi sports car and found with methamphetamine, Viagra and ecstasy. Harrison's lawyer Nick Hanly told Brisbane Magistrates' Court he asked the 29-year-old how he had come by his huge wealth. The lawyer revealed: ""He said he wasn't at liberty to say. At this point I was considering getting mental health to come in."" Harrison, 29, was stopped by police in a sports car But, news.com.au reported, Harrison showed Mr Hanly his online bank account which showed a cash balance of AU$596m (£316m) and a property portfolio of AU$1.56bn (£820m). ""I would not have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,"" Mr Hanly said. Such wealth would make Harrison as rich as a handful of Australian mining magnates and property kings. The court heard Harrison was a user of methamphetamine. He was ordered to surrender his passport as his wealth meant he could be considered an increased flight risk. The bricklayer is due to return to court on 18 April Magistrate Anthony Gett agreed to grant Harrison bail with the condition that he stays at an address in Tewantin, about 75 miles (120km) north of Brisbane. He was told to return to court on 18 April."

The regime used North Korean state TV to demand that South Korean President Park Geun-hye apologise for ""treason"". in a statement titled ""Ultimatum to Park Geun-hye Group,"" a unit of the Korean People's Army (KPA) warned South Korea that its presidential palace is within striking range of the North's artillery units. South Korean President Park Geun-hye ""The three-times-cursed traitor Park and her group should make an official apology to all Koreans in the North, the South and abroad for daring to commit high treason,"" a KRT news reader said. ""If unequalled traitor Park Geun-hye and her group do not respond to the ultimatum of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the long-range artillery force of the KPA units will take merciless military action. ""This is the ultimatum of the KPA's long-range artillery force, which keeps the Cheongwadae (Blue House, the South Korean president's residence) and the reactionary ruling machines (South Korea) within firing range, waiting for the order for a pre-emptive strike to punish the enemies."" The army unit claimed an order to attack was ""just a click away"". The threat came after North Korea state television broadcast images showing artillery being fired and Supreme Leader Kim Jong- Un inspecting weaponry. On Friday, it claimed the military drill was a simulated attack on the South Korean president's Blue House. It is the latest in a series of threats against Washington and Seoul following the start of joint military drills by the US and South Korea. The North sees the drills as preparations for invasion. A series of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang have increased tensions between the two Koreas. Seoul has halted all contact between itself and its northern neighbour, including the operation of a joint industrial park, and placed its own sanctions on the North in addition to existing international sanctions. North Korea is believed to have artillery capable of striking Seoul with little or no warning. However, Pyongyang has issued similar threats in the past without following them through."

But that didn't fully explain his apparent disinterest in the whole judicial process. His big problem is that he has no self-awareness; not of the consequences of grooming a schoolgirl for sex, not of the shame he should be enduring, nor of what lies ahead of him in prison. There was a moment during a court break when he turned to a friend and said: ""I hope this is finished by Friday, it's a bit boring now."" Another time, in the dock, the judge rebuked him for his ""discourteous behaviour"" when he saw him chatting and laughing with a security guard. In the witness box he was asked to study a photograph - from his mobile phone - of his own ""nether regions"", as his barrister described them, and discuss the issue of shaved pubic hair. Johnson played for Middlesbrough, Manchester City and Sunderland Not a hint of embarrassment at the indignity. Even I squirmed a bit. :: Adam Johnson Jailed For Six Years  In his daily walk in and out of court past a phalanx of cameras there was no sign of remorse. He often strode yards ahead of his betrayed partner Stacey Flounders, even on the day she was brave enough to give evidence on his behalf. He admitted in his own evidence that he was not an emotional man, but even so... After the trial it was reported his family and friends threw a farewell party for him at his home two weekends ago. Nothing wrong in that, but did he really have to let one of his guests be photographed walking out barefoot at dawn and swigging from a bottle of booze? Johnson's fall from grace - from star England footballer to jailed paedophile - is as big as any I've witnessed in my years of crime reporting. I can't help feeling a little bit sorry for him, but he's doing everything he can to stop me."

The Visayan warty piglet is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. The new arrival was born at Newquay Zoo in February and has now been put on show. Warty pigs originate from the Visayan Islands in the Philippines but the species is in rapid decline. Newquay Zoo curator John Meek said: ""I am really thrilled we have successfully bred a warty piglet, as the species is in dire straits and without intervention from us they are in danger of becoming extinct. ""We had to keep it inside for the first few weeks as it's been so wet but the piglet is thriving and visitors can now catch a glimpse of it out and about."" Destruction of forests and hunting are to blame for the warty pig's near-extinction. Male warty pigs develop long crests and manes similar to a mohawk hairstyle."

Here are ten things to takeaway: 1) Arbitrary welfare cap The welfare cap should go…Mr Duncan Smith said the cap was ""arbitrarily lowered"" following the General Election putting the Department of Work and Pensions ""under tremendous pressure"". 2) Balancing books on backs of the poor The Government is balancing the books on the backs of struggling working people and the vulnerable. He said the cuts to welfare had ""gone too far"" to the extent the ""unfairness"" was in danger of dividing society. He finally chose to resign after realising the Treasury ""juxtaposed"" the £1.3bn a year Personal Independence Payment curbs with tax cuts for middle earners. 3) Cuts will still come from welfare Mr Duncan Smith says the £4.4bn cut will still need to happen, the money will still need to be saved from the Department of Work and Pensions. He said: ""The money required from the DWP still sits in the Red Book. It will be a requirement that will bear down on working age benefits and that is the problem that I have."" 4) I have been ""isolated"" Mr Duncan Smith said he had been left out of the big decisions in his former department. He said: ""This has been a long-running problem when I have felt really semi-detached in a sense, isolated more often in these debates because I am not able to convince people that what we were losing progressively ... was the narrative that the Conservative Party was this one nation party caring about those who don't even necessarily vote for it, who may never vote for it."" 5) This is not an attack on David Cameron He said that his resignation was not part of a coup against the Prime Minister. He said: ""This is not some secondary attempt to attack the PM or about Europe."" 6) Pensioners need to take some of the pain The Government needs to cut benefits to pensions, says Mr Duncan Smith. He said: ""We have a triple lock on pensions which I was proud to do six years ago but with inflation running at 0% we really need to look at things like this"". 7) This is not personal  This is not about him or EU. He said: ""This is not personal ... I have no personal ambitions. If I never go back into Government again, I will not cry about that. I came into this Government because I cared about welfare reform."" 8) George Osborne's leadership ambitions? He said hoped Mr Osborne would be a good prime minister but added he would say that about everybody else. 9) Cameron and Osborne need to listen He said: ""There needs to be a greater, collegiate sense on how decisions are made. This is not the way to do Government."" 10) Resignation is painful Mr Duncan Smith does care. He said resignation was painful but ""I am resigning because I want my government to think again about this (welfare cuts)""."

To shouts of ""rubbish"" and derisory laughter, Mrs Morgan asked teachers to ""do their bit"" to represent the profession favourably and work with the Government, who she claimed had a mandate. Addressing the NASUWT union in Birmingham she said: ""The education system should extend opportunity to young people and serve to improve the life chances of every single young person in this country.

But plans to make all state schools in England academies by 2020 are opposed by teaching unions. Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, thanked Ms Morgan for coming to speak but urged her to abandon the plans. She said: ""Once again Nicky, the Chancellor's announcements are unravelling. Don't allow yourself to become the next IDS (Iain Duncan Smith). Listen to the concerns being raised. ""If you want education excellence everywhere, then recognise there are outstanding academies, outstanding community schools, outstanding foundation schools, outstanding voluntary-aided schools, which prove academies do not have the monopoly on excellence."" Ms Morgan faced most criticism when she urged the NASUWT to take a more positive line about the profession rather than talk of ""crisis"". She said: ""The teaching unions have a choice - spend the next four years doing battle with us, doing down the profession you represent or stepping up, seizing the opportunity provided by our White Paper."" Another teaching union, the NUT, will ballot its members on strike action over the plans to make all state-run schools into academies."

Italian state police added he was part of a ""network of counterfeiters of residence permits linked to the Brussels attacks"". Local media reports suggest Ouali's name was found in files uncovered during a raid in an apartment near Brussels last October - with photos of the militants involved in last November's attacks emerging, and details of their aliases also being revealed. One of the photographs seized was reportedly of Najim Laachraoui, one of the suicide bombers at Zaventem Airport. Ouali could be extradited to Belgium within the coming days, and Italian authorities have launched an investigation to determine how he came to be in the country. Meanwhile, a man identified as Faycal Cheffou has been charged with terrorist murder after the Brussels attacks - which left 31 people dead. Cheffou has also been charged with participation in a terrorist group and attempted terrorist killings, Belgian prosecutors said in a statement. The self-styled journalist was one of several men detained in police raids on Thursday. No weapons or explosives were found in a search of his home. Brussels mayor Yvan Mayeur told Belgium's Le Soir newspaper Cheffou was known to authorities and is ""dangerous"". Cheffou had been detained a number of times at a park where he attempted to encourage asylum seekers camped there to turn to radical Islam, Mr Mayeur said.

The inflatable blew over trailers and caravans in a park and landed down a hill after wind pulled the safety stakes out of the ground. She has been named by Essex Police as Summer Grant, from Norwich. Police have arrested a 27-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence. The pair, from Cambridgeshire, were thought to be working for the company that runs the dome-shaped attraction. Ambulance crews were called to Harlow Town Park in Essex shortly after 4pm on Saturday following the tragedy at a fun fair. Police and forensic experts at the scene The little girl, from Norwich, was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital where she later died. Ray Smith, a representative of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, told Sky News: ""As far as we understand, and obviously an investigation is going on, the inflatable dome was caught by a gust of wind around 4pm. ""And tragically a little girl in it was blown in the inflatable down the hill in the park and tragically died later."" He added: ""It was a freak gust of wind that caught everyone unawares. It actually pulled the safety stakes out of the ground. ""The police have obviously retrieved them, it's terrible and all my thoughts are with the family of that little girl. ""Everyone here is absolutely devastated, in fact everyone in the fairground industry is shattered by this. ""It's so appalling that this little girl came to have a lovely day out with her family and lost her life."" Families had gathered at the park for the third day of an Easter event organised by Thurston fun fairs when the incident happened. Among the tributes at the park's entrance was a card on a bunch of flowers that read: ""God has taken a beautiful girl for his angel. RIP Princess."" Essex Police is working with the Health and Safety Executive as part of their investigation. Police say they are aware of video footage of the scene being circulated and ask anyone who captured the incident on camera to get in touch. If you can help with any details please contact DI Daniel Stoten on 0300 333 4444 and quote incident number 737 of 26 March or email scdappeals@essex.pnn.police.uk.

The referee stopped the fight in round 10 on the advice of a doctor who was concerned about a swelling over Blackwell's left eye. Soon after the fight ended, Blackwell was seen receiving medical attention on the floor of the ring in the Wembley Arena. It comes nearly 25 years after Eubank Jr's father Chris Eubank beat Michael Watson in a bout that left the then-middleweight champion in a coma.

Pic: Action Images/Adam Holt During Saturday's fight Eubank Snr was heard telling his son that ""if he (the referee) doesn't stop it and you keep beating him like this, he is getting hurt"".  British Boxing Board of Control general secretary Robert Smith told Sky Sports: ""It is our understanding that Nick has a bleed on the brain and is under observation by hospital staff. ""We will just have to wait and see what the hospital says."" Mr Smith said Blackwell is in an induced coma, which is normal procedure in this situation, and has not been operated on. Several in the boxing world expressed concern for Blackwell. Eubank Jr himself tweeted: ""You put up a great fight tonight. Proved yourself a true warrior, wish you a quick recovery and a speedy return 2 the ring."" Thoughts and prayers to @nickblackwell02 and his family at this time! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾#BlackwellEubankJr He's a true fighter & I whole heartedly believe he will pull through. Appreciate everyone that came out to support the fight #TeamEubank Former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis posted: ""Thoughts and prayers to @nickblackwell02 and his family at this time!"" And English flyweight champion Charlie Edwards wrote on Twitter: ""Prayers go out for Nick Blackwell hope you pull through mate sad to hear this!"" Eubank Snr's match with Watson sparked increased concern about boxing in the early 1990s, with some calling for the sport to be banned. Watson spent 40 days in a coma before regaining consciousness and then had to undergo a year of intensive care and rehabilitation. It took six more years before he could walk again. He has since gone on to become a campaigner for better medical treatment for injured sports people."
