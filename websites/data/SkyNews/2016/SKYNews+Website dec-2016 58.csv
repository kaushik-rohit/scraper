2016-12-05,"One in three Britons will be forced to buy their Christmas presents on credit this year due to money worries, according to new research.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/one-third-of-britons-forced-to-buy-christmas-presents-on-credit-survey-10684089,"The research, by National Debtline, suggests up to five million of Brtions are ""regularly"" stressed about finances over the holiday season. A poll carried out in partnership with YouGov showed that around three million people in the UK would see their enjoyment of the festive season hampered by money concerns this year. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: ""Money worries can have a huge impact on your life at any time - but the fact that they are putting Christmas at risk for up to five million people shows what an extremely difficulty time of year this can be. ""This is also, of course, a busy time of year - and it is easy to see why many people don't want to deal with financial problems in December."" The research suggested that less than a third of Britons make a budget and stick to it with regards to buying Christmas presents, and 10% say they ""try not to think about"" their financial problems during the holidays. One in three will be borrowing money in order to buy presents, equating to around 16.5 million people, and one in five will be putting their Christmas food shopping on credit too. National Debtline urges those feeling stressed about their finances to seek help, and has launched a new campaign, #FeelsLikeChristmas, to raise awareness. ""Our research shows there are millions of people worrying about Christmas finances who could benefit from seeking advice now, to start to resolve their financial problems,"" Ms Elson said. ""Three-quarters of callers to National Debtline tell us they feel less stressed as a result - and often that first step is the hardest to take."""
2016-12-05,Theresa May is under pressure from ministers to let in tens of thousands of unskilled migrants every year - even after Britain leaves the EU. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/ministers-pressing-for-low-skilled-migration-to-continue-after-brexit160-10682703,"Sky News understands Cabinet ministers have voiced concerns about the drive to cut EU migration in a number of low-income sectors after Brexit.  Downing Street is determined to end free movement and ministers have publicly referred to attracting ""the brightest and the best"" of highly-skilled workers in future.  But privately, some have argued that tens of thousands of low-skilled jobs currently filled by migrants cannot easily be replaced with British labour, if they face shortages.  Home Office officials have been holding informal discussions with Government departments calling for unskilled migrants to continue working in sectors including agriculture, hospitality, construction and social care. :: Sky News will have LIVE coverage of the Brexit legal battle from the Supreme Court from 10am tomorrow One Cabinet minister said there is now an admission that ""we can't just talk about high-skilled people; it has to be low skilled as well"" or sectors of the economy would suffer. ""It's seasonal work like fruit picking which only lasts two months a year, but someone working at [the cafe chain] Pret could arguably be described as unskilled."" The issue was discussed at a meeting of the Brexit Cabinet Committee after a document drawn up by Home Office officials was circulated. Another Cabinet source said discussions about which sectors would get priority for low-skilled workers, when a new immigration regime is set up, was ""where the tension will come"".  Officials are said to be concerned about a backlash from voters worried about the impact of low-skilled migration on wages and public services, which was highlighted by the Leave campaign. But farmers and rural Tory MPs have expressed concerns about restricting seasonal labour - which employs around 80,000 people, mostly from the EU. Proposals for a seasonal workers' scheme are understood to have stalled because a similar scheme - which brought in tens of thousands of mostly Romanians and Bulgarians - was axed by Mrs May when she was home secretary in 2013.  Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, raised concerns earlier this year that any new work permit system would have to include construction workers in order to meet the target of building a million homes by 2020. Nearly 250,000 overseas workers are employed in both high and lower-skilled jobs, including more than 30,000 from Poland. During the referendum campaign Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, pointed out the reliance on 80,000 EU workers in the social care system, which already faces significant cost and staffing pressures. This week, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, reassured business leaders that when free movement ends they will not face labour shortages. At a CBI speech in Wales, he said: ""No-one wants to see labour shortages in key sectors. That wouldn't be in anybody's interest.""  The latest immigration figures revealed 650,000 immigrants had come to the UK in the year to June, with Romanians the biggest national group at 10% of the total. Number 10 and the Home Office insist they still hope to meet their target to cut net migration to under 100,000. A source familiar with the talks said: ""Meeting that target was always going to be really difficult.  ""The public now view immigration as a numbers game. Although we need an honest debate about what kind of control we can have, some people in Government need to recognise where the public are on this.  ""There will be some shortages that are better filled domestically and there will be discussions with employers about that, but free movement is not going to continue."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Government has been clear that, as we conduct our negotiations, it must be a priority to regain more control of the numbers of people who come here from Europe. ""It would not be right for us to give a running commentary on negotiations. ""The UK needs a fair and controlled immigration policy and that is exactly what this government will deliver."""
2016-12-05,"A man has been arrested for entering a pizza restaurant with an assault rifle - apparently to ""self-investigate"" a US election conspiracy theory.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/gunman-arrested-in-washington-over-pizzagate-fake-news-10683966,"Police said Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, walked into Comet Ping Pong in Washington DC and pointed the gun at an employee. The worker and customers managed to flee and raise the alarm - with businesses going into lockdown after police were called just before 3pm. According to police, Welch, from North Carolina, fired the weapon in the restaurant but no-one is believed to have been hurt. He has since been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon. Police said he told them he had travelled to the popular family restaurant to probe ""Pizzagate"" - a fake news conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton that spread online during the campaign. The restaurant's owners and employees have been threatened since the bogus stories were published claiming Mrs Clinton and her campaign chief were running a child sex ring from its back rooms. President-elect Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn, a retired general, was among those who shared the stories. The restaurant's owner had to contact the FBI, local police, Facebook and social media bosses in an effort to remove the offending article.  Matt Carr, owner of the nearby Little Red Fox market - who also received threats, told the Washington Post: ""This was our worst fear - that someone would read all this and come to the block with a gun, And today it happened."" Gareth Wade, 47, who was sitting down for pizza and beer when the man entered the restaurant, told the paper: ""The server said someone just walked in with a shotgun."" He said the server told them: ""A man had just walked into the building, passed us into the back of the building, he seemed to have a shotgun or a rifle-type of (gun) and said we ought to vacate the building."""
2016-12-05,The winner of this year's Turner Prize will be announced later - with a golden backside and a huge pile of pennies among the contenders.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/giant-buttocks-and-16320000-in-pennies-among-turner-prize-contenders-10684077,"The artist under 50 judged to have put on the most ""outstanding exhibition"" in the preceding year will win £25,000. This year's 32nd winner will join the ranks of previous victors such as Damien Hirst, Grayson Perry and Anthony Gormley. Last year's winner was Assemble, a collective of artists whose Granby Four Streets Project attempted to help a group of residents bring an overlooked and uncared for housing area back into use. Among those up for the award this year are Anthea Hamilton, whose series of installations includes a giant golden pair of buttocks. The 16ft polystyrene backside, called Project for a Door (After Gaetano Pesce), is the artist's attempt to realise a design for a New York doorway that was never built. An exhibition by nominee Michael Dean also won notoriety because of fears that people could steal some of the two million pennies that make up the £20,436 spread on the ground.  The quantity of cash is the amount the Government states is the minimum two adults and two children need to survive on over the course of a year. Another nominee's work caused controversy when observers questioned whether it had been altered by the Tate Britain over concerns about health and safety. When Josephine Pryde exhibited her train in San Francisco, it moved around a track. In London it is stationary, apparently stopped by leaves on the line. The fourth artist in line for the prize is Helen Marten, whose installation artworks include a series of workstations or terminals where work appears to have been interrupted. The sculptures use an array of materials and are designed to make visitors feel like archaeologists, looking at something for the first time. The works remain on show at the Tate Britain gallery in London's Millbank until 2 January."
2016-12-05,A man has been arrested after his 26-year-old British girlfriend died from stab wounds while working at a remote holiday resort in Lapland.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/suspect-held-after-british-woman-dies-from-stab-wounds-in-lapland-10684157,"A police helicopter and husky search was launched after the 36-year-old suspect, thought to be Czech, fled into hostile terrain near the town of Kuttanen with the couple's dogs. He offered no resistance when he was found hours later in temperatures of -30C (-22F) before being sent for treatment at Lapland's central hospital in the capital Rovaniemi on Sunday morning. The unnamed victim from Scotland and her boyfriend were seasonal employees with tour operator Santa Safari, which describes itself as one of Lapland's leading inbound travel companies providing Arctic wilderness trips for adults and children. The company's recruitment advertisements describe working in the remote environment as ""not for the faint hearted"" while offering staff ""a lifetime experience like no other"". ""We are all in shock from this tragic news and our thoughts go out to her family,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our team is working closely with the Finnish Police and relevant authorities to support the investigation that is now under way. ""It goes without saying that we will do everything we can to support the family and our staff at this incredibly difficult time."" A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are supporting the family of a British national who died in Finland on 3 December."""
2016-12-05,Boris Johnson has outlined the four-point blueprint the Government wants to achieve when it negotiates the UK's exit from the EU.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/four-point-brexit-blueprint-revealed-by-boris-johnson-10683108,"The Foreign Secretary told Sky News the Prime Minister wanted to retain control of borders, control of money, control of laws and the ability to do free trade deals. He also refused to rule out payments to the EU in order to maintain access to the bloc's single market. Doing so, which has also been mooted by Brexit Secretary David Davis, would allow the UK to have a soft Brexit, rather than a 'hard' one which would involve leaving the free trade area. Mr Johnson told Sky's Murnaghan programme: ""You... have... got to take back control of money, control of our democracy, our laws and be in a position to do free trade deals and that is what the Prime Minister wants to achieve. ""What David has said is that (paying for access to the single market) is the kind of thing that could be considered but we are not getting into a running commentary of our negotiations. ""I've given you a pretty fair, four-point analysis of what we need to achieve - control of borders, control of money, control of laws and the ability to do free trade deals. ""Within those ideas - those very simple ideas - is a wealth of information about the kind of deal we want. ""I've no doubt that we can achieve it. It'll be good, not just for the UK, but it would be good for the whole of Europe as well."" Mr Johnson was also asked about a Sky News story which reported that the Foreign Secretary had privately told at least four EU ambassadors that he supports freedom of movement. The Sky News story quoted the high-ranking diplomats under the Chatham House rule, which allows their comments to be reported, but not directly attributed. Mr Johnson described the story as a ""dud"", claiming Sky News had got the story wrong. He said: ""Your story was a dud. It was wrong. It was a load of old baloney. That's not your fault. It's perhaps not even the fault of the journalist. ""I don't blame him. He was offered something which is completely untrue, it is nonsense."""
2016-12-05,"The UK services sector grew by more than expected in November, registering its biggest jump since the beginning of the year.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-services-sector-grows-at-fastest-rate-since-january-10684169,"According to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) the services industry grew to 55.2, up from 54.5 in October. The reading was highest than even the maximum expectation from economists. PMI figures are a well-respected measure of the economy's overall health, with any score above 50 indicating growth in the sector while a fall below 50 would mean the industry was contracting. The 55.2 reading marked the fastest pace of growth since January, and follows better-than-expected results from the construction industry last week. Manufacturing, while also registering growth, missed its expectations and unexpectedly slowed in November thanks to the double-edged effect of the fall in sterling since June's Brexit vote. The services industry PMI is particularly closely watched as it accounts for almost 80% of the UK's overall economy. However the sector has seen a sharp squeeze on profits over the last three months, according to figures from the CBI. Sluggish sales growth hit the bottom lines of companies in the sprawling sector, with 41% of businesses saying profitability was down. But today's PMI reading marked the fourth consecutive month of growth in the sector, supported in part by new business creation. Despite this, business sentiment is at its weakest level since July amid Brexit uncertainty, the low value of sterling and the unexpected result of the US presidential election. ""The further upturn in the vast services sector shows that the pace of UK economic growth remains resiliently robust in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. ""The three PMI surveys collectively indicate that the economy will grow by 0.5% in the fourth quarter."" But David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, warned that inflation will mean higher costs for consumers in the coming months. ""The ongoing battle with currency fluctuations, a weak pound and the impact of inflation will continue to undermine company profits,"" he said. ""Rising prices are already being passed on to consumers and this is likely to accelerate in 2017 as the full import costs of higher fuel, food, travel and labour costs make their way down the supply chain.  ""If consumers respond by slowing their spending, the sector will have to upscale their efforts to sustain the current momentum of growth.  ""However, there were some winners. Weaker sterling enabled some businesses to not only raise their charges for export customers but also continue to acquire new business."""
2016-12-05,Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has agreed a settlement with three out of five shareholder groups currently suing the bank for compensation.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/rbs-settles-shareholder-lawsuits-as-part-of-163800m-deal-10684061,"The claims relate to a £12bn fundraising drive which RBS undertook in 2008, just months before it had to be bailed out by the British taxpayer to the tune of more than £45bn. The investor groups involved say they were misled when they bought shares in the bank in an effort to help shore up its finances, after a £49bn deal to acquire Dutch bank ABN Amro went south. But the value of those shares plummeted when RBS was bailed out by the government. The bank is still 73% owned by the British taxpayer and is struggling to get back on its feet following the financial crash. RBS last week was the only major British bank to fail the Bank of England's stringent stress tests, which were put in place to ensure that financial institutions in the UK are better prepared should another crash occur. As previously reported by Sky News, the bank has set aside £800m to pay the claims of all five shareholder groups. A trial to settle the other claims is due to begin in March, and seems likely to go ahead after one of the outstanding groups - the RBoS Shareholder Action Group, representing 27,000 retail investors - vowed to bring the matter all the way to court. According to RBS, it has agreed the settlements to ""minimise further material litigation expense and management distraction"" and has done so without any admission of fault. Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said: ""We have been very clear that we wanted to deal with as many of our legacy litigation issues as possible during 2015 and 2016.  ""We are pleased to have reached this agreement and hope that it will be accepted by the remaining claimant group(s) so that this long course of complex and costly litigation can now be concluded."""

At the other end of the trust scale, nurses topped the index with the backing of 93% of respondents - ahead of doctors, teachers and judges. The report authors said the drop in trust for politicians would have been ""surprising"" had it not been for the EU referendum. They said: ""2016 is, of course, some way away from being a normal year, and voters' levels of trust in mainstream politicians seem to be approaching rock bottom."" The report added: ""One rare point of agreement between Leave and Remain voters is that neither of the campaigns covered themselves in glory; between them they demonstrated most of the characteristics that turn voters off. ""Politicians in Westminster in particular have much work to do to start reconnecting with voters and demonstrating that they have priorities other than getting their own viewpoints across and ignoring debate."" According to the index, which polled 1,019 adults between October and November, government ministers, journalists and estate agents are also among the least trustworthy professionals. Trust in lawyers, priests and the police has climbed, while pollsters fell two places in the index. Most trusted professions (% of people who trust them to tell the truth) :: Nurses (93%):: Doctors (91%):: Teachers (88%):: Judges (81%):: Scientists (80%) Least trusted professions (% of people who trust them to tell the truth) :: Business leaders (33%):: Estate agents (30%):: Journalists (24%):: Government ministers (20%):: Politicians (15%)"

Speaking in a faltering voice, Mr Key, 55, told a news conference: ""Simply put, it has, for me, been the most remarkable, satisfying and exciting time of my life. ""But despite the amazing career I have had in politics, I have never seen myself as a career politician. I have certainly never wanted my success in politics to be measured by how long I spent in parliament."" But Mr Key, who recently marked his tenth year as leader of the centre-right National Party, said the role came with costs. ""For my wife Bronagh, there have been many nights and weekends spent alone, many occasions that were important to her that I simply could not attend,"" he said. ""My daughter Stephie and my son Max have transitioned from teenagers to young adults while coping with an extraordinary level of intrusion and pressure because of their father's job."" He added: ""It would be easy to say I have made this decision solely to rediscover the personal and family life I once had, and that is a factor, but it is one among many."" Mr Key said he was not sure what life after politics would bring, other than he would probably take up positions on a couple of boards. He said he would remain on as an MP long enough that he wouldn't force a special election ahead of next year's general election. ""All I can say is that I gave it everything I had,"" he said. ""I have left nothing in the tank."" The National Party is set to meet next week to elect Mr Key's successor. Deputy Prime Minister Bill English is widely seen as the favourite to take over."

The chanting and dancing continued around the sacred fire, which burned in the middle of the Oceti Sakowin camp. But there was caution alongside the celebrations, which follow months of protests by Native Americans and climate activists amid fears over damage to sacred land and water contamination. There was concern that the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners could find a way to pay a massive daily fine and keep drilling anyway, despite the decision by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Others spoke of President-elect Donald Trump and his support for the project. They worried that once he is elected he may try to grant permits for the pipe to continue. Still, with this symbolic victory, many of the thousands gathered at Standing Rock will go home. Others, particularly those who've been camped on the high plains of North Dakota for months, feel the fight isn't over. They don't trust the police, the government or the pipeline company, and they've pledged to stay through the bitter winter, guarding their sacred land."

The organisation commissioned a survey which shows that the size of a medium fish can vary by over 500% across the UK. In some shops a regular fish can be as small as 97g, while in others they are a whopping 562g. Chip portions vary by almost 700%. The report said: ""Fifteen per cent of consumers think that chip portions are too big and 44% of them even end up throwing some of their chips away. ""Making portion sizes more predictable and offering customers more portion size options could make businesses more competitive."" Whitby's award-winning Quayside Fish Restaurant offers two sizes of fish: small (5oz or 142g) and regular (9oz or 255g). Manager Adam Sheldon told Sky News: ""Some chip shops give bigger portions to appear competitive but that often leads to waste. ""We notice that a lot of people, particularly lunchtime customers or locals who eat fish and chips more regularly, enjoy the option of smaller portions."" Nutritionist Deborah Naylor said consumers are more health and diet aware, and want more accurate information about the food they eat. ""Standardised portions and nutritional information would mean people could plan their diets more easily,"" she said. ""Consumers rightly want to know more about the amount of calories and fats in food, to allow them to make more informed decisions."" The survey backs up her theory. It shows that over 50% would like to know the fat content of their meal, and more than 60% would like to see nutritional information displayed per portion size."

EU finance commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters in Brussels that he has ""full confidence in Italian authorities to manage this situation"". He added: ""I'm very confident in the capacity of the eurozone to resist all kind of shocks."" German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Italy should continue the economic reforms begun by Mr Renzi. He also said investors should be relaxed about the Italian referendum, which was a domestic issue, and said he saw no grounds for there to be a crisis for the euro currency. ""I think we should see the situation in Italy with a certain calmness,"" he said, adding: ""I think there is no need to talk about a euro crisis."" German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, however, said that while the result was ""not the end of the world"", it was also ""not a positive development in the case of the general crisis in Europe"". He said he was watching the developments ""with concern"". The markets seemed initially to take Mr Renzi's departure in their stride and appeared to bet against snap elections. :: Euro falls to 20-month low after Italy vote Stocks and the euro fell in early trading but there were no signs of panic with the possibility of his resignation having already been largely factored in. Some analysts fear a deeper crisis of investor confidence could derail a rescue scheme for Italy's most indebted banks, triggering a wider financial crisis across the eurozone. :: Italy referendum result could hit country's fragile banks Mr Renzi, the head of the centre-left Democratic Party, had staked his future on the constitutional reform, which was aimed at streamlining Italy's notoriously lengthy legislative process by weakening the powers of the upper house, cut down the number of senators and cut the powers of regional authorities. His opponents denounced the reforms as dangerous for democracy and saw a chance to topple his government after almost three years. Mr Renzi, who came to power in 2014, said he took full responsibility for the ""extraordinarily clear"" defeat, with the final count showing the ""No"" camp winning 59.1% to 40.9%. ""The experience of my government ends here,"" Mr Renzi said in a televised address to the nation. Spearheaded by the populist Five Star Movement, the biggest rival to Mr Renzi's Democratic Party, the ""No"" campaign took advantage of the Mr Renzi's declining popularity, a struggling economy and concerns caused by tens of thousands of migrants arriving from Africa. The vote is a major win for Five Star leader Beppe Grillo, who called the result a ""victory for democracy"". Mr Renzi will convene his cabinet for the last time on Monday afternoon and then hand in his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, who is now charged with brokering the appointment of a new government, or if that fails, calling early elections. Mr Grillo said an election should be called ""within a week"" on the basis of a recently adopted electoral law which is designed to ensure the leading party has parliamentary majority."
2016-12-05,Gareth Southgate's endorsement by the man in charge of appointing him was about as far from ringing as you are likely to get.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/is-gareth-southgate-the-right-man-for-england-job-10678372,"""You can see, like all of us, he has still got things to learn,"" said FA chief executive Martin Glenn. This, however, is where England are. The days when the FA could sift through trophy-laden CVs from around the world have gone; and anyway, who wants to repeat the Fabio Capello experience? :: Gareth Southgate signs four-year deal as England manager There is a sensible and widespread acknowledgement that the national team is best coached by an Englishman. Otherwise, what is the point of St George's Park, the FA's £105m National Football Centre in Staffordshire, designed to improve coaching at all levels? On that basis, Southgate had few serious rivals, and his plus points are significant, despite his only club managerial post ending in relegation and the sack at Middlesbrough. Being an FA insider got him the job as interim boss when a newspaper sting led to Sam Allardyce's sacking in September. But it is the kind of logical progression that other countries have long followed, world champions Germany included. He brings from his three years in charge of England's under-21 team the backing of many of those who are now key members of the senior squad, such as Harry Kane, John Stones and Raheem Sterling. Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand said: ""Not only does he encourage us to play with confidence, he understands football and he understands us as players."" Part of that belief in him, Bertrand emphasised, is based on Southgate's own 57 England appearances as a player. :: England and Scotland face FIFA fines by defying football poppy ban They know he's felt the heat of the cauldron - not least when his missed penalty cost England a place in the Euro '96 final. In addition, the FA is entitled to place more weight than usual on his clean-cut image and lack of baggage, in view of the manner of Allardyce's departure, and the welter of revelations and accusations about non-recent abuse of youth players in football. Assuming that image remains untarnished, it will as usual be the players who decide his future. It can be argued that performances in his interim period have been viewed until now through an improbably rosy filter. An opening victory over Malta and a goalless draw in Slovenia were distinctly uninspired, and a 3-0 scoreline against Scotland was flattering. The performance in the friendly against Spain was much more impressive, despite the concession of two late goals to leave the match drawn. :: Where are other England stars of Euro '96 now? But there have been similar encouraging nights before.

Part of the law was Article 50, a five-point plan for any country that wishes to leave the EU. Why is the case happening?The court is being asked to overturn a High Court ruling that the Prime Minister must seek MPs' approval to trigger Article 50 to start the process of taking Britain out of the EU. Three senior judges have already said Theresa May lacked power to use the royal prerogative to trigger Article 50 and start the two-year process of negotiating Brexit without the prior authority of Parliament. How long will it last?The case is due to last four days and for the first time 11 justices will sit on the panel. A verdict will be announced in January. What if the Government's appeal is not successful?If the appeal is unsuccessful, and any potential further appeal to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg also fails, the Government's plans for Brexit could be thrown into disarray and affect the timetable for triggering Article 50. And if it's a success?If the court rules in the Government's favour, Mrs May can press ahead with her plans to invoke Article 50 by the end of March. What is the Government's argument?Brexit Secretary David Davis is leading the Government's historic legal action. His team of lawyers, headed by Attorney General Jeremy Wright, will argue that the three High Court judges erred over Article 50 and its use was legally justified by the 23 June referendum vote in favour of quitting the EU. What is the opposing argument?The case was originally brought to the High Court by investment manager Gina Miller and hairdresser Dier Dos Santos. They argued that the Government cannot use executive powers to override the rights enshrined in domestic law by statute, and that doing so would undermine parliamentary sovereignty. Could the case go to the European Court?All sides agree that, once triggered, Article 50 cannot be revoked. But Article 50 does not deal specifically with this issue and some lawyers believe it can be revoked. If the Supreme Court decides that it needs clarification on Article 50 in order to decide the case, it would have to refer it to the European Court of Justice, which would take months. It would also spark political fury if the EU had any say in how the UK leaves.  :: Sky News will be LIVE from the Supreme Court from 10am and a special programme covering the case starts at 9.30pm"

Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo is another high profile name in football who is accused of having allegedly moved money to a ""tax haven"". The claims emerged in a data leak of over 18 million documents, investigated for the past several months by a group of pan-European media organisations. Football agency Gestifute, which represents the two Portuguese stars, has strenuously denied suggestions its clients may have taken part in a tax avoidance scheme involving millions of pounds. In a statement, it said: ""Both Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho are fully compliant with their tax obligations with the Spanish and British tax authorities. ""Neither Cristiano Ronaldo nor Jose Mourinho have ever been involved in legal proceedings regarding the commission of a tax offence. ""Any insinuation or accusation made to Cristiano Ronaldo or Jose Mourinho over the commission of a tax offence will be reported to the legal authorities and prosecuted."" But MP Meg Hillier, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, called on tax authorities to investigate the claims. ""These revelations are extraordinary and warrant a close examination by the UK tax authorities,"" she said. An HMRC spokesman said: ""HMRC carefully scrutinises the arrangements between football clubs and their employees in respect of any image right payments to make sure the right tax is paid - in recent years we have identified more than £80m in additional tax payable from clubs, players and agents. ""We take seriously allegations that customers or their agents may have acted dishonestly in the course of an inquiry, and can reopen closed cases if we suspect this has happened."" The European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) consortium, consisting of journalists from the UK's Sunday Times, Germany's Der Spiegel, Spain's El Mundo, and the Netherlands' NRC, said it will release further revelations in the coming weeks under the banner 'Football Leaks'. It said the new information will give ""an unprecedented look into the gloomy depths of the modern football industry""."

It was triggered when co-pilot Michael Alsbury unlocked the craft's braking system early.  Mr Alsbury was killed and pilot Peter Siebold seriously injured when the spaceship broke apart - again over the Mojave Desert. As this weekend's test got underway, British astronaut Tim Peake tweeted: ""Good luck with this new phase of the test programme @virgingalactic - safe flight #pushingboundaries."" Sir Richard, the Virgin Group founder, was with Virgin Galactic chief executive George Whitesides as the test was carried out.  The two men were later pictured congratulating Chief Pilot Dave Mackay and Test Pilot Mark Stucky.   There will be further glide flights, after which the team will check the Unity's hybrid motor during rocket-powered tests.  Virgin Galactic has said it will begin a commercial operation from Spaceport America in New Mexico ""once it believes it is safe to do so"".  It will also need regulatory approval."

Following the year-long research she said there still big social and economic gaps between different ethnic groups. The review concludes that schoolchildren should be taught ""British values"" of tolerance, democracy and respect to help keep communities together amid growing ""ethnic segregation"". In particular, she highlighted the plight of women who found themselves marginalised because of poor English language skills while being subjected to ""coercive control, violence and criminal acts of abuse, often enacted in the name of cultural or religious values"". The review calls for more English classes for isolated groups, greater mixing among young people through activities such as sport, and a new ""oath of integration"" enshrining British values for those who hold public office. ""Social integration is about closing the gaps that exist between people and communities,"" Dame Louise said. ""To help bind Britain together and tackle some of the division in our society we need more opportunities for those from disadvantaged communities, particularly women, and more mixing between people from different backgrounds. ""We need more effort to be put into integration policies to help communities cope with the pace and scale of immigration and population change in recent years. ""But we also need more of a spirit of unity, compassion and kindness that brings people together under our common British values of tolerance, democracy, equality and respect."" The review was commissioned by Mr Cameron in 2015 as part of a wider strategy to fight the ""poison"" of Islamic extremism. While it found that Britain has benefited hugely from immigration and the increased ethnic and religious diversity it had brought, there had not been enough emphasis on integration. The review calls on the Government to support a new programme to strengthen cohesion through promotion of the English language, raising employment levels among the most marginalised groups and ""emancipating"" women trapped in social isolation. It highlighted the ""huge national, cultural and symbolic value"" of British citizenship and urged the promotion of British laws, history and values within the core school curriculum to build ""integration, tolerance, citizenship and resilience"" in children. The review said the Government should consider requiring those coming to the UK seeking citizenship to take an oath of integration with British values and society on arrival, rather than waiting for their final citizenship test. It highlighted how isolation can begin at a young age and urged the Government to establish safeguarding arrangements for children who are taken out of mainstream education by their parents - or never enter it to begin with. Central government and local authorities should develop a range of indicators of potential breakdown of integration in an area - such as incidences of hate crime or deficiencies in English - with councils required to gather this information regularly, it said. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This Government is building a democracy for everyone and our country has long been home to lots of different cultures and communities, but all of us have to be part of one society - British society. ""So while it's right that we celebrate the positive contribution that diverse groups make to British life, we also need to continue making sure that nobody is excluded from it or left behind."""
2016-12-05,"When Boris Johnson was made Foreign Secretary in July, confounding expectations, he already had an impressive list of previous crimes against diplomacy.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161205135658/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnsons-foreign-office-faux-pas-so-far-10678692,"He'd written that limerick about the Turkish president and his penchant for goats, rhyming Ankara with the obvious; he'd compared the ambitions of the EU with those of Hitler; and he'd accused Barack Obama of having an ""ancestral dislike of the British empire"" because of his ""part-Kenyan"" heritage. :: Boris Johnson says he 'supports freedom of movement' His appointment was greeted with laughter by German televisions presenters. Former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted he ""wished it was a joke"". Some asked if Theresa May was trolling the world. Others called it a political masterstroke. The argument ran that she had watered down the department by splitting responsibilities with International Trade and Brexit, kept her biggest political enemy close, and set up three scapegoats should Brexit be a disaster. With a role on the international stage, Mr Johnson was also expected to be more guarded with his comments.  It has not quite turned out that way. Since his appointment in July, Mr Johnson has: :: Been accused of ""unbelievable arrogance"" when he offered to help Turkey join the EU after warning during the referendum campaign of hordes of Turkish citizens coming to the UK. :: Got into a scrap with Italian economic development minister Carlo Calenda over which would do better post-Brexit: Prosecco sales or fish and chips. :: Told European leaders to stop the ""collective whinge-o-rama"" about Donald Trump's election - then refused to attend an EU meeting to discuss the future under the new US administration. :: Said it was ""b*******"" to describe freedom of movement as a founding principle of the EU. :: Told a Czech newspaper the UK would ""probably"" leave the customs union - when the Government has not yet made its position clear because of Mrs May's ""no running commentary on Brexit"" rule. :: Mistakenly described Africa as a country, not a continent, in his conference speech. :: Admitted to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that he did not recognise the Commonwealth Flag. But this latest spat has deeper implications for both Mr Johnson and the Government. Even if the EU ambassadors were collectively mistaken in their interpretation of the Foreign Secretary's remarks, it is significant that so many are expressing concern and frustration over perceived mixed signals.  And as Mr Johnson already stands accused of piggybacking on the Leave campaign for political advancement, this adds further doubt over his Brexit convictions. There is another reason why Number 10 will be concerned about the revelations. Mrs May wants to keep her negotiating stance secret - but her top diplomat appears to be sowing confusion with the very countries who will be sitting around the table when discussing the terms of our divorce. Mr Johnson appears to have become strangled by his own diplomatic tightrope."

Many British companies are feeling the effects of the weakness in the pound, which has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since June's Brexit referendum. Due to the decline, importing from abroad has become significantly more costly, meaning that any firms which source products, ingredients or parts from overseas are pushing prices up to compensate. ""Retailers are nervous about the role of inflation, it definitely poses a threat and absolutely, prices will rise next year, there's no avoiding it. We won't be alone,"" said Mr Venters. ""Although our suppliers might be UK based, when you look at the ingredients mix, the packaging mix, it's sourced from all over the world, so we can't get away from currency movements.  ""Of course, we'll try and mitigate against that.""  The retailer is the latest in a line of companies that have warned about rising prices. Unilever, the manufacturer of thousands of products including Pot Noodle and Marmite, clashed with supermarket Tesco earlier this year when it attempted to raise wholesale prices by 10%. However, Mr Venters also acknowledged that the currency weakness will afford new opportunities for his company, including an increase in tourism, bringing new customers and a greater focus on exports. He said this. along with the firm's existing international operations, should allow Fortnum & Mason to offset any downturns in UK business. ""Uncertainty makes our job more challenging, but then consumers look for better value, a great product and reassurance when they spend,"" he said.

The sale would have put a total of around 11,000 UK jobs at risk. However, the company reconsidered after the Government pledged to provide hundreds of millions of pounds in financial support. It is now understood that Tata is edging closer to agreeing a deal with the steel unions which would see continued investment into the plant in return for concessions on staff terms and conditions. Although details of the potential deal have not been released, it is thought the unions will be fighting to ensure the two blast furnaces at Port Talbot are kept in use. Councillor Tony Taylor, who worked at the plant for 44 years, told Sky News' Siobhan Robbins that if the future of two blast furnaces could be guaranteed it would ""secure the plant for 15-20 years"".  ""It's good news for Port Talbot, there's a future there now,"" he said. ""There have been a lot of people working at the plant who were unable to get mortgages as they were told there's no future in steel. There is now.  ""People can start looking forward to the future."" The UK's steel industry has been in decline for more than four decades, but has faced a particularly difficult global climate in recent years as cheap Chinese steel pushes global prices down. Port Talbot is Britain's biggest steelworks, in terms of both workforce and output, and many contractors and service firms also rely on the plant. Tata UK's Scunthorpe site, which employed more than 4,000 people, was sold in June to investment group Greybull Capital, who have continued operating under the revived British Steel brand. The wider Tata Steel company has sites across Europe, India and South East Asia."

Despite the firm ties between the UK and US, Mrs May was 11th on the list of world leaders when Mr Trump came to make his traditional round of telephone calls.

Donald Trump has threatened to rip up a landmark deal which halted Iran's nuclear ambition in return for the lifting of sanctions, but Theresa May will make clear that it was vitally important for regional security. Addressing the plenary of the Gulf Co-operation Council in Manama, the Prime Minister is expected to say: ""As we address new threats to our security, so we must also continue to confront state actors whose influence fuels instability in the region.  ""So I want to assure you that I am clear-eyed about the threat that Iran poses to the Gulf and the wider Middle East; and the UK is fully committed to our strategic partnership with the Gulf and working with you to counter that threat.

The call was made by a man speaking English who threatened an attack on the ""off-ramp"" at the Universal City/Studio City Red Line metro station to the north of Los Angeles, about half a mile from the Universal Studios attraction, on Tuesday. Authorities say they have not established if the call is credible but decided to go public because of the specificity and the imminence of the threat. The FBI, the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments say they will step up security on the metro system, with an increase in uniformed and undercover officers on duty. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti told a news conference he would board a Red Line train at the Universal City metro station on Tuesday to reassure the public they should go about their day as usual. The red and purple lines carried around 145,000 passengers a day. Authorities say they are acting out of ""an abundance of caution"" and have stressed the threat is ""non-corroborated"". Major employers in the area around Universal City have alerted staff to the warning and the potential for an increased police presence in the area. Deirdre Fike, the FBI's assistant director for Los Angeles, told reporters that law enforcement already take an increased ""threat posture"" during the holiday season but that she was confident their actions in this incidence were appropriate. Authorities in Los Angeles were criticised last year for their response to a bomb threat made to the city's schools. They were accused of over-reacting after immediately closing all schools in the city, causing chaos a thousands of students were forced to find a way home just after classes should have begun."

Now the Government has accepted the motion, which may allow potentially rebellious Conservatives to back it when it is debated on Wednesday.  A Government amendment tabled in Theresa May's name also urges MPs to ""respect the wishes"" of those who voted for Brexit in the referendum and calls on Article 50 to be invoked by 31 March 2017. At least 20 Tory backbenchers were thought to be ready to back the Labour motion, causing a potential rebellion for Mrs May. :: EU sets 18-month Brexit deadline A Downing Street spokesman said the amendment was a separate issue to the Supreme Court hearing currently underway, which will decide if Parliament must approve Brexit before Article 50 is triggered.  ""The Prime Minister has been clear that we will set out our plans in due course. That remains the position,"" the spokesman said. ""We won't be showing our negotiating hand until we have to, but we have not suggested we will not set out the position. ""That's what the amendment goes to."" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""This is a welcome and hugely significant climb down from the Government. ""For the last two months Labour have been pushing the Government to put their plan for Brexit before Parliament and the public. ""Without that plan, we have had unnecessary uncertainty, speculation and a running commentary on the Government's likely approach.

I have now seen the Government's amendment for tomorrow and I have seen that it is good.

The Liberal Democrats said the Prime Minister now has to reveal whether she plans to keep the UK in the European single market. Foreign affairs spokesman Tom Brake said: ""Five months on, finally this Conservative Brexit Government is admitting that triggering Article 50 without a plan would be like jumping out of a plane without a parachute. ""Theresa May must now drop the platitudes and come up with clear answers on the big questions facing the country, including membership of the single market."" Among the Conservatives intending to support Labour's original motion were veteran Cabinet minister Ken Clarke and former minister Anna Soubry - both prominent pro-EU politicians. Ms Soubry told Sky News she did not know why the Government had previously been reluctant to commit to a plan ahead of Article 50. ""I think there has been a change,"" she said. ""Until recently I think frankly they didn't have much of an idea themselves.

He added that statutory rights and obligations created under the act could not be taken away ""without parliamentary approval"". The court was told: ""The prerogative cannot be used to remove rights and duties created by Parliament. ""Parliament is sovereign. What Parliament created only Parliament can take away. ""We are submitting that there is simply no prerogative power to interfere, frustrate, nullify a statutory scheme."" :: EU sets 18-month Brexit deadline Earlier in the day, James Eadie QC, for the Government, warned of long-term implications were the Government to lose the landmark case, and accused the rival camp of walking a ""tight rope"" and creating a ""serious constitutional trap"".   He said the Supreme Court would be ""imposing, in effect, a new control of the most serious kind in a highly controversial area"" if it were to rule against the Government.  Wrapping up the Government's case, he argued that the use of prerogative powers did not undermine Parliament - and that the 23 June referendum on EU membership had been held in the universal expectation that the Government would implement its result.  He told the judges: ""Our case fully respects, and offers no affront, to Parliamentary sovereignty."" The QC added: ""Parliament is already deeply involved, and unsurprisingly involved, in the whole process of withdrawal."" :: Brexit appeal explained: What's at stake? However, he also revealed the Government would submit a short bill - ""a one-line act"" - to Parliament to seek MPs' approval to begin the process of Britain's exit from the EU were it to lose the case. ""It may be that it would lead to all kinds of parliamentary complications and possible additions and amendments but that is the solution,"" Mr Eadie added. :: There will be a special programme on Sky News, including highlights from the second day of the historic challenge, at 9.30pm."

He confessed at a news conference to killing her because she had brought shame on their family with her ""intolerable"" behaviour. He has denied murder and says he does not regret what he did. The charge is the final step before a trial begins in what is likely to be one of the country's highest-profile 'honour killings'. Ms Baloch's provocative selfies and videos - which would seem relatively tame by Western standards - divided the traditionally conservative Muslim country. Supporters praised her for daring to challenge Pakistan's views on women, while critics derided her for her ""demeaning"" behaviour.   Waseem appeared before a court in the central city of Multan on Monday together with his cousin Haq Nawaz, who police accused of being an accomplice but did not explain what his involvement was.  A second man, taxi driver Abdul Basit, has been released on bail.  Ms Baloch, whose real name was Fauzia Azeem, became famous In Pakistan in 2014 after a video of her pouting at the camera and asking ""How em looking?"" went viral. In March, she made headlines by offering to strip for the Pakistan cricket team if they beat India in a World T20 match. It was also reported that she would be appearing in the next series of Big Boss, India's version of Big Brother, and in shortly before her death she had appeared 'twerking' in a music video with singer Aryan Khan. She also posed for selfies with a high-profile mullah, who was subsequently told off by the religious affairs ministry.  Her killing has brought renewed calls for action against such killings, in which a victim is killed by a close relative. Under Pakistan law, such killings can be forgiven if another family member agrees it, meaning the killer escapes legal justice. In October Parliament passed a law aimed at removing such ""forgiveness"" but critics say some loopholes remain."

2016-12-06,"As pantomime season descends on Britain, Michel Barnier is surely the EU villain if you read many of the British newspapers.

I can hear the hissing from here. But the EU Commission's chief negotiator has been at pains to stress this is not the case. He reminisced that, aged 20, he had actually campaigned and voted in France for Britain to become a member of the European Community. Some 40 years later, though, the UK is now leaving the European Union stage and he wants it to happen as soon as possible. We are ready ... ready to start tomorrow, he repeatedly said. And so, amid the unfolding drama there are three key points that we can take from Mr Barnier's latest performance. Firstly, the actual negotiations will last much less than the two years set aside under Article 50 (A50). Mr Barnier wants to see them completed by October 2018 on the current UK timetable, allowing time for any agreement to be approved by the European Council and Parliament. Essentially, this is to ensure that Britain will have 'Brexited' by March 2019 ahead of the next EU Parliament elections in June of that year. This will not be surprising to Team May - but will mean the UK must have its ducks in row before the Prime Minister pushes the A50 button. Secondly, there will be no ""having your cake and eating it"" for the UK - or as Mr Barnier insisted, no ""cherry-picking"". ""The single market and its four freedoms (which includes freedom of movement) are indivisible. Cherry-picking is not an option,"" he said. A stark reminder to those optimistic Brexiteers that the rest of the EU is not open to helping Britain get the best deal if it is better than current membership. Thirdly, that Europe is open to a transitional deal that may last years, ensuring Britain does not simply fall off the EU stage. Any deal might see the UK become a Norway or an Iceland - members of the single market but with little say on its rules and still with freedom of movement. How palatable would that be to Brexiteers, even for a short term? Mr Barnier's speech could be seen as the end of the first act in a drama that will play out over the next two years or so. The EU member states seem insistent that they will remain united, principled, and want it over as soon as possible - and this should ensure Mr Barnier keeps his role as the EU pantomime villain on the British stage for some time to come."

White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said the call could jeopardise US relations with China.  He said: ""The Chinese government and Beijing places an enormous priority on this situation and it's a sensitive matter. ""Some of the progress that we have made in our relationship with China could be undermined by this issue flaring up."" :: Trump, Taiwan and China: Why one phone call matters so much Mr Earnest said National Security Council officials twice spoke with Chinese diplomats to ""reiterate and clarify"" Washington's commitment to the ""one China"" policy. He added: ""I think it's hard to determine exactly what the aim was of the President-elect and both the vice president-elect and his campaign manager were ... I'll leave that to them to explain."" On Sunday, Mr Trump responded to controversy over the phone call by complaining about Chinese economic and military policy on Twitter. He said: ""Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the US doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? ""I don't think so!"" Speaking to Sky News, former US assistant secretary of state for public affairs James Rubin said Mr Trump ""may have overplayed his hand"".  He added: ""This wasn't an accident ... it's pretty clear to me that the teams on both sides organised this call.

The Supreme Court is currently hearing the Government's case for invoking Article 50 after the High Court ruled that the Government must put such a move to a vote by MPs. On triggering Article 50, Mr Barnier said: ""The European Union is ready to receive the notification. We are ready. Keep calm and negotiate."" He added: ""It's up to the British to say what relations they want and up to the 27 to define their future relations with Britain."" :: Brexit explained: What's at stake? Britain voted to leave the EU in a shock referendum result in June, but Mrs May is yet to set out the UK's demands in detail. The Government has accepted a Labour motion which called on the Prime Minister to commit to publishing its Brexit plan before invoking Article 50, the formal process for leaving the EU. At least 20 Tory backbenchers were thought to be ready to back the Labour motion, according to pro-Remain Conservative MP Anna Soubry. Mr Barnier warned that the UK would not be able to ""cherry-pick"" which EU rights and obligations it wishes to keep. He added: ""Being a member of the European Union comes with rights and benefits. Third countries can never have the same rights and benefits since they are not subject to the same obligations. :: Brexit judges warned not to cross over the line against the Government ""The single market and its four freedoms are indivisible. Cherry-picking is not an option."" The Prime Minister's spokesman said the Government does not want to extend Brexit negotiations beyond the two-year timetable and added it was confident it could achieve a ""smooth and orderly"" transition from the EU.  Mrs May continued to keep her cards close to her chest during a visit to Bahrain, refusing to rule out the UK paying for access to the single market after Brexit and repeating her promise to achieve an ""ambitious"" deal. She said: ""We will be looking to negotiate the best possible terms that we can with the European Union. ""Crucially, this is not about how we retain bits of what we've already got, but what our new relationship with the EU is.

2016-12-06,Two men from Birmingham raised money for international terrorism which may have included partly funding the devastating attacks on Paris and Brussels.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161206222325/http://news.sky.com/story/pair-convicted-after-giving-money-to-brussels-bomb-suspect-10685390,"Zakaria Boufassil, 26, and Mohammed Ali Ahmed, 27, handed over thousands of pounds to one of the main suspects in the Paris and Brussels atrocities, just months before the attack on the French capital in November 2015. A jury at Kingston Crown Court in London found Boufassil guilty of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism. Ahmed pleaded guilty to the same charge at the start of the trial. The court was told how Mohamed Abrini, 31, who became known as the ""man in the hat"" after he was captured on CCTV at Brussels airport on the day of the bombing there, had travelled to the UK in July 2015 to collect the money from his two British contacts . Boufassil and Ahmed handed over £3,000 to Abrini in a Birmingham park. The two men had taken elaborate measures to evade detection during Abrini's visit between 9 July and 16 July last year. Expert analysis revealed that the phones being used by all three men converged on Small Heath Park in Birmingham on 10 July, the day before the cash was handed over. Max Hill QC, prosecuting counsel, said Ahmed and Boufassil appear to have been watching Abrini in order to check he was not being followed. ""There can be no doubt that the money was handed over with the intention of assisting acts of terrorism,"" he added. The jury was told Abrini, a Belgian citizen of Moroccan descent, had been sent to collect the money by Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who is suspected of being one of the ringleaders of the attacks across the French capital just months later in which 130 people were killed.  The cash had been withdrawn from the bank account of Anouar Haddouchi, another Belgian national, who had been living in the West Midlands and claiming housing benefit. Haddouchi had left the UK to join the terrorist group IS in Syria. But even though he was no longer in Britain, regular benefits payments were still being deposited into his account. Abrini's involvement in the November 2015 Paris terror attacks remains under investigation by the French authorities but it could take another four years before he faces trial, according to Belgian prosecutors. Abrini then allegedly went on to help with the attacks on Brussels airport and a metro station on March 22 this year, which killed 32 people. He became notorious when police released security camera images of him at the airport, wearing a distinctive hat and pushing a luggage trolley next to the two suicide bombers. Part of the evidence in the case against the two Birmingham men came from Belgian police interviews with Abrini after his arrest earlier this year. As well as admitting that he had travelled to collect money in the UK, he also confirmed he had visited Manchester, taking pictures of Manchester United's ground at Old Trafford, as well as shopping centres and casinos around Birmingham. But he denied any knowledge of planned terror attacks in Britain, suggesting this country was too well protected. In police interview transcripts, he said: ""I think England has a more developed secret service, better observation techniques. And it's therefore more difficult to attack."" Margaret Gilmore, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said it was certainly true to say Britain's security services have an international reputation as being among the best in the world, but that it would be nonsense to suggest the UK was not on the terrorists' target list. The two Birmingham men, Zakaria Boufassil and Mohammed Ali Ahmed, are now facing lengthy jail terms when they are sentenced next week. Prosecutors said the case at Kingston Crown Court had provided insight into the multiple, complex links that make up international terror cells and illustrated how those behind terrorist funding were just as culpable for the carnage that is caused."

Vaughan rose to fame as Harry 'Grouty' Grout in the 1970s sitcom Porridge. He also starred in cult films including Terry Gilliam's Brazil, classic thriller Straw Dogs and The Remains of the Day. In the 1960s, he starred alongside Frank Sinatra in the spy thriller The Naked Runner. ""The great thing about Frank was that you had to stand up to him very quickly,"" Vaughan once said. ""If you did that, he respected you, otherwise he'd walk all over you."" In the 1970s, Vaughan starred in John Sullivan's Citizen Smith and later in the BBC drama Our Friends in the North, playing Felix Hutchinson - a character who suffered from Alzheimer's. But it was Game of Thrones that made him famous to millions around the world. The actor was partially sighted and portrayed the blind Maester Aemon for five years. Vaughan was married to actress Billie Whitelaw for 12 years, later wedding actress Lillias Walker, who he met in his repertory days.

2016-12-06,"Human evolution is being shaped by the number of women giving birth by caesarean section, a study has found.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161206222325/http://news.sky.com/story/increase-in-the-number-of-c-sections-affecting-human-evolution-10685115,"Researchers estimate that between 3% and 6% of births worldwide are obstructed because the mother's pelvis is too small for the head or shoulders. Although the caesarean section is thought to date from ancient times, it is only in the modern era that its use has mushroomed. Its use stateside increased from less than 5% of births in the 1970s to more than a quarter for most of the last 30 years, according to the US National Library of Medicine. NHS figures show similar rates for the UK. It is believed that the size of women's pelvises and the size of babies' heads were finely balanced over millions of years of human evolution, with hips unable to dip below a certain width if babies were to survive. But the increased use of caesarean sections means all that is changing because women with hips of any size can now give birth to babies of any size. The study, by a team from Austria and the US, used a ""mathematical model"" to show that increased use of caesareans had accounted for an increase in the size of babies relative to women's pelvic canals. They call this ""fetopelvic disproportion"". Bigger babies are now more likely to survive and the number of babies dying in childbirth has dropped significantly. The paper written by the team, led by Philipp Mitteroecker, said: ""Using a simple mathematical model, we show that weak directional selection for a large neonate, a narrow pelvic canal, or both is sufficient to account for the considerable incidence of fetopelvic disproportion. ""Based on this model, we predict that the regular use of caesarean sections throughout the last decades has led to an evolutionary increase of fetopelvic disproportion rates by 10 to 20%."" The team admits there may be other factors at work. For example, a change in diet over the generations could also be partly responsible for the mismatch between unborn baby size and pelvis width."

The £50m it is receiving from the sale and £30m in dividends will be invested in its core businesses. It currently holds a 30% stake in the retail business, with Central England Co-operative also standing to net £5.8m from its 3.5% holding. The sale means the food-to-funeral mutual will exit the travel market altogether, with Thomas Cook taking full control of the retail estate comprising 764 sites in the UK. The travel firm said it expected the deal to be completed by November 2017. While the holiday sector has been a small part of the Co-op's operations amid its revival from a governance crisis in 2013, the sale comes at a time of caution in the travel industry. Part of that is attributed to the weakness of sterling since the Brexit vote and the possibility it will put people off taking holidays abroad. The pound has fallen by up to 20% against the dollar alone since the referendum, making in-resort spending more expensive, though it is currently trading at a two-month high near $1.28 and it has also clawed back some ground against the euro in recent days. Thomas Cook recently reported a 41% fall in underlying profits, saying it suffered amid a ""difficult year for tourism"". The industry has seen demand for key resorts dampened by terror attacks in Paris and Brussels, while political instability has also hit Turkey. Thomas Cook said it did not expect any job losses to arise from the ending of the joint venture with Co-op. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said: ""Our relationship with the Co-op has given us a strong presence on the high street and fantastic colleagues across the UK, both of which are so important in attracting and inspiring our customers. ""This purchase gives us full control over our retail store network, enabling us to better integrate our stores with our online offering, while also helping us to focus on growing sales of added extras such as holiday-related financial services. ""Over the next two years, we will bring all of our UK stores under the Thomas Cook banner so we can make full use of the best brand in travel."""
2016-12-06,The Football Association is to increase the scope of its investigation into child sex abuse allegations - as another club reveals it is looking into claims about a former employee.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161206222325/http://news.sky.com/story/fa-to-increase-scope-of-child-sex-abuse-review-10685169,"Queens Park Rangers said it had been made aware of historical allegations made against the late Chris Gieler relating to child abuse. ""The club takes these allegations very seriously and will cooperate fully in any forthcoming investigation,"" QPR said in a statement. It comes as the FA announced that in light of the number of allegations and the scale of the review, it is to appoint Clive Sheldon QC instead of Kate Gallafent QC. The latter has other ""professional commitments"". Mr Sheldon has experience of conducting investigatory reviews that included child protection, the FA said in a statement.  A number of former players linked to ""several"" professional football clubs have claimed they were paid to keep quiet about allegations of child abuse, according to a lawyer representing victims. Edward Smethurst said he had been contacted in recent days by players claiming they were paid off. The players are understood to have alleged they were asked to sign confidentiality clauses after receiving compensation payments from clubs. On Saturday, Chelsea apologised to former player Gary Johnson, who was asked to sign a confidentiality clause when receiving a £50,000 pay-off after he alleged abuse by the club's former chief scout Eddie Heath. Speaking at the launch of the Offside Trust, a support and campaign group founded by former player Andy Woodward, Mr Smethurst told Sky News he had received allegations against coaches still active in the game. He said: ""Victims who have come forward to us have made mention of confidentiality clauses being used and now wanting to come forward because they believe the use of those clauses was inappropriate.  ""We need to sit down with those clients, look at the documentation and see what evidence there was, but certainly we have been told by a number of victims that these clauses have been used."" Mr Smethurst added: ""Where there is something of a very, very serious criminal nature involving children there is an overarching need for transparency so that others can come forward, there may be other people involved. ""In answer to the question, are there people involved in the game today where victims have made specific allegations, and those people are still involved in the game? The answer is yes."" The Offside Trust has been launched less than three weeks after Mr Woodward became the first former footballer to go public with claims of historical child abuse in the game. He was quickly followed by former teammates at Crewe Alexandra and their testimony has prompted a wave of allegations. More than 350 people linked to 55 football clubs have contacted police with allegations of abuse and more than a quarter of UK police forces are investigating claims. The FA has launched an internal review of its actions and Crewe are one of several clubs investigating historical allegations, but the Offside Trust is calling for a fully independent inquiry. Mr Woodward said he hoped the trust would provide support to people coming to terms with abuse, as well as seeking justice for the victims. Steve Walters, who has also made allegations, said: ""I'm getting phone calls every day off players who I've grown up with - there are so many.  ""You won't believe how many are still to come out, honestly."""

He was speaking during a visit to Sleaford in Lincolnshire ahead of Thursday's by-election, in which the Conservatives are defending a majority of more than 24,000. Asked if his party's candidate, Victoria Ayling, stands a chance of winning, Mr Farage said: ""I don't know, it's 2016, why predict anything? Only an idiot predicts things in 2016 because it's been so full of upsets. ""It's a big opportunity for voters to say to the Prime Minister: We voted for Brexit, we didn't vote for hard Brexit, we didn't vote for soft Brexit, we voted for Brexit ... and would you please get on with it."" Mr Farage again highlighted his closeness with Mr Trump and reiterated his belief he could perform an ambassadorial role for the UK with the President-elect's administration. Speaking about his plans for 2017, he said: ""Trump becomes president on January 20 and his incoming administration think that I have a very positive role to play between our two countries. ""At the moment, 10 Downing Street doesn't seem to think that. ""To me, that's a shame because I genuinely think we have an Anglophile president coming in on 20 January, a big opportunity to completely reset the relationship after the Obama years."""

He offered no resistance when he was found hours later in temperatures of -30C (-22F) before being sent for treatment at Lapland's central hospital in the capital Rovaniemi on Sunday morning. The unnamed victim from Scotland and her boyfriend were seasonal employees with tour operator Santa Safari, which describes itself as one of Lapland's leading inbound travel companies providing Arctic wilderness trips for adults and children. The company's recruitment advertisements describe working in the remote environment as ""not for the faint hearted"" while offering staff ""a lifetime experience like no other"".

2016-12-06,"Representatives from the ""big six"" energy companies have met in Westminster to discuss how to tackle fuel poverty. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161206222325/http://news.sky.com/story/big-six-energy-companies-to-meet-over-fuel-poverty-10685013,"The issue affects more than two million households in the UK and is an acute problem every winter.  A charity has found that more than half of energy customers are completely unaware that help is available to low-income households and vulnerable people.  Turn2Us, which helps people tackle poverty across the UK, is hosting the event and has spoken to 4,000 people over the past three months.  Other findings include that 46% of people say they have had to cut back on heating to save money, and for older people that figure increases to 55%. The idea of automatically putting low-income and vulnerable customers on the lowest tariffs available was discussed at the meeting. Steve Crabb, from British Gas, told Sky News: ""We don't believe in automatically shifting people without their permission.  ""We try to call customers to speak to them and explain what is available to them, and we are going to be doing more of that in the coming year.""  Sarah-Jane suffers from epilepsy and eyesight problems, and last year found herself seriously behind on her energy bills. However, she had no idea that there was help available to people in vulnerable situations. She told Sky News: ""I haven't put the heating on for years. I put it on for half an hour in the evening but with the storage heaters there's not much point - I put on another layer. ""The elderly people I know are dreading it - no one will put their heating on at the moment. If they're in fuel poverty it's very, very hard."" There are a number of schemes that provide support to vulnerable customers including the Government-led Warm Home Discount, individual support grants, the Cold Weather Payment, and practical support from suppliers themselves. Discussions between the energy companies, charity leaders and industry figures will concentrate on how to increase awareness of these options. Anthony Pygram from the regulator Ofgem said: ""Suppliers should treat their customers fairly, so if people are vulnerable, they should recognise that and give those customers the help that they need. ""If customers are concerned that they could be going into debt with their supplier, they should contact the supplier as soon as possible."""
2016-12-06,The Football Association is close to unveiling the most lucrative kit sponsorship deal in its history despite the England team's limp exit from Euro 2016 and even as the sport's sexual abuse scandal continues to escalate.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161206222325/http://news.sky.com/story/england-nets-163400m-nike-8206deal-despite-early-euro-2016-exit-10685366,"Sky News has learnt that Nike, the American sportswear manufacturer, has agreed the terms of a £400m, 12-year extension to its existing deal with the FA. The new long-term partnership is expected to be announced within days, although the precise timing was unclear on Tuesday. The scale of Nike's backing for ‎the FA - which will encompass all of the England national teams - will mark a modest improvement on the existing deal, which expires after the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Nike replaced Umbro in 2013, ending an association dating back to the 1950s. Sources said‎ the new kit supply deal would for the first time include several contingency clauses, including a financial penalty if the senior men's team fail to qualify for major tournaments. It has also been structured to mean that there will be incentiv‎e payments if the team reaches the latter stages - expected to refer to the semi-finals or beyond - of World Cups and European Championships from 2020 onwards. The Nike deal will come soon after the FA unveiled another major commercial deal, with the overseas broadcast rights to the FA Cup reported in October to have been sold for around ‎$1bn. Under Martin Glenn, the former Walkers Crisps, Birds Eye and United Biscuits executive who took the helm at the FA last year, the organisation has prioritised more effective exploitation of its commercial rights. However, the latest deal comes as the FA finds itself in the middle of a firestorm over the expanding child sexual abuse scandal which has rocked British football. On Tuesday, the FA published detailed terms of reference for an investigation into the allegations. English football's governing body has also had to contend with the poor performance of the men's team, with a second round defeat to Iceland at Euro 2016 following a group stage departure at the World Cup two years earlier. Sports industry executives suggested that the size of the new ‎Nike partnership with the FA meant it would rank second behind only Germany - the reigning world champions - in national kit supply deals. The FA's alliance, worth about £33m annually over the duration of the contract, is nevertheless significantly smaller than the most lucrative club deals. In October, Chelsea announced a 15-year partnership with Nike worth £900m, while Barcelona's annual contract with the Oregon-headquartered sportswear manufacturer is worth an estimated £120m. Neither the FA nor Nike could be reached for comment."

The team analysed ovarian tissue from 11 women undergoing chemotherapy. Eight had Hodgkin lymphoma and were receiving the drug combination ABVD.  Within these women they found up to 10 times more eggs, and their ovaries looked like those of a pre-pubescent girl. Although the sample of women involved was small, the scientists think there could be big implications. Lead researcher Professor Evelyn Telfer said: ""We were very surprised by the results. When we started we were looking at the effects of chemotherapy on the structure of the ovary. ""We expected to find fewer eggs or maybe the same number, so when we found there were more eggs we were really astonished.""  It is not known whether the new eggs can mature or develop normally, but if they do, some fertility doctors say it is potentially very significant.   Associate Professor Tim Child, from the University of Oxford, said: ""I think it's very exciting. ""We've always thought that chemotherapy only damages ovaries - or perhaps some types can leave the ovaries undamaged - but this suggests that drugs can actually increase the numbers of eggs.""  The research team are now hoping to understand the mechanism behind their findings.  They will be looking at the individual drugs which make up ABVD, to better understand what has been happening and how the drugs work. This could help them learn more about women's fertility and how they might be able to produce more eggs. It was previously thought that women were born with a finite number of eggs, but this might not now be true if it is shown drugs can trigger more to be produced.   Professor Telfer admits it is early days and is reluctant to make big claims for fear of offering false hope. ""We wouldn't rush to overstate the significance, but it is a starting point,"" she said. ""The more we understand about the working of the ovary, the better placed we are to treat infertility."""

And if the Prime Minister is to achieve her ambition of Britain morphing into a globally connected free-trade Mecca, untethered from Brussels bureaucracy, then the oil-soaked Gulf ticks plenty of boxes. But there are inherent risks. The six Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman) are controversial bedfellows. Saudi Arabia has been condemned for targeting civilians in its bloody interventions in Yemen, with many of those munitions being soldered in the UK. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says ""the threshold has not been crossed"", but Amnesty and other human rights organisations contend that the bombing campaign has left 10,000 dead. Meanwhile, other GCC countries including Bahrain stand accused of ruthlessly suppressing political dissent. Theresa May told reporters on their way to cover the summit that she has already raised concerns at bilateral meetings she has conducted since becoming Prime Minister. She also hinted, but would not confirm, that she intends to do so again this week. ""The only way which you can actually raise issues around human rights and have a meaningful discussion about it is by engaging with them rather than step back and stand on the outside,"" the Prime Minister said. This is proof that when it comes to finding new governments with whom to boost our trading relationships outside Europe, ethical and moral lines may have to be crossed."
2016-12-06,Network Rail is to be stripped of its complete control of England's railway tracks under Government plans.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161206222325/http://news.sky.com/story/network-rail-to-be-stripped-of-complete-control-of-railway-tracks-10685031,"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling wants the publicly owned company to share its responsibility for running the tracks with private train operators. Mr Grayling thinks the major change will lead to more reliable services and help ""transform the passenger experience"". Network Rail said it welcomed the changes as they will strengthen its existing alliances with operators but they are opposed by the unions who say it will put safety at risk. In a speech at the Policy Exchange think-tank in London, Mr Grayling will say the relationship between the tracks and the trains needs to change, because the lack of a coordinated approach can ""make things much worse"" when disruption happens. He will say: ""In my experience, passengers don't understand the division between the two. They just want someone to be in charge. They want their train to work. I agree with them. ""I intend to start bringing back together the operation of track and train on our railways ... I believe it will mean they run better on a day-to-day basis ... our railway is much better-run by one joined-up team of people. ""They don't have to work for the same company. They do have to work in the same team."" New franchises on the South Eastern and East Midlands routes in 2018 will have integrated operating teams overseeing both train services and infrastructure. Similar action could be taken for other contract renewals in the coming years. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: ""We strongly welcome these plans to bring more joined-up working within the industry. ""We have already devolved Network Rail into route-based businesses closer to customers, and the proposals announced today will build on the alliances we have created between these route businesses and train-operators."" Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group - which represents train operators and Network Rail - said: ""Effectively managed teams focused on the same objectives will resolve problems and make progress more quickly. ""We will work with the Government to make sure that we meet customers' needs and expectations, finding new ways of working and new sources of investment."" Mr Grayling will face protesting rail workers when he arrives to make his speech on Tuesday, as it coincides with another strike in the ongoing dispute over changes to the role of conductors on Southern Railway services. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said the move would send the network back to the ""failed and lethal"" model of private infrastructure. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""This is the Tory Government dragging the railways back to the failed and lethal Railtrack model of the private sector running infrastructure. ""There is no question at all that this plan represents the piecemeal privatisation of Network Rail which, over a period of time, will see both operations and track run by the same bunch of companies who have failed so abysmally over the past two decades."" Network Rail took over responsibility for the track network from Railtrack in 2002 after a series of fatal accidents, including the Hatfield and Potters Bar crashes."

He said: ""I thought it was the bread man but when I turned around I just saw this massive goat standing on its two hind legs. It seemed like it wanted to come into the shop and was looking straight at me. ""It was running around the place, chasing customers and jumping up on cars.

It was eventually stopped when a member of the public, believed to be the animal's owner, grabbed it by the horns and took it away. Footage of the animal butting the shop window has attracted thousands of views online."

Mr Grayling said: ""In a world where I can even buy my lunch in the House of Commons tea room with my mobile phone, I should not have to queue for a paper ticket at the station in the morning. ""I have mandated my department and the industry to make rapid progress introducing smart ticketing across the network. The ingredients are there to deliver something much better - and we want to see these key reforms happen quickly. ""I can't understand the slow progress."" Mr Grayling made the announcement on the same day that he revealed plans to strip Network Rail of its complete control of Britain's rail tracks. The organisation will, instead, have to share control with train operators. Unions have questioned whether the move would compromise safety. By moving his focus on to the ease of buying tickets, Mr Grayling says he is trying to put passengers first. He indicated that he would like to see the success of London's contactless Oyster card system replicated across the country. The capital introduced the smart card payment system in 2003 for use on bus and Tube journeys. It can be used both for pay-as-you-go journeys as well as storing season ticket information for regular travellers. Contactless debit and credit cards and mobile phones are also now accepted as forms of payment across the capital. Mr Grayling suggested that Southern would be the first operator to introduce smart payments properly with its KeyGo system expected to go live in 2017. However, the ability to buy tickets easily will be of little comfort for many Southern passengers who have endured further strike action following months of disputes. The company warned commuters of severe disruption to their journeys and to expect a queuing system to be in place at some stations."

The study, which assesses how students use their knowledge and skills in real life rather than just learning facts and figures by rote, revealed the UK was above the OECD average in science and reading, but not so good in maths. The two-hour tests of more than 500,000 15-year-olds from around the globe included multiple-choice answers. The UK came 15th for science (up from 21st last time), 22nd in reading (up from 23rd) and 27th at maths (down from 26th). Critics say the tests are not infallible, arguing that only the brightest 5% are tested.  The UK is a high spender when it comes to education. It spends more than the OECD average per student, around £90,284 per student from the age of six to 15 - compared with an average across OECD countries of £70,954 and well above the £59,167 across all 72 countries.

In papers filed with a Louisiana court this week, Mr Loeb ended a former lawsuit against the actress and replaced it with a new one. According to the second claim, not allowing the embryos to be born is depriving them of their inheritance. Louisiana is a pro-life state where embryos are given rights as people. ""Emma"" and ""Isabella"" are currently frozen at a California fertility clinic, where Vergara wants to keep them indefinitely. Mr Loeb said: ""A woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects. ""Shouldn't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects?""  The 42-year-old Modern Family star, who is now married to Magic Mike actor Joe Manganiello, insisted last year that she was ""doing the right thing"" by refusing to sign over custody of the embryos. ""Can you blame me?"" she asked. ""A child brought into the world needs more than a mother, it needs a loving relationship of parents."" Vergara is America's top earning TV star. Mr Loeb signed an agreement with the actress stipulating nothing would be done with the embryos unless both agreed.

But if leaders don't take that approach - perhaps particularly in Europe - then it could go down as something quite different."" Mr Cameron also warned of further turmoil with the euro.

The idea is that shoppers pick up groceries in-store and pay via a smartphone app. It will use technology that automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to shelves, allowing customers with the app to walk out of the store without queuing or scanning their items. Payments would be made via Amazon accounts. The company is yet to confirm any plans to expand the project beyond the United States but the concept chimes with a recent warning from the governor of the Bank of England on the threat to jobs posed by technology. The UK retail sector employs almost three million people, though the effects of the fourth industrial revolution, as some see the shift, applies to many areas of the economy. While robotic technology and machinery have replaced humans in a number of sectors from car manufacturing to sorting post, the outsourcing firm Capita said on Thursday, after issuing a profits warning, that it intended to replace 2,000 staff with ""robotic solutions"". Amazon already has a presence in the British grocery market through a wholesale deal with Morrisons. Amazon Go is less likely to compete with online delivery but will challenge the shopping experience in physical stores. Nicla Di Palma, an equity analyst at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said of the concept: ""I would say that it is even more likely to work in the UK than in the US. ""For example, one of the reasons why Fresh & Easy - Tesco's business in the US - did not succeed was that they were focusing on self-checkout, whilst the American consumer likes service."""
2016-12-09,Prince Andrew has denied reports of a rift with his brother over his daughters' role as members of the Royal family.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161209200244/http://news.sky.com/story/prince-andrew-denies-split-with-prince-charles-10689698,"In a statement, Andrew the Duke of York said that ""a number of stories"" had been published over the past few weeks ""that have no basis of fact"". He added that ""the most recent, relating to my daughters, requires correction to terminate further speculation and innuendo"". The Duke said that suggestions he had asked for future husbands of Princesses Beatrice, 28, and Eugenie, 26, to have titles were ""a complete fabrication"". ""There is no truth to the story that there could be a split between the Prince of Wales and I over my daughters' participation as member of the Royal Family and any continued speculation is pointless."" According to reports, Andrew, 56, fears that any children the princesses may have will be ""commoners"", prompting efforts to improve their status by persuading the Queen and heir to the throne Charles to let their future husbands have earldoms. But the Duke said he only wished for his daughters to ""be modern working young women, who happen to be members of the Royal Family"". He added: ""Whilst I appreciate, as granddaughters of The Queen, there is considerable interest in my daughters, I cannot continue to stand by and have the media speculate on their futures based on my purported interventions, which are completely made up and an invention."" The Duke's statement came on the same day that the princesses' mother the Duchess of York pleaded with the media to ""stop bullying the York family"". She spoke as the two young women became patrons of the Teenage Cancer Trust, calling their ""hard work"" an example of ""good parenting"". She said: ""Both the Duke and myself, we could not be more proud of this moment because these are two girls that work so hard in their own careers, have taken time off today to spread the word of teen cancer, which is so important, and then go back to work. ""Let's focus more on this and less on title-tattle gossip."" Just last month, Prince Harry made an unprecedented statement saying his new girlfriend Meghan Markle had been subjected to a ""wave of abuse and harassment"" by the media."

It revealed that 98% of those identified as victims were male and the age of potential victims at the time of the alleged abuse ranged from as young as seven through to 20. Investigators said 98 clubs at all levels of the game - from the premiership through to the amateur grassroots - had so far been ""impacted"" by the inquiry. Police stressed this did not mean they were all under investigation, but had been referenced when information was submitted. Some 639 referrals have so far been received by the inquiry, called Operation Hydrant, which are being examined ""to determine if the referral relates to a victim or a witness and whether the information received is new or a duplication of information already received"". National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, said: ""Allegations received by police forces across the country are being swiftly acted upon. ""We are ensuring an efficient and effective service-wide approach to investigating allegations, removing the potential for duplication and enabling the timely and effective sharing of intelligence and information between forces. ""We are also liaising closely with the Football Association to ensure all relevant information they hold is shared to inform investigations moving forward. ""We continue to urge anyone who may have been a victim of child sexual abuse to report it by dialling 101, or contacting the dedicated NSPCC helpline, regardless of how long ago the abuse may have taken place. ""We will listen and treat all reports sensitively and seriously. Anyone with any information regarding child sexual abuse is also urged to come forward."" He added: ""As the number of calls being received across the service is higher than usual, it may take longer than normal for an officer from a local force to make contact to follow up from the initial call. Please be assured that the information provided will be taken seriously and acted upon."" An NSPCC spokesman said: ""These shocking numbers now identified by police reveal the deeply disturbing extent of abuse that has been going on within football. ""Our football hotline, launched with the support of the FA, saw a staggering surge in calls in its first week and anyone who wants to contact us can continue to do so in confidence, with the knowledge they will be listened to and supported."" It has emerged Richard Scudamore, the executive chairman of the Premier League, wrote to parents of more than 3,000 current youth players this week to say he was ""very concerned"" by allegations involving professional clubs. He added that there ""there is no complacency"" about protecting young players."

Some of her colleagues were moved to tears as she said: ""I'm not a victim - I'm a survivor"". Her speech was part of a debate on the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. On Friday she said that she had been ""humbled by the responses and support"". On Twitter, she mentioned that she had received a ""rapid response"" from Police Scotland after making contact with them. Police did not comment on the message. But it is understood officers will approach someone who publicly says they have been the victim of an offence to see if they want to take matters further. Humbled by the responses and support. Thanks also to @policescotland for their rapid response and with whom I have made contact Mrs Thomson told Sky News on Friday that she had been inspired to speak about her experience because her role was more than ""just about politics and giving a particular political view"". She said: ""There's a much bigger perspective which is trying to make sure voices of other people are heard as well and get a much greater resonance. ""If we look at the statistics, one in three women worldwide are subjected to physical or sexual abuse. ""Around three million every year in the UK are subjected to physical or sexual abuse and one woman is killed roughly every three days on average in the UK at the hands of a man. ""These are appalling statistics and I really think the urgency and the resonance really needs to be increased. ""I thought if I could tell my story and make it real and give it that resonance and, if that helped other women to speak up or get help or indeed stop it happening, that would be a fantastic thing to do."" She added: ""I was terrified beforehand, I really, really was very nervous, for about three hours my hands were sweating and my heart was racing. ""But when I got up to speak, I almost forgot everybody else was there. I was just speaking and telling my story."" She told Sky News that she had talked to her husband about the experience before they got married. She had also told her adult son and daughter ""when they were old enough to cope with it and understand it as well"". She had also told them about what she planned to say in Parliament on Thursday.

2016-12-09,Children from poor backgrounds could go to top public schools like Eton under proposals unveiled by leading independent schools.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161209200244/http://news.sky.com/story/private-schools-plan-to-offer-10000-free-places-for-poorer-students-under-attack-10689298,"Fees at Eton - where David Cameron and Boris Johnson were educated - are among the most expensive in the country at more than £35,000 a year. But independent schools are offering up to 10,000 places for children from state schools if the Government provides a subsidy of £5,500 per pupil. The move is a fightback against Theresa May's grammar schools green paper, in which independent schools were warned to do more for society to keep their charitable status. Among the most expensive UK public schools are Malvern College (£36,288), Tonbridge (£36,288), Harrow (£36,150), Eton (£35,721), Wycombe Abbey (£35,700), Winchester (£35,610) and Charterhouse (£35,529). The 'poor kids to posh schools' proposal comes from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) and would make places available to students of all ages, from prep school to sixth form. Some children would be tested for ability, but the ISC says it is not aiming the places at pupils already at top academy or grammar schools, but those from families on lower incomes. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the ISC, said: ""The proposals we are putting forward go considerably further than some of the ideas the green paper suggested and, by helping create more good school places, both in state and independent schools, we would be helping to expand real social mobility in this country."" The proposal was immediately attacked by Labour. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said it was a call for a return to an Assisted Places Scheme. ""Labour scrapped this scheme in order to fund smaller infant class sizes - a measure that helped millions of children rather than the handful that the Assisted Places Scheme supported,"" she said.  ""Independent schools can and should do more to support state schools if they are to hold on to their business rates relief. ""I'm afraid promising places to a few children just doesn't cut it."" The former chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw, a fierce critic of the Prime Minister's grammar schools revival, said the independent schools' plan does not go far enough. ""I think they can do better than that and if I was Government I would be asking them to do more as a quid pro quo for their tax privileges,"" he said. The proposal was also attacked by the Labour former education secretary Baroness Estelle Morris, who is an ex-teacher. ""This is about a request to use state money, taxpayers' money, to extract the brightest children out of our comprehensive schools and skim them off and put them into public schools, and that's not good for the education system,"" she said. But a Department for Education spokesman told Sky News: ""Our proposals are about creating more choice, with more good school places for more parents in more parts of the country. ""We want to do this by lifting the ban on new grammars, and harnessing the resources and expertise of universities, faith schools and independent schools. ""We welcome contributions to the consultation and will respond in due course."""

It made him the third American and only the fifth person in space. He was eligible to make the attempt by being one of NASA's Mercury 7, a group of elite US Navy and Air Force pilots and test pilots. He had previously flown 149 combat missions in World War II and Korea before setting a speed record for the time taken to fly from California to New York. The spacecraft that took him three times around the planet at 155 miles above the surface was named Friendship 7, and carried into orbit by an Atlas LV-3B launch vehicle. The combination of Mercury capsule and Atlas launch vehicle had only been successfully launched three times before his mission but had exploded in mid air just ten months before Mr Glenn's flight.

He splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean four hours, 56 minutes after blast off and was recovered by a US Navy destroyer. Only two Soviets, Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov, had successfully orbited the Earth before him. But, by being just months shy of NASA's 40-year age cut-off when the programme was announced in 1959, he was the oldest of the Mercury 7 to enter space and somewhat older than his two Soviet rivals Two years after his mission, he announced plans to run for the US Senate, but after suffering a fall, finally achieved his aim in 1974, representing Ohio as a Democrat. He ran twice for higher office, once in 1976 as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, but was beaten by Walter Mondale and for a second time as the Democratic presidential nominee in 1984, again being beaten by Mr Mondale.

Experts have concluded North Korea is able to make nuclear warheads small enough to arm Scud missiles, but it is unclear if they can put weapons on larger rockets which travel further and can deploy warheads from space. The defence official said: ""Truthfully, they have the capability right now to be able to deliver a nuclear weapon, they are just not sure about re-entry, that's why they continue to test their systems out there."" He added that he believed North Korea can already ""mate"" a missile with a warhead. The US is deploying an advanced missile defence system in South Korea in the wake of increased testing by North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will be operational within 10 months, according to the Pentagon, and has sparked strong objections from China and Russia. Pyongyang's continued nuclear testing has generated concern in the US military, and the Pentagon has devised contingency plans to try and halt its atomic capabilities. The official added: ""It is the threat that keeps me awake at night. ""You've heard other senior leaders say the same thing, primarily because we don't know what the 'Dear Leader' in North Korea really is after."""

Most of what Boris Johnson said in his latest alleged 'gaffe' is not that controversial. It is the reaction from Downing Street that makes this a much stronger story. The Prime Minister has distanced herself from her own Foreign Secretary. ""These are the Foreign Secretary's views,"" said her spokesman. ""They are not the Government's views on Saudi Arabia and its role in the region."" :: Boris Johnson's criticism of UK ally Saudi Arabia slapped down by PM When a Foreign Secretary cannot be relied upon to get things right about one of the country's closest strategic allies, he becomes a liability to a Prime Minister - and the media starts to wonder if his future is in doubt. ""There are politicians who are twisting and abusing religion and different strains of the same religion in order to further their own political objectives,"" said Mr Johnson. He does not specify Saudi Arabia in this respect or any other country, but is speaking more generically. The claim is uncontroversial. Religion is used and abused for political ends by politicians across the Middle East. It is a fact of life in the region. ""There are not enough big characters, big people, men or women, who are willing to reach out beyond their Sunni or Shia or whatever group to the other side and bring people together and to develop a national story again."" Another fair point. Where are the Begins, Sadats, Rabins of today? Even if the turmoil of the region post-Iraq War and Arab Spring is hardly conducive to charismatic peacemakers rising to the leadership roles. ""That's why you've got the Saudis, Iran, everybody, moving in, and puppeteering and playing proxy wars."" This is more controversial. It is not the official position of the British Government to brand its closest strategic ally in the region, Saudi Arabia, a puppetmaster, nor Syria's rebels puppets. Defending the Foreign Secretary, Foreign Office sources pointed out this was not an official policy speech but off-the-cuff remarks as part of a panel discussion about migration. Others defending the Foreign Secretary will say that it is about time the UK spoke some home truths about its Middle Eastern partners and asked what decades of softly-softly diplomacy have actually achieved. But if Boris Johnson is deliberately embarking on a new blunter kind of diplomacy he needs to be consistent with the rest of the Government. :: Boris Johnson's 'gaffes' as Foreign Secretary so far... His comments come while his boss, Theresa May, has been in the Gulf assiduously courting its leaders, including dining with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and neighbours. Branding them puppetmasters is not on the message. The Prime Minister has already distanced herself from her own Foreign Secretary on his comments. Given that backdrop, the Foreign Secretary's comments seem clumsy and ham-fisted even if there are plenty of people who will say they are simply spelling out the obvious. When Mrs May appointed Mr Johnson as her chief diplomat she was presumably not expecting a quiet life on the diplomatic front. But she will know the press is beginning to smell blood on the trail of Mr Johnson. His transition from newspaper columnist to diplomat has been littered with alleged missteps. This means his every word is scrutinised, and borderline contentious comments become blown up into headlines about yet another 'gaffe'. Mr Johnson has always had an uncanny ability to deflect controversy and scrutiny, but even he will know that a gaffe-prone politician is a liability to any government, and a gaffe-prone Foreign Secretary can be a liability to national interests. That is far more serious."

The context was the Scottish Government's representative claiming that abiding by the Sewel Convention (that legislation affecting Scotland must have Holyrood's consent) is a ""constitutional requirement"" for the purposes of Article 50. Lord Mance interjected: ""It is a question of European law, isn't it?"" The Lord Advocate replied: ""It is ultimately"". :: MPs vote to back Article 50 timetable So the four word question, was one of the 11 Justices publicly pondering whether defining the phrase ""constitutional requirement"" was for ""us"" the Supreme Court, or for them, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  In theory, if the point is relevant to the case, the Court has an obligation to refer to Luxembourg.  As I reported last month, the ECJ has been pondering whether it might get a referral for its ""ultimate authority"" on aspects of EU law. :: Commons motion 'will not impact Brexit court case' If it came it would be an extraordinary development, and delay the case, and so probably Article 50, by four to eight months. It may well merely have been a mischievous musing from a legal intellectual.  It had been thought the issue of Article 50 revocability (the Government and Lord Pannick are actively trying to avoid it) would be the more likely issue for referral.  It is still merely a possibility than a likely situation. But it is now on the table. In fact it is one of three cans of worms opened up on day three. Firstly, as I have referred to, the Supreme Court kept on coming back to the issue of the appropriate legal remedy or underpinning for the Article 50 decision.  At times the Justices debated among themselves whether a simple motion, a one line Bill, or the machinations of the Great Repeal Bill, would be necessary to trigger EU exit. Secondly, Northern Irish claimants and the Scottish Government staked their claims for Article 50 requiring both an Act of Parliament and Legislative Consent Motions in their legislatures.  Any one of these developments could scupper Theresa May's timetable. It is impossible to second guess the Justices, but all three are on the table. Rhetorically however, it was a better day for the Government on the substantive case.  The President of the Court, Lord Neuberger, tested Duncan Chambers QC, saying repeatedly that ""it seemed a bit odd"" that a referendum and a simple motion of Parliament might be insufficient legal backing for the Government trigger of Article 50.  The Acts of Union were mentioned, as was the Bill of Rights, and the Claim of Right 1689. Earlier in the day Lord Pannick had felt Neuberger's wrath, when asked how it could be that the referendum might not have any ""legal effect"". Again matters returned to the lack of legally binding underpinning to the 2015 Referendum Act. The constitutional ping pong continued. As the Court mentioned the Commons, so vice versa. Brexit Secretary David Davis rose in its debate and said something rather crucial.  He said the Government would ""obey what the Court finds"" and that ""one of the reasons we are waiting for the outcome is to get precisely right what this House has to do"". And then three hours after adjournment with ""Pannick over"" as it might be said, Government indeed passed a motion, with a thumping majority, supporting the triggering of Article 50 by the end of March.  It may not be legally binding, and it may be odd that such a motion could be ignored, but it surely will get a mention when the Government lawyers sum up their case on Thursday afternoon.  But in the end, the Court could well decide an Act or perhaps more is required, and the chief Appellant in the case, acknowledged this, away from the Court, today."
2016-12-09,"The UK's food and drink industry has fired a warning shot over Brexit, arguing prices will rise and choice will fall without access to EU workers.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161209200244/http://news.sky.com/story/food-prices-will-rise-without-eu-workers-industry-warns-10688728,"In a letter to The Guardian signed by 30 interest groups in the sector, it is argued that such staff provide an ""essential reservoir of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour"" to an industry employing almost four million. It warned some were already leaving the country following the referendum result in June and ministers must guarantee their status to remain amid uncertainty over the terms of the divorce from the EU. The letter, whose signatories included the Food and Drink Federation, said labour from overseas - mainly eastern Europe - was a factor behind three years of falling grocery prices in the supermarket price war. Economists expect store prices to go up next year as key supply deals end and producers look to pass on increased import costs - a consequence of the pound's collapse in value since the EU vote. The food industry said its domestic costs would grow without EU workers - exacerbating that price pressure. :: Ministers press for low-skilled migration to continue after Brexit The EU has, to date, made it clear that the principle of freedom of movement is locked to access to the single market. The Financial Times reports that Brexit Secretary David Davis told the City of London Corporation last month that the bloc's ""inflexible approach"" on immigration meant it was unlikely the UK would achieve access to the single market. The food industry letter made its case for no special treatment between different sectors of the economy should the exit deal put the brakes on EU workers and the single market in the wake of the political row over Nissan's decision to build new models at Sunderland. The letter said: ""If we adopt a work-permit system to control immigration, then the whole of our supply chain must receive equal treatment with financial services or the automotive sectors. ""All options should be explored, including a workable points-based system for shortage occupations, sector-based and seasonal/guest worker schemes and effective transitionary arrangements."""

""The First Minister and the President Elect also discussed the longstanding relationship between Scotland and the United States."" Mrs Sturgeon had expressed her support for Mr Trump's rival Hillary Clinton during the campaign and afterwards results came in said she was disappointed that Mrs Clinton ""will not be America's first woman president"".    However, her letter to the President-elect congratulated him, while expressing her hope he would promote the ""fundamental values of equality, tolerance, diversity and human rights for all"".  The billionaire property tycoon's mother, Mary Anne Trump, nee MacLeod, lived in the small Gaelic-speaking village of Tong before leaving for the United States in 1930, aged 18. There, she married Fred Trump, the son of German immigrants, and Donald is one of their five children. Mr Trump owns the Trump International golf course in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry in South Ayrshire. However, his relationship with Scotland has been troubled in recent years. In 2015, he lost a bid to stop the building of wind turbines of the coast near his Aberdeenshire golf course. His membership of the GlobalScot business network was also pulled after he called for a ban on Muslim entering the US.  Mr Trump called Prime Minister Theresa May last month, shortly after his win, and it was reported he could be welcomed to the UK with an official state visit."

The Independent MP for Edinburgh West shared her story during a Commons debate on UN International Day For The Elimination Of Violence Against Women. Police Scotland said speaking out about abuse was ""incredibly difficult"" and officers are understood to be planning to contact the MP, as they would with anyone who publicly disclosed an attack. She was comforted by former SNP colleagues at the end of her speech, with Speaker John Bercow visibly moved. Ms Thomson told the debate she was 14 when she was attacked by someone she knew on the way home from a youth event. The MP said her attacker told her he wanted to show her something ""in a wooded area"". She said: ""I did have a warning bell - but I overrode that warning bell because I knew him and therefore there was a level of trust in place. ""To be honest, looking back, at that point I don't think I knew what rape was. It was not something that was talked about. ""It was mercifully quick and I remember first of all feeling surprise, then fear, then horror as I realised I quite simply couldn't escape - because he was stronger than me, and there was no sense even initially of any sexual desire from him, which I suppose, looking back, again I find odd."" Ms Thomson said her senses were ""absolutely numbed"", telling MPs: ""Thinking about it now, 37 years later, I cannot remember hearing anything when I replay it in my mind."" She said that afterwards she walked home alone crying and shivering in shock. Ms Thomson said she did not tell anyone about the attack at the time, saying she felt ""ashamed"". She added: ""I felt I was spoiled and impure and really felt revulsion towards myself. ""I, of course, then detached from the child up to then I had been. ""Although, in reality, at the age of 14 it was probably the start of my sexual awakening, at that time, remembering back, sex was something that men did to women and perhaps this incident reinforced that early belief."""

Essex coroner Eleanor McGann, recorded a conclusion of accidental death. She hailed Miss Rogers for her bravery in dialling 999, fighting off the dog and barricading it in a conservatory until police and paramedics arrived. It took a team of dog handlers with specialist equipment to remove the pet, an inquest at Essex Coroner's Court in Chelmsford heard on Friday. Miss Rogers had moved in to the house in Harwich Road, Colchester, with her sister, Clare Ferdinand, who is a serving Essex Police officer, around a week before the attack on 13 October. The property is owned by Mrs Ferdinand's husband, John, and the couple were the owners of the dog, which was put down with their consent. The family had got the animal from a rescue centre and no concerns had been raised about its behaviour. Police took advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and were satisfied no offences had been committed. Ms McGann described the attack as ""harrowing"". She said: ""Nobody here is to blame.

""The unions should cancel the strikes and get back around the negotiating table, but the Government are washing their hands of this crisis and abandoning commuters in the process.

""The desire to win medals superseded their collective moral and ethical compass and Olympic values of fair play."" His investigation has found more than 1,000 Russian athletes have benefited from a systematic, state-sponsored doping cover-up across 30 sports. These athletes include 78 whose positive tests were covered up in London Games, the report said. Fifteen of them were medallists at the Games.  No Russian athlete tested positive for a prohibited substance at the time. ""The [Russian] ministry of sport was working to discipline athletes in advance of the London Games into taking the cocktail of steroids ... in order to beat the detection thresholds at the London lab,"" Prof McLaren said. He said the state-sponsored corruption involved ""the ongoing use of prohibited substances, washout testing and false reporting"". As well as at the London Games, the investigation found positive tests were covered up at Sochi 2014 and the 2013 World Athletics Championships. Prof McLaren, a Canadian sports lawyer, said: ""We are now able to confirm a cover-up that dates back until at least 2011 and continued after the Sochi Olympic Games. ""It was a cover-up that evolved from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalised and disciplined medal-winning conspiracy."" He said the Russians had ""hijacked"" international sports competitions ""for years"". ""Sports fans and spectators have been deceived and it is time that this stops,"" he said.

The spokeswoman said Mrs May has ""full confidence"" in Mr Johnson and noted he will have the opportunity to set out official policy - to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia and support for its controversial military involvement in Yemen - when he visits the Arab state on Sunday. Mrs May spoke to Saudi King Salman during her visit to the Gulf region this week, where she assured him of ""her commitment and that of her Government to enhancing and strengthening this relationship"", the spokeswoman added. Mr Johnson remained on message during a keynote speech at a regional conference in Bahrain on Friday night, as he told attendees that ""any crisis in the Gulf is a crisis in Britain"". The Foreign Secretary also spoke of his ""profound concern"" for the people of Yemen, where a Saudi-backed coalition is launching airstrikes on Iran-aligned Shia rebels. He said: ""Force alone will not bring about a stable Yemen and that's why we in London have been working so hard with all our partners to drive that political process forwards."" A video of Mr Johnson speaking at the Med 2 conference in Rome last week revealed him saying that a lack of strong leadership meant politicians in the Middle East were ""twisting and abusing religion and different strains of the same religion to further their own political objectives"". He was also recorded saying ""you've got the Saudis, Iran, everybody, moving in and puppeteering and playing proxy wars"". The comments, revealed by The Guardian, go against established protocol where diplomats do not publicly criticise British allies. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""As the Foreign Secretary made very clear on Sunday, we are allies with Saudi Arabia and support them in their efforts to secure their borders and protect their people. ""Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong and misinterpreting the facts."" Peter Ford, former British ambassador to Syria, told Sky News that Mr Johnson had been handed ""a warning"". He said: ""I've never seen the likes of it in my 40 years of diplomatic experience and therefore Boris is skating on thin ice. But Boris being Boris he may well survive to fight another day."" Britain backs investigations into alleged breaches of human rights by the Saudi-backed coalition in Yemen, according to the PM's spokeswoman. :: When do Boris Johnson's 'gaffes' become a liability? Its airstrikes against rebel forces have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians as the population struggles with starvation and disease. The UK has lent military assistance, helping the Saudis pick targets, but the Ministry of Defence insists it is to ensure the country complies with the rules of war. Britain is also a major exporter of arms to the country. Mr Johnson's criticism of Gulf states is another awkward entry in his diplomatic CV which includes a number of gaffes since his appointment in July."

""It could also mean the situation for victims that are identified is worse and that they're offered less support, especially in terms of compensation payments."" It is estimated there are around 13,000 victims of modern slavery in the UK. One of those was Monika Patricna, who was trafficked from the Czech Republic and forced into prostitution in Bristol.

There are 30 properties up and down the country, for men, women and families, that offer legal advice and counselling.

He says if it has been triggered then the Commission is in breach of its treaty duties through wrongly refusing to commence negotiations with the UK.  But if not, he says the European Council and Irish government are in breach of their treaty duties in wrongly excluding the United Kingdom from European Council meetings. ""Put aside the legal niceties, what no one can dispute is that there are incredibly important questions to answer,"" said Mr Maugham. ""Should Parliament control the terms on which we Brexit? Could we have a referendum on the final deal - or is the consequence of triggering Article 50 that we will leave the EU whatever the terms?

Independent directors of Sky - which is Europe's biggest pay television broadcaster with 21 million subscribers in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria - have agreed to recommend the offer to shareholders other than 21st Century Fox.  However, the company said that ""certain material terms"" remained under discussion and that there could be no certainty that an offer would be made by 21st Century Fox. The announcement follows a rise in Sky's share price earlier today.  Shares of Sky closed up 210.5p at 1000p - a 26.7% rise on the day. The offer price recommends a premium of 36% to Sky's closing share price on Thursday evening. Sky said it had formed an independent committee of its board to consider the American giant's proposal.  Members include Martin Gilbert, the company's senior independent director, and Jeremy Darroch, the chief executive of Sky.  Mr Gilbert is founder and chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the UK's biggest fund management firms, and a respected City grandee.  Others on the committee include Andrew Griffith, Sky's chief operating officer and chief financial officer, and Andrew Sukawaty, another non-executive director of Sky and previously chief executive of European satellite operator Inmarsat.  James Murdoch, Sky's chairman, is not on the committee because he is chief executive of 21st Century Fox.

News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media giant, tabled an £8bn takeover bid in June 2010 for the shares in Sky - then called British Sky Broadcasting - that it did not already own.  That deal attracted a good deal of scrutiny because it would have brought together Sky News with News Corporation's UK media assets, including The Sun, Britain's biggest-selling daily newspaper, The Times, The Sunday Times and the News of the World.  This attracted criticism from rivals of those newspapers about a concentration of media ownership and, in response to regulatory concerns, BSkyB agreed to hive off Sky News as a separate company.  However, in July 2011, News Corporation abandoned its offer when it emerged that the News of the World had hacked the mobile phone of murder victim Amanda 'Milly' Dowler.  News Corporation subsequently demerged its film and television assets outside Australia into a new company, 21st Century Fox, leaving it as a business focussed on newspaper titles from around the world - apart from the UK titles like The Sun and The Times it also owns the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post - and the book publisher Harper Collins.  There are likely to be fewer concerns from rivals of either Sky or the UK newspaper businesses owned by News Corporation about a concentration of the news market. Sky traces its origins to Sky Television - which was launched by Rupert Murdoch in February 1989.  The business merged with rival satellite broadcaster British Satellite Broadcasting in November 1990 and it floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1994 in a move that saw News Corporation's stake reduced to 40%.  However, it retained close ties with News Corporation and 21st Century Fox that, two years ago, saw Sky buy the American company's interests in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to become a pan-European broadcaster. In an email to Sky's near-30,000 employees, Mr Darroch said the offer was ""the first step in what will now be a formal process over the coming weeks"". He added: ""As you know, 21st Century Fox were the founders of our business and have always been an extremely supportive shareholder and backer of Sky. Many of us have worked closely with them over the years and know them very well."" Because 21st Century Fox already owns some 39.1% of Sky, buying full control of the company would cost it an estimated £11.25bn.  Speculation has mounted about a possible deal in recent months due to the fall in the pound against the US dollar - reducing the value of Sky, whose shares are quoted in sterling, in dollar terms."

A large number then went through the city centre, including in pedestrian areas and shopping arcades. More than 50 motorbikes and quad bikes were thought to have been involved in the social media organised events of 31 October. Users on Twitter described the scenes as ""madness"" and ""utter chaos"", with a police helicopter monitoring the situation. Officers said people's safety was put at risk in the incident which caused ""fear"" among the public and ""created an image of lawlessness"". There were also similar Halloween ""ride outs"" in Birmingham and London. Six men, aged 22 to 26, and a 29-year-old woman were arrested in early-morning raids on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance, West Yorkshire Police said. Four motorbikes and a number of items of motorcycle equipment were seized as part of the city-wide raids and officers are appealing for the public's help to identify 10 men caught on CCTV. A force spokesman said around 80 registration numbers of vehicles involved have been identified and officers are trying to find out who uses them. Leeds City Council has been granted an injunction as part of wider plans to give authorities extra powers to prevent any future such events. Chief Superintendent Paul Money said: ""The behaviour that was witnessed in the city that night put people's safety at risk, caused unnecessary fear to the public and created an image of lawlessness that we simply cannot allow to go unchecked. ""The arrests we have made today are by no way the conclusion of this investigation. ""And we do anticipate identifying other suspects and making further arrests as well as taking other action to prosecute other offences arising from this incident."""

2016-12-10,"Shock, horror, scandal. Britain's chief diplomat speaks truths about the Middle East. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161210172221/http://news.sky.com/story/when-do-boris-johnsons-gaffes-become-a-liability-for-the-pm-10687849,"Whatever next? Most of what Boris Johnson said in his latest alleged 'gaffe' is not that controversial. It is the reaction from Downing Street that makes this a much stronger story. The Prime Minister has distanced herself from her own Foreign Secretary. ""These are the Foreign Secretary's views,"" said her spokesman. ""They are not the Government's views on Saudi Arabia and its role in the region."" :: Boris Johnson's criticism of UK ally Saudi Arabia slapped down by PM When a Foreign Secretary cannot be relied upon to get things right about one of the country's closest strategic allies, he becomes a liability to a Prime Minister - and the media starts to wonder if his future is in doubt. ""There are politicians who are twisting and abusing religion and different strains of the same religion in order to further their own political objectives,"" said Mr Johnson. He does not specify Saudi Arabia in this respect or any other country, but is speaking more generically. The claim is uncontroversial. Religion is used and abused for political ends by politicians across the Middle East. It is a fact of life in the region. ""There are not enough big characters, big people, men or women, who are willing to reach out beyond their Sunni or Shia or whatever group to the other side and bring people together and to develop a national story again."" Another fair point. Where are the Begins, Sadats, Rabins of today? Even if the turmoil of the region post-Iraq War and Arab Spring is hardly conducive to charismatic peacemakers rising to the leadership roles. ""That's why you've got the Saudis, Iran, everybody, moving in, and puppeteering and playing proxy wars."" This is more controversial. It is not the official position of the British Government to brand its closest strategic ally in the region, Saudi Arabia, a puppetmaster, nor Syria's rebels puppets. Defending the Foreign Secretary, Foreign Office sources pointed out this was not an official policy speech but off-the-cuff remarks as part of a panel discussion about migration. Others defending the Foreign Secretary will say that it is about time the UK spoke some home truths about its Middle Eastern partners and asked what decades of softly-softly diplomacy have actually achieved. But if Boris Johnson is deliberately embarking on a new blunter kind of diplomacy he needs to be consistent with the rest of the Government. :: Boris Johnson's 'gaffes' as Foreign Secretary so far... His comments come while his boss, Theresa May, has been in the Gulf assiduously courting its leaders, including dining with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and neighbours. Branding them puppetmasters is not on the message. The Prime Minister has already distanced herself from her own Foreign Secretary on his comments. Given that backdrop, the Foreign Secretary's comments seem clumsy and ham-fisted even if there are plenty of people who will say they are simply spelling out the obvious. When Mrs May appointed Mr Johnson as her chief diplomat she was presumably not expecting a quiet life on the diplomatic front. But she will know the press is beginning to smell blood on the trail of Mr Johnson. His transition from newspaper columnist to diplomat has been littered with alleged missteps. This means his every word is scrutinised, and borderline contentious comments become blown up into headlines about yet another 'gaffe'. Mr Johnson has always had an uncanny ability to deflect controversy and scrutiny, but even he will know that a gaffe-prone politician is a liability to any government, and a gaffe-prone Foreign Secretary can be a liability to national interests. That is far more serious."

In video footage shown at his death penalty trial on Friday, he explained that he wanted to leave at least one person alive to reveal what happened. He told FBI agent Michael Stansbury that he wanted to kill black people because they rape white women daily. ""I knew that would be a place to get a small amount of black people in one area,"" he said. ""They're in church, they weren't criminals or anything."" The agent told him nine people had died in the attack on 17 June, 2015. Roof replied: ""There wasn't even that many people in there. Are you lying to me?"" When asked how he felt, he added: ""Well, it makes me feel bad."" Testimony from survivor Felicia Sanders said Roof sat through the Bible study alongside pastor Clementa Pinckney and began shooting as the rest of the group of 12 closed their eyes for a final prayer. In the confession, Roof said: ""I was sitting there thinking about whether I should do it or not. That's why I say there for 15 minutes. I could have walked out."" Church surveillance videos indicate Roof was actually inside for 45 minutes. Roof barely looked up as the confession was played in court. He told FBI agents questioning him that he could never look at the families of his victims. The court heard he meticulously prepared for the shootings. He carried eight magazines which could hold 13 bullets each, but only loaded 11 bullets so he could shoot 88 times - a number revered among white supremacists because it stands for Heil Hitler as H is the eighth letter of the alphabet. In the video confession, Roof said he left bullets in the magazine to kill himself but changed his mind when he did not see any police. Two handwritten notes were found in his car - one to his mother and one to his father. Roof told the court in Charleston that the killing of unarmed black man Trayvon Martin in 2012 was a turning point in his life."

There, she married Fred Trump, the son of German immigrants, and Donald is one of their five children. Mr Trump owns the Trump International golf course in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry in South Ayrshire. However, his relationship with Scotland has been troubled in recent years. In 2015, he lost a bid to stop the building of wind turbines of the coast near his Aberdeenshire golf course. His membership of the GlobalScot business network was also pulled after he called for a ban on Muslim entering the US.  Mr Trump called Prime Minister Theresa May last month, shortly after his win, and it was reported he could be welcomed to the UK with an official state visit."

But it appears something may have changed in the House of Windsor, with Prince Andrew the latest member of the family to speak out about press reports with a personally signed statement on his Twitter feed. This is a father sticking up for his daughters, fed up of newspapers questioning their role within the Royal Family and their job prospects. He says reports that he's being a pushy Dad, demanding their future husbands are made Earls, are a complete fabrication. While suggestions that he's fallen out with big brother Prince Charles, over whether Beatrice and Eugenie can become full time royals, are without truth. He's of course not the first Windsor male to stick up for his loved ones in the past month. Only a few weeks ago there was the angry statement sent out on behalf of Prince Harry, complaining that his new girlfriend Meghan Markle was being harassed. So is this a new type of media strategy? More likely, it's a sign of how a new generation of royals are no longer afraid to speak from the heart if they think it will confront what they see as hurtful, unjust and unfair. What does the Queen think about it all? I suspect that's a statement we won't be seeing anytime soon."

It revealed that 98% of those identified as victims were male and the age of potential victims at the time of the alleged abuse ranged from as young as seven through to 20. Investigators said 98 clubs at all levels of the game - from the premiership through to the amateur grassroots - had so far been ""impacted"" by the inquiry. Police stressed this did not mean they were all under investigation, but had been referenced when information was submitted. Some 639 referrals have so far been received by the inquiry, called Operation Hydrant, which are being examined ""to determine if the referral relates to a victim or a witness and whether the information received is new or a duplication of information already received"". National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, said: ""Allegations received by police forces across the country are being swiftly acted upon. ""We are ensuring an efficient and effective service-wide approach to investigating allegations, removing the potential for duplication and enabling the timely and effective sharing of intelligence and information between forces. ""We are also liaising closely with the Football Association to ensure all relevant information they hold is shared to inform investigations moving forward. ""We continue to urge anyone who may have been a victim of child sexual abuse to report it by dialling 101, or contacting the dedicated NSPCC helpline, regardless of how long ago the abuse may have taken place. ""We will listen and treat all reports sensitively and seriously. Anyone with any information regarding child sexual abuse is also urged to come forward."" He added: ""As the number of calls being received across the service is higher than usual, it may take longer than normal for an officer from a local force to make contact to follow up from the initial call.

The 2009 incident became known as the Edlington Case, after the former pit village where it happened. The brothers, now aged 17 and 19, were sentenced to an indeterminate period in custody, with a minimum of five years. They were originally granted anonymity until the age of 18 - but after being released back into society with new identities they wanted a permanent order. Their lawyers claimed identifying them would breach various sections of the Human Rights Act. In granting the order, High Court judge Sir Geoffrey Vos said he would outline his reasoning in writing at a later date.

As Mr Corbyn started his speech, Mr Tatchell and other protesters lined up in front of the stage and held up placards demanding immediate air drops in the war-ravaged country. He likened the current situation in the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo to the infamous bombing of a town during the Spanish Civil War, in which civilians were deliberately targeted from the air by fascist planes. Mr Tatchell said: ""What is happening in Aleppo is a modern day Guernica. ""We haven't heard the leader of the Labour Party speak out enough to demand UK air drops to besieged civilians who are dying in their thousands."" The protest came as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson travelled to Paris for international talks on the crisis. :: Syrian regime accused of chemical attack in Aleppo Mr Tatchell has previously criticised Mr Corbyn for not being vocal enough against Russia, which is backing the brutal regime of Syrian leader Bashar al Assad. He has also attacked the Stop the War coalition, previously headed by Mr Corbyn, for opposing Western military action while failing to protest against the Syrian regime. Mr Corbyn was on stage with a number of his frontbench team, including shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, at the time of the demonstration. Apparently forgetting they were still wearing microphones, Lady Chakrabarti advised the Labour leader ""just let them do this"". Mr Corbyn then consulted Ms Thornberry, asking her: ""When did we condemn the bombing?"" He later told the meeting: ""Just to be absolutely clear in response to the point that Peter made, Emily Thornberry, on our behalf, during Foreign Office questions and on many other occasions, has made it absolutely clear that we do think there should be aid given to people in Aleppo, we do think the bombing should end, we do think there should be a ceasefire, we do think there should be a political solution, we do think that the war should end in Syria."" Speaking to Sky News after the demonstration, Mr Tatchell said: ""Today's protest was a last desperate measure because Labour is not listening to the appeals from Syrian civil rights activists. ""They want the UK to do aid drops, humanitarian aid drops, of food and medicine to besieged civilians. ""We haven't had the Labour Party propose any specific proposals about bringing a measure, a proposal to Parliament, to make that happen. ""Of course, Labour has said it supports the principle of aid drops but it is not actually doing anything to get a vote in Parliament to make sure that they happen."""

The UK Airprox Board (UKAB) has warned that a minority of drone operators are ""flagrantly disregarding regulation and common sense"" in pursuit of ""ever more spectacular video footage"". UKAB reports have recorded 59 near-misses involving drones this year - though the incident with the Airbus A320 has been registered as among the most serious.

The cost of clearing up fly-tipping is almost £50m across England, with the number of recorded incidents rising 6% in 2014/15 to 900,000 cases. The power to seize and destroy a vehicle, trailer or mobile plant and their contents if it was suspected of being used in a waste crime was brought in last year. Councils can also issue on-the-spot fines, or fixed penalty notices, of up to £400 for smaller scale offences. Local authorities are calling for a legal loophole - in which enforcement officers have to give some fly-tippers seven days written warning before carrying out an inspection - to be closed as part of a pre-Christmas crackdown. Martin Tett, environment spokesman for the Local Government Association, said: ""Councils are taking a zero-tolerance approach to fly-tipping and this means using every power at their disposal - including seizing and destroying vehicles used by the dumpers. ""At a time when councils face difficult choices about services in light of reducing budgets, they are having to spend a vast amount each year on tackling litter and fly-tipping. ""This is money that would be better spent on vital services such as filling potholes and caring for the elderly."" Mr Tett said councils should be able to give hard-hitting fines for more serious offences, and should be able to recoup all prosecution costs in fly-tipping cases."

""There is no truth to the story that there could be a split between the Prince of Wales and I over my daughters' participation as member of the Royal Family and any continued speculation is pointless."" According to reports, Andrew, 56, fears that any children the princesses may have will be ""commoners"", prompting efforts to improve their status by persuading the Queen and heir to the throne Charles to let their future husbands have earldoms.

She said: ""Both the Duke and myself, we could not be more proud of this moment because these are two girls that work so hard in their own careers, have taken time off today to spread the word of teen cancer, which is so important, and then go back to work.

The Washington Post on Friday, citing an official, reported that individuals with connections to Moscow provided website WikiLeaks with emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chief and others. Those emails were steadily released through WikiLeaks in the months before the election and damaged Mrs Clinton's campaign. The newspaper reported that the aim was to help Mr Trump win, not just to undermine the US election process. The official was quoted as saying: ""It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal here was to favour one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected."" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied links with Russia's government. White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said Mr Obama had called for the cyberattack review this week to ensure ""the integrity of our elections"". He said: ""This report will dig into this pattern of malicious cyberactivity timed to our elections, take stock of our defensive capabilities and capture lessons learned to make sure that we brief members of Congress and stakeholders as appropriate."" The US President wants the report to be completed by his term ends on 20 January. The Democratic party has put pressure on the White House to reveal details of Russian hacking in the election. On 7 October - a month before the election - the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence announced that ""the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organisations"".

""The desire to win medals superseded their collective moral and ethical compass and Olympic values of fair play."" His investigation has found more than 1,000 Russian athletes have benefited from a systematic, state-sponsored doping cover-up across 30 sports. These athletes include 78 whose positive tests were covered up at the London Olympics, the report said. Fifteen of them were medallists at the Games.  No Russian athlete tested positive for a prohibited substance at the time. ""The [Russian] ministry of sport was working to discipline athletes in advance of the London Games into taking the cocktail of steroids ... in order to beat the detection thresholds at the London lab,"" Prof McLaren said. He said the state-sponsored corruption involved ""the ongoing use of prohibited substances, washout testing and false reporting"". As well as at the London Games, the investigation found positive tests were covered up at Sochi 2014 and the 2013 World Athletics Championships. Prof McLaren, a Canadian sports lawyer, said: ""We are now able to confirm a cover-up that dates back until at least 2011 and continued after the Sochi Olympic Games. ""It was a cover-up that evolved from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalised and disciplined medal-winning conspiracy."" He said the Russians had ""hijacked"" international sports competitions ""for years"". ""Sports fans and spectators have been deceived and it is time that this stops,"" he said. UK Anti-Doping said Prof McLaren's report was ""hugely significant"" and highlight how ""anti-doping is woefully underfunded"". ""WADA needs support and the ability to apply the right sanctions so that this type of situation cannot happen again,"" it said."
2016-12-10,Boris Johnson has called for deeper ties to Gulf nations and said Brexit could lead to free trade deals with them as he sought to move past his earlier criticism of Saudi Arabia.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161210172221/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-charms-the-gulf-after-proxy-wars-rebuke-10690109,"The Foreign Secretary was speaking during a tour of the Gulf just days after footage showed him accusing Saudi Arabia, a key UK ally, and Iran of ""puppeteering"" and stoking ""proxy wars"" across the Middle East. The comments drew a humiliating rebuke from Number 10, which said they did not reflect the Government's view. In a speech in Bahrain, Mr Johnson did not directly address the controversy, but said Britain's decision to leave the European Union would open fresh opportunities. ""We'll still be there to stick up for our friends and partners in the Gulf,"" he said. ""But now for the first time since the 1970s we will additionally be able to do free trade deals and we'll be able to build on the extraordinary commercial relationships that already exist between the UK and the Gulf."" :: When do Boris Johnson's 'gaffes' become a liability? Mr Johnson did his best to charm the audience in a typically colourful speech, often triggering laughter among the guests and at one point calling London the ""eighth Emirate"". In his address at the Manama Dialogue, a security conference, he talked about the UK's historic ties with the region. ""Any crisis in the Gulf is a crisis for Britain from day one. Your security is our security,"" he said, adding that £3bn will be spent on military commitments in the Gulf over the next 10 years. ""That's deepening a partnership that is stronger than with any other group of nations in the world outside NATO,"" he said. Mr Johnson also said he supports the Iran nuclear deal, though he stressed the need to remain ""clear-eyed and vigilant."" Speaking on the eve of a visit to Saudi Arabia, he did raise the conflict in Yemen, where Riyadh is supporting the internationally recognised government against Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Mr Johnson said Saudi Arabia is ""securing itself from bombardment by the Houthis"". ""But I must also share my profound concerns, which I'm sure is universal in this room, about the present suffering of the people of Yemen,"" he added, saying that ""force alone will not bring about a stable Yemen"". Saudi Arabia is the UK weapons industry's largest customer, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in a speech later will accuse the Prime Minister of sacrificing ""human rights on the altar of the arms trade""."

The idea is that shoppers pick up groceries in-store and pay via a smartphone app. It will use technology that automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to shelves, allowing customers with the app to walk out of the store without queuing or scanning their items. Payments would be made via Amazon accounts. The company is yet to confirm any plans to expand the project beyond the United States but the concept chimes with a recent warning from the governor of the Bank of England on the threat to jobs posed by technology. The UK retail sector employs almost three million people, though the effects of the fourth industrial revolution, as some see the shift, applies to many areas of the economy. While robotic technology and machinery have replaced humans in a number of sectors from car manufacturing to sorting post, the outsourcing firm Capita said on Thursday, after issuing a profits warning, that it intended to replace 2,000 staff with ""robotic solutions"". Amazon already has a presence in the British grocery market through a wholesale deal with Morrisons. Amazon Go is less likely to compete with online delivery but will challenge the shopping experience in physical stores. Nicla Di Palma, an equity analyst at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said of the concept: ""I would say that it is even more likely to work in the UK than in the US. ""For example, one of the reasons why Fresh & Easy - Tesco's business in the US - did not succeed was that they were focusing on self-checkout, whilst the American consumer likes service."""

Some of her colleagues were moved to tears as she said: ""I'm not a victim - I'm a survivor"". Her speech was part of a debate on the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. On Friday she said that she had been ""humbled by the responses and support"". On Twitter, she mentioned that she had received a ""rapid response"" from Police Scotland after making contact with them. Police did not comment on the message. But it is understood officers will approach someone who publicly says they have been the victim of an offence to see if they want to take matters further. Humbled by the responses and support. Thanks also to @policescotland for their rapid response and with whom I have made contact Mrs Thomson told Sky News on Friday that she had been inspired to speak about her experience because her role was more than ""just about politics and giving a particular political view"". She said: ""There's a much bigger perspective which is trying to make sure voices of other people are heard as well and get a much greater resonance. ""If we look at the statistics, one in three women worldwide are subjected to physical or sexual abuse. ""Around three million every year in the UK are subjected to physical or sexual abuse and one woman is killed roughly every three days on average in the UK at the hands of a man. ""These are appalling statistics and I really think the urgency and the resonance really needs to be increased. ""I thought if I could tell my story and make it real and give it that resonance and, if that helped other women to speak up or get help or indeed stop it happening, that would be a fantastic thing to do."" She added: ""I was terrified beforehand, I really, really was very nervous, for about three hours my hands were sweating and my heart was racing. ""But when I got up to speak, I almost forgot everybody else was there. I was just speaking and telling my story."" She told Sky News that she had talked to her husband about the experience before they got married. She had also told her adult son and daughter ""when they were old enough to cope with it and understand it as well"". She had also told them about what she planned to say in Parliament on Thursday. ""My daughter was fantastic, she said: 'you go, girl' to me and I was really pleased with that,"" the MP said.  ""My son was also so supportive. ""They understood immediately what I was trying to do and why I was trying to do it."""

Badminton is the only sport that got a medal at this summer's Games to lose out in the next funding cycle.  Rowing will get the most cash - £32.1m - to help its 100-strong team. That is just over £500,000 down on what it received to prepare for this summer's games in Brazil. Cycling, which has reliably supplied a gold rush of medals, gets just under £26m - the fourth-largest award. However, that is £5m down on last time. In second place with £27.1m is athletics, then sailing with £26.2m. Swimming, another of Team GB's summer successes with gold from Adam Peaty among others, gets a healthy £21.7m.  Gymnastics - where Max Whitlock bagged a brace of golds - benefits from a £2m increase and will get £16.6m in total. The total cash pot for the Tokyo cycle, which runs for four years from 2017, is over £265m for 808 athletes. That compares with £274m for Rio. There is some flexibility in the funding in case competitors in new Olympic sports, such as climbing, start to show medal potential. Gail Emms, who won badminton silver at Athens 2004 with partner Nathan Robertson, said she was shocked the sport had been ditched after Britain bagged a medal in Rio. ""My initial reaction is, 'hang on a sec, we've won an Olympic medal' - you'd think that if you go out there and win anOlympic medal it guarantees some funding. ""I think badminton deserves some explanation and I'm sure they will appeal against the decision,"" said Emms. ""We're not asking for 27 or 30 million like some sports.  ""We not asking for anything near that and if I was one of those guys who went out there and came back with a medal, I'd be fuming."" UK Sport CEO Liz Nicholl said the organisation would help the sports that are losing out as they make the transition to non-funding status."

Dozens of people were also injured in the collapse in the southern city of Uyo in Akwa Ibom state. The Reigners Bible Church International was reportedly still under construction when it was being used for a ceremony to ordain church founder Akan Weeks as a bishop. Witnesses said hundreds of people were inside when metal girders crashed and the corrugated iron roof caved in. Udom Emmanuel, governor of Akwa Ibom, was attending the service at the time. He and Mr Weeks escaped unhurt. Mr Emmanuel said: ""It's not a good thing. We are really, really devastated that this could happen. ""But at the same time, I pray that people should be calm and let's at least say that the situation, let's see the casualities that we have and then be rest assured on the part of government we will do everything possible to make sure that this will never happen again in this state."" Governor spokesman Ekerete Udoh said the state government will hold an inquiry to investigate if building standards were compromised. Buildings collapse regularly in Nigeria because of endemic corruption with contractors using sub-standard materials and bribing inspectors to ignore shoddy work or a lack of building permits.

He added that ""the most recent, relating to my daughters, requires correction to terminate further speculation and innuendo"". The Duke said that suggestions he had asked for future husbands of Princesses Beatrice, 28, and Eugenie, 26, to have titles were ""a complete fabrication"". ""There is no truth to the story that there could be a split between the Prince of Wales and I over my daughters' participation as member of the Royal Family and any continued speculation is pointless."" According to reports, Andrew, 56, fears that any children the princesses may have will be ""commoners"", prompting efforts to improve their status by persuading the Queen and heir to the throne Charles to let their future husbands have earldoms. But the Duke said he only wished for his daughters to ""be modern working young women, who happen to be members of the Royal Family"". He added: ""Whilst I appreciate, as granddaughters of The Queen, there is considerable interest in my daughters, I cannot continue to stand by and have the media speculate on their futures based on my purported interventions, which are completely made up and an invention.""

2016-12-11,Revered critic AA Gill described in his final article how the NHS was unable to give him potentially life-extending cancer treatment.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161211171744/http://news.sky.com/story/aa-gills-last-article-reveals-life-extending-drug-was-too-expensive-10692057,"But he praised the service saying it triumphed on a human level where private health care does not. The Sunday Times columnist died on Saturday aged 62 just three weeks after revealing he had the ""full English of cancers"". Gill wrote that he had been denied expensive therapy that costs up to £100,000 a year which could have helped him live ""considerably"" longer. The writer, a former smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer that had spread to his neck and pancreas with tumours that were inoperable and unsuitable for radiotherapy. He described how a consultant oncologist told him that a pioneering new treatment for cancer, immunotherapy, would give him his best chance at fighting the disease, but it was not available on the NHS. ""The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the quango that acts as the quartermaster for the health service, won't pay,"" he wrote. Gill was told the treatment would be ""particularly successful"" with his kind of cancer, but told his wife Nicola Formby: ""If he had insurance, I'd put him on immunotherapy - specifically, nivolumab. As would every oncologist in the First World. But I can't do it on the National Health."" Gill said that the prohibitive cost of nivolumab was £60,000 to £100,000, around four times the cost of chemotherapy. He added: ""As yet, immunotherapy isn't a cure, it's a stretch more life, a considerable bit of life. More life with your kids, more life with your friends, more life holding hands, more life shared, more life spent on earth - but only if you can pay."" The father of four previously said he wanted to have his treatment on the NHS due to a sense of ""human connection"" but highlighted the health service's performance in international oncology rankings. He wrote: ""It was the first question I asked my oncologist, Dr Conrad Lewanski. 'Why is this such a bad place to get cancer, when we have lots of hospitals, when we teach doctors from all over the world, when we've won more Nobel prizes than the French?' 'It's the nature of the health service,' he says."" Gill, who was married to current Home Secretary Amber Rudd in the 1990s, eventually underwent a course of platinum chemotherapy at Charing Cross Hospital in London. Gill ended the article, with a conversation he had with a cancer nurse. ""(She said) 'You're supposed to be with me down in chemotherapy. I saw your name. Why are you up here?',"" he wrote. ""'Well, it turns out the chemo isn't working'. Her shoulders sag and her hand goes to her head. 'F***, f***, that's dreadful.' I think she might be crying. ""I look away, so might I.

2016-12-11,"It looks like a prison and in some ways, that is exactly what it has become.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161211171744/http://news.sky.com/story/how-russia-is-engaged-in-a-battle-for-its-own-history-10691897,"Just a few kilometres from the Kremlin, down on Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Street, lies a squat-looking complex that holds the State Archive. Inside an austere 10-storey corner-block, you will find a multitude of documents relating to the Russian revolution, the administration of the Soviet Union in Russia and the activities of the police. For the not inconsiderable sum of 10,000 roubles (£120), Sky News was given permission to film inside and we were surprised when one staff member told us that Russia's security police the FSB had recently been to visit. They were unhappy with the general set-up revealed the archivist. ""They said it was too easy to access some of the documents. In the past, relations of people killed (during the Soviet period) could read files about their loved ones. Now those documents are being summarised for them instead,"" he said. The FSB's trip to Bolshaya Pirogovskaya is just the latest sortie in the battle for Russian history - a fight for the collective memory waged by the government on one side and a small number of academics, civil society organisations, officials and victim's relatives on the other. It is thought that as many as 50 to 60 million people suffered from the political purges, expulsions, massacres and manufactured famines between 1917 and 1956. Repressive acts authorised by Joseph Stalin - the diminutive, club-footed Georgian who led the country for much of that period - may represent the largest yet most poorly understood crimes of the 20th century. Poorly understood because human rights groups like Memorial are finding it increasingly difficult to find out what is held in the national archives. ""Everything is starting to move backwards now,"" said Memorial co-chair Yan Rachinsky. ""Documents belonging to the FSB and MVD (Soviet Interior Ministry police) are very difficult to get hold of because the government has extended the period that they will remain top-secret. It's difficult because we don't even know what these documents are about."" One set of documents that have been made public detail a 1948 investigation into Panfilov's 28. Just about everyone in Russia knows how 28 soldiers under General Panfilov's command made a heroic last stand against a column of German tanks in November of 1941. Yet the military judge who conducted the inquiry found that a group of war-time journalists made the story up. There was a battle in the area, but not the way the men from the Red Army's newspaper said it happened. The documents were published online by the head of the state archive, Sergei Mironenko - an act for which he was later fired. What is more, Mr Mironenko's boss (Andrey Artizov) was dragged on national television in April and told by President Putin that the national archive would now come under his direct control. Under Mr Putin, Russia's role in defeating Nazi Germany in what is known here as the Great Patriotic War has become a central part of Russian identity.  ""Putin says we should be proud of our history and the things that followed are influenced by that idea,"" said Mr Rachinsky. ""But I think we should admit history as it was and try not to make it look better than it was."" There is a price to pay for those who dispute the official narrative. We met Vladimir Luzgin, an auto-body painter from the Russian city of Perm, thousands of miles from home in Prague. He has decided to seek political asylum in the Czech capital after he was prosecuted and fined for reposting an article detailing how Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union carved up Poland at the beginning of the Second World War. The state prosecutor said Mr Luzgin had distributed ""knowingly false information"" - and the judge agreed, making him the first person in Russia to be convicted under a new law prohibiting the ""rehabilitation of Nazism"".  Mr Luzgin, who says the FSB raided his flat looking for evidence, has refused to pay the 200,000 rouble (£2,500) fine. He said: ""It's natural that I don't accept my guilt because it's a fact that Germany attacked Poland and it's a fact that a little later Soviet troops entered Poland. ""I was sentenced for stating a historical fact. How can I proven guilty?"" His conviction is part of a pattern say critics, a wide-ranging assault on Russia's historical memory.  The facts are out there, in the hands of victims' relatives and on the shelves of the State Archive's 10-storey tower, but many worry they will never see the light of day."

As Mr Corbyn started his speech, Mr Tatchell and other protesters lined up in front of the stage and held up placards demanding immediate air drops in the war-ravaged country. He likened the current situation in the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo to the infamous bombing of a town during the Spanish Civil War, in which civilians were deliberately targeted from the air by fascist planes. Mr Tatchell said: ""What is happening in Aleppo is a modern day Guernica. ""We haven't heard the leader of the Labour Party speak out enough to demand UK air drops to besieged civilians who are dying in their thousands."" The protest came as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson travelled to Paris for international talks on the crisis. :: Syrian regime accused of chemical attack in Aleppo Mr Tatchell has previously criticised Mr Corbyn for not being vocal enough against Russia, which is backing the brutal regime of Syrian leader Bashar al Assad. He has also attacked the Stop the War coalition, previously headed by Mr Corbyn, for opposing Western military action while failing to protest against the Syrian regime. Mr Corbyn was on stage with a number of his frontbench team, including shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, at the time of the demonstration. Apparently forgetting they were still wearing microphones, Lady Chakrabarti advised the Labour leader ""just let them do this"". Mr Corbyn then consulted Ms Thornberry, asking her: ""When did we condemn the bombing?"" He later told the meeting: ""Just to be absolutely clear in response to the point that Peter made, Emily Thornberry, on our behalf, during Foreign Office questions and on many other occasions, has made it absolutely clear that we do think there should be aid given to people in Aleppo, we do think the bombing should end, we do think there should be a ceasefire, we do think there should be a political solution, we do think that the war should end in Syria."" Speaking to Sky News after the demonstration, Mr Tatchell said: ""Today's protest was a last desperate measure because Labour is not listening to the appeals from Syrian civil rights activists. ""They want the UK to do aid drops, humanitarian aid drops, of food and medicine to besieged civilians. ""We haven't had the Labour Party propose any specific proposals about bringing a measure, a proposal to Parliament, to make that happen. ""Of course, Labour has said it supports the principle of aid drops but it is not actually doing anything to get a vote in Parliament to make sure that they happen."""

The cost of clearing up fly-tipping is almost £50m across England, with the number of recorded incidents rising 6% in 2014/15 to 900,000 cases. The power to seize and destroy a vehicle, trailer or mobile plant and their contents if it was suspected of being used in a waste crime was brought in last year. Councils can also issue on-the-spot fines, or fixed penalty notices, of up to £400 for smaller scale offences. Local authorities are calling for a legal loophole - in which enforcement officers have to give some fly-tippers seven days written warning before carrying out an inspection - to be closed as part of a pre-Christmas crackdown. Martin Tett, environment spokesman for the Local Government Association, said: ""Councils are taking a zero-tolerance approach to fly-tipping and this means using every power at their disposal - including seizing and destroying vehicles used by the dumpers. ""At a time when councils face difficult choices about services in light of reducing budgets, they are having to spend a vast amount each year on tackling litter and fly-tipping. ""This is money that would be better spent on vital services such as filling potholes and caring for the elderly."" Mr Tett said councils should be able to give hard-hitting fines for more serious offences, and should be able to recoup all prosecution costs in fly-tipping cases."

Most of what Boris Johnson said in his latest alleged 'gaffe' is not that controversial. It is the reaction from Downing Street that makes this a much stronger story. The Prime Minister has distanced herself from her own Foreign Secretary. ""These are the Foreign Secretary's views,"" said her spokesman. ""They are not the Government's views on Saudi Arabia and its role in the region."" :: Boris Johnson's criticism of UK ally Saudi Arabia slapped down by PM When a Foreign Secretary cannot be relied upon to get things right about one of the country's closest strategic allies, he becomes a liability to a Prime Minister - and the media starts to wonder if his future is in doubt. ""There are politicians who are twisting and abusing religion and different strains of the same religion in order to further their own political objectives,"" said Mr Johnson. He does not specify Saudi Arabia in this respect or any other country, but is speaking more generically. The claim is uncontroversial. Religion is used and abused for political ends by politicians across the Middle East. It is a fact of life in the region. ""There are not enough big characters, big people, men or women, who are willing to reach out beyond their Sunni or Shia or whatever group to the other side and bring people together and to develop a national story again."" Another fair point. Where are the Begins, Sadats, Rabins of today? Even if the turmoil of the region post-Iraq War and Arab Spring is hardly conducive to charismatic peacemakers rising to the leadership roles. ""That's why you've got the Saudis, Iran, everybody, moving in, and puppeteering and playing proxy wars."" This is more controversial. It is not the official position of the British Government to brand its closest strategic ally in the region, Saudi Arabia, a puppetmaster, nor Syria's rebels puppets. Defending the Foreign Secretary, Foreign Office sources pointed out this was not an official policy speech but off-the-cuff remarks as part of a panel discussion about migration. Others defending the Foreign Secretary will say that it is about time the UK spoke some home truths about its Middle Eastern partners and asked what decades of softly-softly diplomacy have actually achieved. But if Boris Johnson is deliberately embarking on a new blunter kind of diplomacy he needs to be consistent with the rest of the Government. :: Boris Johnson's 'gaffes' as Foreign Secretary so far... His comments come while his boss, Theresa May, has been in the Gulf assiduously courting its leaders, including dining with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and neighbours. Branding them puppetmasters is not on the message. The Prime Minister has already distanced herself from her own Foreign Secretary on his comments. Given that backdrop, the Foreign Secretary's comments seem clumsy and ham-fisted even if there are plenty of people who will say they are simply spelling out the obvious. When Mrs May appointed Mr Johnson as her chief diplomat she was presumably not expecting a quiet life on the diplomatic front. But she will know the press is beginning to smell blood on the trail of Mr Johnson. His transition from newspaper columnist to diplomat has been littered with alleged missteps. This means his every word is scrutinised, and borderline contentious comments become blown up into headlines about yet another 'gaffe'. Mr Johnson has always had an uncanny ability to deflect controversy and scrutiny, but even he will know that a gaffe-prone politician is a liability to any government, and a gaffe-prone Foreign Secretary can be a liability to national interests. That is far more serious."

She had previous met with Ms Morgan and fellow Conservative Alistair Burt and invited them to meet Mrs May about their views on Brexit next week. But text messages obtained by the Mail on Sunday show Ms Hill texted Mr Burt and told him ""don't bring that woman to No 10 again"". Ms Morgan found out about the message, and according to the newspaper replied: ""If you don't like something I have said or done, please tell me directly. ""No man brings me to any meeting. Your team invites me. If you don't want my views in future meetings you need to tell them."" :: Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill: The team shaping Theresa May's reign Ms Hill, thought to have been referring to a previous meeting the two attended together, replied: ""Well, he just did. So there!"" It comes after the PM insisted she was not out of touch because of her choice to wear expensive clothing. Speaking during a trip to Bahrain, she said: ""Look, I stood on the steps of Downing Street and said what I did about the importance of a country that works for everyone because that is what I have heard from people as I have gone around the country, as I have met people in a whole variety of circumstances. ""I believe it is important for politicians to get out and about and that's exactly what I continue to do. ""It is important that we have a country that works for everyone.""

His expected appointment comes after former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani formally withdrew from consideration for the job. Ex-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in the 2012 election, is also said to have been among those in the running. Mr Tillerson, 64, has been chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil since 2006 and he is set to retire from the company next year. Mr Trump's spokesman Jason Millerin said there would be no official announcements on the Secretary of State job until next week at the earliest. Should Mr Tillerson be nominated, his business ties will come under scrutiny. Exxon Mobil operates in more than 50 countries and explores for oil and natural gas on six continents. In 2011, his company signed a deal with Rosneft, Russia's largest state-owned oil company, for joint oil exploration and production. Since then, the companies have formed 10 joint ventures for projects in Russia. In 2013, President Vladimir Putin awarded Mr Tillerson his country's Order of Friendship. The oil chief has been a vocal critic of US sanctions against Moscow after Russia's 2014 incursion into Crimea. Following the incursion, Exxon Mobil was forced to scrap some projects and it suffered at least $1bn (£800m) in losses. Mr Trump has spoken of wanting closer relations with Moscow, which has sparked concerns in Congress he could lift or loosen some Russian sanctions. Climate change could be another divisive issue if Mr Tillerson is nominated. The company is under investigation by the New York Attorney General's office for allegedly misleading investors, regulators and the public on what it knew about global warming."

""I apologise. I'm sorry, I'm so nervous,"" she said, asking the orchestra to start again, as the audience comforted her with applause. Dylan, 75, is the first songwriter to be awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature for creating ""new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"". The singer had declined an invitation to attend the event and sent a thank you speech to be read out instead. According to the Nobel Foundation, his prize should be presented to him in person sometime in 2017, either in Sweden or abroad. Meanwhile, Colombia's president has collected the Nobel Peace Prize for reaching a deal with Marxist rebels to end the country's civil war. Juan Manuel Santos said his award gave a boost to the ""impossible dream"" of halting the 52-year-old conflict in which 220,000 people died. The leader called the prize a ""gift from heaven"" as he dedicated it to all Colombians - those killed but also the eight million displaced, and he said the accord was a ""ray of hope"" for solving conflicts from Syria to South Sudan. Speaking at a ceremony in Oslo's City Hall, Mr Santos said: ""With this agreement, we can say that the American continent from Alaska to Patagonia is a land in peace."" He reached a deal with rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, earlier this year, but the accord was narrowly rejected by voters in a 2 October referendum, days before the Peace Prize announcement. Then the government and FARC signed a new peace accord on 24 November. It was approved by Congress, but controversially without a referendum demanded by a major opposition party. The Nobel Committee praised Mr Santos as ""a driving force"" behind the agreement. He collected a gold medal, diploma and a cheque for 8m Swedish crowns (£690,000)."

Mr Burnham argued it was a tightening of the rules that people voted for on 23 June as he highlighted the ""negative effects"" of the policy, including the downward pressure on wages and impact on services. However, his stance puts him at odds with members of his party's own front bench. :: Brexit deal needs MPs' backing, says senior Tory Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has stressed the importance of the economy during Brexit negotiations and argued freedom of movement was ""inextricably linked"" with access to the single market. Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan programme, Mr Burnham said: ""I think what's got to happen is people have got to go back to what people voted for. ""Here in Greater Manchester people quite clearly voted for a change to the current freedom of movement rules. ""That is the starting point it seems to me in this debate."" He said people in the area he was seeking to represent did not vote on the single market. He added: ""I believe we have got to have a system that is more linked to people coming to fill a specific job in the labour market rather than speculative free movement."" :: Brexit battle - The main arguments from court Mr Burnham argued the latter had caused some ""quite difficult challenges"" in Greater Manchester. He said: ""We need a system that affords greater control that allows us to bring people to work here come and contribute to our economy and our society, but also deal with the negative effects of full free movement, which has seen downward pressure on wages, but also pressure on primary schools, GP services."" But responding to his comments, Mr Clarke likened the Labour politician to the former UKIP leader, as he insisted Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson remained pro-immigration. Mr Clarke told Sky News: ""I would point out, unlike Andy going on about free movement of labour and sounding a bit like a paler version of Nigel Farage, Boris has never been anti-immigrant."" On BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Abbott said: ""We believe in regional autonomy and Andy (Burnham) has always had those views. ""But the truth is you cannot have access to the single market without a measure of freedom of movement. ""My experiences of Labour Party members all over the country want immigration rules that are fair and they want reasonable management of migration."" She added that it ""would be wrong to put the economy anything other than first"" as part of Brexit talks."

Independent directors of Sky - which is Europe's biggest pay television broadcaster with 21 million subscribers in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria - have agreed to recommend the offer to shareholders other than 21st Century Fox.  However, the company said that ""certain material terms"" remained under discussion and that there could be no certainty that an offer would be made by 21st Century Fox. The announcement follows a rise in Sky's share price earlier today.  Shares of Sky closed up 210.5p at 1000p - a 26.7% rise on the day. The offer price recommends a premium of 36% to Sky's closing share price on Thursday evening. Sky said it had formed an independent committee of its board to consider the American giant's proposal.  Members include Martin Gilbert, the company's senior independent director, and Jeremy Darroch, the chief executive of Sky.  Mr Gilbert is founder and chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the UK's biggest fund management firms, and a respected City grandee.  Others on the committee include Andrew Griffith, Sky's chief operating officer and chief financial officer, and Andrew Sukawaty, another non-executive director of Sky and previously chief executive of European satellite operator Inmarsat.  James Murdoch, Sky's chairman, is not on the committee because he is chief executive of 21st Century Fox. The deal is likely to ignite a huge amount of debate in the UK media industry. News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media giant, tabled an £8bn takeover bid in June 2010 for the shares in Sky - then called British Sky Broadcasting - that it did not already own.  That deal attracted a good deal of scrutiny because it would have brought together Sky News with News Corporation's UK media assets, including The Sun, Britain's biggest-selling daily newspaper, The Times, The Sunday Times and the News of the World.  This attracted criticism from rivals of those newspapers about a concentration of media ownership and, in response to regulatory concerns, BSkyB agreed to hive off Sky News as a separate company.  However, in July 2011, News Corporation abandoned its offer when it emerged that the News of the World had hacked the mobile phone of murder victim Amanda 'Milly' Dowler.  News Corporation subsequently demerged its film and television assets outside Australia into a new company, 21st Century Fox, leaving it as a business focussed on newspaper titles from around the world - apart from the UK titles like The Sun and The Times it also owns the Wall Street Journal, the Australian and the New York Post - and the book publisher Harper Collins.  There are likely to be fewer concerns from rivals of either Sky or the UK newspaper businesses owned by News Corporation about a concentration of the news market. Sky traces its origins to Sky Television - which was launched by Rupert Murdoch in February 1989.  The business merged with rival satellite broadcaster British Satellite Broadcasting in November 1990 and it floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1994 in a move that saw News Corporation's stake reduced to 40%.  However, it retained close ties with News Corporation and 21st Century Fox that, two years ago, saw Sky buy the American company's interests in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to become a pan-European broadcaster. In an email to Sky's near-30,000 employees, Mr Darroch said the offer was ""the first step in what will now be a formal process over the coming weeks"". He added: ""As you know, 21st Century Fox were the founders of our business and have always been an extremely supportive shareholder and backer of Sky. Many of us have worked closely with them over the years and know them very well."" Because 21st Century Fox already owns some 39.1% of Sky, buying full control of the company would cost it an estimated £11.25bn.  Speculation has mounted about a possible deal in recent months due to the fall in the pound against the US dollar - reducing the value of Sky, whose shares are quoted in sterling, in dollar terms."

Andrew Wallis, from the Bristol-based charity Unseen, told Sky News: ""The potential is that every victim found in this country would have to apply to stay here and that would put a terrible burden on the asylum process. ""It could also mean the situation for victims that are identified is worse and that they're offered less support, especially in terms of compensation payments."" It is estimated there are around 13,000 victims of modern slavery in the UK. One of those was Monika Patricna, who was trafficked from the Czech Republic and forced into prostitution in Bristol. Speaking exclusively to Sky News Ms Patricna, 28, said: ""There were 60 or 70 men that came to the house per day. ""We woke up in the morning and had to be ready for customers because we were working 24/7. ""We didn't sleep. ""They woke us up in the middle of the night. ""We would have 30 minutes' sleep and then we would have to be ready again."" It has taken Avon and Somerset Police five years to bring Ms Patricna's traffickers to justice and last week the three gang members were sentenced to a total of 25 years in prison. Ms Patricna had been promised a better life in the UK but had no idea that she would be working in the sex industry. She was even sold off as part of a sham marriage, which she served time in prison for. She said: ""I couldn't leave the traffickers because I didn't have any money, I couldn't speak any English at the time and I didn't have anyone… I was alone and I didn't know what to do."" Safe houses, run by the charities Hestia and the Salvation Army, help many people get their lives back on track. There are 30 properties up and down the country, for men, women and families, that offer legal advice and counselling. Earlier this year, the Prime Minister announced a crackdown on those who benefit from modern slavery, promising a £33m investment. The Government said it has taken world-leading action to tackle the issue, but admits there is always more that can be done."

He aims to bring an action in the Irish High Court in which he hopes to establish whether an Article 50 notification sent by the UK to Brussels could be overturned at a future date. He is taking on the Irish government, the European Council and the European Commission and he is hoping UK MEPs who want the UK to remain in the EU will spearhead his legal action. :: 'Child could see flaws in Government Brexit case' The move follows the four-day hearing in the UK Supreme Court on an appeal by the UK Government against a High Court ruling demanding more Article 50 scrutiny by Parliament. Mr Maugham, who wants another EU referendum because he claims many people who voted Leave now regret doing so, claims Article 50 may, in fact, already have been triggered. He says if it has been triggered then the Commission is in breach of its treaty duties through wrongly refusing to commence negotiations with the UK.  But if not, he says the European Council and Irish government are in breach of their treaty duties in wrongly excluding the United Kingdom from European Council meetings. ""Put aside the legal niceties, what no one can dispute is that there are incredibly important questions to answer,"" said Mr Maugham. ""Should Parliament control the terms on which we Brexit? Could we have a referendum on the final deal - or is the consequence of triggering Article 50 that we will leave the EU whatever the terms? ""By triggering Article 50, does the UK also leave the European Economic Area, or is there a separate decision to make about whether we remain in the EEA and Single Market? ""Everyone - those who voted Leave and Remain; the people and Government of Ireland - deserves to know the answer to these questions.  ""People must plan their lives. Businesses need certainty to invest. The people of Ireland are entitled to a government that can work for the best possible future for Ireland. ""It's right that we all have the maximum certainty that the law can give. And referring these questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union is the only way to deliver that certainty.""

Findings showed young offenders in public sector institutions were only receiving on average 17 hours of education every week compared to the expected 30 hours. The plans are part of the Government's response to a review by child behavioural expert Charlie Taylor, which will be published on Monday. Justice Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Prisons rightly punish people who break the law, but they should also be a place where offenders are reformed. ""While young people are in custody we need to make sure they get the right education and training so they can lead law-abiding lives - and, in turn, make our streets and communities safer too."" The measures which she will set out later today will mark ""the beginning of a series of reforms which will help us cut reoffending, make our communities safer and create a justice system that works for everyone"". Mr Taylor's report said around 40% of those detained in under-18 Youth Offender Institutions have not been to school since they were 14, while nearly nine out of 10 have been excluded from school at some point. He welcomed the plan, saying: ""Education needs to be central to our response to youth offending. It is the building block on which a life free from crime can be constructed."" ""If children who offend are to become successful and law-abiding adults, the focus must be on improving their welfare, health and education - their life prospects - rather than simply imposing punishment,"" he added."
2016-12-11,Personal statements on private matters have traditionally been a no no from the royal family.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161211171744/http://news.sky.com/story/is-prince-andrews-defiant-statement-part-of-a-new-royal-media-strategy-10689751,"In the face of headlines about family matters, their motto has usually been ""never complain, never explain"", followed up by a quick ""no comment"" from their press secretaries. But it appears something may have changed in the House of Windsor, with Prince Andrew the latest member of the family to speak out about press reports with a personally signed statement on his Twitter feed. This is a father sticking up for his daughters, fed up of newspapers questioning their role within the Royal Family and their job prospects. He says reports that he's being a pushy Dad, demanding their future husbands are made Earls, are a complete fabrication. While suggestions that he's fallen out with big brother Prince Charles, over whether Beatrice and Eugenie can become full time royals, are without truth. He's of course not the first Windsor male to stick up for his loved ones in the past month. Only a few weeks ago there was the angry statement sent out on behalf of Prince Harry, complaining that his new girlfriend Meghan Markle was being harassed. So is this a new type of media strategy? More likely, it's a sign of how a new generation of royals are no longer afraid to speak from the heart if they think it will confront what they see as hurtful, unjust and unfair. What does the Queen think about it all? I suspect that's a statement we won't be seeing anytime soon."
2016-12-11,Crewe director of football Dario Gradi has been suspended by the FA as part of its wider review into historical allegations in football. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161211171744/http://news.sky.com/story/fa-suspends-crewe-director-of-football-dario-gradi-over-abuse-cover-up-claims-10692287,"The former Crewe manager released a statement last month insisting he was unaware of the alleged sex abuse that took place at the club. His response follows revelations by former player Andy Woodward that he was abused by Barry Bennell while at Crewe when he was aged between 11 and 15. Gradi, who has worked as a manager and academy manager during his 33 years at Crewe, said in a statement last month: ""I would like to express sympathy to the victims of Barry Bennell, not only at Crewe Alexandra, but at other clubs in the North West. ""The first I knew of Barry Bennell's crimes was when he was arrested in the United States in 1994. I knew nothing of his crimes before this time when he was employed by us."" Sky News spoke to Gradi at his home on Sunday. He refused to explain why he had been suspended by the FA. The FA have not commented on his suspension and claims he ""smoothed over"" a complaint of sexual assault against a Chelsea scout in the 1970s. It is understood the FA intends to question Gradi at a later stage. Bennell was jailed for nine years in 1998 after pleading guilty to committing sex offences."
2016-12-11,"Turkey has vowed vengeance for the victims of twin blasts outside a football stadium in Istanbul that killed 38 people, as Kurdish militants claimed responsibility.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161211171744/http://news.sky.com/story/turkey-vows-vengeance-after-deadly-explosions-in-istanbul-10692098,"A day after the two bombs, which appeared to be a co-ordinated attack on police, an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) said it was responsible. In a statement on its website, the group, called Kurdistan Freedom Hawks, or TAK, also said two of its militants were killed. As some of the victims were laid to rest, Turkey vowed to make the perpetrators pay.  ""Sooner or later, we will have our vengeance,"" said interior minister Suleyman Soylu, speaking at a funeral service at Istanbul police headquarters. ""This blood will not be left on the ground, no matter what the price, what the cost."" President Tayyip Erdogan called the attack on Saturday night ""the ugly face of terror"" and vowed to fight ""the curse of terrorism till the end"". In the first explosion, a car bomb was blown up outside the Vodafone Arena, home to the club Besiktas, after a football match. Less than a minute later, a suicide bomber hit in an adjacent park. Thirteen people have been arrested as officials started pointing to Kurdish militants soon after the attack. Most of the victims - 30 - were police officers, seven were civilians and one was yet to be identified, officials said. More than 150 were injured, and 136 people remained in hospital, including 14 under intensive care. Authorities have determined that about 300-400kg of explosives were used in the powerful blasts. The number of civilians killed was lower than feared as fans had already left the stadium after the game when the blasts occurred. The first explosion struck in an area where police special forces were located at the stadium exit. A riot police bus appears to have been the target, said Mr Soylu. The suicide bomber triggered the explosive after being stopped by police in the nearby Macka Park. Witnesses have described scenes of panic as the explosions rocked the area and shattered windows. ""It was like hell. The flames went all the way up to the sky,"" said Omer Yilmaz, who works as a cleaner at the nearby Dolmabahce Mosque, directly across the road from the stadium. ""People ducked under the tables, women began crying. Football fans drinking tea at the cafe sought shelter, it was horrible."" Sunday was a day of national mourning, with flags flying at half-mast across the nation and officials calling for a march against terrorism. Mr Erdogan, who cancelled a planned trip to Kazakhstan, described the blasts as a terrorist attack on police and civilians. He said the aim of the bombings, two hours after the end of a match attended by thousands of people, had been to cause maximum casualties. ""We have once again witnessed tonight in Istanbul the ugly face of terror, which tramples on every value and decency,"" he said. ""Nobody should doubt that with God's will, we as a country and a nation will overcome terror, terrorist organisations."" This year Istanbul has witnessed a spate of attacks attributed by authorities to the Islamic State group or claimed by Kurdish militants. A state of emergency is in force following a failed coup attempt on 15 July."

A student-led think-tank in Edinburgh concluded that the devices would boost satisfaction levels at the university and 84% of students backed the proposal. The think-tank's research director, Priyanka Radhakrishnan, told Sky News: ""The idea behind it is that sleep deprivation is one of the main causes of mental health problems. ""This is an initiative to tackle that problem, promoting the idea of napping and having students take around 40-minute breaks throughout the day to make sure their mental and physical wellbeing is on top point."" ""Nap pods"" are used in some American universities and by Google in London.  But there is disagreement over their effectiveness. Second year Edinburgh University student Verity Brown told Sky News she opposed the installation of the pods due to their appearance and cost.  She said: ""They look like… very claustrophobic coffins, cost £10,000 and the university wants four of them. ""The student to pod ratio being 28,000 to four, it doesn't make any sense to me. ""Most people are not going to be able to go in one in their student life, they are going to be in very high demand."" The first UK student ""nap pod"" was introduced by Manchester University in 2014.  Librarian Mark Fossey said that since installation it has been well-used. He said: ""The pod enables people to take time out, refresh and go back to their studies. ""It is really relaxing.  As soon as you shut the lid and the music surrounds you it's easy to just drift off… it's the sense of immersion and the soothing lighting.   ""It helps to block out everything else... you feel weightless."" However, one student in the library said: ""If you want a sleep you should go home and get a proper sleep.   ""The maximum amount of time you can spend in the pod is 20 minutes, it's not enough."""

The senior Tory MP also told the Murnaghan programme even if the Government lost its current Supreme Court appeal over starting the formal two-year Brexit process, it would be able to secure the majority at Westminster to trigger Article 50. :: Brexit battle - The main arguments from court And he cast doubt on the prospect of success of a fresh legal challenge by campaigners aimed at keeping the UK in the single market. But he warned the UK ""disentangling"" itself from the EU would be complicated. Mr Grieve, who campaigned for Remain, also insisted ""no one is trying to sabotage Brexit"" but argued the referendum result did not ""close down all debate forever"" on the UK's future relationship with Europe. He said: ""It's quite clear to me that we have to get on with the process of leaving he EU and having some fresh relationship with our EU partners but from outside the EU. ""That's the issue which is now going to dominate the politics in which we are involved and it's on that you are going to see the debates."" But he added: ""You can't just close down all debate forever. ""What I am not prepared to accept is that because there was referendum on the 23 June that somehow closes down debate for evermore about our relationship we are going to have with the EU and our EU partners."" ""But at the same time no one is trying to sabotage Brexit."" On any final deal reached with Brussels, Mr Grieve said: ""If at the end of the negotiating process there is a package to put before the country, it will certainly have to be put before Parliament. ""And there's at least an argument that it should be put before the public as well in a referendum, but that's something we are not going go come on to for some considerable time."""

2016-12-23,There was no sign of a Brexit-linked slowdown for the UK economy in the latest revisions to official growth figures.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161223172917/http://news.sky.com/story/economic-growth-for-third-quarter-revised-upwards-to-06-by-ons-10705755,"But while the Office for National Statistics (ONS) upwardly revised third quarter growth to 0.6% from 0.5% in its previous reading, it said the annual rate of growth eased to 2.2% because of other revisions. The latest data suggested that the economy's dependence on consumer spending was greater than first thought in the three months to September as it offset a markedly worse picture for trade. Net trade, the ONS said, acted as a drag of 1.2 percentage points in the quarter - its highest level in almost five years - though it said much of the revision was down to a recent correction in the miscalculation in the trade of gold. More recent figures have suggested exports are now just starting to benefit from the collapse in the value of the pound in the wake of the EU vote - a scenario which makes UK-priced goods cheaper for foreign buyers. Some experts had predicted the economy would suffer in the event of a Leave win in June's referendum but it has proved more resilient, largely because consumer spending has held strong. However, the Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in his Autumn Statement that tougher times lay ahead of the economy amid uncertainties over the terms of the divorce from the EU. It is expected to face a greater test in the coming months as inflation, at a two-year high, is predicted to climb further as imports become more expensive compared to a year earlier. Economists see a squeeze on household spending power as those rising costs become more likely to be passed on through new supply contracts. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said the latest economic figures suggested people were dipping in to savings to help fund big purchases now ahead of price hikes ahead. ""Despite the current resilience, 2017 is likely to be an increasingly difficult year for the UK economy. ""Indeed, we expect GDP growth to slow markedly to 1.3% in 2017 - as consumer fundamentals weaken markedly and uncertainty is heightened by the Government triggering Article 50 to formally start the UK's exit from the European Union."""
2016-12-23,"Almost 80% of people sleeping rough were attacked or suffered abuse over the past year, according to new figures.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161223172917/http://news.sky.com/story/three-quarters-of-rough-sleepers-subjected-to-abuse-or-attacks-report-finds-10705615,"Homelessness charity Crisis said around one in three rough sleepers it questioned in England and Wales reported they had been deliberately hit, kicked or been subjected to violence, while a similar number said they had things thrown at them. Almost half reported being intimidated or threatened with violence, six in 10 claimed to have been verbally abused or harassed and 10% said people had even urinated on them. Meanwhile, 7% said they had been the victim of a sexual assault while homeless. Others reported having their belongings deliberately damaged or vandalised, but more than half did not report crimes to the police as they did not think anything would be done. The figures, drawn from a survey of 458 rough sleepers, comes as Crisis is calling on members of the public to urge their MPs to back the Homelessness Reduction Bill which is currently going through Parliament. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to put ""prevention at the heart of tackling homelessness"" as she announced £20m of funding to stop people becoming rough sleepers on the streets of London. :: Sir Chris Hoy sleeps rough to help the homeless Mrs May also announced £10m backing for projects aimed at helping those at ""imminent risk"" of becoming homeless. Crisis expects to take in around 4,000 homeless people to its centres around the country this Christmas, offering companionship and hot meals. Jon Sparkes, the charity's chief executive, said rough sleepers face ""a horrifying state of affairs"". He added: ""For anyone sleeping on the street, life can be a struggle just to survive. ""Rough sleepers are far more likely to be victims of crime, including violent assault, abuse and intimidation, compared to the general public."""

""She suffered from severe matting (dreadlocks, really), the likes of which had been neglected for years,"" the rescue group posted on its Facebook page. ""Our medical team shaved off the pounds of intertwined fur from her body and, needless to say, this cat is feeling so much better now!"" A now much lighter Hidey is due to be cared for by a relative of her previous owner, the post said, and will ""finally have a chance at a happy and healthy life"".

2016-12-23,"Britain's hospitality industry has asked the Government for more than 100,000 work permits post-Brexit, underlining just how difficult it will be for Theresa May to fulfil her pledge to cut net migration.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161223172917/http://news.sky.com/story/hospitality-industry-demands-100000-brexit-work-permits-a-year-10705581,"Across the UK, EU migrants account for 15% per cent of the 4.5m-strong hospitality workforce, but in some areas of London that figure rises to more than 65% of staff - making these workers critical to the capital. Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, says closing down flows of migrant labour would be ""catastrophic"" for the hospitality sector and could force small businesses to close.  She said the sector had told the Government it needed more than 100,000 visas a year once Britain exits the EU. Ms Ibrahim told Sky News: ""This is just our sector - hospitality and tourism.  ""If you add to that the construction industry, the care sector and other sectors you can understand there will be a difficult task ahead for the Government."" The number of work visas being demanded emphasises the severe labour shortages affecting not just the hospitality industry, but also a number of different sectors and regions across the UK as unemployment falls to an 11-year low. Reliance on migrant labour is particularly acute in the capital, which is why London Mayor Sadiq Khan is pressing Brexit Secretary David Davis to create a regional visa scheme for the capital or, at the very least, a big allocation of any work permits offered after Brexit. Mr Khan told Sky News: ""I understand the toxicity of the visa word, but the reality is that there are employers who need workers from overseas and one way of addressing that is having an allocation of work permits fairly met by Government. ""The reality is that if London is going to carry on having huge economic import to our country's prosperity and carry on delivering revenues to the Exchequer, we are going to have to attract talent."" Consultancy firm PwC has drawn up a possible regional visa scheme for the City of London Corporation, based on regional visa policies of Australian and Canada.   However, Government insiders say the idea of regional visas have been shelved in favour of work permits for different sectors.  Mr Khan, who is meeting Mr Davis on a monthly basis to talk Brexit, said the Government is listening but warned that he will step up political pressure should London's needs not be met. Labour insiders admit that Mr Khan can't independently set migration rules for London, but said the capital has ""plenty of leverage"" to mobilise against No 10 if necessary.  Last week, Sky News revealed that the Government is collecting data from industry on the numbers of EU visas different sectors will need to avoid chronic labour shortages."

He resigned as shadow health minister via Twitter even before Mr Corbyn had finished his leadership acceptance speech last September. He called on him to step down in a long letter just after the EU referendum that included the suggestion that Mr Corbyn and his supporters had injected an ""unprecedented poison"" into the party. The big fact, though, is that the constituency is being abolished under the terms of the boundary review. This might have an impact on the calibre of candidate - who will be willing to fight a seat that will only exist for a maximum of three years? That Mr Reed thinks he can serve his constituents better as an executive at Sellafield, rather than as an MP, is a remarkable statement. But his antipathy to Mr Corbyn comes as no surprise. His leaving present, though, is a scientific testing ground for the theory that he can turn a mass membership party into actual votes, and seats where they matter. Losing a seat that has been held constantly (including in its previous incarnation as Whitehaven) should be totally unthinkable. But with the Conservatives just 2,564 votes behind at last year's General Election and currently 8-10% ahead in national polls, Copeland is definitely ""in play"". The seat voted 62% to leave the EU in the referendum. But this is not as simple as it seems. UKIP did well to get 6,148 votes last May, but it is not perfect UKIP territory given the strength of the Conservatives here. UKIP and the Conservatives risk splitting the ""Brexit means Brexit"" vote, too. But if the Conservatives run a hard UKIP-tinged campaign this could turn off a minority of its own pro-Remain supporters. Labour's challenge is acute, though: maintain its base of support, win back some Labour supporters who voted Leave, but also provide a home for 14,000 Remain voters in Copeland. Above all, the presence of Sellafield puts a special dynamic on this election. Labour will surely have to get a pro-nuclear local union official as its candidate, which is contrary to the instincts of the leadership. Local health issues might also end up as important as Brexit as there have been performance issues in local hospitals. That said, the by-election campaign will be against a backdrop of Article 50 debates in Parliament and the Supreme Court decision. It will settle the issue of how defined UK voters are by Brexit. It is all to play for in Cumbria in early 2017."

2016-12-23,"Around 600,000 extra homes and businesses are in line for superfast broadband services, it has been announced.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161223172917/http://news.sky.com/story/extra-600000-in-line-for-superfast-broadband-under-government-scheme-10704635,"Some £440m will be used to connect properties in the hardest-to-reach parts of the UK under the Broadband Delivery UK programme (BDUK), Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said. The announcement comes a month after Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged £1bn of Government investment in ""full-fibre"" broadband, a handout which means at least two million more homes and businesses could get access to speeds of more than 1Gbps. Last week, the Government also faced calls to ""play an active role"" in the future rollout of 5G, as a report revealed that Albania and Peru have better mobile phone coverage than the UK. Ministers set up the BDUK project to provide superfast broadband to 95% of the UK by December 2017. Ms Bradley said the programme is providing homes and businesses with ""fast and reliable internet connections which are increasingly at the heart of modern life"". She said: ""Strong take-up and robust value-for-money measures mean £440m will be available for reinvestment where it matters - putting more connections in the ground. ""This will benefit around 600,000 extra premises and is a further sign of our commitment to build a country that works for everyone."" The fund is made up of £150m in savings from ""careful contract management"" and £292m released through a clawback system that reinvests money when people take up superfast connections installed under the scheme. Ms Bradley added: ""Broadband speeds aren't boosted automatically - it needs people to sign up. ""Increasing take-up is a win-win-win: consumers get a better service, it encourages providers to invest, and when more people sign up in BDUK areas, money is clawed back to pay for more connections."" BT said the investment in superfast broadband is ""a huge success story for the UK"", adding that the BDUK project ""shows exactly what can be achieved through close partnerships between the public and private sector""."
2016-12-23,Two men who hijacked an aircraft and threatened to blow it up had a grenade and guns that were both fake.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161223172917/http://news.sky.com/story/libyan-afriqiyah-airways-flight-hijacked-and-taken-to-malta-10705819,"The pair surrendered peacefully after several hours of negotiations at Malta International Airport, where the internal Libyan flight had been diverted. The hijackers, named as Libyans Suhah Mussa and Ahmed Ali, gave themselves up after allowing passengers and then some crew off the Afriqiyah Airways jet. The pair, believed to be aged in their twenties, later left the plane with the rest of the crew. Maltese soldiers found a second pistol when they searched the aircraft. The Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, said their weapons had been examined and were found to be replicas. The Airbus A320, with 111 passengers and six crew on board, was travelling from the Libyan city of Sabha to the capital Tripoli when it was forced to land in Malta on Friday morning. The hijackers initially wanted the plane to be flown to Rome but it ended up in Malta due to fuel limitations. All flights to the airport were immediately diverted. Mr Muscat said his government had told the hijackers to release all the passengers before there could be any talks. He said: ""This request was negotiated and eventually accepted, and passengers were released in consecutive groups."" In a series of tweets, Mr Muscat said 65 people had been allowed to leave, then another 44, including some crew, followed by the hijackers and the final crew members. The passengers were being questioned by police and will then return to Libya on another Afriqiyah Airways jet, while the hijackers are being interrogated. At one point during the hijacking a man, believed to be one of the perpetrators, briefly appeared with a plain green flag at the top of steps outside the aircraft. The flag was thought to be of Libya when it was ruled by former dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The plane's pilot Ali Milad told Libyan TV the hijackers had been seeking political asylum in Europe and wanted to set up a political party called ""the New Fateh"". But the Maltese prime minister said the pair had not issued any demands. Fateh is a reference to Gaddafi, who led the Fateh revolution after his coup in 1969 and was killed in 2011 after being overthrown in an uprising."

One of the reasons for this change in stance is believed to be the approach Theresa May has taken. A key issue is expected to be the ""divorce bill"" which will be presented to the UK by the European Commission, which reports suggest could be as much as £50bn to £60bn. The report's authors say that would be ""a considerable embarrassment"" politically for the Prime Minister. London School of Economics assistant professor Sara Hagemann said the prospect of Brexit has ""united the EU27 to a degree rarely seen before"". ""While several of these countries first expressed the hope that a solution would be found to keep London 'closely involved in EU affairs', attitudes are now quite different,"" she said. ""The UK Government is seen as working opportunistically with only UK interests in mind and little consideration for wider European issues and priorities."" The key moment in the Brexit negotiations is expected to be the EU's response to the triggering of Article 50. Dr Angus Armstrong of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research wrote: ""If the continental consensus is that the UK is still living on Fantasy Island, we could be heading for a showdown sooner than anyone expects."" The authors believe Mrs May is probably aiming to take Britain out of the single market and will seek a free trade deal for goods and sectoral agreements to allow as broad as possible access for services. Immigration would be brought ""fully"" under UK Government control, resulting in a ""large fall"" in EU migration to the country. The report, titled Brexit: Six Months On, warns that divisions within the Conservative Party and the Cabinet itself may ""hamstring"" the Prime Minister as she finalises her position in the weeks before the tabling of Article 50. A DExEU spokesman said: ""We're preparing for a smooth and orderly exit from the EU and by working together with our European neighbours we're confident we will be able to secure a deal that works in the mutual interests of both the UK and the rest of the European Union."""

Following a review of Chelsea's conduct, the Premier League has cleared the London club but requested that it undergoes an audit from an independent safeguarding expert. In a statement, the Premier League said: ""The league has no reason to have any concerns about Chelsea's current provisions in this area but, given the seriousness of these historical allegations, feels that such a review is an appropriate course of action."" It added that it has also requested Chelsea to share details of a review the club has commissioned into historical abuse and how it handled Mr Johnson's claim. The 57-year-old said he had been sexually abused by the club's former chief scout Eddie Heath, who died in the early 1980s. Mr Johnson joined Chelsea as an 11-year-old in 1970 and claimed he had been groomed from the age of 13 by Heath. ""I felt shame, I felt my childhood had been taken away,"" he told The Daily Mirror. ""I spent my late teens in turmoil, absolute turmoil."" Police have revealed that children as young as four are among the potential victims in the football sex abuse scandal. According to the information gathered by Operation Hydrant - the UK-wide police investigation into non-recent child sexual abuse - there are 429 potential victims. The number of potential abusers has also almost doubled in recent weeks to 155. Earlier in December the number stood at 83, according to figures from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). Meanwhile, a confidential hotline received more than 1,700 calls in three weeks after it was set up by the NSPCC and the FA."

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said there had been a ""significant disruption of what we would describe as an imminent terrorist event"". Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said the plot had been ""inspired by ISIS (Islamic State) and ISIS propaganda"" and had been removed ""in its entirety"".  It was targeting prominent sites in Australia's second largest city, including Federation Square, Flinders Street Station, a trendy bar and restaurant precinct, and St Paul's Cathedral, ""possibly on Christmas Day"", Mr Ashton added. He said it was likely the attacks would have involved the use of explosives, and either guns or knives.    ""Certainly (there was the) potential,"" he said, ""for quite a number of people to be injured or killed in this attack.""  Three of the seven people initially arrested in the raids - two men, aged 26 and 21, and a 20-year-old woman - have been released without charge. The other four - all men aged between 21 and 26 - are being held in connection with the alleged plot.     Three of them - Hamza Abbas, 21, Ahmed Mohamed, 24, and Abdullah Chaarani, 26 - have been charged with preparing or planning a terrorist attack. The trio appeared in court on Friday and were remanded in custody. A fourth man - a 22-year-old who has not been named - was later charged with the same offence and will appear in court on Saturday. The suspects had been under close surveillance for a fortnight.  Earlier Mr Ashton said one of the suspected plotters in custody was an Egyptian-born Australian and the others were all Australian-born of Lebanese descent. About 400 police officers and members of Australia's domestic spy agency were involved in the security operation which resulted in the arrests.  There will be extra officers on patrol on Christmas Day and at the annual cricket Test on Boxing Day.  Anglican Archbishop Philip Freer said Christmas Eve and Christmas Day services would be ""unaffected by these things"".  Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters that the ""Islamist terrorist plot"" was ""one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years"". He added: ""We will continue to go about our lives as we always have. ""What these criminals seek to do is to kill.

During the unrest fires were lit at the Isle of Sheppey jail, according to the Prison Officers Association. The Prison Service said that those involved in the incident ""surrendered and were back in cells by 1am with no injuries to staff or prisoners"". In a statement it added that Justice Secretary Liz Truss ""is committed to making sure our prisons are stable while we deliver wholescale reforms to the prison estate to help offenders turn their lives around and reduce reoffending"". :: British prisons: Five major incidents in 12 months The disturbance comes a week after a riot at HMP Birmingham that involved up to 600 prisoners and was described by experts as the worst for 25 years. Riot officers managed to win back control of the jail after 12 hours of violence in which inmates set fires and stole keys and equipment. The Swaleside incident is the fourth disturbance at an English prison in less than two months. A damning report this year by the Chief Inspector of Prisons called HMP Swaleside ""dangerous"" and said levels of violence were ""far too high"". Many staff were also ""demotivated and overwhelmed"", with half of the prisoners claiming it was ""easy or very easy"" to get drugs. The Ministry of Justice has announced plans to recruit 2,500 extra prison officers to make jails safer and crack down on the use of drugs and phones, which are increasingly being dropped using drones.  A task force has also been set up to ""manage down potential flashpoints of unrest"". But the Prison Officers Association says it will be difficult to retain and recruit people given existing levels of pay and conditions inside jails.

Barton, who signed for Premier League side Burnley until the end of the season earlier this week, is alleged to have placed the bets between 26 March 2006 and 13 May 2016. The 34-year-old was given a one-match suspension for breaking Scottish Football Association betting rules during his short spell with Rangers. The midfielder admitted breaching the SFA's zero-tolerance rules, which forbid players from gambling on games. Barton is said to have placed 44 bets on games between 1 July 2016 - when his deal with the Scottish Premier League side started - and 15 September. His Scottish suspension will carry over into his Burnley career. Barton had his Rangers contract terminated last month, seven weeks after being suspended by the club over a training ground row with his manager and a teammate. Although the charge comes three days after Burnley signed Barton, it was not announced just because of his return to English football, the Press Association reported. The FA is believed to have been investigating the matter for the last few months, having received information from a bookmaker. Given the sheer volume of bets that are alleged to have been placed, the investigation has taken longer than most cases. Barton could therefore still have been charged by the FA as a free agent. Burnley said in a statement they were aware of the charge and would be discussing it with Barton."

Mrs May was invited to Balmoral in September for the first time, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were said to have been looking forward to hearing her private thoughts on the subject.  But the Prime Minister - who visited the Scottish estate with her husband Philip - apparently revealed no more in private than she has during her public appearances. The account suggests their relationship did not get off to an ideal start, although a newspaper report at the time suggested the two women ""got on famously"" - and share an interest in outdoor pursuits.  Neither Buckingham Palace nor Downing Street would comment on the report. A palace spokeswoman said: ""By long-established convention we never disclose details of discussions between the Queen and her prime ministers. Nor would we comment on anonymously sourced conjecture of this kind."" Behind the scenes however is irritation at the report, with one source insisting it was not representative of Mrs May's conversations with the monarch during her two-day stay in Scotland. The visit - an annual fixture for prime ministers - came just two months after Mrs May entered No 10 following the resignation of David Cameron in the wake of the Brexit vote. Although she had attended regular weekly audiences with the Queen it was the first occasion the two women had spent an extended period of time together. Mrs May has frustrated some MPs by refusing to offer ""a running commentary"" on Brexit. At an appearance before a Commons committee this week she refused to directly answer a string of questions.  The Queen is said to be a keen observer of the political scene, and previous Prime Ministers have spoken of how they confided in her about difficult decisions. Her private views are a source of fascination, although a report earlier this year the Queen vented her frustration at Brussels during a private lunch with ministers was slapped down by the Palace. However during the Scottish referendum in 2014 the Queen expressed hopes that Scots would ""think very carefully about the future"" - a comment which was taken to show her support for the Union. A biography of the Prime Minister alleged that she and David Cameron had a ""strained"" breakfast on the morning that a poll put the independence side one point ahead."

Work on some schemes will start on Christmas Eve to give engineers and maintenance teams four days to complete upgrades before the next working day. Crossrail work means no trains will operate to or from Paddington between Christmas Eve and Thursday. Heathrow Express services between Heathrow and Paddington will be suspended for six days and Great Western trains will terminate at Ealing.

""Our dispute is about taking action to haul back the cuts machine and put safety back at the top of the agenda."" The TSSA said its members had been subjected to increased threats and abuse since the programme of ticket office closures started, saying they were being made ""scapegoats"" for ticket machine failures. London Underground is yet to respond. While holiday action by airport staff has been averted, the Southern Railway dispute is still simmering alongside strikes by some Post Office workers.

2016-12-23,A haulage boss and a mechanic have been convicted of manslaughter after a 32-tonne truck with faulty brakes killed four people.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161223172917/http://news.sky.com/story/two-guilty-over-deadly-bath-tipper-truck-crash-10704939,"Matthew Gordon, 30, and Peter Wood, 55, were both convicted of four counts of manslaughter following a trial at Bristol Crown Court. The truck's driver, Phillip Potter, 20, was cleared of all charges. Outside court he said he thought of the families and those affected every day. The vehicle, which was carrying aggregate, crashed into cars and pedestrians as it travelled down a steep hill in Bath in February 2015. Police described it as a ""catastrophic"" brake failure. Four-year-old Mitzi Rosanna Steady, who was walking with her grandmother, was killed. Robert Parker, 59, Philip Allen, 52, and 34-year-old Stephen Vaughan - all from South Wales - were killed when the truck hit their car. Judge Mr Justice Langstaff remanded Gordon and Wood in custody and will sentence them on 27 January. Gordon, of Dauntsey in Wiltshire, and Wood, of Brinkworh in Wiltshire, displayed no emotion as the verdicts were revealed. The jury cleared Mr Potter, also of Dauntsey, of causing death by dangerous driving, causing death by careless driving and causing serious injuries to Karla Brennan and Margaret Rogers by dangerous driving. The trial heard that Mr Potter was following Gordon, the owner of Grittenham Haulage, when the brakes on his 11-year-old vehicle failed in Lansdown Lane, Upper Weston. He hit Mitzi and her grandmother Mrs Rogers as they crossed the road, before smashing into three parked cars and killing Mr Vaughan, Mr Allen and Mr Parker. Witnesses said they saw smoke coming from Mr Potter's lorry and smelt the brakes burning. Mr Potter, who had started his job at the firm days earlier, said he would have never driven the lorry had he known the brakes were faulty. Describing what happened, he told the jury: ""I tried the handbrake. I put it on and nothing. I tried putting the lorry into third gear to try and get the engine to slow it down. ""I was really scared because I never had anything like this happen to me before. I blasted the horn."" Prosecutor Adam Vaitilingham QC told the court Gordon's operation was a ""shambles"" and the crash was an ""accident waiting to happen"" because of his ""disregard for the rules and a failure to comply with routine guidelines"". He said virtually no problems were recorded in the truck's paperwork and its brakes were not properly tested. Wood, who was employed to inspect and help maintain the lorries, carried out the final safety check on the vehicle in January 2015. ""If Mr Wood did carry out a safety inspection that day it was wholly inadequate,"" Mr Vaitilingam said. Following the verdict, Sian Vaughan, who had been married to Stephen for six months when he died, told Sky News: ""This denied us of a family, something we both wanted very much… and especially having to spend your first wedding anniversary alone was just so far removed from what we had planned. ""It has been like an outer body experience. I can't believe what we have been hearing, that someone would have total disregard for other road users."""
