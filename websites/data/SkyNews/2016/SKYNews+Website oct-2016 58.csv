2016-10-02,"Theresa May will introduce a ""Great Repeal Bill"" in the next Queen's Speech that will scrap the legislation that took Britain into Europe 44 years ago.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-eu-laws-to-stay-on-brexit-day-10602284,"Sky News understands that moves will be made to remove the European Communities Act from the statute book next year. EU law and regulations will then be converted into domestic law and subsequently removed or kept, depending on what the UK Parliament decides. This process could take years - meaning many EU laws could be in force long after the day Britain formally leaves the union. The Prime Minister will also trigger Article 50 before German elections in September 2017, the Sunday Times reports. In an interview with the newspaper, Mrs May again said she would not hold a general election before 2020 - warning that an early vote would cause ""instability"". David Davis, the Secretary of State for Brexit, said the Government will ""take a simple approach"" over changes to legislation. He said: ""EU law will be transposed into domestic law, wherever practical, on exit day. ""It will be for elected politicians here to make the changes to reflect the outcome of our negotiation and our exit."" The ""Great Repeal Bill"" will end the supremacy of EU law, meaning rulings by the European Court of Justice will stop applying to the UK once the legislation takes effect. It will also include powers to make changes to the laws using secondary legislation, but wide-ranging amendments or new laws may come forward in separate bills. Mr Davis added: ""That is what people voted for: power and authority residing once again with the sovereign institutions of our own country."" The move comes as former Cabinet ministers ramped up pressure on Theresa May by presenting her with a ""Brexit Blueprint"" to take the country out the EU in less than two years. The plan, proposed by ex-ministers Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood, Owen Paterson and Peter Lilley, was circulated ahead of the Prime Minister's Brexit speech at the Tory party conference on Sunday. Steve Peers, professor of EU law at the University of Essex, said Mrs May's planned transfer of EU legislation ""is probably the most straightforward way to have the transition to Brexit"". He told Sky News: ""In principle it does make sense, it avoids a big legal and practical vacuum. ""But there is going to be a big issue about who decides which EU laws get to be changed in future - will it simply be a power given to the Government to decide or will it be Parliament which decides through Acts of Parliament?"" Professor Peers added: ""I think that will be a very important issue that will probably end up dominating the debate on this bill."" :: From 10am today Sky News' Dermot Murnaghan will be talking to Iain Duncan Smith, Priti Patel and Theresa Villiers as the Conservative Party conference begins"
2016-10-02,Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared a handshake and a brief exchange of words at the funeral of Shimon Peres.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/world-leaders-pay-tribute-to-israels-founding-father-at-shimon-peres-funeral-10599453,"The sombre ceremony for the former president and prime minister of Israel was attended by world leaders and dignitaries from 70 countries. Mr Abbas, who had taken part in peace negotiations with Mr Peres, was sat in the front row for the ceremony on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Barack Obama, Prince Charles and Bill Clinton were also at Israel's national cemetery. :: As It Happened: World Leaders Gather For Funeral In Mr Obama's eulogy to Mr Peres said Mr Abbas's presence was ""a reminder of the unfinished business of peace"".   ""Shimon never saw his dream of peace fulfilled. And yet he did not stop dreaming, and he did not stop working,"" he added. ""It is that faith, that optimism, that belief, even when all the evidence is to the contrary, that tomorrow can be better, that makes us not just honour Shimon Peres, but love him. The last of the founding generation is now gone. ""Toda rabah haver yakar,"" he added - Hebrew for ""Thank you so much dear friend"". The Nobel Peace laureate considered one of the founding fathers of Israel and his rich political career spanned seven decades. Mr Netanyahu, who was a political rival to Peres, recalled a late-night discussion on Israel's future with Mr Peres discussing security and peace. ""Be at peace, Shimon, dear man, exceptional leader,"" he said. ""He was a great man of Israel. He was a great man of the world. Israel grieves for him. The world grieves for him,"" he said. Friday's ceremony was Israel's largest gathering of international dignitaries since the funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a Jewish nationalist in 1995. Mr Peres' children described the personal side of their father, with his daughter Tzvia Walden reflecting on his ""forbearance and infinite patience"". She said: ""He measured long and short on a timeline of two thousand years of history when weighing the state of the nation, but in nanoseconds when waiting for a text to be printed. ""He was ready with his new corrections even before the ink was dry. A day after lending me a book, he was astonished to learn that I had not yet finished reading it."" Born in Poland in 1923, Mr Peres emigrated to what was then British mandatory Palestine when he was 11. He held nearly every major office in Israel - serving twice as prime minister (1984-1986 and 1995-1996) and also as president (2007-2014). He died at the age of 93, two weeks after suffering a stroke. Mr Peres' casket lay in state on Thursday outside the parliament building, where some 30,000 people filed past to pay their respects.

2016-10-02,There's been a worrying rise in the number of botched lip jobs as rogue practitioners cash in on the latest celebrity craze.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/victim-of-botched-lip-filler-op-warns-of-dangers-10600514,"Big names like Kardashian's star Kylie Jenner have openly admitted to having lip fillers. But as many try to mimic the look, concerns have been raised about the procedure which is unregulated in the UK. Maisie Busby wanted Jenner's lips and paid for the lip filler treatment - but the procedure went horribly wrong, leaving her with lumps in her lips. ""I had a couple of lumps so I went back and he injected them a bit more to try and hide it, and then I just came up with more and more lumps,"" she explained. Ms Busby is now paying for corrective treatment. ""Because it's obviously on my face, everyone can see it. I rarely smile now, I don't want to smile because then you can see the bumps even more,"" she said. Ms Busby is being treated by Emeline Hartley, a qualified aesthetics nurse who believes the problem is getting worse.  ""I'm seeing at least five or six people a week within my work. It's becoming more common, and people are seeing practitioners who are not properly qualified,"" she said, What's worrying Ms Hartley is the rise in young people wanting the treatment. ""Since Kylie Jenner's had her lips injected, we are having more youngsters coming through wanting their lips injected, and again, they're just not going to recognised practitioners,"" she cautioned. The campaign group Save Face promotes a register of credible practitioners for procedures like lip fillers. Save Face director Ashton Collins recognised there were growing numbers of rogue operators, carrying out the procedure with little or no medical training. And she's worried about the use of discount online promotions which are attracting younger girls. ""They're enticed by cheap deals, and because the treatments are so trivialised on TV it actually takes away the clinical factor from them, so these young girls are perceiving them more as an extension of their beauty regime then actual medical treatments,"" she said. Save Face only accredits doctors, nurses and dentists. But in reality anyone can carry out the procedure. The British Association of Aesthetic Surgeons (BAAPS) is also concerned about the lack of regulation. Plastic surgeon and BAAPS spokesperson Ash Mos Ahebi says he's seeing growing numbers of patients suffering complications from botched lip fillers. ""In some cases the damage is irreparable. I've seen people end up in intensive care with severe infection. That's an extreme, but in the lower end they can have permanent face disfigurement,"" he said. He believes the public should be educated about the potential risks. ""They must make sure they're doing it for the right reason. Make sure they get a consultation with a fully qualified plastic surgeon or dermatologist. And make sure it is done in a proper location with good facilities in case things go wrong,"" he said. Ms Busby's lips are slowly being corrected. The whole experience has cost her thousands, and left her very wary of the problems that can occur if lip fillers aren't properly administered."
2016-10-02,Tyson Fury is facing fresh questions about his boxing future after it emerged he failed a drugs test.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/world-heavyweight-champion-boxer-tyson-fury-fails-drugs-test-10600384,"The Fury camp has refused to comment on the reports, however, the World Boxing Organisation (WBO) is taking an interest in the allegations involving its world heavyweight champion. It has been widely reported Fury tested positive for cocaine, with ESPN saying the positive test came after he gave a urine sample on 22 September. The US-based sports broadcaster said Fury was tested in Lancaster by the Las Vegas-based Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA), as part of the routine agreed by both him and Wladimir Klitschko before their fight. The pair had been due to square off in Manchester on 29 October, with Fury defending the WBA and WBO heavyweight belts he won against the Ukrainian last November, but that clash was postponed on 23 September. Cocaine, while being an illegal Class A drug, is not banned out of competition. Sources have told Press Association Sport the VADA test was taken on an in-competition basis. A spokesman for Hennessy Sports, Fury's promoter, declined to discuss the ESPN report. A source close to the postponed fight told PA he had been told ""traces"" of cocaine were found in Fury's system, something the 28-year-old fighter's camp would not confirm. When contacted regarding Fury, VADA said it does not release the results of samples unless at an athlete's request. WBO president Paco Valcarcel told PA his organisation was waiting to see the paperwork involved in the tests before making any decisions. He said: ""We have to wait for the British board to notify us of the information they have got regarding the doping tests."" Asked whether Fury risked losing his WBO belt, Valcarcel added: ""We don't want to go any further until we receive the medical certification and the results."" ESPN said it had obtained a letter from VADA president Dr Margaret Goodman that it said was sent to both fighters, plus the British Boxing Board of Control and the United States' Association of Boxing Commissions on Thursday. It said the letter read: ""This letter is to advise you that the 'A' sample urine specimen number 4006253 collected from Tyson Fury on September 22, 2016 in Lancaster, England through his participation in the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) program has been analysed for anabolic agents, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, stimulants and drugs of abuse. The results of the analysis are as follows: Adverse. Urine specimen contains benzoylecgonine. ""Mr Fury has the right to promptly request analysis of the 'B' sample at his expense."" Benzoylecgonine is a metabolite of cocaine. It is unclear whether Fury will lose his belts, having failed to make a title defence this year. After the cancellation of a previous fight with Klitschko scheduled for 9 July, it emerged the UK Ant-Doping Agency (UKAD) had charged Fury over a urine sample taken in February 2015, and his cousin Hughie with a doping offence. They deny wrongdoing. It was alleged the sample - taken nine months before Fury beat Klitschko - contained traces of the banned substance nandrolone.  Fury was provisionally suspended, but the ban has since been lifted, and his legal team said they would be suing UKAD over the allegations.  A hearing will be held in November."
2016-10-02,"We were warned of a Brexit apocalypse: the pound in free fall, investment frozen, and the Chancellor forced to pen an emergency budget to save the nation from penury. ",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-earthquake-has-failed-to-materialise-10600501,"Remainers warned that traditional allies would spurn us, forcing the UK to ""the back of the queue"" as global markets shuddered. However, 100 days after polling stations opened and the nation decided to walk away from the European Union, we may have felt the tremors, but an earthquake has failed to materialise. In their defence, most of the Brexit Cassandras have consistently said the real impact wouldn't be felt until Brexit actually meant Brexit and we found ourselves outside the world's largest custom union. That could be two years if we follow the Lisbon treaty's Article 50 route, but quicker if the UK decides to walk away from the single market in a so-called ""hard"" Brexit. But before ""triggers are pulled"" and negotiations start ""after notification"", the fallout of the vote has been profoundly reshaping British politics.  With few facts, or a fixed timetable, bitterness, fear, anger and bravado have been carving through the biggest parties. Let us start with the winners. UKIP has lost and gained a leader, but the referendum result tore off a scab on the party's internal politics, pitching millionaire donor Arron Banks against its only MP, Douglas Carswell. Anti-Farage modernisers tried to co-opt UKIP's national executive to take the party in a new direction, causing Mr Banks to openly ponder whether he should turn his cash hose onto setting up a political movement, powered by the data gleaned from Leave.EU's vote push. In the Conservatives, there is an increasingly vocal group of hardline backbenchers (and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox), who believe World Trade Organisation rules and the threat of mutually assured tariffs are the justification for withdrawing from the customs union as soon as possible. That's set them at odds with the soft-Brexiters and majority backbench Remainers who have their foot on the brake pedal rather than the accelerator. So far Theresa May has adopted her default position when faced with internal squabbles or potentially controversial decisions: silence. But ""Submarine May"" - as she was dubbed waspishly in a book by Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron's former director of communications - will have to surface soon. Business leaders, Brussels negotiators and European premiers continue their clamour for clarity. And in Labour the so-called ""shadow-shadow"" cabinet of New Labour moderates still agitate, fuelled by their anger over Jeremy Corbyn's seeming reluctance to campaign to stay. That the Labour leader used his address at the party conference to concentrate on broad themes such as social inequality rather than the mechanics of Brexit has widened, not healed, divisions. After his team briefed that he was ""relaxed"" about levels of immigration when a third of Labour supporters had voted to leave, critics warned he was blind to changing political realities in core party seats. So while the plague of locusts never materialised, a swarm of political ramifications keeps buzzing around Westminster. 100 days and the political landscape's still shaking."

2016-10-02,Harry Redknapp has claimed players at a team he managed bet on the result of one of their games.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/harry-redknapp-claims-his-players-bet-on-outcome-of-match-10600492,"Gambling on football by current professional players is prohibited by the Football Association, and a worldwide ban on doing so has been in force since 2014. Redknapp says he was unaware at the time that his players were betting on the outcome of the game and denies any wrongdoing. Undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph filmed Redknapp without his knowledge as part of an investigation into British football. The newspaper does not identify the match or the players in question, or the year in which the game occurred. Redknapp's team were odds against to win the fixture but secured a comfortable victory, the paper said. :: Sam Allardyce 'hurt and disappointed' to lose England job Redknapp is shown saying in the video that the opposition ""murdered us early on"", and adding: ""At half-time I took (a player) off and put, erm, (another player on) and they're all looking at me, all the lads, 'cause I didn't know they'd had a bet, 'cause they was (sic) all choked, they'd all had a spread bet and everything."" The 69-year-old has managed a host of clubs during his long career, starting at Bournemouth and taking in stints at West Ham, Tottenham, QPR, Portsmouth and Southampton. His last role was a short spell in charge of Jordan's national team earlier this year. The Daily Telegraph said Redknapp met with undercover reporters, who were representing a fictitious Far East firm, and football agents Dax Price and Pino Pagliara at a London private members' club. When contacted later by the newspaper, and told that betting by players was against the rules, Redknapp reportedly replied: ""Oh would it? Oh, okay. But not at that time I don't think it was, was it? They weren't betting on the other team, they were having a bet on their own team."" :: 'Widespread corruption' claims hit FA after Allardyce quits Asked about his remarks about the players gambling on the game, the Telegraph claims he told the newspaper: ""Unbeknownst to me. No, not a spread bet. It wasn't a spread bet. I think they had a bet on the game, but it wasn't, that was nothing to do with me... after the game I'd heard the rumour the lads had had a bet that day... I'm not in control of whether they go and have a bet or not."" There is no suggestion Redknapp may have broken the law. It is not known if he told the FA about the gambling. Mr Price is quoted during the filmed conversation as saying a player, who is not identified, had contacted him about the match in question and urged him to put money on a victory for Redknapp's team. Mr Price reportedly said the player from Redknapp's club ""phoned me and said remortgage your house 'cause the odds were mental, they were 5/2 at the time"". Mr Price, according to the Telegraph, also claimed players on the losing team had bet on Redknapp's side winning."
2016-10-02,"Jeremy Corbyn needs to appeal to middle class voters, while at the same time speaking the language of traditional working class supporters.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/seven-things-jeremy-corbyn-needs-to-do-to-save-labour-10595811,"That's the challenge being set for the embattled Labour leader by mutinous MPs ahead of his big set-piece speech that will close Labour's conference. But Mr Corbyn's backers among Labour activists claim it is the MPs who need to change - and also begin to show some loyalty to their party leader. According to MPs, Mr Corbyn needs to do seven things in his big conference speech and beyond. They are: 1.    Appeal to middle class voters 2.    Want to win and not settle for opposition 3.    Explain how Labour would pay for its programme 4.    Speak the language of traditional working class supporters 5.    Do more than simply campaign on social media 6.    Campaign in the shires 7.    Get the new members out delivering leaflets In fringe meetings in Liverpool, Labour MPs said Mr Corbyn needs to listen more to his mutinous MPs and to the millions of voters who have deserted Labour for the Conservatives and other parties. At two meetings I chaired, titled Winning the next General Election, MPs clashed with left-wing activists on Mr Corbyn's record as leader and how he should now respond to his victory over Owen Smith last weekend. Both meetings exposed the wide - and at times acrimonious - gulf between activists and MPs, who claim the first conciliatory gesture Mr Corbyn should make would be to restore Shadow Cabinet elections. In the first meeting, Caroline Flint said Mr Corbyn should listen to voters' worries and broaden Labour's appeal to include middle class voters. ""Tories are not devils in horns,"" she said. And in what sounded like a jibe at Mr Corbyn and his left-wing supporters, Chris Leslie said ""occupying libraries"" wasn't the way to bring about change. Stephen McCabe stressed the importance of education policy, but - in an apparent swipe at Mr Corbyn's campaign against them - said grammar schools were a ""side issue"". And Gavin Shuker said a YouGov poll had identified the economy, immigration, welfare and Europe as voters' top four concerns. ""If we can't find answers to these four issues, we might as well go home,"" he said. Former minister Stephen Timms, meanwhile, said Labour must do three things. ""First, if we are going to win, we have got to want to win,"" he said. ""Second, we have to engage with people who don't agree with us. And third, we have to explain how we are going to pay for things we are going to do."" But the MPs didn't have it all their own way. One activist in the audience accused Labour MPs of indiscipline and another said the party was now in a position of ""MPs v the members"". There were further clashes at the second fringe meeting, this time between Labour MPs from the north of England and activists from London and south-east England, who defended Mr Corbyn and his record. Teesside MP and former steelworker Tom Blenkinsop said his working class constituents didn't think Labour spoke for them. ""They think we are very middle class, out of touch and foreign to them,"" he said. Dismissing the rival Momentum conference taking place in Liverpool as a ""circus"", he said: ""Why are we trying to invent this new left, post-'60s, broad... people with different ideas, let's all sit around and sing Kumbaya? ""We have organised labour, people actually work on shop floors and want to talk about industrial policy. How are you going to help me get my pay, terms and conditions? Brass tacks, meat and potato issues."" Graham Jones said Labour needed to win seats such as Basingstoke, which had an 11,000 Conservative majority, to change people's lives. The general election would not be won in metropolitan areas but in the shires, he said, adding that Labour had to speak to these people and listen to them. Nic Dakin admitted that with a 3,200 majority in his Scunthorpe seat he wasn't confident he could hold on to it now, after his constituency voted 2-1 to leave the European Union. Plenty of advice and gloomy forecasts. Activists, however, would say the MPs should stop sulking and raise their game. Labour MPs say it is Mr Corbyn who must do better… starting with his conference speech."
2016-10-02,Building work is to get under way on the UK's next generation of submarines armed with Trident nuclear missiles.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/work-to-start-on-trident-nuclear-missile-submarines-10601164,"Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced nearly £1.3bn to start the first construction phase of the new fleet, which will replace the four ageing Vanguard-class vessels. The money will be used to build the part of the first submarine which contains switchboards and control panels for the reactor. It will also be spent on designing the vessels and investing in facilities at the BAE Systems yard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, where the submarines will be built. The go-ahead for the controversial project, estimated to cost £31bn over 30 years with £10bn set aside as a contingency, came after MPs voted in July in favour of renewing the deterrent. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a long-standing campaigner for unilateral nuclear disarmament, was among those to vote against the move - a stance at odds with his own party's policy. The nationalist government in Scotland, where the submarine deterrent is based at Faslane, has also stated its strong opposition to the ""immoral"" weapons system. The announcement will secure thousands of highly skilled jobs in the UK, and comes ahead of the Tory party conference in Birmingham. The Defence Secretary said: ""Britain's nuclear submarines are the ultimate guarantee of our nation's safety - we use them every day to deter the most extreme threats. ""We cannot know what new dangers we might face in the 2030s, 2040s and 2050s, so we are acting now to replace them. ""Along with increasing the defence budget to buy new ships, planes and armoured vehicles, this shows that the Conservative Party will never gamble with our national security."" Labour divisions over Trident were recently exposed at the party's conference.  Shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis reportedly punched a wall in frustration after a section of his speech in which he committed to maintaining the current pro-renewal policy was deleted on the orders of Mr Corbyn's spin doctor Seumas Milne. Mr Lewis has said he would not attempt to change the policy ""as things stand"", however a shift in position was not ruled out by Mr Corbyn as he pledged to campaign for a ""nuclear-free world""."

The Royal children have been staying there with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with their nanny looking after them while their parents travel around British Columbia and the Yukon on the rest of the Royal tour. After being carried down some steps into the garden party Princess Charlotte was keen for her mother to put her down, and soon ran off towards a large arch made from balloons, beaming back at her mother. Prince George also joined his little sister, hitting the balloons in a more boisterous way. There was plenty of proof that William and Kate are hands on parents. Prince William put his son on a miniature pony, and could be heard trying to convince him to stay on it. He also played bubbles with his little boy, and seemed to being enjoying himself as much as George. Princess Charlotte meanwhile had a dance with mum Kate, sat on a giant white fluffy dog and started to master a key part of royal engagements, accepting balloon flowers from another party guest. The other guests at the party were parents and children from military families in Canada, many of whom have a parent currently serving overseas. Kensington Palace were keen to describe this as a normal children's party, but Prince George and Princess Charlotte are so rarely seen in public it was always going to be a special moment. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are fiercely protective of their children's privacy and any public moments like these are strictly controlled. But if William and Kate had been worried about any tears or tantrums they had little to worry about. Both children behaved themselves, even if Prince George did get a little stroppy when he wanted his sister's balloon flowers."

The testing process, which includes reassessing conditions every six months, has come in for heavy criticism, amid claims it fails some of the most seriously ill and disabled. But Mr Green said the reforms, which will be unveiled at the upcoming Conservative party conference, will help end the anxiety and financial insecurity that claimants may have felt. The criteria will be drawn up with health professionals, but illnesses such as severe Huntingdon's, autism or a congenital heart condition, are among those likely to qualify for continuous payments without reassessment. Mr Green said: ""We are building a country that works for everyone - not just the privileged few.  ""A key part of that is making sure that all those who are able to work are given the support and the opportunity to do so. ""But it also means ensuring that we give full and proper support to those who can't. ""That includes sweeping away any unnecessary stress and bureaucracy - particularly for the most vulnerable in society. ""If someone has a disease which can only get worse then it doesn't make sense to ask them to turn up for repeated appointments.  ""If their condition is not going to improve, it is not right to ask them to be tested time after time. So we will stop it."" The Government climbdown on the controversial policy is set to be seized on by Labour as another victory. Jeremy Corbyn in his recent party conference speech claimed credit for the opposition in forcing previous U-turns on cuts to tax credits and disability benefits. Sky News Political Correspondent Tamara Cohen said: ""Theresa May is again distancing herself from the previous administration, by trying to detoxify the issue of welfare. ""While planned benefit cuts will go ahead next year, there will be new no ones and the change of language is important. ""There's no more of George Osborne's 'skivers' and 'strivers'. ""Welfare secretary Damian Green makes clear that scrapping assessments for seriously ill claimants is about showing the Tories are a compassionate party who care about the vulnerable. ""It's also about shedding the 'nasty party' tag."""

One passenger said the coach ""swerved"" at the roundabout and the bus landed on its side on a grass verge. The coach was taking the Nith Valley Loyal Rangers Supporters' Club to Ibrox Stadium, where Rangers were due to play Partick Thistle in the Scottish Premiership. Mr Baird, originally from Northern Ireland, was named by a family member and fellow fans. He had been living in Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway. Louise Evanne Baird, his cousin, said he was an ""amazing"" man who would be ""sadly missed"". His partner, Sarah Hughes, said he loved his club - as many of his friends and family changed their profile pictures on social media to a Nith Valley scarf in his memory. Tributes were paid online from fans on both sides of the Old Firm divide and from Rangers supporters' clubs far and wide. Thoughts are with the Rangers fans involved in the bus crash today. Wish them all a speedy recovery. RangersLinfieldFC tweeted: ""We have been informed that the man who sadly passed away was a Rangers and Linfield fan named Ryan Baird from Larne, Northern Ireland, RIP."" In a club statement, Rangers said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the crash, adding: ""Our profound condolences go to the gentleman who has died and our thoughts are with his family. ""We are also thinking of those who have been injured and taken to hospital."" Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson said: ""Everyone at the football club and every member of our Rangers family is thinking of all of those caught up in this terrible accident. ""Clearly this is a deeply distressing time and the board extend our deepest sympathies and concerns."" Celtic also passed on their condolences in a club statement, saying ""everyone at Celtic sends our sincere condolences following the death of a supporter"". Ryan Rowe, from Darvel, East Ayrshire, was driving to work when he passed the crash scene. He said: ""One man I spoke to was just sitting down and in tears and he was shaking. He said the bus had swerved. ""Another young man had cuts all over his arm and blood all the way down it. He was holding it in the air to try and stop the bleeding."" Thirty-six passengers and the driver were on board the bus at the time of the crash.  Police Scotland said: ""Eighteen people are receiving treatment in hospital, three of whom are in a serious condition. ""This includes seven men under 20 years of age, three men and three women aged between 30 and 59 and five men over 60."" Police are still trying to establish the cause of the crash but anyone with information is asked to call Irvine Police on 101."

The amount raised had topped £26,000 by Sunday afternoon - with more than 1,100 people donating money. A ""heartbroken"" Ms Ross spoke of her loss and said Towell, from Dundee, had been suffering headaches in the weeks before Thursday's fight. The 25-year-old's death on Friday night - after Thursday's bout - has again raised questions over safety in the sport. Towell's management team said they had not been aware of any headache complaints. The welterweight, known as Iron Mike Towell, was stretchered from the ring after a fifth-round loss to Dale Evans at St Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow. Towell was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and diagnosed with severe bleeding and swelling to his brain. He died shortly after 11pm on Friday, 12 hours after being taken off life support. Ms Ross, his partner of eight years, wrote on Facebook: ""I'm absolutely heartbroken to say my annoying best friend passed away tonight at 11.02 very peacefully. ""Michael had severe bleeding and swelling to his brain. He had been complaining of headaches for the last few weeks but we put it down to migraines with the stress of his fight. ""It has been the longest 24 hours of our lives. My baby has lost his daddy. But he will be so so proud of his dad in what he achieved. ""Once he was taken off of his life support he managed 12 hours, 12 whole rounds off his life support, he fought right to the end and he's done us all so proud."" Towell's family were at his bedside and were joined by his manager, Tommy Gilmour, and St Andrew's Sporting Club owner Iain Wilson. Mr Gilmour said boxing had lost a top fighter and a ""very special man"", and described him as one of the best he had worked with. Mr Wilson said the club said had lost ""one of our favourite sons and boxing has lost an explosive talent"". The eliminator for the British welterweight title at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow was being broadcast on STV Glasgow when Towell was fatally injured. Evans is yet to comment on Towell's death, but described his opponent as a ""true warrior"" in a statement issued after he was taken to hospital. He said: ""I never wanted to see my opponent being stretchered out of the ring. Who would ever want that sight? That was so hard for his family and my heart goes out to them."""

She was found knocking on doors nearly four hours later, more than a mile away from where she was grabbed in Summertown. Det Supt Chris Ward, Head of Thames Valley Police Major Crime Unit, said: ""The victim has now been able to provide more detailed descriptions of the two offenders which we are releasing today. ""The first offender is a man with shaven dark blonde hair and balding, but no facial hair. ""He is in his mid twenties, of medium build, with blue eyes and about 6ft.

""The second offender is a man with brown hair that was gelled. ""He is in his late teens or early twenties, clean shaven, with brown eyes. He was slightly smaller in build than the first offender. ""Please rest assured that we are carrying out a thorough investigation but we also need the help of the public to bring these offenders to justice."" He appealed for anyone who knows anyone who fits the descriptions to come forward. On Friday it was revealed the girl did not arrive at school and police were informed by the school and her mother at 8.45am that she was missing. Det Supt Ward said officers received a ""substantial"" number of calls in the first 24 hours of their investigation and they were trying to piece together exactly what happened."

She mentions a ""continuous"" tremor in his left hand. There was also a ""shuffling gait"", ""terrible insomnia"" and a ""loss of basic reasoning"" and memory.  The disease began to affect his work. While filming Night At The Museum 3, Ms Schneider says: ""Robin was having trouble remembering even one line for his scenes, while just three years prior he had played in a full five-month season of the Broadway production Bengal Tiger At The Baghdad Zoo, often doing two shows a day with hundreds of lines - and not one mistake."" She says: ""This loss of memory and inability to control his anxiety was devastating to him."" As the symptoms took hold, Ms Schneider says doctors diagnosed the star with Parkinson's disease. He was also, she writes, keeping some symptoms from her - including the fact that he was hallucinating. In her essay, called The Terrorist Inside My Husband's Brain, Ms Schneider also recalls the last words they said to each other. ""When we retired for sleep, in our customary way, my husband said to me 'Goodnight, my love,' and waited for my familiar reply: 'Goodnight, my love'.  ""His words still echo through my heart today."" Ms Schneider is hoping to raise awareness of Lewy body disease.  ""It is my belief that when healing comes out of Robin's experience, he will not have battled and died in vain,"" she writes.  :: Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK."

""I was prepared to fly for money to go and make a speech and that was it. ""I understand the word bung and have never taken an amount of money for those kinds of reasons or implied that I would.

2016-10-02,The safety of boxing has once again been called into question following the death of 25-year-old boxer Mike Towell.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/boxers-safety-in-spotlight-again-after-death-of-mike-towell-10601276,"The welterweight died a day after suffering a brain injury during a fight in Glasgow, having previously been ""complaining of migraines for the last few weeks"". The fight was refereed by Victor Laughlin, who was also in charge of the fight between Chris Eubank Jr and Nick Blackwell, in which the latter suffered a bleed on the brain. Blackwell later retired after waking from an induced coma.  Towell's death is the third boxing-related death in Britain in 21 years. It comes three years after boxer Michael Norgrove died days after collapsing in the ring after a fight in London. In the wake of Towell's death, a brain injury charity has called for boxing to be banned.  Peter McCabe, chief executive of Headway, told Sky News: ""How many more young people have to lose their lives or end up disabled before we do something about it? ""We are living in the 21st century and yet this barbaric sport continues, it is wrong."" Meanwhile, the general secretary of the World Medical Association, Dr Otmar Kloiber, warned that the sport ""ruins"" the lives of boxers. He told Sky News: ""You can have an immediate fracture to the skull which results in the boxer immediately going down and being seriously hurt. ""You can also have effects on vessels which start bleeding and you get a haematoma ... which may not be observed and felt by the person that has been hit. ""Then it comes to a life-threatening situation after a few hours or the next day."" Dr Kloiber added: ""This is dangerous and even if you don't feel it in the moment, there is a very high price in the end. ""It will ruin the life of the boxer, there is a high chance of this."" But for ex-professional boxer Johnny Nelson, a former world cruiserweight champion, banning the sport is not the answer. He told Sky News: ""It can't be banned, the reason you have the Boxing Board of Control and these rules in place is because at one point this was underground and no one looking after the fighters."" Nelson added: ""The worst thing you could possibly do is ban boxing because then you would see a lot more situations like this occur."""

The hurricane is currently off the northern coast of Colombia and Venezuela but is forecast to move northwest, say monitors in the US. Its winds are gusting up to 155mph (250kph), making it one of the most powerful in recent years. It was previously a category 5 storm - the most powerful - but it has since weakened slightly, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Hurricane Matthew is one of the strongest storms to threaten the Caribbean since Hurricane Felix in 2007, which killed 150 people and caused $720m of damage. The most recent category 4 storm to hit the region was Hurricane Joaquin last year. That struck the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Antilles and the Turks and Caicos and caused $120m of damage and killed 34. If Matthew does strike Jamaica, it could be the worst to hit the island since Wilma, which hit as a tropical depression in 2005, causing $93m in damage. The NHC currently predicts that Matthew will tear across Jamaica before hitting the southern coast of Cuba late Monday or early Tuesday. Forecasters said that up to 15 inches (38cm) of rain could fall in Jamaica and southern Haiti but the NHC said isolated areas could receive up to 25 inches (63cm). Jamaicans have already begun stocking up on supplies of water and other food in case of a disaster, emptying store shelves. Local Government Minister Desmond McKenzie told The Star newspaper that authorities had been instructed to ""go full speed ahead"" with efforts to prepare. The US said its embassy in Jamaica would be closed on Monday and Tuesday for consular services ""due to the anticipated effects of Hurricane Matthew"". In Haiti, authorities warned residents living on the islands in the south of the country that they were ""first at risk,"" and urged them to prepare. Edgar Celestin, a spokesman for the Haitian civil protection agency, said: ""We invite them to secure the area surrounding their homes and begin to stock up on water and food."" The Dominican Republic has also been put on alert and Colombia issued a high-level alert for much of its northern coast, warning of ""extremely dangerous life-threatening conditions"" and of giant waves up to five meters high."

Griff Tomos, 20, started his career as a fireman, but recently decided to give beekeeping a try. He told Sky News: ""I never saw myself being a beekeeper until I worked there one summer in sixth form. ""I like being outside, it's good exercise as well. I think experience is the most important part. I just like the hard work of moving the bees up here and getting the heather in, it's all worth it."" In 1900 there were around a million beehives in the UK. However, there's been a 75% decline and today there are only 270,000. Of those, 65,000 are managed professionally. For apprentices, the Bee Farmers' Association Apprenticeship scheme isn't just about looking after the bees. Recruits learn carpentry, botany and how to produce honey. The director of Tropical Forest Products, David Wainwright, who also directs some apprenticeships said: ""What we were trying to do is get a new generation of people getting into farming because the average age of our members is 65, which is really old, so we need some young blood and we thought apprentices would be a good idea. ""It's really rewarding when you teach somebody something and then you see it being put into action and actually working."" Honey is hugely popular in the UK and yet we produce only 14% of what we eat. However, it's hoped that will change with more young people like Griff getting into the industry."

Her announcement of a ""Great Repeal Bill"" will see the 1972 European Communities Act repealed on the day the UK leaves the European Union.  It will all still apply though. The laws will be repealed only in the sense they will, in their entirety, be incorporated into UK law.  This will provide ""maximum possible certainty"" for the economy.  The substance of this is that the jurisdiction of the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (a key bone of contention for Leave campaigners Boris Johnson and Michael Gove) will end over English law. The Supreme Court will be Supreme. This would appear to sound the death knell for the idea that Britain will stay in the Single Market. It does not completely rule it out though. What it does do undoubtedly though is underline the involvement of Parliament in the Brexit process.  The Bill will have to pass through readings and votes in both the Commons and the Lords. The Lords are spoiling for a fight on this. The Commons has a large majority of Remain voters.  Parliament will surely respect the decision of the referendum, but it could be delayed, and terms amended, given the Government's small majority.  It makes the already Byzantine negotiation between the UK, the EU-27, the European Commission, Parliament and the World Trade Organisation, also a simultaneous negotiation with MPs of all parties, Lords and crossbenchers.  Then it gets very interesting. ECJ jurisdiction is hardwired into the devolution settlements of both Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is an open question as to whether legislative consent will be required at Holyrood (where it might not be given) and Stormont.  At the very least, it considerably strengthens the Remain nations' hand in talks with the PM. At most it is a constitutional Pandora's Box. The announcement from the PM does not prejudge the timing of Article 50 at all.  It is likely to be triggered before the Great Repeal Act becomes law.  A court case will decide whether a separate Parliamentary vote is required before that trigger. Sky News understands that UK diplomats have had almost no cooperation from EU partners on scoping out the contours of any deal. Expectations are growing of ""hard Brexit"". So Theresa May and David Davis, not yet able to say the when or the what, have offered up the ""how"".  We have moved from ""Brexit means Brexit"" to ""how Brexit will mean Brexit""."

It followed the discovery of an ancient burial site dating back around 2,000 years. Lawyers for the landowner asked police to stop operations on the land while he sought certain assurances. Police believe the area of land, near an old farmhouse, could be key to helping solve the 25 year old mystery. Ben Needham was last seen playing outside the farmhouse shortly before he vanished on 24 July, 1991. Over the years, most of the theories surrounding the toddler's disappearance centred around abduction. Detectives are now trying to determine whether Ben might have been accidentally crushed to death by a local digger driver, who'd been clearing farmland at the time. The driver, Konstantinos Barkas, died of cancer last year. His death prompted a local man to contact police and offer the new information. Detective Inspector Jon Cousins had been on his way to update Ben's mother Kerry when news of the land dispute broke. He returned to Kos to try to negotiate with the landowner and by Friday afternoon said the owner's concerns had been addressed and work had now commenced once again. In five days of excavations, nothing substantive has yet been found.  But investigators have made some smaller finds of possible interest. In a statement, South Yorkshire Police said: ""Our priority remains the investigation to find out what happened to Ben. ""We have been in direct contact with Ben's family throughout this process and a pre-arranged meeting with the family went ahead as planned.  ""We have their full support and we remain committed to finding answers for Ben's family and the people of Kos."""

The Royal Navy blew up the 1,100lb (500kg) bomb at 7am this morning - but not a ripple was detected on the water's surface. It left the confused navy crew bobbing in a rigid inflatable craft just over a mile to the east of the Isle of Wight, not knowing whether their efforts had worked. At 11.30am specialist divers took the plunge to investigate. They found that their mission had been a success, albeit a quiet one. The bomb had been found after it was dislodged from the seabed during dredging works.   The harbour entrance is being deepened to accept the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, next spring. It is the second time that World War Two explosives have been found during the dredging operation. A torpedo, discovered earlier this month, was also exploded at sea.

The extension comes after Monarch was forced to deny ""negative speculation"" it was in financial trouble. In a statement, Monarch said it received ""significant"" investment from its shareholders and is ""close to announcing the largest investment in its 48-year history"". Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield said he was ""excited about the additional capital coming into the group which will help us fund our future growth."" He added he was ""delighted"" to agree the deal to extend the firm's ATOL licence. ATOL protection ensures customers don't lose money or become stranded abroad if a travel firm collapses. The CAA said it would ""continue to monitor"" the Luton Airport based airline during the period of extension. Despite tougher market conditions, Monarch said it expected to make £40m in pre-tax profit by the end of its financial year in October. It is understood Greybull Capital, the carrier's owners, is in discussions with several interested parties about a potential takeover deal. Greybull bought a 90% stake in the airline as part of a £100m rescue deal in 2014. Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said the licence extension is ""good news for the pilots, crew, staff and customers"". He added: ""Although the Monarch licence has been extended temporarily for 12 days, my understanding is this will be sufficient to satisfy the regulator that long term funding is secure and details of this will emerge over the next few days."""
2016-10-02,A prominent First Nations leader who refused to meet Prince William has told Sky News the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge should have used their Royal tour of Canada to put a spotlight on the poverty facing indigenous people.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20161002053102/http://news.sky.com/story/first-nations-leader-explains-why-he-didnt-meet-prince-william-10600761,"Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, says he has been contacted by people around the world after his decision not attend an event earlier in the week. The black rod ceremony was meant to symbolise reconciliation between First Nation communities and the federal and provincial governments. He told Sky News: ""Had I participated and made some eloquent statement, it would have led to convey the normalisation of the appalling levels of poverty of indigenous peoples and the general public would have taken a deep breath and said: 'Well all is well and isn't that wonderful'."" He also said that representatives from indigenous communities in other Commonwealth countries have said they support his stand against the pageantry. It came as William and Kate visited the remote islands of Haida Gwaii, 60 miles off mainland Canada, on the penultimate day of their official visit. They have visited a number of First Nation communities this week to try to get a true sense of Canadian life. Addressing the Haida people, Prince William was careful to sidestep this politically sensitive issue. He said: ""The historic link between the Crown and the First Nations people is strong, and something that I hold dear to my heart. ""And so it is an honour for me to be here with you, to see that your traditions remain strong."" The Royal couple then opened a new hospital on the island, before heading out on a boat, on which they held freshly caught crabs and participated in fishing, one of the main sources of income for this remote community.  Canada has been forced in recent years to confront the discrimination of First Nation people. Historically, they have had less access to healthcare provision and education. A truth and reconciliation committee was set up to look into the scandal of residential schools where indigenous children were forced to integrate into Canadian society. They were taken away from their families and punished for speaking their traditional languages.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said it is one of his priorities to address the social problems faced by the hundreds of First Nation communities across Canada."

Cambridge Analytica is a political tech company that is delivering hypertargeted - and hyperpersuasive - messages to people on social media.   Working for the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica crunches billions of data points - from social media, credit card histories, supermarket loyalty schemes, TV watching habits - to tailor political adverts.  It previously worked for the Ted Cruz campaign, as well as Nato and the Ministry of Defence.  Chief executive Alexander Nix told Sky News: ""Today in the United States we have somewhere close to four or five thousand data points on every individual. ""The traditional model where 50 million people receive the same blanket advert is being replaced by extremely individualistic targeting. ""So we're able to identify clusters of people who care about a particular issue, pro-life or gun rights, and to then create an advert on that issue, and we can nuance the messaging of that advert according to how people see the world, according to their personalities."" Cambridge Analytica's method relies on machine learning. It starts with a detailed survey, often presented as a psychological test.  The tech company creates these and seeds them on Facebook, where they are filled in by hundreds of thousands of people.  Those answers are combined with data, bought or licensed from brokers and sourced from social media, to create models of their personality. Those models are then applied at a population-level scale. Mr Nix said: ""Each one of these data points on its own is not that revealing, but the sum of them begins to paint a fairly comprehensive picture.  ""So we model the personality of every adult across the United States, some 230 million people."" The technology then identifies key voter types, who receive tailored messages - including Facebook and banner adverts.  Unlike traditional media, hypertargeted online and social messaging is not well regulated. Some researchers are concerned about privacy issues, as well as the effect of highly individualised messages on political discourse.  Carl Miller, research director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media, told Sky News: ""The technology gets better every day, the amount of data about people gets bigger every day. ""And yet public awareness of all of this is not moving very fast at all. The technologies might as well be magic to most of us, given how much we know about them. ""There's a big issue here, that data science is flashing forwards and public acceptability of it - and even knowledge - isn't catching up."" However, Mr Nix said Cambridge Analytica does not believe its methods are ""intrusive"". He said: ""The data we're using is freely available to license or purchase, and most of this data has had the agreement of the users to be licensed or sold."""

But they failed to find anything that might have caused it. However, a later Met Police statement said: ""A subsequent search of the airport led to the discovery of what is believed to be a CS gas spray. ""Whilst the cause of the incident has not yet been confirmed, officers are investigating whether it was the result of an accidental discharge of the spray.

London City Airport advised people due to fly to check with their airlines for latest flight information.

Police say no new information has come to light and they are appealing to anyone who saw Mr McKeague on 24 September to contact them. After leaving a bar, he got a takeaway and was seen on CCTV walking with the food before sleeping in a shop door for a couple of hours. He was believed to have been drunk and was caught on camera heading to the rear part of a row of shops, but was not seen coming back out. It is believed he may have tried to walk back to his base at RAF Honington. Mr McKeague's uncle, Tony Ringe, told Sky News the serviceman's disappearance was ""so out of character"" and there was ""no evidence"" he went missing ""out of choice"". Mr Ringe said he wanted people to remember if they spotted his nephew in other places that night.He said: ""Could you have seen him in a vehicle with other people, not on his own, in a different context? That may help unlock a sighting.""Officers have searched a bin lorry, believing Mr McKeague's black Nokia Lumia phone had been lost or discarded and ended up in the rubbish, but it could not be found."

The orders, which aim to stop threatening or violent behaviour, allow councils to ban various activities in certain areas. The Kennel Club says that, in the last two years, the orders have also been used to prevent dogs from running or playing off a lead in 1,100 public places. Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club secretary, said some councils have imposed PSPOs to wage a ""war on dogs and their owners"". She told Sky News: ""We really need councils to take the whole subject of consulting seriously and not to penalise responsible dog owners alongside the irresponsible.""   Critics have labelled PSPOs a ""busybodies' charter"". In one case an order was used by Salford City Council to criminalise the use of ""foul and abusive language"". Guide dog user Paul Jarman is one of those who have been fined for failing to comply with a PSPO. He told Sky News: ""Unless there is some kind of limitation placed on local authorities as to how they can use these Public Space Protection Orders, we are going to turn the whole business of guide dog owning into a postcode lottery."" The RSPCA warned local authorities to use the orders ""cautiously"". A spokesman said: ""Where dogs are excluded or open spaces are restricted, it is essential that local authorities make sure other open spaces are available close by. ""We hope local authorities issue PSPOs cautiously and do not use them as a blanket power that punishes the responsible majority in an effort to tackle problems created by an irresponsible few."""

Rescue workers and hospital staff say at least 73 people died in the crash, though the official death toll remains at 53. Other victims remain trapped in the wreckage. The accident occurred around 120km (75 miles) west of the capital Yaounde while the Camrail inter-city train was en route to the port city of Douala, Cameroon's transport minister Edgar Alain Mebe Ngo'o said. ""The cause of the accident is not yet clear,"" he said, adding that several of the injured were in very serious condition. ""There are the bodies of women, children. There are many,"" said one employee of Camrail, which is operated by France's Bollore, adding that three of his colleagues were among the victims. The train is said to have been crammed with people due to road traffic disruption between Yaounde and Douala.

The train is believed to have a capacity of 600 though is thought to have been carrying 1,300 people at the time of the crash.

Yet Mrs May's expected U-turn on Heathrow expansion is just the latest example of the new Prime Minister ditching or changing a David Cameron policy. Back in 2009, when he was Leader of the Opposition, Mr Cameron said: ""The third runway at Heathrow is not going ahead, no ifs, no buts."" In all, Mrs May has performed 12 U-turns in just under 100 days as Prime Minister. Here are eight Cameron policies she and her Government have dumped: :: Grammar schools. In 2007 Mr Cameron angered some Tories by scrapping party policy to bring back grammars and secondary moderns. Now Mrs May has reinstated it. :: Hinkley Point. In a shock announcement, the Government put the brakes on the Chinese-backed nuclear power station, a project championed by George Osborne :: Obesity. In January, David Cameron threatened drinks companies with a ""sugar tax"". Now Theresa May has watered down the crackdown by abandoning curbs on junk food ads. :: Northern Powerhouse. The new PM initially appeared lukewarm about Mr Osborne's flagship policy and has had to reassure the North that the Government still backs it :: Help to Buy. Another Osborne pet project, to help homeowners, has been dumped by his successor Philip Hammond and will be scrapped at the end of the year. :: Lloyds Bank sell-off. Mr Hammond has abandoned Mr Osborne's privatisation pledge to sell the Government's stake in the high street bank to small investors. :: Prison reforms. Michael Gove planned to devolve more power to governors. :: Deficit. Mr Hammond has also ditched Mr Osborne's vow to balance Britain's books by 2020 and thrown his predecessor's hard hats and high-viz yellow jackets in the bin. And here are three of her own Government's policies or announcements which have been very quickly dropped since she became Prime Minister in July: :: EU citizens. In her leadership campaign Mrs May refused to guarantee the status of EU nationals living in the UK. Now the Government is saying they can stay when Britain leaves the EU. :: Foreign doctors. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt suggested foreign doctors would not stay if they could be replaced by British recruits. Mrs May then failed in an interview to say the policy would go ahead. :: Foreign staff lists. Home Secretary Amber Rudd's controversial plan to force companies to publish how many foreign staff they employ, unveiled at the Tory conference, has now been abandoned. Quite a list. Not exactly Theresa's dirty dozen, but more like a clean-out of unpopular policies, out-of-date policies and policies on which the Prime Minister disagrees with Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne."

Two victims described in court how Anglesea had abused them as teenagers. One said he had been handed around ""like a handbag"" by a paedophile ring that preyed on children in the care system in north Wales. Now, a third victim has told Sky News how Anglesea's brutal offending went even further than was outlined in court. The man, who only wishes to be identified by his first name Michael, first spoke to Sky in 2012 about his tormented childhood in the care system. He has revealed that Anglesea was also one of his abusers and branded the ex-policeman a ""monster"". He told Sky News: ""Today is another reminder for everyone of the secretive world of sadistic bullying and sexual abuse that we endured in the north Wales 'care' system. ""This is a great victory for his victims, their loved ones and the police officers from Operation Pallial. ""Against great adversity we have shown courage and determination in standing up to him - he is literally a monster. ""This man made my life a personal hell, all along I thought it was something that I had endured alone."" Michael had given evidence to Operation Pallial detectives at the National Crime Agency and was preparing to go to court as part of the case but was unexpectedly dropped by prosecutors without full explanation. He added: ""My case against him stood for over a year. It included gross indecency, it will always haunt me. ""Now as he finds himself guilty only God can forgive. But we'll never forgive or forget."" Anglesea claimed he had ""lived a nightmare"" after he was accused of sexually abusing youngsters in a newspaper article published back in 1991. Following publication he successfully sued and in 1994 won £375,000 in libel damages from four media organisations. Now, 25 years later and convicted of similar offences, Anglesea faces jail. Nine people have been convicted of abusing children in care as a result of Operation Pallial, including care-home owner John Allen, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2014. Ed Beltrami, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Wales, said: ""Gordon Anglesea abused a position of power and authority in order to prey on very young and vulnerable victims. ""I would like to thank all the victims, survivors and witnesses who had the courage to come forward and provide important evidence in this case.

The temperature that day reached as high as 31C, according to the first warrant filed in the case. A court has heard that while he was at work, Harris, 34, sent explicit messages to a teenage girl and asked her for a photo of her breasts. The girl, now aged 19, said she sent a photo with a message which read: ""I'm super sunburned."" Harris allegedly replied: ""Yummy."" The teenager told Glynn County Court that she met Harris online in 2013, when he responded to a comment she posted on the app Whisper stating she wanted a sexual relationship like the one depicted in the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey. She said: ""When it started, it was strictly sexual. ""Then at times it would be like a normal conversation."" The court heard that Harris knew her age and that she attended high school. According to a transcript of their text messages read in court, Harris once asked for a photo of her breasts and she replied: ""I'm at school."" As well as being charged with murder, Harris is also accused of sending graphic, sexual text messages and photos of his penis to the teenage girl. Prosecutors allege that Harris killed his son intentionally because he wanted to escape from the responsibilities of being a husband and a father. The 34-year-old's lawyers say the death was an accident and Harris forgot to drop the toddler off on his way to work."

They said the teddy bears represented the thousands of children trapped in rebel-held eastern areas of the city. The Syrian government regime recently stepped up attacks, with civilians being pulled dead from the rubble after numerous devastating barrel bombings. Heavy clashes between regime and rebel forces followed the end of a ""humanitarian pause"" in Aleppo on Saturday night, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. During the protest in central London, demonstrators wore ""Save Aleppo"" t-shirts and some carried signs urging ""No bomb zone now."" Calls for action ranged from a no-fly zone to more pressure on Russia, Syria's key ally in the conflict. Mulligan, star of films such as Shame and Drive - and an ambassador for the charity War Child - said one of her daughter's toys was among the teddies. :: Aleppo under siege: a timeline The actress said she hoped the protesters could send a ""real message"" that ""we really want our government to be the one to step up and lead this and try to stop the fighting in Aleppo"". ""We need to hold people accountable,"" said the actress. ""There are widespread accusations of war crimes being committed and that can't be done with impunity ... They're breaking humanitarian international laws. ""I've got a one-year-old daughter and I think for a moment about what it would be like for my daughter to experience any of the things that are happening in Syria. ""It's unbearable - it's a lottery where you are born in this world. We were lucky enough to be born here and these children are born in Syria, in Aleppo, and they are experiencing a living hell.""

The most sensitive part of the fleet's journey was through the English Channel's narrowest point at the Strait of Dover. Vladimir Putin's armed flotilla is believed to be heading to Syria to support Russia's military operations in the war-torn country. Asked whether the Russian deployment was an indication that Moscow regarded Britain as weak, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""I would reject suggestions that the Russians feel we are too weak. Clearly, we are not weak at all."" HMS Duncan has joined HMS Richmond to meet the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier task group in the Norwegian Sea. https://t.co/q1EtXRVhVY pic.twitter.com/3eJ40G0cTk A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""It is pretty unambiguous that they have set a course to pass through the Dover Strait."" He added: ""When they are clear of the Dover traffic separation scheme, they will probably break back out in a formation scheme and be on their way. ""We still don't know where that is and how they are going to get there, but everything so far has been exactly how we would have expected."" British ships, including two destroyers - HMS Duncan and HMS Dragon - were deployed earlier this week and have been monitoring the Russian vessels. The Russian fleet, which has been heading south from the Norwegian Sea, has also been escorted by frigates HMS Richmond and HMS Duncan. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the Russian naval deployment was aimed at ""testing"" British capabilities. ""The Russian fleet that is now sailing from the north, presumably down into the Mediterranean, is clearly designed to test the alliance. ""It's being marked every step of the way by the Royal Navy and ships and planes of other NATO members as well. ""It's clearly designed ... to test our response, and any weaknesses in the alliance, and we must make sure we respond in due measure. ""That fleet will be marked, shadowed every inch of the way."" Shadowing ships is a regular task for the Royal Navy, which has been supported by Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft this time, it is understood. Images of the Russian convoy, taken from a North Sea oil rig, also show the fleet being shadowed by a NATO Hercules C-130. It is feared the powerful force could soon join in attacks on Syria's besieged city of Aleppo. A NATO official said: ""Russia has the right to operate in international waters. There are plans in place for NATO navies to monitor the Russian ships as they head for the Mediterranean. ""At the same time, the deployment of the carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean does not inspire confidence that Russia is working towards a political solution to the conflict in Syria."" According to the Russian news agency Tass, Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told a meeting in September the plan was to bolster the ""combat capabilities"" of the country's Mediterranean fleet. A statement from the fleet to the agency said: ""Special focus will be made on safeguarding security of maritime traffic and other types of maritime economic activity of Russia and also on responding to the new kinds of modern threats such as piracy and international terrorism."""

But an uneasy summit for the new leader as she finds herself under pressure from the US and other countries over trade links in a post-Brexit world. She also faced questions over Chinese investment in the UK after her decision to review Beijing's investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear plant - which she has since approved. :: Picture Five - Bilateral talks between Theresa May and Chancellor Merkel Mrs May chooses to visit her strongest continental ally, Chancellor Merkel, for her first foreign trip as Prime Minister - a sign of the importance the Prime Minister places on this bilateral relationship as she begins to negotiate Britain's exit from the European Union."

The Government stepped in and ordered a public inquiry after the scheme was unanimously approved by Northumberland Council in July. A final decision will be taken by ministers next year in what campaign group Friends of the Earth claims is a test of the Government's commitment to environmental issues. The organisation's spokesman Guy Shrubsole told Sky News: ""It's very welcome that for the first time ever the Government has called in a coal mine on climate change grounds. ""And this means there's going to be a public inquiry next year which could set up conditions for the end of coal in the UK."" He added: ""It's certainly the case that the Government needs to get on with phasing out coal power stations as it's already committed to doing. ""We understand it's going to be launching a consultation on this soon but it's also the case that if you're going to stop burning the coal there's no need to dig it up as well."" Members of the Save Druridge Bay protest group claim the new mine would ruin the windswept coastline and destroy tourist trade. Organiser Duncan Lawrence runs a cafe a few fields away from the site. ""We employ 18 local people full time and part time and customers have said that if this mine goes ahead they'll go to other parts of Northumberland and to other beaches,"" he said. According the Coal Authority, there are 13 working surface mines in Britain. But Friends of the Earth estimates that permission is in place to extract at least 28 million tonnes of coal from other sites. Jeannie Kielty from Banks Mining told Sky News the industry has a place in Britain's energy market. She argues that the Druridge Bay mine would reduce reliance on imported coal between now and 2025 when all UK coal fired power stations will have been shut down to meet climate change targets. She said: ""There is a market there for the coal in the medium term. ""We believe it makes much more sense to mine the coal and provide the investment and jobs in Northumberland and the North East than to send that money abroad."""

Sara Broadhead, 35, said her husband was ""a brave hero who managed to save the lives of his wife and eldest daughter"". ""Unfortunately he couldn't save our youngest daughter Kiera and gave his own life trying to save hers,"" she added. ""He was a very kind man and Kiera was a vibrant, independent loving girl.

A decision is expected to be announced by the Government on Tuesday following a meeting of the sub-committee, with Mrs May allowing Conservative MPs to publicly oppose the verdict. Sources said that Gatwick's letter would reiterate the case for the Sussex airport to land a new runway ahead of Heathrow. ""We will focus on the benefits of competition, the relative cost of the two airports' plans, and the straightforward and clear path to delivery,"" an insider said on Saturday. In addition to Mrs May, ministers on the Cabinet sub-committee include Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, and Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary. A decision next week will be followed by a year-long public consultation and then a final vote in the House of Commons. People close to Gatwick said it would highlight the ""difference in risk profile"" of its scheme and that of Heathrow Airport, which is pushing for a more expensive project to construct a new third runway. Another proposal, from Heathrow Hub, would extend and then divide one of the site's two existing runways. ""Heathrow's project carries considerable planning, financing and construction risks against Gatwick's very modest profile in respect of these risks,"" said a Gatwick insider. ""Gatwick has underwritten substantially all of the risks associated with its project through guaranteeing a cap on charges whereas Heathrow is asking the airlines and their passengers, and the Government to bear the risks of its project."" ""That's what Monday's letter will highlight."" The owner of British Airways, International Airlines Group, has vehemently opposed Heathrow's plans, saying that it would unfairly bear much of the cost through higher charges. IAG already pays close to £900m annually to Heathrow's parent company. Executives at Gatwick have said the airport and its shareholders are prepared to commit to building a second runway under all circumstances because existing traffic growth there supports its expansion case. Industry sources expect the Government to further growth in regional aviation capacity alongside the decision to grow at least one of the two largest London airports. The Prime Minister's decision to suspend collective responsibility for the decision has been interpreted as a sign that she will give the green light to Heathrow, in line with the recommendation made last year by the Airports Commission. A number of her top team, including Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, bitterly oppose the expansion of Heathrow, while politicians such as Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, have publicly endorsed Gatwick's case."

The Old Bailey heard that when investigators searched Brizzi's home in Southwark, south London, PC Semple's DNA was found on the blade of a blender, a cooking pot, chopsticks, on a chopping board and in the oven. Officers also discovered bite marks on a piece of bone recovered from the kitchen, the jury was told. Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, said: ""The defendant cannot have confined himself to dismembering Gordon Semple and disposing of his body either by acid in the bath or else in the dustbins. ""Instead, the prosecution suggest it would be open to the jury to find that the defendant cooked part of his body and ate it."" PC Semple, 59, was on duty when he arranged to meet Brizzi, via gay dating app Grindr, for ""hot, dirty, sleazy"" sex on 1 April this year. Days later neighbours noticed a ""revolting smell"" from Brizzi's flat. When one alerted the police, two officers arrived to find bottles of chemicals scattered in the hall and ""blue-green liquid"" in the bath with ""flesh-coloured globules floating in the water"", Mr Aylett said. One of the officers looked inside a bin liner on the floor and saw a human hand and part of a spine, the court heard. Brizzi said he had HIV and had been told by Satan to ""kill, kill, kill"", jurors heard. The 50-year-old later allegedly claimed he disposed of body parts he had been unable to break up by taking them on his bicycle to a quiet spot by the River Thames. Brizzi said there was still a foot, hand and leg at his flat ""which I tried to roast as well"", the court was told.  While in the custody suite after his arrest, the Italian allegedly said: ""I thought I was getting away with it.  ""I had nearly finished but I took a shot (of crystal meth). I was going to finish the job today. ""As you can see, this man was a very big man and all I have left is two buckets."" Brizzi denies murder but has admitted obstructing a coroner by dismembering and disposing of the body. He says PC Semple died accidentally during a ""sex game gone wrong"". The trial continues."
