2016-01-08,Cologne's police chief has been sent into early retirement following criticism over his handling of allegations of sex assaults and violence by migrants on New Year's Eve.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618820/cologne-police-chief-removed-over-assaults,"Cologne's police chief has been sent into early retirement following criticism over his handling of allegations of sex assaults and violence by migrants on New Year's Eve. Wolfgang Albers admitted mistakes were made in a report compiled after more than 100 New Year revellers were sexually assaulted, robbed or threatened during the city's celebrations, mostly by migrants and asylum seekers. Cologne police said the decision to retire Mt Albers would be formally discussed by North Rhine-Westphalia's governing Cabinet on Tuesday, but he would not be returning to his job. Performance artist Milo Moire's nude protest outside the cathedral The sacking came as a women's rights campaigner and performance artist named Milo Moire staged a naked protest over the assaults. Ms Moire stood in front of Cologne Cathedral brandishing a placard which read: ""Respect us. We are not fair game even when we are naked."" She later told Sky News she had ""zero tolerance"" of the attacks and wanted to make her feelings known. ""It was important for me to go onto the street and make a statement.that we women have fought so long for our rights and it's important now to say no, that's not normal (behaviour), we have our rights... and freedom."" Earlier Germany's interior ministry spokesman Tobias Plate said police had identified 31 people suspected of playing a role in the violence, 18 of them asylum seekers. Mr Plate said the vast majority of the 32 criminal acts documented by federal police on the night were related to theft and bodily injury, and three to sexual assaults. He said of the 31 people questioned, nine had been Algerian, eight Moroccan, five Iranian, and four Syrian. Two German citizens, an Iraqi, a Serb and a US citizen were also among those seen to have committed crimes during the night. :: Cologne Attacks: Offenders Could Be Deported An internal police report following the violence has described how women were forced to run through mobs of drunken men. The document, made public by German newspapers, came amid allegations that officers struggled to cope with the large crowds of disorderly revellers - as ""several thousand males with a migrant background"" hurled fireworks and bottles. It recounted how policemen were met by ""anxious citizens with crying and shocked children"" as numbers swelled at Cologne's main train station in the minutes before midnight. Jens Floeren, a federal police spokesman, has confirmed the authenticity of the report - but stressed it was the ""subjective assessment"" of one officer who was at the scene. Meanwhile, Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a ""fundamental"" debate on how to integrate the 1.1 million refugees who were registered in the country last year. She described the assaults as ""repugnant criminal acts that Germany will not accept"". She added: ""The feeling women had in this case of being at people's mercy, without any protection, is intolerable for me personally as well. ""We must examine again and again whether we have already done what is necessary in terms of deportations from Germany in order to send clear signals to those who are not prepared to abide by our legal order."" Members of Cologne's Muslim community, including some who have lived in the city for decades, have joined other Germans in condemning the attacks. :: Cologne Mayor Under Fire Over Attacks Comment One woman said: ""Everywhere it says this has something to do with Muslims. What I read and learned in the Koran is completely different. ""I've been here for 30 years myself and I've never seen anything like this."" Elsewhere Swiss police have said several women were also robbed and sexually assaulted in Zurich on New Year's Eve in attacks ""a little bit similar"" to those reported in Cologne. Officers in Finland have also confirmed there were a higher-than-average number of sexual harassment complaints in Helsinki as revellers welcomed in 2016. Officials claimed they were tipped off about groups of asylum seekers who were planning to assault women. Swedish police say two asylum seekers are among the suspects after at least 15 women reported being groped on New Year's Eve in Kalmar."
2016-01-08,"Adolf Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf - meaning ""My Struggle"" - has gone on sale in German bookstores for the first time in more than 70 years.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618909/hitlers-mein-kampf-on-sale-again-in-germany,"Adolf Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf - meaning ""My Struggle"" - has gone on sale in German bookstores for the first time in more than 70 years. The book has been banned in the country since the end of the Second World War. The southern German state of Bavaria, which has held the copyright of the text since the Allies gave it control of the main Nazi publishing house in 1945, has not published the book out of respect for victims of the Nazis. However, the copyright of the anti-Semitic manifesto in which Hitler justifies the Holocaust, expired on 1 January this year. The book, which costs €59 (£43), has been reprinted amid strong criticism from Jewish communities as a new 2,000-page edition by the Munich-based Institute of Contemporary History. It includes a critical commentary and analysis of the Nazi leader's ideology which historians argue is an important historical and educational tool. Hitler wrote the book mostly in the mid-1920s while in jail for treason. It set out two ideas he put into practice as Germany's leader - annexing neighbouring countries to gain ""lebensraum"" - or ""living space"" - for Germans, and his hatred of Jews, which led to the Holocaust. The institute said the reprint aims to ""deconstruct and put into context Hitler's writing"". ""How were his theses conceived? What objectives did he have?"" it said. ""And most important: which counterarguments do we have, given our knowledge today of the countless claims, lies and assertions of Hitler?"" Josef Kraus, the head of Germany's teachers' association, endorsed the reprint. He said ""I find it's right to now publish an edition with scientific comments because this way, something shadowy, a myth can be destroyed."" ""My experience as a citizen and as a teacher is that something which is forbidden creates a lot of curiosity. This way, something can be demystified."" But Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said Holocaust survivors would be ""offended by the sale of the anti-Semitic work in bookstores again"" - which he argued historians already had easy access to. ""Now, it would be best to leave Mein Kampf where it belongs: the poison cabinet of history,"" he added. A version of the book is also being published in France, but the ban will continue in several European countries that were under Nazi occupation, including Austria and the Netherlands."
2016-01-08,"The British economy could be badly damaged in 2016 by a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks abroad or higher public spending at home, George Osborne has warned.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618062/uk-economy-faces-dangerous-cocktail-of-risks,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent The British economy could be badly damaged in 2016 by a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks abroad or higher public spending at home, George Osborne has warned. The Chancellor claimed the economy could be dragged into decline by economic problems in China, Brazil or Russia, falling oil prices or the political crisis in the Middle East. In a speech to business leaders in Cardiff, he warned against complacency or a sense of ""mission accomplished"", despite the economy performing ""better than almost anyone dared to hope"". And attacking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, he said Britain must not ""go back to the bad old ways"" of spending beyond its means or more ""debt-fuelled public spending"". Mr Osborne said: ""Anyone who thinks it's mission accomplished with the British economy is making a grave mistake. 2016 is the year we can get down to work and make the lasting changes Britain so badly needs. ""Or it'll be the year we look back at as the beginning of the decline. This year, quite simply, the economy is mission critical."" On risks from overseas, Mr Osborne said: ""Last year was the worst for global growth since the crash and this year opens with a dangerous cocktail of new threats. ""For Britain, the only antidote to that is confronting complacency and sticking to the course we've charted."" He pointed to the slowdown in China, problems in Brazil and Russia, the slide in commodity prices, the risk of stagnation and political developments in the Middle East as potential hazards. He claimed the UK's strong economic performance is ""sadly lacking"" in many other parts of the world and that the IMF believes world growth in 2015 was the slowest since 2009. If problems in emerging markets persist, or market volatility continues, global growth in 2016 could be much the same, he claimed. ""Yes - there's good news here and right across the UK,"" Mr Osborne said. ""That's because we have a national economic plan that backs business and skills, and is delivering growth, high employment, and rising wages. ""But as we start 2016, I worry about a creeping complacency in the national debate about our economy. ""A sense that the hard work at home is complete and that we're immune from the risks abroad. A sense we can let up, and the good economic news will just keep rolling in."" On falling oil prices, Mr Osborne said: ""That is good for consumers and business customers here in Britain, bad news for the oil and gas industry, worrying for the creditors who have lent to it, and a massive problem for the countries that depend on it. ""Meanwhile, the political developments in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia and Iran, concern us all. ""Yes, the British economy has performed better than almost anyone dared to hope. And as an issue the economy has slipped down the list of many people's everyday concerns. But the biggest risk is that people think that it's job done."" Referring to Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell, Mr Osborne said: ""Many in our politics encourage this, irresponsibly suggesting that we can just go back to the bad old ways and spend beyond our means for evermore. ""Though the year is only seven days old, already we hear their predictable calls for billions of pounds more debt-fuelled public spending. They reject all the reforms we propose to deliver better quality public services for less taxpayers' money. ""Today I want to issue this warning: unless we finish the job of fixing the public finances, to get Britain back into the black by finally spending less than we borrow, all of the progress we have made together could still easily be reversed."" Speaking ahead of the speech, Mr McDonnell accused Mr Osborne of failing to prepare the UK economy for ""the global headwinds that will not hit us"". He told Sky News: ""There is this lethal cocktail of domestic economic problems as well by failing to invest in our economy. ""The problem is this - he says he has got a long term economic plan, but it isn’t long term, it’s short term. We get different messages every three months. ""What he should be doing is investing in our economy, investing in our infrastructure, in skills, in our manufacturing base."""
2016-01-08,Bill Clinton told Tony Blair of his fears for Princes William and Harry in a phone call the day after Princess Diana died.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618753/clintons-fear-for-princes-revealed-in-blair-calls,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent Bill Clinton told Tony Blair of his fears for Princes William and Harry in a phone call the day after Princess Diana died. In the same call, Mr Blair said her death was ""like a star falling"" and said he would personally miss her. The emotional private conversation, on 1 September 1997, is disclosed in documents published by the Clinton Presidential Library. The transcripts include personal conversations between the two leaders It is one of many between the two leaders and political soulmates now released in 500 pages of transcripts, covering major international issues like Iraq, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. But the transcripts also include deeply personal conversations, such as one when Mr Blair was shocked at becoming a father again in 2000. After Diana died in 1997, just months after he became prime minister, Mr Blair famously paid tribute to her publicly by declaring: ""She was the people's princess."" His former spin doctor Alastair Campbell has always claimed authorship of that phrase. But the transcripts reveal Mr Blair also spoke colourfully about her in private, too. He told the then-president about the last time he had spoken to her. ""She said that were it not for the boys, she'd be off the board,"" he said. Blair declared Diana was the 'people's princess' after she died in 1997 Mr Blair added: ""She was not the Royal Family but she was liked by ordinary people, it gave her problems with the Royal establishment."" Then he said: ""I will personally miss her, it's like a star falling. She was a star for them."" Mr Clinton, expressing his fears for William and Harry, told the PM: ""I worry a lot about those kids now."" Another personal chat came in April 2000 as Mr Blair and wife Cherie prepared for the birth of their fourth child, Leo. Mr Clinton called the PM ""dad"" and joked that after the presidential elections he was ""available for babysitting duties"". As they discussed balancing work and family life, Mr Blair confessed: ""I could do with a bit of help, I tell you. ""Cherie is in great form but just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Clinton called Blair 'Dad' when Cherie became pregnant ""I tell you, just the thought and I feel as if my life's about to begin again."" Discussions on policy issues included a telephone call in January 1999, when Mr Clinton spoke about his concerns over Northern Ireland. ""I'm really worried,"" he said. ""Gerry Adams was here not long ago, and I had a firm talk with him. ""I am really getting kind of frustrated by them not doing anything."" Mr Clinton also warned Mr Blair about how Iraq could ""become a real nightmare"" for him when they discussed how to deal with Saddam Hussein. He could have had no idea then just how big a nightmare Iraq would become for Mr Blair. ""I think if we say to this guy, 'If you start to comply, we will lift sanctions', he will quickly re-establish the weapons of mass destruction programme, and it will become known in two years that he has. ""It may not happen while I'm in office, but it will for you. ""It could become a real nightmare for you."" Some of the conversations now sound bizarre, including an exchange about how the ""only decoration"" in John Prescott's office was a bowl of bananas. The president then said: ""My staff won't let me talk to you unless I have a banana at hand. ""I'm sitting here with a banana; it's a big, ugly, brownish one."" At that point, Mr Blair replied: ""Now Bill, I thought we should have a word about Kosovo."""
2016-01-08,A French BASE jumper and tightrope walker has died in an accident while preparing to perform a balloon stunt.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618986/daredevil-dies-in-hot-air-balloon-accident,"A French BASE jumper and tightrope walker has died in an accident while preparing to perform a balloon stunt. Tancrede Melet, 32, was attached to the hot-air balloon with teammates from the extreme sports group Flying Frenchies when it took off unexpectedly. His teammates released themselves and jumped clear but Melet remained suspended until he was around 30 metres (100ft) in the air when he fell to the ground in Diois, France. Melet was described as a 'visionary bird' by colleagues. Pic: Seb Montaz It is thought he was preparing to walk on a 'slackline' between two balloons, a stunt he has performed before. Writing on Facebook, his friend and filmmaker Seb Montaz-Rosset paid tribute to the man he described as a ""gifted visionary"" who had become meticulous about safety since becoming a father. I Believe I Can Fly (Flight of the Frenchies) from sebastien montaz-rosset on Vimeo. ""Such a talented and visionary bird is a rare breed. I haven’t met many like him. ""Don’t be too quick to judge; he was twice as careful since becoming a father to Leonie. ""He didn’t fall while attempting a complicated stunt - the clown slipped on a banana skin, one of those devious things you can’t see coming, clipping the wings of our most brilliant bird. ""Tanc, we won't forget you - you showed us how to make our dreams come true."" Melet's extraordinary feats thrilled thousands who watched his stunts, many of which were filmed by Montaz-Rosset Very sad to hear of loss of Tancrède Melet. We’ve lost a great adventurer!
#TancredeMelet #FlyingFrenchies pic.twitter.com/xUNuUF50yq His speciality was combining BASE jumping with slacklining – walking barefoot across a thin piece of tensioned webbing suspended 3,000ft above a gorge or between two balloons, before jumping off and deploying a parachute. He featured in advertisements and participated in lectures and video festivals with his Flying Frenchies teammates. His profile on the group's website states Melet resigned from his job as an engineer to follow his ""quest of freedom"" and that his motto was to ""try everything, at least once"". Speaking before his death, he said: ""This feeling of freedom is something you can't describe. ""It's such a strong feeling, falling for 15 seconds or so before the parachute opens, you shout out and let it all go."""
2016-01-08,The pound has slipped to a near six-year low against the US dollar as prospects of a UK interest rate hike fade amid gathering gloom for the domestic and world economies.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618430/pound-hits-near-six-year-low-against-dollar,"The pound has slipped to a near six-year low against the US dollar as prospects of a UK interest rate hike fade amid gathering gloom for the domestic and world economies. Sterling was trading below $1.46, at its lowest level since May 2010, and was also sharply lower against the euro. The fall is good news for UK manufacturers trying to sell their goods at competitive prices abroad. It comes after the British Chambers of Commerce warned that factory exports grew at their weakest level since 2009 late last year and that the UK manufacturing sector was ""close to stagnation"" .  But the slide in sterling is less welcome to holidaymakers as their pound will buy them less in foreign currency. It comes a day after forecasts for UK growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 were revised lower as figures showed the expansion in the dominant services sector slowed last month. The pound had spiked during the summer at above $1.59 as expectations grew of an early interest rate hike by the Bank of England. Bank governor Mark Carney did little to dampen the speculation at the time when he said that the decision on a rates rise would come into sharper focus around the turn of the year. Rates have remained on hold at the historic low of 0.5% since March 2009. But with inflation remaining close to zero, prospects for a rise in 2016 still look some way off, especially with the price of Brent crude sliding further to a near 12-year low at under $33 a barrel. Meanwhile the UK economic picture has since become more gloomy, with disappointing growth and earnings figures. Fears of a slowdown in China, the world's second biggest economy, have also weighed on global sentiment. Chancellor George Osborne is warning of a ""dangerous cocktail"" of risks abroad or higher spending at home. It all points to continued inaction by the Bank of England even though central bankers in the US have already started lifting rates from near-zero levels after it had also slashed them during the recession. The housing market has been buoyed by low interest rates. Latest figures from Halifax showed a stronger than expected 1.7% increase in house prices last month meaning they rose by 9.5% over 2015 to reach an average of £208,000. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ""The pound has weakened as expectations of a Bank of England interest rate hike any time soon have waned and there has also been a mounting market focus on the UK's referendum on EU membership. ""Expectations of an interest rate hike have been pushed back by recent mixed UK economic data, a relapse in earnings growth and the likelihood that inflation will stay lower for longer due to oil prices falling to new lows."""
2016-01-08,Eddie Redmayne has been nominated for a BAFTA award for the second year in a row after winning plaudits for his role in The Danish Girl.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618919/eddie-redmayne-gets-second-bafta-nod-in-a-row,"Eddie Redmayne has been nominated for a BAFTA award for the second year in a row after winning plaudits for his role in The Danish Girl. Stephen Fry and actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw announced the shortlist for the prizes at BAFTA's headquarters in London. The British star, who won a BAFTA and Oscar last year for The Theory Of Everything, will face Leonardo DiCaprio in the best actor category. DiCaprio, who stars in The Revenant, has been nominated for a BAFTA three times but has never won. The only other actor to win two years in a row is Colin Firth for A Single Man in 2009 and The King's Speech in 2010. Bryan Cranston (Trumbo), Matt Damon (The Martian) and Michael Fassbender (Steve Jobs) are also named in the best actor category. DiCaprio in The Revenant In the best actress category The Lady In The Van star Dame Maggie Smith will face a hotly-tipped Cate Blanchett, who stars in Carol. Redmayne's co-star Alicia Vikander is also up for best actress with Saoirse Ronan (Brooklyn) and Brie Larson (Room) completing the shortlist. Vikander received two BAFTA nominations after also being recognised in the supporting actress category for her role in Ex Machina. She said she was ""truly honoured"" to be nominated. ""The Danish Girl and Ex Machina have been such gifts of projects for me,"" said Vikander. ""The fact that both of these projects were driven from the UK, with a predominantly British cast and crew and that both these films have been so generously recognised by BAFTA today, makes this even more poignant for me."" British actresses Kate Winslet (Steve Jobs) and Julie Walters (Brooklyn) are also nominated alongside Jennifer Jason Leigh (The Hateful Eight) and Rooney Mara (Carol). There is a good showing of British talent in the supporting actor category too with Mark Rylance (Bridge Of Spies) and Idris Elba (Beasts Of No Nation) being named. They face competition from Benicio del Toro (Sicario), Christian Bale (The Big Short) and Mark Ruffalo (Spotlight). Carol, directed by Todd Haynes, and Steven Spielberg's Bridge Of Spies lead the way with nine nominations each. English director Sir Ridley Scott, who has never won a BAFTA for best direction, is a contender for his film The Martian. He will be up against Spielberg (Bridge Of Spies), Adam McKay (The Big Short), Haynes (Carol) and Alejandro G Inarritu (The Revenant). Amy, The Lobster, Ex Machina, The Danish Girl, 45 Years and Brooklyn are all on the shortlist for outstanding British film. Bridge Of Spies, Carol, The Revenant, Spotlight and The Big Short will fight it out for best film. Star Wars: The Force Awakens has been nominated in four categories. The Rising Star Award nominees have already been announced, including Star Wars actor John Boyega and 50 Shades Of Grey's Dakota Johnson. The BAFTA awards will be handed out on 14 February at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden."

Kevin-Djene was found cycling along a rural road in France without knowing where he was, only knowing he had to find his mother. He was discovered at 10.30 at night shivering by motorist Jean-Francois Pinot, who alerted the authorities as he warmed up the youngster, ouest-France said. When emergency services arrived, they managed to extract enough information from the boy to track down his house in 30 minutes. Inside the home, in Saint-Pierre-la-Cour, east of Brittany, they found his father in cardiac arrest before rushing him to hospital for urgent medical treatment. Mr Pinot said: ""I was driving on the main road where I met many cars and one of them flashed his main beam at me. ""I continued carefully and before I saw what looked like a child on a bike. This is where I discovered Kevin-Djene in pyjamas and slippers in the rain freezing cold."" ""The little boy didn't wait a second to raise the alarm. He said, 'my dad died'."" His mother, Djeneba Godin, was tracked down by officers and informed what had happened. She was shocked by what she had found out, but very grateful to the motorist. She said: ""Jean-François has saved the life of my husband, who was released Thursday from the hospital, but also that of my son who was alone at night on the road."" The motorist said he was pleased the story had happy ending. He told ouest-France: ""This boy is incredible! What he has done is very clever. ""His mother called me to thank me and tell me that her husband was released from the hospital. I have tears in my eyes because it shows the beauty in the world."""

Hours after Seoul resumed high-decibel propaganda broadcasts across the border it shares with the secretive state, Philip Hammond warned against ""rising to the bait"". Mr Hammond was speaking in a town south of Tokyo, where he and the UK's Defence Secretary are meeting their Japanese counterparts. North Korea, led by Kim Jong-un, has claimed that it has successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb - a move that has caused alarm in the west. This is likely to be at the top of Mr Hammond's agenda when he discusses global security challenges with Japanese foreign minister Fumio Kishida, alongside Michael Fallon and his opposite number Gen Nakatani. The Foreign Secretary, who has arrived in the country after visits to China and the Philippines, will also meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The FCO says he will reaffirm Britain's commitment to working together to uphold the rules-based international system. Speaking after urgent discussions about North Korea in recent days with Chinese and South Korean foreign ministers, Mr Hammond said: ""The UK and Japan are close allies. ""We enjoy a strong, historic relationship, based on common values and support for democracy, the rule of law, human rights and open markets. ""The long-term security of both the UK and Japan depend on upholding a stable international system. We will continue to work closely together to contribute to global prosperity, peace and security. ""The world today is increasingly dangerous, complex and uncertain. ""We face growing threats from terrorism and extremism, a resurgence in state-based threats including nuclear proliferation, and an escalation in challenges to our cyber security and to the rules-based international order. ""It is more important than ever for the UK to work with allies like Japan to counter these threats. ""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the UK is continuing to play a central role on the issues that matter and is working with allies like Japan to safeguard national security, as well as building our prosperity overseas."" Besides his top-level talks with the Japanese government on the H-bomb and other international issues, the Foreign Secretary will also visit Nissan HQ, Hitachi and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)."

Now we know its origin: the Labour leader has revealed that in the past he was in fact… a geography teacher. Addressing regional political journalists at Westminster, Mr Corbyn told them how he had been asked to teach geography to 70 children in Jamaica, after he went to the Caribbean island aged 18 to be a volunteer youth worker and teacher. He said: ""It was really a defining moment of my life because I was thrown in at the deep end as an 18-year-old who arrived in Jamaica and somebody said: 'Would you teach geography?' But it was not just general geography, it was Caribbean geography. ""I was then confronted with a class of 70 kids to teach geography to, of something I was barely aware of. I worked out what all teachers do. If you are a chapter ahead of the class you are okay until you have a really bright kid, and then you have got a problem. ""You say, 'Don't be so pushy, give a chance to the others'. ""So I learnt tactics of crowd control during that process and also a great deal about people and how you deal with a crisis, because you have to deal with it because you have got no choice."" In another career move unknown until now, the Labour leader revealed he was also a local cub reporter, on the Newport and Market Drayton Advertiser, and described how he learnt the process of ""making something out of nothing"". But he joked with self-depreciation that: ""I understand one of my brothers (not climate sceptic Piers) says I am a very bad journalist. I must speak to him about it."" He did not quite admit to being a trainspotter, but said his regional tours helped to feed his interest in Britain's train links. ""I had a discussion with Andy McDonald, who has just been appointed as our shadow rail minister, about the whole issue of reopening railways and branch lines and the community railway idea, and the discussion that goes with that,"" said Mr Corbyn. He claimed that travelling south to north in Britain was ""like a study of rolling stock history of Britain where you end up with almost slam door trains in the very north and you start off with very sophisticated new electric trains in the south"". On this week's marathon shadow cabinet reshuffle, which took three days, Mr Corbyn said it was ""like playing multi-dimensional chess"". He said: ""You start off with a chess board and that's fine, then you realise you're playing a game on a parallel board as well and then you suddenly find there's a third board down the way. ""Because if you move someone from department A to department B, that creates a vacancy in A, which you might need to fill with somebody from C, that then creates a vacancy in E, and by the way somebody in group G is very upset with the job they've got and wants to move somewhere else."" He said it took so long because so many Labour members wanted to talk things through. ""My great failing in life is to listen to everybody at whatever greater length they wish to speak to me,"" he said. ""Of course I appointed a shadow cabinet that has changed a bit, not much. But it does reach out to all parts of the Labour Party. I said during the campaign I would build this coalition. ""I know there are critics, there are always critics, always critics of a reshuffle. No reshuffle goes the way it was initially intended."" He added: ""Ed Miliband has told me the same."""

Prosecutors say the clues were found during a raid on a flat on 10 December, confirming an earlier report by a Belgian newspaper. The property in the district of Schaerbeek had been rented under a false name that might have been used by a person already in custody related to the Paris attacks, officials added. A fingerprint belonging to Paris attacks fugitive Salah Abdeslam was found The find suggests that the 13 November shooting and suicide bomb attacks in Paris, in which 130 people were killed, were at least partially planned in Belgium. A fingerprint belonging to Paris attacks fugitive Salah Abdeslam was discovered, along with clues suggesting explosive belts may have been manufactured there. ""Material that can be used to fabricate explosives as well as traces of TATP (acetone peroxide) were found,"" a statement from the Belgian federal prosecutor said. The flat in this street contained traces of explosives ""Three handmade belts that might be used to transport explosives as well as a fingerprint of Salah Abdeslam were also discovered."" Acetone peroxide is an ingredient which is often used in improvised explosive devices used by terrorist groups. It is relatively cheap and easy to obtain, around the world because of its low cost and relative ease to obtain. Abdeslam's brother Brahim blew himself up during the Paris attacks. He is still on the run after disappearing following the massacres. The attackers wore suicide vests during their attacks on the Stade de France, Bataclan, and bars and restaurants."

Police are treating the deaths as murder after the bodies were found in the garden of the family home in Erith, Kent, on Tuesday. A post-mortem confirmed the identities of the victims - Miss Blake and eight-year-old Zachary and four-year-old Amon. The search is on for the children's father, Arthur Simpson-Kent, with police investigating reports he may have fled to Ghana. He has not been seen since detectives spoke to him on 16 December. ""Significant attempts"" had been made to hide the bodies, said a statement from Metropolitan Police. They were found when officers dug up the garden after sniffer dogs ""indicated areas of interest"" and soil that had possibly been disturbed. An investigation is being held into the handling of the case after it emerged that a relative is reported to have called the NSPCC on December 16 to raise concerns about domestic violence. Miss Blake and her children were last seen in east London on 13 December, prompting a missing person investigation, but the murder squad did not get involved until 4 January. Her sister has revealed the former actress was planning to leave Mr Simpson-Kent over Christmas and wanted to end the relationship ""a long time ago"". ""She had asked to come back home and we said yes, so we really tried to plan on getting her to move back home,"" said Ava Blake. ""She said she would come back, sort of Christmas week, and after Christmas they would arrange about selling the property she lived in. ""She didn't want to throw (Arthur) out on the street but give him time to find somewhere else to live. ""That was the only point she was wavering on."" Ava Blake said her sister had changed from the ""vivacious, happy person she once was"" and that she suspected texts sent by Sian after she disappeared had not been written by her. ""The first part of the text, I believe my sister may have written that,"" she said.  ""But the rest of the wording and other texts my family received, they were not my sister. We don't use text lingo. We write full sentences."" Gallery: Missing Family Murder Probe Three bodies have been found by police searching for Sian Blake and her two sons Zachary, eight, and Amon, four Scotland Yard has said it is aware of a photo apparently showing Mr Simpson-Kent, 48, arriving in Ghana, but refused to confirm reports he had flown to Africa. Miss Blake, 43, had motor neurone disease - a fatal, rapidly progressing illness which affects the brain and spinal cord - and was reportedly looking ""very frail"" before she vanished. Previously an unknown actress, her big break in EastEnders came when she was introduced as soul singer Frankie in June 1996 by series producer Jane Harris. She was in the BBC soap for 56 episodes, reportedly quitting because of hostility from viewers towards her manipulative character. She also appeared in episodes of The Bill, Casualty, Doctors and Skins. The Metropolitan Police has faced questions over why it took so long for its murder squad to become involved and has referred itself to the police watchdog, the IPCC."

Onlookers said people working on the Changzhou First International Trade Co stall were stunned. A team of marshals were seen confiscating products and merchandising material, which the US Department of Justice say is related to a civil case. It follows a patent infringement claim filed by a Silicon Valley-based rival, and the case is set to reach court in the next few days. The firm's hoverboard model - featuring a single central wheel rather than one at each end - is similar to California-based Future Motion's Onewheel vehicle. The Onewheel uses sensors and computer controls to balance the board, which are covered by two key patents stopping rivals using similar technology for free. The first covers the vehicle's design and the second covers the technology which makes it self-stabilising. Changzhou sells its device for the equivalent of £375 on the Alibaba shopping website - about a third of the price of the Onewheel product. Before CES launched earlier this week, organisers announced that travelling around the event on hoverboards was banned due to safety risks. Some of the devices have recently burst into flames due to problems with their batteries."
2016-01-08,A dirty tricks row has broken out in the junior doctors' dispute over claims that a warning of the impact of a strike in the event of a terror attack was sexed up in Whitehall.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618811/govt-accused-of-sexing-up-doctors-strike-threat,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent A dirty tricks row has broken out in the junior doctors' dispute over claims that a warning of the impact of a strike in the event of a terror attack was sexed up in Whitehall. A letter from the medical director of NHS England, questioning whether striking junior doctors would be available to help in the event of a Paris-style attack, was strengthened and signed off by Whitehall officials, it has been claimed. According to The Independent, Sir Bruce Keogh was told by a Department of Health official in the week after the Paris massacres the risk of a ""major incident"" in the UK would be ""pressed quite hard in the media once the strike is formally announced"" and he was advised: ""The more hard-edged you can be on this, the better."" Emails between the department and Sir Bruce suggest that Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, was given approval on the text of the letter, The Independent reports. Sir Bruce was told by an official: ""I am sure that JH [Jeremy Hunt] will be interested to see the proposed final product."" When the letter was eventually sent and made public a few days after the Paris terror attacks in November it caused a storm of protest from junior doctors. Some 3,000 doctors wrote to Sir Bruce accusing him of using fears of a terror attack for ""political purposes"". They said any insinuation that striking doctors would not come back to work in the event of an attack was ""not in keeping with the inherent duty that junior doctors have to serve the public"".  The disclosure of how the final text was negotiated is likely to anger them still more. A spokesperson for the BMA told Sky News: ""This level of political interference is extremely concerning and will only serve to worsen junior doctors' lack of trust in the Government's handling of negotiations."" The emails also suggest Mr Hunt agreed that Sir Bruce would not be asked to speak to the media on the day the strike was declared ""so long as"" his letter reiterated his opposition to strike action, and was ""clear"" about the assurances the DoH wanted to hear from the BMA. But after the disclosure in The Independent, Sir Bruce told Sky News: ""Given the seriousness of potential industrial action and NHS England's statutory responsibilities to ensure everything possible is being done to reduce all potential risk, it was entirely appropriate that all parts of the NHS - including the Department of Health, hospitals and NHS England - coordinated the operational response across the country."" A Department of Health spokesman said: ""Given it is the Government's ultimate responsibility to do everything it can to ensure public safety, it is completely right that the Department expressed a view on communication with the BMA."" A spokesman for the arbitration service ACAS said the latest talks between the two sides had been ""constructive"" and will continue but despite this ""the parties are not able to able to prevent the industrial action planned for 12 January 2016""."

The firm, controlled by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, said it had seen a ""deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period"" and expected the gloom to continue. It said that as a result it was no longer confident of meeting its adjusted underlying earnings target of £420m for the full financial year. The group said that in the light of those factors ""and in anticipation of similar trading conditions between now and the end of April"" it now expected annual earnings of between £380m and £420m. It is the latest retailer to blame the higher-than-average temperatures last month for poor sales – with Marks & Spencer and Next both citing the weather as a factor in their disappointing Christmas updates this week. Winter fashion sales tend to be hurt by milder weather because it hits sales of products such as coats and other warm clothing. Last month Sports Direct posted a 25% rise in pre-tax profits to £187.3m for the six months to 25 October but underlying results missed expectations and the figures were overshadowed by claims over working conditions for warehouse staff - helping shares plunge. The retailer defended its behaviour after being accused of a series of practices including sharp reductions in pay for clocking in just one minute late and rigorous searches of workers at the end of shifts, as well as employees being harangued over a public address system for not working fast enough. It came in for sharp criticism with Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, describing the company as leaving ""a scar on British business"". The company later said it would launch a review of agency workers' terms and conditions led by Mr Ashley."

Scores of homes were evacuated in Aberdeenshire after the river swelled in a number of places in Port Elphinstone following further heavy downpours. Two severe flood warnings are still in force across Inverurie and Kintore - indicating a ""danger to life"" - and the extreme weather has also caused major travel disruption. Sky's Scotland Correspondent James Matthews, who is in Inverurie, said: ""I'm told that in parts it was waist deep, which clearly was a danger, given the speed at which the water level rose."" It was a matter of life and death for residents like Derek and Lyn Mackay, whose home was 4ft under water when firefighters helped them to safety. A map of the affected areas ""We have been pumping the water here for four days. Last night there was nothing we could do about it. It was devastating,"" said Mr Mackay. ""At one time we thought the water had risen to 3ft in 10 to 15 minutes. My wife came out the front door and it was up to her waist. ""The first thing she said was she couldn't swim. We can joke about it now ... but last night was unbelievable, devastating."" He added: ""Everything in the house has been damaged. Nothing could be saved in the house at all. ""I have never seen anything like it - and I hope I never see it again."" Mother-of-three Ashley Wilson said she was alerted by a neighbour to get out of the house, and within just two minutes her garden was transformed into a swimming pool. ""I checked the water levels and you could see the garden ... by the time the kids had got their clothes on, we were 3ft deep in water and we managed to just escape. Gallery: Flooding Misery In Aberdeen Rescue teams knock on doors and look through windows for trapped residents ""It's a very horrific experience to have your own family go through that. It was awful. ""It was just a case of panic - but get everybody out. We had to abandon ship. ""We have a front garden and then within two minutes we have a swimming pool. ""Absolutely devastated. This is not how you want to see the New Year in. ""Lives were most definitely in danger,"" she added. People fleeing their properties in the area have been put up in makeshift rest centres, while some hotels have also opened their doors to flooding victims. Matthews said: ""People I have spoken to here have been watching flooding elsewhere in the UK. ""To quote one gentleman I spoke to, he said he watched it on his TV - now he is 'living the live event and it is all terribly depressing'."" Stuart Moffat, who returned to Canal Crescent in Inverurie on Friday morning to assess the damage to his family home, said he was ""devastated, exhausted - mentally and physically"". ""It is a little bit hard to take solace from the fact that my family and I are not alone, but at this moment in time I feel pretty alone and isolated,"" he said. ""We are not out of winter yet. What do you do?"" He and his family fled the house before the River Don burst its banks. ""If I didn't evacuate, someone was going to have to come and get me in a dinghy and I didn't want to have to add to the problem, so I evacuated, knowing my house was ok at that time,"" he said. ""Now it looks like it was the right call because it looks anything but good."" His wife Jenny added: ""This is an absolute disaster. We don't know what's going to happen, when we can go back to our house. We are homeless."" The River Ythan was also feared to be at risk of overflowing - and motorists have been advised to avoid making journeys unless essential. Aberdeen Airport urged the public to check before turning up for a scheduled flight, after ""unprecedented rainfall"" damaged a section of the tarmac on Thursday - meaning flights were unable to land safely. Chief Superintendent Campbell Thomson said: ""A major incident was declared due to the severity of the warnings in place and the potential for serious impact on communities. ""Our focus over the past 36 hours has been the Donside area, Keith to Huntly, Turriff, Inverurie, Kintore, Ellon and into Aberdeen including Riverside Drive and the Grandholm area. Additionally, we continue to support the recovery effort in Deeside, specifically in the Ballater and Braemar area, following the impact of Storm Frank."" Sky's weather producer Christopher England said more rain was forecast over the weekend, followed by a cold spell with a risk of snowfall. ""Northeast Scotland will be much drier during the next few days, although there will still be a few showers around,"" he said. ""There'll be a spell of more general rain on Saturday night and it will be turning colder, with widespread overnight frosts and many places below freezing all day from the middle of next week, so there is a risk of snow and icy stretches at low levels."" Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said the Scottish Government's resilience committee is monitoring the situation ""very closely"". The county has endured persistent rainfall since Storm Frank made landfall on 30 December, with the council warning that it is now dealing with an escalating emergency response situation. Residents who remain at properties with private water supplies are being urged to use bottled water as a precaution."
2016-01-08,"It was a pulsating event that lasted more than 30 hours, was full of high tension and low farce, and ended with resignation drama.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618002/labours-day-of-sledging-its-not-cricket,"It was a pulsating event that lasted more than 30 hours, was full of high tension and low farce, and ended with resignation drama. The 2nd Test between South Africa and England in Capetown? Or Jeremy Corbyn's so-called revenge reshuffle? The answer, of course, is both. And just as the Test Match ended in a draw, so too did the battle between Mr Corbyn and his enemies in the Labour Party. Both sides will settle for a draw because Mr Corbyn won a victory by moving pro-Trident Maria Eagle from shadow defence secretary, but suffered a defeat because he failed to shift Hilary Benn from his shadow foreign secretary post. Mr Benn was the Hashim Amla - the South African captain who batted obdurately for two days - of the shadow cabinet, digging in and refusing to budge. Of course, unlike Amla, who announced a shock resignation when the drama was over, it wasn't Mr Benn who quit at the end of the contest. But three of his Labour teammates - Jonathan Reynolds, Stephen Doughty and Kevan Jones - did, resigning from their front-bench jobs in protest to the shuffling that occurred. Just as Ben Stokes electrified the Test Match with an explosive 258 in England's first innings, Michael Dugher provocatively grabbed the headlines on day one of the Corbyn reshuffle by tweeting his own sacking from his culture, media and sport post. And as Stokes was later accused of ""sledging"" his South African opponents, Mr Dugher took to the airwaves and began sledging Mr Corbyn and his supporters. At times, the ferocity of his verbal onslaught was every bit as brutal as Stokes' batting in Cape Town. The high tension at Westminster came in the battle Mr Benn fought to save his position in the shadow cabinet. The low farce - like the England cricket team's dropped catches in the field - was what appeared to be hour after hour of dithering by Mr Corbyn over who to sack and who to appoint to key jobs. Of the three Labour resignations so far, Kevan Jones' was the most dramatic. In a candid interview with Kay Burley on Sky News, he disputed many of the statements made earlier by Mr Corbyn and his team about the moving of his boss, Maria Eagle. :: The three resignation letters in full As midnight approached at the end of the Labour reshuffle, John McDonnell told reporters outside the Labour leader's suite of offices that her position had been ""resolved amicably"" and she was ""a happy person"". Labour sources later claimed she had wanted the move to the culture, media and sport brief. Not so, insisted Mr Jones. She wanted to stay in her job, he said. This was just one example of many acrimonious disputes between the Labour leadership and those shadow ministers who were either given out or walked. Like challenging the umpire's decision, you might say. Except in politics, unlike modern test cricket, for those who have to walk there's no review system with slow-motion action replays. The most poisonous sledging between Mr Corbyn's supporters and his opponents was over the sacking of Pat McFadden from his job as Europe spokesman for what the leadership claimed was ""serial disloyalty"". The Reynolds and Doughty resignations were sparked by Mr McFadden's dismissal. Kevan Jones' was more over a policy clash. In Cape Town, it was Jonny Bairstow, who made a big comeback with a maiden test century. In the shadow cabinet, Emily Thornberry's comeback as shadow defence secretary was much more remarkable. Just over a year ago she was sacked by Ed Miliband for her notorious ""white van man"" tweet during the Rochester and Strood by-election. During the epic struggle of past few days, many Labour MPs - just like cricket fans - will have watched the unpredictable events unfold with bemusement. Their reaction? Stumped, I imagine."
2016-01-08,Drinkers are being warned that regularly consuming even a small amount of alcohol can lead to cancer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1618772/drinkers-told-any-alcohol-carries-cancer-risk,"By Ashish Joshi, Sky News Correspondent Drinkers are being warned that regularly consuming even a small amount of alcohol can lead to cancer. Government guidelines on alcohol consumption have been revised, with men being urged to halve their weekly intake from 28 to 14 units, in line with the recommendation for women. This means the typical British adult should not be having more than six pints of beer or five 175ml glasses of wine in a seven-day period. England's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said: ""Drinking any level of alcohol regularly carries a health risk for anyone, but if men and women limit their intake to no more than 14 units a week, it keeps the risk of illness like cancer and liver disease low. ""What we are aiming to do with these guidelines is give the public the latest and most up-to-date scientific information so that they can make informed decisions about their own drinking and the level of risk they are prepared to take."" A bottle of wine contains about 10 units, while a pint of beer equates to 2.3 units. Before, official guidelines suggested it was safe for men to consume 21 units a week - the equivalent of about 12 pints. It has been stressed that the guidelines are not about safe drinking, but about managing risk. Put simply, the more alcohol you drink, the greater the threat of cancer. As before, it is recommended that Britons spread their units over the course of a week instead of saving them up for bingeing. Meanwhile, fresh evidence suggests that consuming alcohol does not protect the body against heart disease as effectively as once thought. Only women over the age of 55 may experience positive health effects when alcohol is drunk in small amounts, and there is no benefit to men whatsoever. The report also warns that the risks of getting cancer ""start from any level of regular drinking and rise with the amount being drunk"". Even consumption at low levels is linked to cancers of the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus and breast. At higher levels, there is an increased danger of developing bowel and liver cancer. Modelling for the study shows that, compared with non-drinkers, women who drink two units a day on a regular basis have a 16% increased chance of developing breast cancer and dying from it. Those who regularly consume five units a day have a 40% increased risk. Among non-drinking men, 64 in every 1,000 will develop bowel cancer, and this stays the same for those drinking 14 units or fewer per week. However, in men drinking 15 to 35 units per week, there is an 85 in 1,000 chance they will contract the illness. The report said drinking regularly over time can lead to a wide range of illnesses including cancers, strokes, heart disease, liver disease, and damage to the brain and nervous system. Asked whether the Prime Minister thought hard-working Britons should be able to enjoy a glass of wine at the end of the day, his official spokeswoman said: ""I think that's a choice for hard-working Brits to make in the comfort of their own households or wherever they are."" Sir David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk, University of Cambridge, said: ""These guidelines define ""low-risk"" drinking as giving you less than a 1% chance of dying from an alcohol-related condition.  ""So should we feel OK about risks of this level? ""An hour of TV watching a day, or a bacon sandwich a couple of times a week, is more dangerous to your long-term health. ""In contrast, an average driver faces much less than this lifetime risk from a car accident. ""It all seems to come down to what pleasure you get from moderate drinking."""
2016-01-08,"A takeover bid for Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos and Homebase, has been rumoured for quite a while.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160108191136/http://news.sky.com/story/1617155/what-sainsburys-sees-in-home-retail-group,"A takeover bid for Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos and Homebase, has been rumoured for quite a while. Private equity buyers have been linked with either a bid for the entire company or some of its constituent parts - and more recently Wal-Mart, the owner of Asda, has also been touted as a potential buyer. What no one expected was an approach from Sainsbury's, even though the pair have been partnering in an experiment for the last year, with 10 Sainsbury's stores playing host to digital in-store Argos concessions. Many will regard this as a defensive move on the part of Sainsbury's in the face of growing competition in the grocery sector. However, in its stock exchange announcement confirming the approach, Sainsbury's claims the deal will also provide a platform for growth. It argues there is a strong rationale behind a tie-up, noting that it would bring together two respected and well-known businesses, capable of offering customers fast and reliable delivery across a range of platforms. Argos has been investing heavily recently in a same-day delivery service aimed at seeing off the competitive threat from Amazon and, coupling this with Sainsbury's store network, this could quite easily form the UK's biggest ""click and collect"" proposition. An artist's impression of one of the Argos concessions found in Sainsbury's Interestingly, Sainsbury's also argues that a combination of the pair could also create a financial services proposition, offering a wider range of services than those available from its existing banking business. But make no mistake - this would also be a deal in which cost-cutting would also loom large. The combined store estates of these businesses would overlap considerably and, as Sainsbury's notes in its statement, there would be potential for rationalisation. Britain's commercial landlords will be watching on nervously. Others already burned by the news include the hedge funds: Home Retail Group is one of the most popular stocks in the market for ""shorting"" - selling shares that you do not own in a company in the hope of making a profit by buying them back later more cheaply - and several of them, including the likes of Odey and Marshall Wace, will have been hit by the sudden rally in Home Retail Group shares sparked by this announcement. Not least the most intriguing aspect of any marriage, should it be consummated, is that it would bring Homebase back into the Sainsbury's stable. The UK's second-largest do-it-yourself business was once owned by Sainsbury's but was sold to the old Great Universal Stores group, which later de-merged Home Retail Group, back in 2000 for £969m. Such have been Home Retail Group's fortunes since that the combined business, even after a 30% jump in the share price sparked by the news of Sainsbury's interest, is now only valued at £990m. It is perfectly possible that, should it succeed in buying Home Retail Group, Sainsbury's might well choose to offload Homebase to a private equity buyer. Investors have never really been sold on the synergy benefits, in the jargon, of keeping it and Argos under one roof. The real prize for Sainsbury's here will be the vast high street store estate Argos has - many of which could be converted into its convenience formats. At the same time, it is easy to see how the larger out-of-town stores owned by Sainsbury's could be used to fuel Argos's click-and-collect proposition while benefiting from the increased numbers of customers visiting its stores that would create. This approach also sends out another intriguing signal, namely the growing self-belief of Sainsbury's under its chief executive, Mike Coupe. The retailer has, for some time, been outperforming the other members of the big four - Tesco, Asda and Morrisons - and this approach suggests Mr Coupe is confident of both continuing that and that his management team is capable of executing a big combination like this."

Having spent all day trying to get an interview with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, I felt it was fair enough to ask his adviser where he was. He had declined all interview requests, despite calls for him to answer questions from doctors and patients. Instead, the UK broadcast media was offered a senior official from the NHS England by the Department of Health to do one interview for all of us. But when I tried to ask Norman Williams, Mr Hunt's senior clinical adviser, about why Jeremy Hunt was not answering questions and where he was, it lead to an uncomfortable exchange and an attempt by Department of Health press officers to alter the interview. When I asked if he thought it was ""good that doctors on the eve of a national strike, and indeed, people that use the NHS aren't able to hear from the Secretary of State"", the aide cut in: ""Hang on a minute, we're not doing any of this nonsense."" I reminded him that the interview was being recorded and that the Department had put Mr Williams up to respond to concerns ahead of one of the biggest NHS strikes in history. :: Follow live updates on the strike here"

The energy giant currently employs 3,000 people in the region, including 1,800 in Aberdeen and 500 offshore. Most of the lost jobs will go this year with the rest in 2017. The cuts are among more than 4,000 posts being cut across the company's ""upstream"" exploration and production divisions over the next couple of years, reducing the number employed in this part of the company from 24,000 to below 20,000. BP's announcement came as a sustained slump in the oil price showed no signs of abating, with the cost of a barrel of Brent crude hitting a new near-12 year low as it slid below $31. It has tumbled by nearly three-quarters from a peak of more than $115 in the summer of 2014 amid a glut of supply and slowing demand from emerging markets, particularly China. BP officials have begun notifying workers of the cuts at meetings in Scotland. Mark Thomas, regional president for BP North Sea, said the company remained committed to the region and saw a long term future for the business there. He said BP was investing around $2bn (£1.4bn) of of capital into North Sea projects this year and spending a further $2bn in running North Sea operations, sustaining hundreds of supply chain jobs. ""However, given the well-documented challenges of operating in this maturing region and in toughening market conditions, we need to take specific steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust,"" he said. ""An inevitable outcome of this will be an impact on headcount and we expect a reduction of around 600 staff and agency contractor roles by the end of 2017, with the majority of these taking place this year. ""We are speaking to our staff and agency contractor management and will work with those affected over the coming months."" The cuts show how the slump in the oil price - while welcome for consumers because it feeds through to cheaper petrol - can have a damaging impact on UK jobs. BP has already been slashing spending and jobs in the wake of the collapse in prices. The latest announcement comes a year after it set out previous cuts hitting 300 North Sea jobs. In October the company reported third-quarter profits down by half amid the slump. Deirdre Michie, chief executive of industry body Oil & Gas UK, said: ""The plummeting oil price has impacted heavily on activity across the UK Continental Shelf. As a sector, we will have to build resilience against the toughening market conditions to get us through the months ahead and ensure an enduring industry for the future. ""While Oil & Gas UK cannot comment on the commercial decisions made by its members, companies are having to take very difficult decisions in what continues to be a challenging time and we as an industry must be thoughtful and supportive of our colleagues who are being made redundant or facing uncertainty."""
2016-01-13,The boyfriend of murdered Sian Blake has appeared in a Ghanaian court ahead of proceedings to extradite him to the UK.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160113013429/http://news.sky.com/story/1621262/sian-blake-boyfriend-appears-in-ghana-court,"The boyfriend of murdered Sian Blake has appeared in a Ghanaian court ahead of proceedings to extradite him to the UK. Arthur Simpson-Kent is accused of killing the former EastEnders actress and her children, Zachary, eight, and Amon, four. Their bodies were discovered in the garden of the family home in Erith, Kent, last week - three weeks after they were reported missing. All three died of head and neck injuries. Blake and her sons Zachary and Amon Simpson-Kent appeared before magistrates dressed in the same grey T-shirt and jeans in which he was detained on Saturday. The hairdresser was told he would remain behind bars until 26 January, when a court will decide whether to extradite him to the UK. The British Government has yet to submit a formal request for his extradition. Simpson-Kent's counsel have accused Ghana's attorney general of deliberately denying them access to their client. The Met Police last week referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over its handling of an initial missing person's inquiry, amid claims the probe was blighted by delays. Simpson-Kent was arrested in the coastal town of Busua. Pic: Sunday People Ms Blake, 43, and her children were last seen in east London on 13 December, but the murder squad did not get involved until 4 January. Simpson-Kent had spoken to police when the three disappeared, but then left the UK. About 10 armed officers descended on a beach in Busua, which is in the west of Ghana, where Simpson-Kent was spotted hiding between some rocks, according to reports. Ms Blake had motor neurone disease - a fatal, rapidly progressing illness which affects the brain and spinal cord - and had reportedly been frail before she disappeared. She took on the role of soul singer Frankie in EastEnders in 1996, appearing in 56 episodes."

2016-01-13,David Cameron has been involved in heated clashes with senior MPs in a secrecy row over British military operations in Syria.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160113013429/http://news.sky.com/story/1621510/pm-in-heated-clashes-over-syria-secrecy-row,"By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent David Cameron has been involved in heated clashes with senior MPs in a secrecy row over British military operations in Syria. Appearing before a powerful committee of MPs at Westminster, the Prime Minister rejected calls to provide more information about drone strikes and the work of the intelligence services. At times Mr Cameron appeared tetchy and rattled as the committee's chairman, senior Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, repeatedly urged him to make more information available to the public and MPs. During their clash, at one point a clearly annoyed Mr Cameron snapped at Mr Tyrie: ""You don’t know what you’re talking about."" The bad-tempered exchanges came as the PM appeared at one of his regular grillings by the Liaison Committee of MPs, made up of the chairs of the all-party Commons select committees. Mr Cameron's first clash came with the Tory chairman of the Defence Select Committee, Julian Lewis, over the PM's claim last month that there were 70,000 ""non-extremist"" opposition fighters in Syria. Refusing to give details of the groups concerned, Mr Cameron said: ""It would be effectively giving President Assad a list of the groups and the people and potentially the areas he should be targeting."" He did admit, however, that some were ""relatively hardline Islamists"" and said: ""They are not all the sort of people you would bump into at a Liberal Democrat party conference."" Mr Cameron was then challenged by Harriet Harman, the former interim Labour leader who now chairs Parliament's Joint Human Rights Committee, to publish Government policy on the use of drones for targeted killings. He said he was unlikely to allow all the information to be published surrounding the events that led to the drone strike that killed 21-year-old Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, and Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen, currently being investigated by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC). That prompted Mr Tyrie to complain that he was not giving the ISC the information it needed and had excluded details about the military circumstances around the strike. Without information on all aspects of the operation a sympathetic observer would conclude the ISC's work be incomplete while a less sympathetic observer would find ""their work could be rendered meaningless"", Mr Tyrie protested. An angry Mr Cameron told the chairman he was wrong and insisted the public ""by and large probably support the action that we took"" and insisted the action he ordered last year was ""necessary and proportionate"". ""I'll look in detail at the question you ask but my instinctive answer, so you know how I approach this, my instinctive answer would be no,"" said the Prime Minister. At one point, he banged the table and told Mr Tyrie: ""The Government is engaged in a military operation against terrorists who are trying to attack the UK. If you don't think there is a cell of people in Raqqa trying to attack this country, you don't know what you are talking about."" Mr Cameron added: ""You have to be incredibly careful with highly sensitive information, information that if revealed could result in somebody's death. The source that gave you that information would be, could be, at risk. ""You are asking me should the Government have no hold-back on the intelligence it gives to the ISC? Instinctively I would be very worried about that because there might be a piece of intelligence so sensitive that its release in anyway could endanger the source of that intelligence. ""In that case, the Government should keep that intelligence as tightly held as possible."" Mr Cameron told Mr Tyrie he was ""not going to give you that blanket guarantee"" that he would release the rest of the information and he was ""not inclined"" to publish policy on the use of drones strikes to kill terrorists because that could give away intelligence information to terror groups. After the committee hearing, Harriet Harman hit back: ""The PM sought to give the impression today that he is allowing the ISC to scrutinise the targeted killing of Reyaad Khan in Syria in August. ""But under questioning from the Liaison Committee Chair Andrew Tyrie MP he was forced to admit he is not allowing this scrutiny. It's not acceptable that he is clearly frustrating the scrutiny work of the ISC who he appointed and who are all security cleared."" After the committee hearing, a defiant Mr Tyrie came out fighting and said: ""On the basis of today's evidence, the Intelligence and Security Committee will not be able to do a thorough job. ""The Prime Minister should reconsider his decision to prevent the ISC from looking at information on the military aspects of the drone strikes. Unless he permits this, the ISC will be incapable of providing reassurance to Parliament and the public that the strikes were both necessary and proportionate. ""He should also instruct his Secretaries of State to release all relevant information to the ISC. Without that, government departments may render inquiries incomplete by withholding relevant information. ""It is conceivable that a piece of information is so sensitive that the Prime Minister would want to prevent even the security cleared ISC from seeing it. But in evidence the PM appeared to argue that restrictions on the ISC's access to information may range more broadly than that. ""The country expects the PM to keep the UK secure. It also needs reassurance that appropriate force is being used. By giving the ISC authority to do a proper inquiry, he could achieve both."" On the question of 70,000 fighters, which was referenced in December's debate to extend airstrikes into Syria, Mr Tyrie said: ""It's clear from the Prime Minister's evidence that even the 70,000 opposition fighters may not be enough to suppress and defeat Daesh (IS). ""The Prime Minister also made clear, in contrast to his statement to the House, that some of the 70,000 were hardline Islamists."""

The pound fell to a new five-and-a-half year low against the US dollar after official figures showed a surprise 0.7% contraction for the sector in November - its biggest monthly fall since January 2013. Within this manufacturing - which is part of the wider industrial production sector - shrank by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It was its second month in a row of contraction. Britain has seen strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the past couple of years but relied on the domestically-focused services sector and consumer spending. The strength of the pound and global economic slowdown has hit hopes that the recovery can be rebalanced towards exports. The ONS figures came as separate survey data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed a disappointing Christmas for the high street. The gloomy picture helped further push back any prospect of the Bank of England lifting interest rates. JP Morgan economist Malcolm Barr said that, added to continuing disappointment on pay growth and the slump in oil prices putting pressure on inflation, the official data meant a hike was now not likely to take place until the final months of 2016. Britain's economy grew by a tepid 0.4% in the third quarter of 2015 and the latest data will dampen hopes that it can pick up speed. The ONS said that industrial production would now have to rise by 0.5% in December to prevent it representing a drag on overall GDP growth for the fourth quarter. But last month's weather was also exceptionally mild for the time of the year meaning there could be a similar effect on electricity and gas consumption as in November, when it fell by 2.1%. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures put a ""significant dent"" in hopes that UK GDP growth picked up in the fourth quarter of 2015. The pound fell below $1.44 for the first time since June 2010 during the latest session though it later climbed back above that level."

The men were pulled through a window of the Chase tower in downtown Houston on Monday morning, a fire department spokesman said. Both men escaped injury and did not need medical treatment, Houston fire spokesman Jay Evans said. Footage from local media showed the gantry the men had been working on leaning at 45 degrees from where it should have been. A mechanic for the window cleaning firm helped retrieve the scaffolding from the top of the 75-storey building, Mr Evans said. In October, six construction workers were pulled underneath scaffolding that collapsed at a flat block under construction in the city, fire officials said at the time."

Outpatient clinics are also likely to be disrupted as 38,000 members of the British Medical Association take action over threats by the Government to impose a new contract. Junior doctors will provide only emergency care. Consultants will cover their other responsibilities as far as possible. Anne Rainsberry of NHS England said patients can be confident they will receive safe care. ""The NHS has procedures for dealing with a range of disruptions including industrial action,"" she said. ""Trusts have been planning to make sure urgent and emergency care continues. ""If your operation has been cancelled it will be rescheduled at the earliest possible time."" At Ipswich Hospital extra consultants will be available on the wards to fill gaps left by striking junior doctors. It has not cancelled any operations - and just 60 of more than 1,000 outpatient appointments have been rearranged. Nick Hulme, the hospital's chief executive, told Sky News: ""The problem won't be on the day of the strike but on the following couple of days. ""If patients have been admitted and need an X-ray or a CT scan before they can go home we may lose a day because that test hasn't been booked on the day of the strike."" The proposed contract reduces the hours in the evenings and at weekends that qualify for pay premiums, but increases basic pay instead. The Government says the contract will help hospitals to provide more seven-day services for patients. But doctors believe it will cut their pay in the long term and remove safeguards that prevent them from working excessive hours. Gagan Bhatnagar, a junior doctor in Oxford, has arranged a consultant to see the most urgent patients on his cancer list. Others have been rescheduled for another day. ""That hurts me because I do not want to inconvenience my patients,"" he said. ""But I look at the long term and this is a dangerous contract, not just for doctors but for patients."" Lawrence Anstey was due to have his broken hand put in a cast. ""It's going to be inconvenient. I don't want to wait weeks and weeks but as it stands I can live with it as it is,"" he said. This is the first of three strikes planned by the BMA. Doctors will only provide emergency cover during a 48-hour strike starting at 8am on 26 January. There will then follow the first-ever full walkout between 8am and 5pm on 10 February. Talks are continuing at the conciliation service Acas between the BMA and NHS employers."

The Staffordshire theme park claims Galactica will be a ""complete game changer"" for rollercoasters as it combines a physical ride with virtual reality. Bosses hope it will boost visitor numbers, which fell last year when a crash involving The Smiler forced two young women to have leg amputations. Riders will wear a virtual reality headset creating the illusion they are flying through space, with the movements on-screen coinciding with those on the 840-metre long track. Galactica will allow riders to feel g-force akin to a rocket launch The ride, which opens in April, will last 189 seconds, with a maximum speed of 46mph. The park's marketing director Gill Riley said independent inspections would take place before it opened. She added: ""Galactica uses groundbreaking technology to give riders a breathtaking and completely unique rollercoaster experience. ""Tim Peake captured the imagination of millions of Brits last year when he set off on his mission to the International Space Station - and now our visitors can become astronauts too."" Alton Towers claims passengers will experience a similar level of g-force to that felt by astronauts during rocket launches - 3g. ""There is nowhere else in the world that people can experience the feeling of a flying rollercoaster combined with soaring through the universe,"" said Ms Riley. ""For two minutes, our guests will be transported into space and we believe Galactica showcases the future for theme parks around the world - it's a complete game changer."" The park also confirmed The Smiler is due to reopen later this year. An investigation attributed the crash to ""human error""."
2016-01-13,Six former British soldiers have been jailed for five years by the Indian authorities.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160113013429/http://news.sky.com/story/1621297/ex-british-troops-get-jail-terms-in-india,"By Neville Lazarus, Asia Producer and India Reporter Six former British soldiers have been jailed for five years by the Indian authorities. The men were convicted by a court in the southern state of Tamilnadu of entering Indian territory illegally and possessing arms and ammunition without paper. The Britons are among a group of 23 foreign nationals from the UK, Ukraine and Estonia, as well as 12 Indians, who have been sentenced. Defence lawyers say they will appeal. The crew were part of the MV Seaman Guard Ohio ship, a US-owned ship registered in Sierra Leone. It is an armoury ship that provides protection against pirates for ships sailing in the Indian Ocean. The ship was intercepted on 12 October 2013 within Indian waters and was found with 35 automatic guns and almost 6,000 rounds of ammunition. The crew had spent nine months in prison before being given bail and told to remain in the country in July 2014 when the Madras High court dropped all charges. Intelligence agencies appealed against the decision and were then allowed to try the case in the sessions court of Tuticorin. In his order, Judge N Rajasekaran said the captain had failed to obtain the proper approvals before entering Indian waters, and the licence obtained in Sierra Leone had not been renewed. Also, there was no proper documents for possessing arms and ammunition. The crew will now return to prison and serve the five-year sentence of ""rigorous imprisonment"" at the Puzhal central jail. Moments after the judgement, former British army sniper Ray Tindall, one of those convicted, said: ""I hope this nightmare will be over soon. They (the authorities) ignored every one of their own Indian laws, every one of the international laws and decided to proceed and prosecute us and jail us ... There's no grounds for what they have done."" David Cameron made a personal appeal to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when the latter visited the UK in November last year. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office say the men have 90 days to appeal against the decision. A spokesperson said: ""Our staff in India and the UK have been in close contact with all six men since their arrest to provide support to them and their families, including attending court."" Speaking to Sky News, public prosecutor K.Sivakumar said the Modi-led central government had tried to persuade him to lessen the charges and show leniency. He said: ""I have to go by the law and the State Government has backed me all the way. Officers from the Intelligence Bureau have been attending the court sessions for over a month. ""The state government of Tamilnadu will consider all that the accused have gone through over this period."" Mr Sivakumar added that the lawyers for the accused had ""messed up the case from the beginning even after being paid huge amounts of money. They were not specialised in dealing with marine cases or these kind of cases involving foreigners""."

""Steve"", as he has asked to be known, said the drug made him hallucinate and believe he had contracted AIDS after sleeping with a prostitute. ""It was horrendous. It was the worst experience of my life. Those two weeks onboard a ship. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. Suicide was a big option. ""I'd never experienced anything like that before. It was just something I'd never come across in my life."" Steve was medevaced back to the UK for treatment. Most NATO countries have stopped using Lariam but the once-a-week pill is issued to around 2,500 UK military personnel each year in accordance with Public Health England guidelines. But the number of military personnel suffering side-effects has prompted a Defence Select Committee investigation. Major General Alastair Duncan DSO CBE, was a commander of British forces in Bosnia and later Chief of Staff for the UN mission in Sierra Leone. For the past 10 months he has been sectioned in a secure Intensive Care Unit, suffering mental problems that his wife thinks might be linked to the Lariam he took as a soldier. Speaking from their home in Somerset, his wife Ellen said she believes it to be ""the worst form of friendly fire"". ""They join up, they expect risk but they do not expect risk from their own side,"" she told us. Maj Gen Duncan's vehicle was blown up when he was serving in Bosnia. Although he wasn't badly injured physically, he was later diagnosed with PTSD as a result of the incident. His wife believes Lariam he was given prior to the deployment to Sierra Leone in 1999 exacerbated his condition. ""It's not a question of Alastair being a General. They're all soldiers. They've all done the same job, they deserve the duty of care that's owed them by their government."" Philippa Tuckman is a lawyer representing a number of former personnel, including Steve, who are considering suing the Ministry of Defence: ""We know people's lives and careers have been absolutely ruined by the effects. Those people would like an apology and, above all for the future, the Ministry of Defence has got to review - seriously review - its policy on Lariam. It may like to look at making a different drug its first choice."" The most senior medical officer in the military, the Surgeon General, will defend the Armed Forces' use of Lariam when he appears before the Defence Select Committee later today. A Conservative politician Jonny Mercer, himself a former soldier, is a member of the Committee. ""The question is, is the price we're paying for our servicemen, some of whom have suffered really tragic mental health problems after using this, is that price worth paying for the protection we get from malaria which is a killer disease? ""That is a serious conversation we need to have."" The Ministry of Defence said: ""No anti-malarial treatments are without associated side effects but it is crucial we protect our personnel from this potentially fatal disease upon deployment to affected areas. ""We need to be able to use the most appropriate drug in order to ensure resistance and base our advice on the current guidelines set out by Public Health England. ""Mefloquine is used throughout the world but is not prescribed widely in the UK military, and only after an individual risk assessment."""
2016-01-13,All your questions answered about how today's industrial action could affect you.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160113013429/http://news.sky.com/story/1621191/doctors-strike-the-key-questions-answered,"By Robert Nisbet, Senior Political Correspondent All your questions answered about how today's industrial action could affect you. So why are junior doctors striking? They are unhappy with government proposals to bring in a new work contract. Both sides are now trying come to an agreement, but the process has been a fractious one. The latest NHS proposal is for an 11% rise in basic pay for staff, while shrinking the number of hours considered to be 'unsocial'. Those 'premium pay' hours would now kick in at 10pm rather than 7pm from Monday to Friday and end at 7am. Before any work over the weekend was considered 'premium', but the current plans would consider Saturday a normal working day until 7pm. In return, the government claims maximum working hours would be reduced and the proposals would have a negligible effect on junior doctors' pay. The BMA says the package is ""misleading"" as it would erode protections for doctors and make the NHS less safe for patients. Why does Jeremy Hunt want to change the contracts? The Health Secretary wants a ""truly seven-day NHS"", which means elective surgeries and treatments (ie: non-urgent procedures) would be available every day. This was a key Conservative party manifesto pledge during last year's general election. Aren't doctors paid loads of money? Junior doctors are deemed to be those who have completed their training but are yet to become consultants. Trainee doctors currently have a starting salary of £22,636, which increases to £30,000 within four years. This amount can be topped up by a series of supplementary payments up to £40,000 at the start and £56,000 as they gain more experience. Doctors in specialist training receive a salary of between £30,002 and £47,175, which can rise in exceptional cases to £69,325. How long will it last? Today's strike lasts 24 hours, so will end at 8am on Wednesday morning. Will there be another one? If there is no agreement then there will be an escalation of industrial action. There will be a 48 hour stoppage for elective treatments from 8am on Tuesday 26 January. If there's still no deal then there are plans for a full 'withdrawal of labour' - an all-out strike including emergency care - on Wednesday 10 February from 8am to 5pm. How will it hit hospitals? Hospital managers say they will do their best to reschedule elective surgery and that emergency treatment today should be unaffected. However the National Medical Director of NHS England has told hospital bosses to ""walk the floor"" and call back junior doctors if there is an ""exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance."" The BMA interprets that letter as an attempt to ""thwart"" the strike which has caused ""concern and anger"" among its members. What if I have an operation coming up? Check with your hospital. They should be able to reschedule the procedure if it falls on one of the planned days of industrial action. So far today 4,000 procedures are thought to have been cancelled."

The 69-year-old actor, who returned to play the role in new film Creed, has now played the boxer seven times since the original version - Rocky - in 1976. In the new film, directed by Ryan Coogler, Rocky is tracked down by Adonis Johnson, the son of former rival Apollo Creed and persuaded to re-enter the boxing world as the young athlete's trainer. Speaking at the film's European premiere in London's Leicester Square, he told Sky News: ""It was kind of daunting because I thought Rocky's story was pretty much done and I was pretty happy with it. Stallone has won a Golden Globe for the role ""Then this young man, Ryan Coogler, has this idea to resurrect him, not as a fighter but as an older man who is facing loneliness and isolation."" Stallone won a Golden Globe last weekend and, as he accepted the best supporting actor award, he thanked ""my imaginary friend Rocky Balboa for being the best friend I ever had"". Coogler brought his father to the premiere and said it was their relationship that motivated him to make the film. ""He's the biggest Rocky fan in the world, and he means a lot to me,"" the writer and director said. ""He got really sick round about the time I finished film school. And going through that put me in a real emotional place, and I came up with this story as a way to vent."""

Check ignition 
and may God's love be with you (David Bowie) Bowie influenced not only the careers of some artists but their style, too. Fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier, who visited the touring 'David Bowie is' exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London a few years ago, said: ""David Bowie was an absolute Rock Star. He transcended the eras, influencing them and sometimes even creating them musically, intellectually and as a humanly. ""Personally he inspired me by his creativity, his extravagance, his sense of fashion(s) that he was constantly reinventing, by his allure, his elegance and his play on gender."" Tommy Hilfiger hailed Bowie a ""true style icon"" on Instagram. Glastonbury Festival's Facebook page carried images of the icon - who performed there in 1971 and 2000 - with the message: ""Thank you David Bowie for all the magic and memories."" Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""I grew up listening to and watching the pop genius David Bowie. He was a master of re-invention, who kept getting it right. A huge loss."" Former PM Tony Blair, who described himself as huge Bowie fan and saw his Ziggy Stardust concert as a student, said in a statement it was ""a great privilege when I got to meet him later in life"". His former spokesman and Number 10 spin doctor Alastair Campbell said it was only one of the two times he ever saw Mr Blair star-struck. The Vatican also paid tribute to the superstar with Gianfranco Ravasi, Cardinal and head of its Culture Council, posting lyrics from Bowie's Space Oddity on Twitter: ""Ground Control to Major Tom Commencing countdown, engines on Check ignition and may God's love be with you (David Bowie)"" Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn described Bowie as an ""amazing showman"". He told Sky News: ""He was quite unique - you never quite knew what you were going to get. He was always reinventing himself."" Bowie biographer Mary Finnigan, who the singer lived with as a lodger between April and September 1969, described him as a ""kind and thoughtful person"", who was very dedicated to his career. She told Sky News: ""While he lived with me, he composed a lot of music. Me and my children were witnesses to an extraordinary process, it was one song written after another which appeared after his second album."" Director Guillermo del Toro tweeted: ""Bowie existed so all of us misfits learned that an oddity was a precious thing. he changed the world forever.""  Chris Hadfield, the former commander of the International Space Station who recorded a video of a version of Bowie's Space Oddity during his final mission in 2013, tweeted: ""Ashes to ashes, dust to stardust.

2016-01-13,The moment a suspected Islamic State suicide bomber killed at least 10 people in an attack in the Turkish city of Istanbul was captured on one tourist's camera.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160113013429/http://news.sky.com/story/1621185/istanbul-bomb-blast-caught-on-tourists-camera,"The moment a suspected Islamic State suicide bomber killed at least 10 people in an attack in the Turkish city of Istanbul was captured on one tourist's camera. Eight Germans and a Peruvian man have been confirmed as the victims of the blast in Sultanahmet Square, next to the city's famous Blue Mosque landmark. Another 15 people, including nine Germans, were injured in the attack, which happened at 10.20am local time (8.20am UK time). The tourist, who happened to be filming at the site when the suicide bomber struck, survived the attack unharmed. The moment the bomber struck. Pic: Depo Photos/REX/Shutterstock Germany has warned its citizens to avoid crowded places away from tourist attractions in Istanbul, saying further violent clashes and ""terrorist attacks"" are expected across Turkey. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said the Germans involved were from a group travelling together, said: ""Today Istanbul was hit; Paris has been hit, Tunisia has been hit, Ankara has been hit before. Gallery: Explosion In Central Istanbul A map showing where the blast happened ""International terrorism is once again showing its cruel and inhuman face today."" Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the bomber, a 28-year-old Syrian national, was a suspected member of Islamic State. The individual is thought to have recently crossed from Syria but was not on Turkey's watch list. He was identified from body parts at the scene. Six Germans, one Peruvian, a South Korean and a Norweigian are thought to be among the injured. The Norwegian man, Salvation Army officer Jostein Nielsen, told Norway's TV2 that he and his wife were sightseeing when the bomb went off. ""I first heard a bang that I think is what detonated the bomb,"" the 59-year-old said. ""After that came the real bang. I felt that my knee stopped working. There were human remains all over the place."" Police sealed off the scene, which is near an obelisk in the area that is on the site of the ancient Roman hippodrome. No group has claimed responsibility, but Turkey has been the scene of numerous acts of terrorism in the past, including several claimed by al Qaeda-linked groups and Islamic State. More than 30 people were killed in a suicide attack in the town of Suruc, near Turkey's border with Syria, in July - an attack claimed by IS. NATO member Turkey has been part of the coalition fighting IS in Syria since 2014, but is also conducting military operations against Kurdish groups it regards as terrorists. The country's President Recep Tayyip Ergogan said that Turkey is the first target of all terrorist groups in the region, as his country is fighting them all ""equally""."
2016-01-13,"It was a pulsating event that lasted more than 30 hours, was full of high tension and low farce, and ended with resignation drama.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160113013429/http://news.sky.com/story/1618002/labours-day-of-sledging-its-not-cricket,"It was a pulsating event that lasted more than 30 hours, was full of high tension and low farce, and ended with resignation drama. The 2nd Test between South Africa and England in Capetown? Or Jeremy Corbyn's so-called revenge reshuffle? The answer, of course, is both. And just as the Test Match ended in a draw, so too did the battle between Mr Corbyn and his enemies in the Labour Party. Both sides will settle for a draw because Mr Corbyn won a victory by moving pro-Trident Maria Eagle from shadow defence secretary, but suffered a defeat because he failed to shift Hilary Benn from his shadow foreign secretary post. Mr Benn was the Hashim Amla - the South African captain who batted obdurately for two days - of the shadow cabinet, digging in and refusing to budge. Of course, unlike Amla, who announced a shock resignation when the drama was over, it wasn't Mr Benn who quit at the end of the contest. But three of his Labour teammates - Jonathan Reynolds, Stephen Doughty and Kevan Jones - did, resigning from their front-bench jobs in protest to the shuffling that occurred. Just as Ben Stokes electrified the Test Match with an explosive 258 in England's first innings, Michael Dugher provocatively grabbed the headlines on day one of the Corbyn reshuffle by tweeting his own sacking from his culture, media and sport post. And as Stokes was later accused of ""sledging"" his South African opponents, Mr Dugher took to the airwaves and began sledging Mr Corbyn and his supporters. At times, the ferocity of his verbal onslaught was every bit as brutal as Stokes' batting in Cape Town. The high tension at Westminster came in the battle Mr Benn fought to save his position in the shadow cabinet. The low farce - like the England cricket team's dropped catches in the field - was what appeared to be hour after hour of dithering by Mr Corbyn over who to sack and who to appoint to key jobs. Of the three Labour resignations so far, Kevan Jones' was the most dramatic. In a candid interview with Kay Burley on Sky News, he disputed many of the statements made earlier by Mr Corbyn and his team about the moving of his boss, Maria Eagle. :: The three resignation letters in full As midnight approached at the end of the Labour reshuffle, John McDonnell told reporters outside the Labour leader's suite of offices that her position had been ""resolved amicably"" and she was ""a happy person"". Labour sources later claimed she had wanted the move to the culture, media and sport brief. Not so, insisted Mr Jones. She wanted to stay in her job, he said. This was just one example of many acrimonious disputes between the Labour leadership and those shadow ministers who were either given out or walked. Like challenging the umpire's decision, you might say. Except in politics, unlike modern test cricket, for those who have to walk there's no review system with slow-motion action replays. The most poisonous sledging between Mr Corbyn's supporters and his opponents was over the sacking of Pat McFadden from his job as Europe spokesman for what the leadership claimed was ""serial disloyalty"". The Reynolds and Doughty resignations were sparked by Mr McFadden's dismissal. Kevan Jones' was more over a policy clash. In Cape Town, it was Jonny Bairstow, who made a big comeback with a maiden test century. In the shadow cabinet, Emily Thornberry's comeback as shadow defence secretary was much more remarkable. Just over a year ago she was sacked by Ed Miliband for her notorious ""white van man"" tweet during the Rochester and Strood by-election. During the epic struggle of past few days, many Labour MPs - just like cricket fans - will have watched the unpredictable events unfold with bemusement. Their reaction? Stumped, I imagine."

The dig at Must Farm quarry in Cambridgeshire has also unearthed a human skull, ceramics, jewels and weapons. The finds provide a unique insight into the lives of families in Bronze Age Britain. The houses, which were built on stilts, were apparently damaged in a fire which caused them to fall into a river. The ancient Roman site of Pompeii was devastated by a volcanic eruption Silt in the river helped preserve pots with food still inside. Human and animal remains have also been found. Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, likened the settlement to the ancient Roman site of Pompeii, which was devastated by a volcanic eruption. He told Sky News: ""The nearest analogy I can think of is Pompeii where there was a catastrophe and everybody left very quickly, leaving behind their food vessels, and some died in the process. ""We have found human remains which we are in the process of excavating."" The archaeological team are now hoping to find out if the fire was started deliberately and why the 3,000-year-old settlement was abandoned."

Abdeslam, a native of Brussels, is believed to have played a key logistical role in the 13 November attacks in which 130 people were killed. His older brother Brahim was a suicide bomber. Responsibility for the attacks was claimed by extremists from the so-called Islamic State. The new pictures were taken at around 9.45am on 14 November and show Abdeslam with his friend Hamza Attou at a petrol station near the Belgian border. Police have already said that Abdeslam called two friends Mohammed Amri and Hamza Attou in Brussels earlier that morning to ask if they could collect him from the French capital and bring him back to Brussels. The three men were stopped near the border by French police but then released, as Abdeslam had not yet been connected to the French attacks. Abdeslam, 26, arrived in Brussels later that day, was met by someone else and then police admit they ""lost him"". Amri and Attou were arrested and face terror charges but Abdeslam is now the subject of an international manhunt. Belgian police have arrested 10 people as part of their investigation into the attacks."

In an interview with French radio, Mr Blair said such a scenario would be followed by a second independence vote, with Scotland choosing to go it alone this time.

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said an agreement on the UK's renegotiation with Brussels could be delayed beyond a summit next month. Mr Hammond said it would be ""inappropriate and unwise"" for the UK to insist on finalising a deal at the European Council summit on 18-19 February.

2016-01-27,A man who says he was the victim of sex assault has told Sky News how his struggle to get help left him suicidal.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160127143449/http://news.sky.com/story/1630245/nspcc-abuse-victims-struggling-to-get-help,"By Katie Spencer, Sky News Reporter A man who says he was the victim of sex assault has told Sky News how his struggle to get help left him suicidal. It comes as an NSPCC report suggests there is inadequate mental health support for abused children. ""Elliot"" was 13 years old when he says he was sexually assaulted. He'd been asked to take part in a charity fashion show. During a clothes fitting, a man in his twenties started touching him. ""We were in the changing room and I was too scared to say anything,"" he told Sky News. Over the course of the next three hours, he says he was repeatedly assaulted but too afraid to make a fuss. It's something he regrets to this day. ""I was upset with myself for not saying anything earlier on during the evening when he was assaulting me, but at the time I didn't want to acknowledge what was happening."" The police were eventually called and the case was brought to court. It left Elliot mentally traumatised. ""I just wanted it to go away. It dragged on for so long and was making me feel so low."" In the end his alleged abuser was found not guilty. ""The police called me to say he was found not guilty on four counts of sexual assault and they were undecided on the two more serious counts of sexual assault and that there was going to be a retrial. ""Ten minutes later, someone from victim support called me and told me that my case had been dropped because the Judge didn't think it was in the public interest to spend money on a retrial."" The experience left him feeling suicidal. ""I thought I might as well end it ... I just felt so alone, I was constantly blaming myself for everything that happened."" Realising his depression, his mum tried to get him seen by CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) but at first they were told he didn't qualify. ""They said because you're not at risk, we don't need to see you. ""And I was thinking 'well, I want to see someone, I am at risk. I'm hurting myself and I can't control it because all of the feelings from everything that happened are making me feel this low and I need to see someone and speak about it.'"" After the NSPCC pleaded his case, he did eventually get to see a psychiatrist. ""Some people might think 'why didn't you just get over it?' but it's kind of hard to get over it when you're trying to deal with it on your own. After going through the courts and being spat out again."" According to the NSPCC, longer waiting lists and reductions in spending have had a big impact on the support that's available. In a survey of over a thousand professionals who work with abused children, more than three quarters said in the last five years it's become more difficult to access therapy. Over half reported that the criteria for assessing which children can access local mental health services are too stringent. The charity says often children who have been abused have to develop chronic mental health problems before therapeutic services become available to them. Jon Brown, who's head of the NSPCC's sexual abuse programmes, describes it as a ""national scandal""."

Speaking to Sky News, Melissa Mead, 29, of Penryn in Cornwall, said: ""It could have just taken one person to say 'something's not quite right'."" One-year-old William died from blood poisoning in December 2014, after developing an abscess in his left lung. A report found he could have been saved if an NHS 111 hotline call handler had realised how sick he was - and if a qualified medic had realised the need for ""urgent medical attention"". His mother told of how his condition deteriorated and his temperature plunged, however, ""no one picked this up, so we thought it was normal because we didn't know what the signs of sepsis were ... we didn't know he was in a life-threatening condition"". Mrs Mead said the family sought reassurance from several doctors ""who all made the same errors - which is just catastrophic"". ""We trusted them, and we didn't trust one, we trusted them all, and they all failed,"" she said. She described William as ""a delightful little boy. He was everything we had ever imagined and more ... he was so loving"". Mrs Mead said every day without William was like ""a debilitating life sentence"". ""We don't get up in the morning and think, 'oh, we feel better today', because we don't."" Fighting back the tears she added: ""William is still not here. #teamwilliam on our way to London to spread the #sepsis message and share #williamslegacy 💙 pic.twitter.com/2e5M9oZCsS ""William still should be here, and for what is milestones for everyone else who have children in their lives, are losses for us. ""We won't ever have that future that we had planned, that we had dreamed of. ""We just hope that as much as William changed our lives, we are now able to move forward and change the lives of others."" She has called for a national public heath campaign, similar to that for raising awareness of the signs of meningitis, to help people spot the symptoms of sepsis. William's death has thrown doubt on whether the NHS's out-of-hours helpline can identify when children have potentially deadly illnesses. Addressing the Commons on the issue on Tuesday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to the family. ""I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the family of William Mead. I have met William's mother, Melissa, who has spoken incredibly movingly about the loss of her son,"" he said. ""Quite simply we let her, her family and William down in the worst possible way through serious failings in the NHS care offered and I would like to apologise to them on behalf of the Government and the NHS for what happened."" He admitted ""a major failing was that in the last six to eight weeks of William's life, the underlying pathology including pneumonia and a chest infection, were not properly recognised and treated"". He said the understanding of sepsis across the NHS was ""totally inadequate"", and insisted significant efforts were being made to improve awareness of the condition amongst doctors and the public. ""But the tragic death of William Mead reminds us that there is much, much more to be done,"" he said, adding that the recommendations in the report would be implemented as soon as possible. Among the 16 mistakes pointed out in the report were: Our children's symptom checker for Sepsis is a must have for every parent or people in contact with children #sepsis pic.twitter.com/Eq4DdTiQRl :: GPs - who saw him six times in the months leading up to his death - failed to look for signs of sepsis and give William potentially life-saving antibiotics. :: His GPs had not recorded all of the necessary information in his notes. :: Doctors working out of hours were also unable to access patients' medical records. :: The system used by the hotline that includes a box-ticking questionnaire by staff is not ""sensitive"" enough to identify when children are deteriorating because of the deadly inflammatory condition. Lindsey Scott, director of nursing with NHS England in the South West, said: ""In William's case, it's clear in looking back that opportunities to intervene more decisively were missed. ""But we will only be able to make a real difference if professionals across the country understand how different choices at critical moments might avert a similar tragedy."""

The taxpayer-backed bank made the announcement in a surprise trading statement which confirmed £3.6bn of extra charges in total. The lender's share price fell more than 5% when the FTSE 100 opened in reaction to the news. They later fought back but still closed 2.8% down. It said a provision of £1.5bn related to various litigation claims in the US concerning mortgage-backed securities. It meant that RBS, which is expecting a settlement this year, had booked a total £3.8bn charge to date to cover civil action. It added £500m to its PPI scandal fallout fund, taking the total so far to £4.3bn, and a £498m writedown in the value of its private banking business.  RBS also confirmed it was pumping an additional £4.2bn into its pension scheme - taking a £1.6bn hit from accounting charges in the process. Sky's City Editor Mark Kleinman said the trading update meant the bank was on course to announce a ""thumping great loss"" for 2015 next month. It would be its eighth consecutive year of losses. Sky had previously reported that UK banks were set to announce £5bn in extra provisions to cover PPI scandal costs when they reported their annual results. The figure would be on top of £27bn already absorbed by the industry. Santander UK also revealed on Wednesday that its annual profits took a £450m hit from PPI - falling 4% to £1.3bn. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said of the latest charges facing it: ""I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. ""We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses. ""We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders."""

The Tale Of Kitty-In-Boots will go on sale in September, 150 years after the author and illustrator's birth. Beatrix Potter remains one of the world's best-selling children's authors The story was discovered two years ago by publisher Jo Hanks who spotted a reference to the manuscript in an out-of-print biography about the best-selling children's writer. The book referred to a letter Ms Potter had written to her publisher in 1914, talking about a new story concerning ""a well-behaved prime black Kitty cat, who leads rather a double life"". Kitty in her role as domestic pet to an elderly lady Beatrix Potter, who died in 1943, wrote and illustrated 28 books altogether but Quentin Blake, the illustrator behind Roald Dahl's well-loved stories, will provide the drawings for the new story. Sir Quentin said: ""It seemed almost incredible when, early in 2015, I was sent the manuscript of a story by Beatrix Potter, one which had lain unpublished for 100 years and which, with the exception of a single drawing, she had never illustrated."" He went on to say he liked the story instantly and added: ""I have a strange feeling that it might have been waiting for me."" Quentin Blake provides the illustrations for the new book Ms Hanks, who works for Penguin Random House, said Sir Quentin was the perfect artist to illustrate the book because he ""understands what makes a story engaging for children and adults, just as Potter did"". Potter's first children's book was The Tale Of Peter Rabbit, based on a real rabbit named Peter Piper. The book, published in 1902 by publisher Frederick Warne & Co, was an instant success."

The sperm whale is believed to be from the same pod as those found on Friday and at the weekend. Three washed up in Skegness, Lincolnshire, and the fourth in Hunstanton, Norfolk. The fifth whale was found on Monday in Wainfleet, around five miles from Skegness. The sperm whale that was found in Hunstanton The dead animals are understood to have been part of a group of six spotted in The Wash on Friday. They have been linked to a larger pod, some of which beached in the Netherlands and Germany. :: Why Do Whales Wash Ashore? East Lindsey District Council has said it may be a ""few days"" before the 48ft whales on the Skegness beach are removed. In the meantime, scientists are inspecting the carcasses and trying to figure out what caused their deaths. It is believed they died at sea before washing up over the weekend. An explosive release of gas burst out from one of the whales as scientists cut into it on Monday. People have been urged not to go near them, but graffiti has been sprayed on two of the carcasses, including ""man's fault"", ""Fukushima RIP"" and ""CND"". The council needs to be granted formal permission by the Marine Management Organisation to move the whales. A council spokesman said: ""The council has well-rehearsed plans for dealing with such situations, having dealt with a number of strandings in recent years, the most recent being in 2012, when a sperm whale weighing around 30 tons was beached just north of Skegness Pier. ""Whilst it is understandable that people wish to view the whales, those doing so are asked to not go through the cordon to touch them. ""The council will dispose of their bodies as soon as the relevant permissions are in place."" The 50ft sperm whale that died in Hunstanton on Friday is thought to have become distressed and injured its tail thrashing around in the shallow waters. Rescue divers were joined by staff from RNLI, HM Coastguard and Hunstanton Sea Life Sanctuary - but their attempts to push the whale back into deeper waters were unsuccessful."
2016-01-27,It is no surprise to learn there are yet more obstacles being thrown in front of the new Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160127143449/http://news.sky.com/story/1630711/edf-has-right-to-feel-nerves-over-hinkley,"It is no surprise to learn there are yet more obstacles being thrown in front of the new Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset. There have been numerous delays to date, ranging from planning objections, continual questions over the financing and the incentives to be offered to EDF, the constructor, right down to objections from Lady Gass, the former Lord Lieutenant of Somerset, who agreed to sell around 230 acres of the site to EDF but retained freehold for some of the property and refused to give consent unless guarantees were given on sensitive treatment of the landscape. As things are, even without this latest wrinkle, Hinkley Point C seems unlikely to be constructed much before 2025. Now, or so it would appear, EDF itself may be having cold feet. This would be quite understandable. The collapse in oil and gas prices has eaten into the company’s profits - even though the company is predominantly a nuclear generator it will have been hit by the accompanying fall in wholesale power prices – and its stock market valuation has slumped to the extent that, earlier this month, it was relegated from the CAC 40, France’s equivalent of the FTSE-100 index, and replaced, ignominiously, by a shopping centre operator. The cost of building Hinkley Point C has escalated to the extent that it will now cost €30bn (£22.8bn), two-thirds of which is currently due to be met by EDF whose stock market value is now a mere €22bn. Moreover, the concerns over the ‘European pressurised reactor’ technology to be used at Hinkley Point C have not gone away: projects to build the same reactors at Flamanville in Normandy and at Olkiluoto in Finland have been delayed by more than five years apiece - the latter by nine years - and, again, costs have escalated. The state-backed China General Nuclear Power Corp and China National Nuclear Corp, EDF's partners in the project, have always had their doubts about the reactor technology and not least because it is designed by the French company Areva - which itself had to be bailed out by Paris and EDF last year. This in itself put yet further strain on EDF's balance sheet. This latter factor is now likely to be behind the latest delays. EDF has always been a company in thrall to its powerful trade unions - 17 years ago, when France introduced a 35-hour working week, some 30,000 EDF employees won the right to 10 weeks paid holiday - and these unions are now agitating about the sheer cost of Hinkley at a time when the company is having to shed 6,000 jobs worldwide. Onto that can be overlaid a political dimension: EDF is effectively controlled by the French government and Francois Hollande, the French President, has shown a propensity to interfere in its affairs in a way that his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, did not. He will be paying particular attention to any concerns raised by the unions. With EDF and Areva both requiring recapitalisation by the French government, which holds stakes of 85% and 87% in them respectively, Mr Hollande may feel that his taxpayers may have better things on which to spend their money. Areva alone is said to require up to €5bn in new equity and, with Mr Hollande having just successfully lobbied the Indian government to give Areva the right to build six new reactors in Jaitapur, in the west of the country, he may insist cash is earmarked for that work rather than Hinkley C - particularly in view of the French government's desire to foster closer trade links with India over a range of projects, including fighter jets. It may well be that EDF, having already spent more than £1bn preparing the site in Somerset on which Hinkley C will be built, feels it has no choice but to press ahead with its plans. However, if it proves too difficult financially, even with the huge incentives being provided by the UK government - all of which will ultimately find their way onto household energy bills - it is unlikely that Hinkley C will ever be built unless the Chinese can be persuaded to take on the project. That is not to say new nuclear power plants will never be built in the UK. The Franco-Japanese NuGen consortium is planning to have a reactor at Moorside, Cumbria, up and running by the end of 2024 and Horizon, another developer backed by Hitachi of Japan, aims to have a reactor running at Wylfa, Anglesey, earlier in the next decade. Meanwhile, China General Nuclear Power Corp is looking to build a new plant at Bradwell, Essex, using its own reactor technology. But it all seems a long time ago that Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF's UK arm, promised that British households would be able to cook their Christmas turkey in 2017 using nuclear power."

The dog, named Ludivine, was a last-minute entry into the inaugural Elkmont Half Marathon last week after her owner let her outside to relieve herself. Ludivine, said to have a penchant for solo walks through the woods, apparently heard the sound of runners gathering at the nearby starting line and went to investigate. Ludivine received a medal. Pic: Elkmont Half Marathon/Facebook When the starting gun fired Ludivine took off with the pack, witnesses told Runner's World. She stopped several times throughout the 13.1-mile trek to inspect other dogs and animals, including a dead rabbit around the two-mile mark, race competitors told the magazine. Jim Clemens, who eventually finished fourth, said: ""Every time I thought she had dropped off to go back home, I would hear her coming back up to me, and she would race past me up to the two leaders."" Ludivine eventually crossed the finish line in a time of 1:32:56 - good enough for seventh out of some 165 runners. Race volunteers put a medal on the dog, who took time to pose for a picture after the race. As Ludivine's accomplishment began to go viral, race organisers noted on Facebook that the dog was helping put the inaugural race ""on the map"". Her owner, April Hamlin, said she learned of the dog's exploits after receiving photos via text messages. ""All I did was open the door, and she ran the race on her own accord,"" Ms Hamlin told Runner's World. She added that Ludivine is ""laid back and friendly, so I can't believe she ran the whole half marathon because she's actually really lazy""."

The corpse was found on a barren heath at Cockley Cley on 27 August 1974 dressed only in a pink 1969 Marks & Spencer night-dress and tied up with a rope mainly used in agriculture. Rope used to tie up the victim was a type used mainly in agriculture The victim is thought to have been 5ft 2in tall and aged between 23 and 35 when she was murdered. Tests have established she was also probably a mother. Despite a huge police investigation her killer was never found. But after exhuming the body in 2008 and conducting further tests, detectives believe the victim may have been a Danish sex worker who worked around Great Yarmouth docks. Forensic experts used a method of geographical profiling that analysed particular trace elements in her body to identify where the woman may have lived or visited before her death. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Guy said: ""As part of our investigations we employed two scientists to study the victim's isotopic make-up. ""This resulted in both experts believing that the victim had spent time in an area defined as central Europe - this would encompass Denmark, Germany, Austria and northern Italy. ""Another interesting feature was her diet appeared to be predominantly fish and shellfish. ""This led us to one report of a woman known as The Duchess, who lived and worked around Yarmouth docks and was thought to be from Denmark. ""She was known to people in the Great Yarmouth area around 1973/74 but one day just disappeared. ""It may be that The Duchess has nothing to do with this inquiry but we would very much like to be able to eliminate her as the victim at Cockley Cley as we have been unable to establish her true identity."" Officers now have a full DNA profile which could help identify her through a family member. ""I believe if we identify the victim we can identify her murderer,"" said Chief Insp Guy. :: Anyone with information or who believes they may have known the victim should contact the investigation team on 01953 424520."

No? Well, 48-year-old Susanne Hinte from Worcester says that's just what's happened to her. Superbly bad luck you may say, but according to lottery operator Camelot she's not alone. Hundreds of people have come forward claiming to be the missing winner of a £33m jackpot prize. So how does Camelot sort the winners from the washouts and if your ticket is verified, can you still claim your millions? :: Is there a deadline to come forward? With all National Lottery draws, players have 180 days from the day of the draw to claim their prize. But, if your ticket is lost, stolen or damaged you have to submit a written claim to Camelot within 30 days. :: How does Camelot verify claims? In order for Camelot to start its investigation you have to provide as much evidence as possible in the written statement. That might include where and when the ticket was bought, whether the numbers were a Lucky Dip or chosen by you, how many lines were played and so on. Camelot told Sky News it may as part of the investigation analyse CCTV footage from the shop where the ticket was bought. It declined to offer further details about investigation procedures on the grounds that it could compromise active and future claims. :: Why can't Camelot tell who has a winning ticket? Unless they are bought online, Camelot never takes people's names so can't identify winning ticket holders. It said requiring names would violate a player's right to anonymity.  It does record where winning tickets were bought and will name the area if a prize worth more than £50,000 goes unclaimed for two weeks. Last week for example, it was revealed the £33m ticket was bought in the Worcester area.  But it will never name the shop, again so the winner can remain anonymous. Most winners don't choose to come forward and releasing the shop name would make it too easy to identify them. :: What should you never do with your ticket? Iron it!

The former Army officer died after collapsing from exhaustion 30 miles short of completing a solo crossing of Antarctica. He set up the page to raise money for the Endeavour Fund, which helps wounded servicemen and women, and was trying to become the first adventurer to cross the South Pole entirely unsupported. The 55-year-old had already achieved his original fundraising goal when he called for help and had to be airlifted from the treacherous ice to a hospital in Punta Arenas, Chile. Prince William is patron of the fund Worsley was supporting He had been trying to finish the uncompleted journey of his lifelong hero Sir Ernest Shackleton, who started his attempt in 1914 and had to be rescued two years later. Following the announcement of his death, many people have contributed to the site and the figure is still rising. Scores of tributes have been left on the Virgin Money Giving page for the former lieutenant-colonel. One donor, Philip Smith, wrote: ""I had the privilege of serving with Col Henry briefly with 2RGJ in Kosovo and was greatly saddened by the news of his death. ""What better epitaph than service and sacrifice for the benefit of so many others."" His death also inspired messages from younger people. Teenager Amy Rose wrote: ""I am 16 years old, but I think I will remember Mr Worsley and I hope I will carry his spirit with me when I face challenges."" British astronaut Tim Peake paid tribute from space to his fellow explorer, tweeting: ""Thoughts are with the family & friends of Henry Worsley - a true explorer, adventurer & inspiration to many."" BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner tweeted: ""My last memory of explorer Henry Worsley who died crossing Antarctica: our dinner together in Kandahar, full of plans for his next adventure."" Col Worsley's wife Joanna had rushed to reach her husband while he was undergoing surgery but she did not get there before his death from complete organ failure. He is to be repatriated to the UK. The Duke of Cambridge expressed his sadness at the news, saying he and Prince Harry had lost a friend. In a last online message, Worsley said: ""My summit is just out of reach."" He resolved to ""gather my thoughts in a final message in the coming days"" and finished with the words: ""This is Henry Worsley, signing off, journey's end."""

The Coventry City Police team has been posting the images while on ""burglary patrol"" in the city ""making sure life is not being made easy for thieves"". Some of the images show houses with unlocked doors or windows, sometimes including street names, but other photographs are of officers standing inside the homes. One photo is of an officer in a hallway with the caption: ""PCSO Smith speaking to a resident off Holyhead Road about door left open."" Another tweet shows an officer inside the hallway of another home with the caption: ""Another house left open, owner advised, that's 6 in half hour!! Stop making life easy for thieves."" Some of the images showed unlocked windows One image of a security alarm inside a resident's house said: ""Spotted this alarm, great addition to home security, but we were able to walk into its owners home through open door."" Another shows an officer inside a darkened home with the caption: ""Three house doors in a row left open, victims waiting to happen!"" Dozens of people on social media have questioned their actions. One user, Chris McKee, said it ""seems a daft approach considering how someone could reasonably respond aggressively to the unwarranted intrusion"". Cov City Police responded to his tweet saying: ""Thanks for your knowledgeable thoughts & wisdom, we will take on board your observations when the relevant situation arises."" Mr McKee added: ""I'm not sure where you stand legally entering a private home without a warrant. Unlocked doors don't give permission."" User Quendergeer said: ""Pretty sure ""wandering in to make a point"" would recieve a very dim view from the ipcc."" Ryan Brown tweeted: ""It's not a crime to leave your door unlocked, you've entered without asking and now people know they leave they door unlocked."" The force said it had received positive feedback from local people Shannon said it was ""breaking and entering"" and added: ""It's not illegal to leave your door unlocked. In many places, it's abnormal to leave your door locked."" Sheanderthal said: ""You can't just be walking into peoples homes. Its a complete invasion of privacy."" Niffy1a tweeted: ""... if my dog attacks you as you trespass in my house ... don't blame me or him."" Situations when officers do not need a warrant to enter properties include: dealing with a breach of peace or preventing it; enforcing an arrest warrant; arresting a person or to save a life or prevent serious damage to property. The Cov City Police team tweeted at the weekend: ""Thanks all for the feedback on one of the burglary prevention tactics. We'll review based on feedback #socialmediasuccess?"" Chief Inspector Helen Kirkman said: ""A significant proportion all burglaries in this area − in excess of 25% − are 'walk-in' offences committed by opportunists taking advantage of properties left unsecure. ""Neighbourhood police teams have been on patrol to deter such offences, look for suspects, and to offer crime prevention advice to residents. ""If they find a door or window left open I think people would want officers to check everything is OK at that address and not to just walk on by. ""We have had very positive feedback from residents …they are grateful for officers pointing out what they've found and the advice they're offered. ""We encourage our police teams to be proactive and creative in their use of social media to engage with the public and get messages across. ""We haven't received any complaints from residents but obviously we will take on board social media comments."""

The owners of the Glenridding Hotel in Ullswater, Cumbria, posted a message on Facebook revealing it had been hit again a month after being ""hammered"" by floods. ""We are flooding again. We are feeling very emotional here as we are receiving the full brunt of the water yet again,"" the message said. Water rushing past the hotel ""Feeling devastated, tired and defeated."" They posted pictures showing a swollen river rushing past the hotel and parts of the grounds under water. The hotel flooded three times last month, the wettest December ever recorded in the UK. The rain and gale-force winds are remnants of a storm that has battered the US East Coast. Storm Jonas dumped near record-breaking amounts of snow on the US East Coast at the weekend. The hotel grounds are flooded At least 37 deaths were attributed to the storm. A Met Office spokeswoman said: ""As it travels across to us, we're not going to get snowfall, it will just manifest itself as wet and windy weather because, as it travels over the Atlantic, it picks up moisture and warms up, which means it comes as rain rather than snow. ""What we have got is a lot of weather coming our way."" Severe weather warnings have been issued for Wales, Scotland, Lancashire, Cumbria, Yorkshire, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall and the South East. A swollen river Greta, in Keswick. Pic: Adam Anderson-Cole Forecasters are predicting around 30 to 50mm of rain in most parts and up to 80 to 100mm in exposed upland areas. Many aircraft are in a holding pattern at Dublin airport and unable to land because of strong winds. Southwestern Scotland is likely to face winds of up to 70mph (112kph). The Environment Agency (EA) said regions that saw record river levels - including Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire - could be at risk again. A flooded football pitch in Keswick. Pic: Adam Anderson-Cole There was also the chance of flooding along the rivers Severn and Wye. Temporary defences and pumps have been deployed across the areas which are expected to be hit.

The Firth of Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands is where oil rigs go when they run out of business - a calm, safe spot to moor until things pick up again.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160128121145/http://news.sky.com/story/1630947/oil-plunge-means-tough-times-for-north-sea,"It is the North Sea's resting place. The Firth of Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands is where oil rigs go when they run out of business - a calm, safe spot to moor until things pick up again. But today, with the oil price having dropped to around $30 a barrel, the firth is almost full, with more rigs moored here than at any time in the past 12 years. It is a vivid illustration of the problems facing the industry. In the North Sea, where it is expensive to drill out in the rough waters, the average breakeven price is somewhere between $40 and $60 a barrel, so today's low oil prices simply make business uneconomical. Two of the rigs left in the firth over the winter have already been towed away to be dismantled. Others may follow. And while those who live and work here (the rig plant at nearby Nigg is the biggest private employer in the Highlands) hope for an imminent pick-up, even the most optimistic admit things are not looking good. This time last year there were around 3,500 people working on rig repairs and maintenance in the port at Invergordon. Today there are only around 200. Across the entire industry there are reckoned to have been more than 65,000 job losses in the past year. The North Sea is not the only region to be struggling in the face of falling oil prices. Shale oil producers in the US, and high cost producers in Canada and Venezuela are also facing difficulties. But with investment here in Scotland likely to fall further in coming months, the worry is that this sector could drag down UK economic growth in the coming years. In some senses, this is merely more evidence of creative destruction in the economy. The offshore oil industry was already in decline. The price collapse merely accelerates the process. In years to come the docks and facilities here may be used to build and repair offshore wind turbines rather than oil platforms. Indeed, Invergordon itself is no stranger to economic turbulence. In 1931 this town was where Naval workers staged a mutiny which caused share prices in London to collapse, and triggered Britain's exit from the Gold Standard system of fixed exchange rates. In the long run this region will recover and thrive again. But, as John Maynard Keynes once said, what matters to people more is the short run, and in the short run things look tough for Invergordon, and tough for the North Sea."
2016-01-28,"Up to 80,000 migrants who arrived in Sweden last year are going to be expelled from the country, its interior minister has announced.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160128121145/http://news.sky.com/story/1631096/sweden-to-expel-up-to-80000-migrants,"Up to 80,000 migrants who arrived in Sweden last year are going to be expelled from the country, its interior minister has announced. Anders Ygeman said thousands of migrants' asylum applications had been rejected. ""We are talking about 60,000 people but the number could climb to 80,000,"" he was quoted as saying by Swedish media. He said the expulsions would be staggered over several years. Police and authorities in charge of migrants have been asked to organise the expulsion. Migrants whose applications are rejected are normally taken out of Sweden using commercial flights. But because of the large number being rejected they would use specially chartered aircraft to take them out of the country, Mr Ygeman said. Sweden accepted more than 160,000 asylum seekers last year, putting it among the EU states with the highest proportion of refugees per capita. The number of migrant arrivals has dropped sharply since it brought in systematic photo ID checks for travellers earlier this month. The announcement comes after a teenage asylum seeker was arrested on suspicion of murdering a female employee at a youth refugee centre in Molndal, near Gothenburg, earlier this week. A motive for the stabbing attack was not clear, but her death has led to questions about overcrowded conditions in some centres, with too few adults and employees to look after children, many traumatised by war. Meanwhile, neighbouring Denmark voted in favour of seizing the assets of asylum seekers to help pay for their stay while their claims are processed.  Valuables worth more than about £1,000 will be seized by police as migrants enter the country to help cover their housing and food costs. Some have likened the new measures to the Nazis confiscating gold and other valuables from Jews during the Holocaust. President of the Danish National Party, Kashif Ahmad, told Sky News: ""There is a connotation and similarity to the 1930s and 1940s in Germany where we saw the Nazis confiscating large amounts of gold from Jews and others. ""Therefore I believe it's a disgrace and it's a shameful law that we passed."" It is part of a package of immigration reforms designed to make Denmark less appealing for migrants. In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron has rejected calls to take in thousands of refugee children who have become separated from their parents and travelled to Europe. However, the UK has offered to resettle more vulnerable children from refugee camps near Syria and offer some assistance to migrant children in Europe."
2016-01-28,"Scientists in Brazil believe the devastating Zika virus may have already crossed over to the common mosquito, dramatically increasing the risk of it spreading worldwide.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160128121145/http://news.sky.com/story/1631065/zika-virus-may-have-spread-to-common-mosquito,"By Alex Crawford, Special Correspondent, in Recife Scientists in Brazil believe the devastating Zika virus may have already crossed over to the common mosquito, dramatically increasing the risk of it spreading worldwide. The Brazilian government is already struggling to contain a growing public health disaster. There are suspicions the mosquito-borne virus is linked to more than 4,000 babies with brain deformities in South America's largest country. The authorities have called troops out on to the street and deployed teams of health workers to try to combat the spread but so far those at the forefront admit they are nowhere near succeeding. Up until now, it was thought the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is confined to the tropics, was solely spreading the virus. But scientists at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Recife, Pernambuco State, in the northeast of the country, believe otherwise. They say they are as little as a month away from confirming that the virus is also being carried and transmitted by the much more common Culex mosquito. There are 20 times more Culex mosquitos in existence as the Aedes aegypti and they are significantly more widespread - breeding throughout most of the Americas, parts of Africa and Asia - so increasing the chances of the virus spreading. The lead research scientist at the foundation, Constancia Ayres, told Sky News that if her suspicions are confirmed, the implications are huge.  ""It means much more combined efforts from a lot of other countries are going to be needed to combat this virus,"" she said. Dr Vanessa Van Der Linden, from the Barao de Lucena Hospital in Recife, was the first person to spot a possible link between the Zika virus and a spike in the increase in microcephaly births, a dangerous condition where babies are born with abnormally small heads. ""I saw three cases of microcephaly in one day last August when normally I would see one maybe every three months,"" she said. ""It was very strange."" She said so little was known about the virus and its effects, she and the other doctors were learning ""as we go along"". The virus has no cure and no vaccine and although efforts have now been stepped up to develop one, it's far too late for the thousands already condemned to a lifetime of struggle - where their hearing and sight may be affected, where their brain development will be limited and their life expectancy shortened. Dr Angela Rocha is from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, which has seen more than 300 microcephaly cases in the last five months. She said: ""We just don't know much about this virus at all. The mothers ask me ,'Will it get better? Will my baby's head grow?' ""And I have to tell them 'no, it's never going to get better'."" :: Have you got a story?

The victim was found half-naked and face down on a mattress in her apartment on Tuesday.  Although a ""considerable amount of blood"" was found at the scene, police have said there were no signs of external injury. Police spokesman Thomas Keiblinger told Sky News no stab wounds, gunshot wounds or significant signs of trauma were found on the body.  Ms Mann was working as a nanny in the Austrian capital ""It's quite strange,"" he said, adding that a preliminary post-mortem examination had shed no further light on the cause of death.  He said a toxicology report has now been ordered to establish whether any drugs or poison were in her system as it is possible the blood was caused by an internal injury.  Local authorities have identified the victim only as ""Lauren M"", however, both NBC and CBS News, citing the US Embassy in Vienna, have named her as 25-year-old Lauren Mann, of Colorado. Police and firefighters forced their way into Ms Mann's studio flat after her employer raised the alarm when she failed to turn up for work. All the light bulbs in the apartment were burnt out and several candles were found around the body, according to local media reports. Austria's Kronen Zeitung newspaper says police are trying to track down the last person to visit the flat. It quoted one anonymous source as saying she had been putting up an ""old acquaintance"" from Gambia who police are now trying to trace. Ms Mann had been studying German and working as an au pair, or nanny, in the Austrian capital for around three years."

Damian O'Hagan, from Liverpool, had charged one of his clients more than £90,000 in VAT - and then tried to keep the money for himself. When he realised HMRC had discovered the fraud in January 2015, he moved to the Spanish resort and opened a bar to evade capture. But less than eight months later, O'Hagan scored an own goal when he returned to the UK so he could see his team Everton play Manchester City at Goodison Park. At the request of HMRC, Merseyside Police arrested the 60-year-old at the turnstiles. On Wednesday, O'Hagan was sentenced to 18 months behind bars at Liverpool Crown Court. During the trial, the client who had paid O'Hagan the VAT money described how the fraud had caused them significant cash flow issues, resulting in the redundancy of two workers. Sandra Smith, from HMRC's fraud investigation service, said: ""O'Hagan knew his business transactions were under scrutiny and the game was up. This was one match he wasn't going to win.

In 1995 Stephen Wynne began selling refurbished DeLoreans in Texas. But now his firm, still using the name the DeLorean Motor Company, is able to build new cars as well, following changes to the laws governing small scale car manufacturers. Mr Wynne told KPRC: ""It's huge for us. It means we're back as a car company again."" The new models are expected to cost around $100,000 but the final price will depend on what engine the designers choose. ""There's no reason to change the appearance of the car,"" Mr Wynne added. ""As we go into the programme, we'll decide what areas need to be freshened up."" Mr Wynne hopes to have the first car completed in early 2017."

Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice, according to the Surrey force. Police said they had arrested a man in his 40s on Wednesday in relation to allegations of rape and assisting an offender, but not murder. Officers later released him without charge over the claims, after finding no evidence to support them. Milly's parents Bob and Sally Dowler Bellfield was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for killing 13-year-old Milly nearly 14 years ago. A Dowler family statement said: ""The Dowler family has been made aware of the recent arrest. Gallery: Levi Bellfield Has Admitted Abducting, Raping And Killing Milly Dowler Milly Dowler was 13 years old when she was abducted on her way home from school in March 2002 ""They have been aware for some considerable time that a new police investigation was taking place into the circumstances of the abduction and murder of Milly. ""The effect of this information has been devastating for a family which has already had to endure so much. ""We must stress how important it is that, notwithstanding this development, the Dowler family should be afforded privacy and space to go about their lives."" When Bellfield went on trial, he was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. Milly was making her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, when she was snatched in March 2002. Her body was found in a wood in Yateley Heath, Hampshire - 25 miles from Walton-on-Thames. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield lived 50 metres from where she went missing but he did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004. In February 2012 he lost a bid to challenge his conviction at the Court of Appeal in London. A spokesman for Surrey Police said on Wednesday: ""During this investigation police have also spoken to Levi Bellfield and he has admitted his responsibility for the abduction, rape and murder of Milly Dowler. ""Despite his conviction, this is the first time Bellfield has made such admissions to police."""

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) are to investigate ""certain"" bosses at the bank in the run-up to its collapse. It comes after a damning report last November by Andrew Green QC, which blasted former regulators for their failure to probe a raft of executives. It also called for further investigations into 10 senior managers, including ex-chief executives Andy Hornby and James Crosby, as well as past chairman Lord Stevenson. Lord Stevenson, James Crosby and Andy Hornby The FCA and PRA said their inquiries would ""determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced"" against the former bosses. They could face being struck off from working in the financial services industry, while the Insolvency Service also has the power to ban them from being company directors. The FCA and PRA also said they would ""review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers"". The watchdogs did not name the ex-managers who will be investigated. However, Mr Hornby, Mr Crosby and Lord Stevenson were named in Mr Green's report, as well as a raft of other executives he said the former regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), should have probed. These included Mike Ellis, former finance director, Colin Matthew, ex-head of the international division, and Lindsay Mackay, former boss of the treasury division. Mr Ellis is currently chairman of Skipton Building Society, while Mr Mackay is a director of Alpha Bank. Mr Hornby is chief operating officer of Gala Coral and Lord Stevenson has a number of positions, including at book group Waterstones Holdings where he is a non-executive director. Mr Crosby is largely retired. Alongside the Green report, the FCA and PRA published their own delayed review of the HBOS saga, which put the blame firmly on the bank's executives, saying they were ""ultimately responsible"" for its demise. The bank had to be rescued by Lloyds and bailed out with £20.5bn of taxpayer's money in 2008. So far, formal action has only been taken against one former HBOS executive - Peter Cummings, who ran the bank's commercial arm. He was fined £500,000 and banned for life from working in the City."

Kyodo cited an unnamed Japanese government official who said there were signs of possible preparations for a missile launch based on satellite images of the North's Tongchang-ri missile test site. The source said a missile launch could happen in a week, Kyodo reported. It gave no further details about the satellite images. Pyongyang conducted its fourth nuclear test on 6 January, a move that is expected to result in fresh United Nations sanctions. North Korea claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb in the test, although the United States and other governments and experts have expressed scepticism it has made such a technological advance. North Korea's last test of a long-range rocket was in late 2012, when Pyongyang successfully put an object into orbit in what experts believed to be part of its effort to build an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The North is also thought to be working to miniaturise a nuclear warhead to mount on a missile, but many experts think it is still some way away from perfecting the technology.

Lord and Lady March were tied up and assaulted by thieves who broke into Goodwood House, near Chichester, on 13 January. Lady March was disturbed at around 4.30am by an intruder who climbed through an upstairs window. He pushed her and struck Lord March, injuring his ear. Lady March was then forced to open a safe containing valuable jewellery. After helping himself to the contents and tying up the couple, the thief made off. He took more than 40 items, including an 1820 diamond tiara worth nearly £400,000, diamond necklaces, bracelets, rings and several luxury watches. Among other items stolen were an emerald intaglio and diamond ring from 1800, engraved with the Duchess's coronet and monogram CL for Louise de Keroualle, mistress of Charles II. Lord and Lady March with actor Tom Cruise at Goodwood races Lord March, who founded the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 1993, issued a statement later saying he and his wife were recovering from their ordeal. The statement added that they were ""entirely focused"" on helping the police. Detective Inspector Til Sanderson, from Surrey and Sussex police major crime team, said Interpol had been alerted, along with dealers, pawnbrokers and auction houses. Mr Sanderson said: ""Much of this treasured property is irreplaceable and my team... is making every effort to trace it and identify those responsible."" He added: ""I hope the offer of a substantial reward by the insurers, for information leading to the recovery of important items of jewellery and personal effects of historical significance, will encourage anyone who knows anything to come forward."" Mr Sanderson did not say how big the reward was. A 26-year-old man from Hampshire was arrested and released on bail until February while investigations continue."

The 24-year-old was attempting to become the first female British grand slam finalist since Virginia Wade won Wimbledon 39 years ago. But her hopes were dashed by the German world number six, who in the end was too strong for the world number 47 and sealed a 7-5 6-2 straight sets victory. Konta (R) congratulates Kerber after the match Fellow Briton Andy Murray is one match away from reaching the men's final. He faces Canadian Milos Raonic in a semi-final on Friday. Murray's brother Jamie has reached the final of the men's doubles with Brazilian Bruno Soares. I cannot thank everyone enough for the positive and supportive messages throughout this fortnight. You have made, This experience that much more memorable and I am forever grateful. Kerber will face world number one Serena Williams - who is chasing a record-equalling 22nd grand slam title - in Saturday's women's final. ""It's a really special moment to reach the final for the first time,"" Kerber said after the match. ""I gave everything on court. Johanna had a great two weeks, she had a great two weeks and she has a great future. ""She is a tough opponent and will win many, many tournaments in the future for sure."" Steffi Graf was the last German player to win the women's title in Australia, in 1994. Laughing with the crowd after her win, Kerber appealed: ""So Steffi, write me please."" Konta said she would be taking ""a lot of positives"" from her performances in the tournament. ""I played against a better player today who earned her right to a grand slam final,"" she said. ""But I'm really taking a lot of positives out of it ... I've really enjoyed the battles, I think that has been a really good experience."" Sydney-born Konta beat seven-time major winner Venus Williams in the first round of the tournament. Her winning run continued as she went on to become the first British woman to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final since 1984 after beating 21st seed Ekaterina Makarova. A 6-4 6-1 straight sets victory against Chinese qualifier Zhang Shuai saw her through to the semi-final. She has now matched Jo Durie - who lost in the last four at the US Open 33 years ago. Konta, who lives in Eastbourne, represented Australia until 2012. She became a British citizen after her family moved to the UK. She has a Hungarian passport too and has described herself as ""the female version of Jason Bourne""."
2016-01-28,"David Cameron has been branded ""heartless and foolish"" for ""turning his back"" on 3,000 orphaned Syrian children in European camps.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160128121145/http://news.sky.com/story/1631079/pm-heartless-to-reject-3000-syrian-orphans,"By Jason Farrell, Senior Political Correspondent David Cameron has been branded ""heartless and foolish"" for ""turning his back"" on 3,000 orphaned Syrian children in European camps. The Prime Minister has rejected calls to take the vulnerable children saying that to do so could create ""a magnet"" to attract more migrants to cross the Mediterranean. Three million are expected to arrive on mainland Europe this year. His refusal to acquiesce to pressure from charities to help the 3,000 has led to criticism from the Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron who accused Mr Cameron of ignoring the migrant crisis. :: PM Under Fire For 'Bunch Of Migrants' Jibe Speaking on Sky News, Mr Farron said: ""It is an absolute calamity on our doorstep and it is not going to go away by David Cameron pretending it's not there. ""I think he is both heartless and foolish because ... he is wrong to turn his back on orphan children fleeing conflict."" He added that the Prime Minister's reaction to the refugee crisis was ""about media management"" and not about ""meeting the human needs"". However, the Government has announced it will work with the UN to take orphaned children from the camps in the Syrian region, rather than the camps in Europe. The criticism comes after Mr Cameron was lambasted for referring to the refugees in the Calais camps as ""a bunch of migrants"" during Prime Minister's Questions. Britain has already agreed to take 20,000 vulnerable refugees from the camps in the region but the Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told Sky News the orphans would be in addition to that figure, however, he would not put a figure on it. When pushed he said the Government would work with the UNHCR but indicated it would not be a high figure. Separately, the Department for International Development (DFID) is to establish a new fund of up to £10m to support vulnerable migrant children in Europe. This could include resettling some from countries such as Greece and Italy in to the UK if they have family here but will not be used to help children in the Dunkirk or Calais camps. Save the Children for Britain wants the UK to admit at least 3,000 young people who have reached Europe from countries such as Syria and Afghanistan. The reason the charity is keen for children to be taken from Europe is because a third of the refugee children coming to the continent go missing - most having been captured by child traffickers. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ""The vast majority are better off staying in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members."" Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham told Sky News it was a ""welcome step forward"" but said the Government should not distinguish between orphans in camps in the region and those in the rest of Europe. The UK has offered £1.1bn in assistance to the war-torn region and it is clear the Government's priority remains helping those who remain close to home rather than travel to Europe."
2016-01-28,"The so-called bedroom tax discriminated against a domestic violence victim and the grandparents of a disabled teenager, the Court of Appeal has decided.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160128121145/http://news.sky.com/story/1630601/bedroom-tax-victory-for-abuse-victim-and-carers,"The so-called bedroom tax discriminated against a domestic violence victim and the grandparents of a disabled teenager, the Court of Appeal has decided. Judges ruled an application against the tax brought by a single mother living in a three-bedroom council house fitted with a secure panic room to protect her from a violent ex-partner should be upheld. Another case focussed on the impact of the tax on seriously disabled children who need overnight care. Grandparents Paul and Sue Rutherford, from Pembrokeshire, claimed they should not be penalised by the tax on the bedroom in which their 15-year-old disabled grandson's carer has to stay overnight. In both cases it was argued the policy, which came into force in April 2013, unlawfully discriminates against women and domestic violence victims and against children in the situation of the Rutherfords' grandson, Warren. Three years ago, charities accused David Cameron of giving ""inaccurate"" statements and raising ""false hopes"" by suggesting disabled people who need an extra room are exempt from the so-called ""bedroom tax"". Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Vos, announced they were allowing the appeals in both cases on the ground the ""admitted discrimination in each case ... has not been justified by the Secretary of State"". Reacting to the ruling, Mr Rutherford told Sky News he will continue to fight the Government to ensure his family feels secure in their own home. He said: ""We just thought the whole thing was massively unfair on us and a lot of other people as well. So we decided that we had to stand up and challenge it."" Mr Rutherford added: ""We just want the peace to know we can look after Warren without the stress of worrying about whether or not we'll be able to stay in the house, (whether) we'll have to move, whether he'll have to go into care. ""Him going into care is something that our lives are dedicated to preventing and we will fight anybody who makes it look like it might have to happen, including, as we have done now, the Government."" The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was given permission to challenge the Court of Appeal's ruling at the Supreme Court. The Government rejects the term ""bedroom tax"" and says the regulations remove what is in fact a ""spare room subsidy"", with the aim of encouraging people to move to smaller properties and save around £480m a year from the housing benefit bill."

His wife Lisa said ""He's getting better slowly. He's not too bad."" A 31-year-old man from Brighton was arrested on Tuesday after trying to hide on a roof in the seaside town, and has been bailed until 3 April. He was detained on suspicion of dangerous driving causing serious injury, attempting to pervert the course of justice and aggravated vehicle taking. A 56-year-old woman, also from the town, who was arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice has been bailed until the same date. Footage of the incident, which happened in the Kemptown area of the town on 14 January, has been viewed almost three million times. In the video a witness can be seen holding their hand to their mouth in shock at the impact. Mr Payne is seen lying motionless in the road as passers-by stand in disbelief. Officers are continuing to appeal for witnesses, and anyone with information is asked to call Sussex Police on 101, quoting Operation Northdown. Sergeant Dan Pitcher said: ""We know the CCTV was very shocking but almost three million people watched it, we had 16,000 comments and more than 6,000 liked it on Facebook alone. ""More than 300 people retweeted our appeal on Twitter. ""We have passed on all the well-wishes from people on social media to the victim who is grateful for the support. He is continuing to recover well at home."" Sgt Pitcher added police have traced the drivers of four vehicles they were trying to speak to."

The simulation unfolded at the Intu Braehead mall on Tuesday night - and saw the emergency services respond to a major firearms attack in which four ""gunmen"" opened fire at a busy bus stop. Police Scotland had been planning the mock exercise since early last year, with Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins stressing it was not based on a recent incident or a specific threat. He explained: ""The emergency services and partners plan extensively for a wide number of challenging situations from naturally occurring events caused by the weather to significant industrial accidents or criminal acts. ""(This exercise was to) test how specially-trained armed officers respond alongside other emergency services at a crowded place."" During the simulation, which took place after the shopping centre had closed, police told members of the public there was ""no need to be alarmed"" if they heard loud noises or noticed increased activity from the emergency services."

The Prime Minister was referring to Jeremy Corbyn's visit to see refugees living in foul conditions in the northern France camps at the weekend. Following his visit, Mr Corbyn said the Government should let in the 3,000 refugees living there. :: Corbyn: Let 3,000 Calais Migrants Come To UK Mr Cameron rounded on the Labour leader in the Commons, saying: ""Look at the record of the last week. They (Labour) met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets. ""They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands. The met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain. ""The only people they never stand up for is the British people and hard-working taxpayers."" Mr Corbyn has now written to the Prime Minister, calling his choice of words ""shameful"" and ""inflammatory"". ""I have to say I found it shameful that you referred to the people in those camps as 'a bunch of migrants', escalating the tensions on such a serious issue,"" the Labour leader wrote. ""It is clear that many are fleeing conflict and human rights abuses that you and I cannot begin to imagine. ""Such dismissive language and tone demeans people's suffering and demeans the office of Prime Minister."" :: UK Could Take Refugee Children From Europe Mr Cameron's comments also drew fire on Twitter, and former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper raised a point of order calling on the PM to withdraw his comments. Speaking to Sky News, she called it ""really inappropriate language from a prime minister"". Mr Cameron made the comments about the refugees, many of whom are fleeing civil war and the brutality of Islamic State, on Holocaust Memorial Day. When  Cameron mocks refugees @ #CalaisJungle on #HolocaustMemorialDay it tells you who his heart belongs too-the corps & the dictators #pmqs The 92-year-old war veteran and Labour campaigner Harry Smith tweeted: ""When Cameron mocks refugees @ #CalaisJungle on #HolocaustMemorialDay it tells you who his heart belongs too-the corps & the dictators #pmqs."" Mr Cameron was criticised in the summer for using the word ""swarm"" to refer to migrants crossing the Mediterranean. :: PM Criticised For Swarm Comment The Prime Minister is under pressure to agree that 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children should be allowed into the UK in a scheme reminiscent of the Kindertransport during the Second World War. Yvette Cooper, who is head of Labour's refugee task force, told Sky News the UK had ""a responsibility not to turn our backs"" and said the children were ""deeply vulnerable to exploitation, prostitution, to abuse"". A Sky News snap poll of 1,070 people found that 47% of people supported taking in unaccompanied refugees, while 53% opposed the idea. It comes as the migration crisis in Europe threatens to overshadow Mr Cameron's attempts to renegotiate Britain's deal with the EU at a summit on 18 February. Mr Cameron will also travel to Brussels on Friday for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The key sticking point is his insistence the UK should be able to control EU migration by limiting benefits. :: Merkel And PM: More Work Needed For EU Deal Cameron very wrong to talk of ""a bunch of migrants"" in #PMQs. Divisive, not statesmanlike. Raised point of order calling on him to withdraw He spoke to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier this week and the pair agreed there was more to be done before a deal could be reached. Mr Cameron wants to ban EU migrants from getting in-work benefits for four years. Ms Merkel has suggested a proposal which would see no benefits paid to EU migrants earning less than £9,000 on a 20-hour week, but that would affect very few. The European Commission is offering a migration brake – allowing the British Government to stop letting in EU migrants if the influx is putting too much of a strain on local services. Britain was on Wednesday criticised by the European Committee of Social Rights for failing to comply with obligations under the 55-year-old European Social Charter because of the UK's treatment of migrant workers. :: What Does Cameron's Cancelled Trip Tell Us? The UK Government was rebuked for requiring migrants to speak English and to earn at last £18,600 before their families can move over to join them. Mr Cameron has recently announced migrant women who do not learn English to a required level within two and a half years will be removed from the country. :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,070 Sky customers by SMS on 27 January 2016.

The eight-year-old female sand tiger shark, measuring 2.2m (7.2ft) long, attacked the five-year-old male banded houndshark on Thursday - and reportedly devoured him bite by bite. A day later, visitors to the aquarium in Seoul watched with amazement as the shark swam around the tank with the tip of the victim's tail hanging out of her mouth. Just 21 hours after the attack, all that remained of the victim was a tail Experts believe the tail will remain in her mouth for up to five days - but as she will be unable to digest her rival, the body will likely be regurgitated within a week. Oh Tae-Youp, who works at the aquarium, said: ""Sharks have their own territory. ""However, sometimes when they bump against each other, they bite out of astonishment. ""I think the shark swallowed the whole body, because they usually eat it all when they bite the head part."" Although there have been bust-ups between sharks at the aquarium before, instances of sharks eating their tank mates are rare - and this is the first time the attraction has seen such an attack."

Customers were told to visit their local branch for all urgent transactions and the bank said all major branches would remain open on Saturday. The bank revealed on Friday morning it had been hit by ""denial of service"" attacks and said it had ""successfully defended against the attack"". HSBC said customer transactions were not affected and that normal service was being resumed, but hours later it said internet and mobile services had still only partially recovered. HSBC has apologised for the outage The bank tweeted: ""We continue to defend ourselves against today's attack. ""For urgent transactions please visit your local branch. ""All our major branches will be open on Saturday."" HSBC said it had fallen victim to ""denial of service"" attacks. This sort of attack seeks to overload and bring down an online platform through sheer volume of traffic. By late on Friday afternoon the problems had still not been fully resolved. John Hackett, UK chief operating officer, said: ""HSBC's internet and mobile services have partially recovered, and we continue to work to restore a full service. ""We are continuing to experience attempted denial of service attacks and we are closely monitoring the situation with the authorities."" A spokesman later added: ""HSBC internet and mobile banking are now fully recovered. Thanks for your patience and again we apologise for the disruption."" It is the second major outage to face HSBC's services this month following two days of faults - blamed on a ""complex technical issue"" - which sparked calls for a full explanation from the chair of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie. Mr Tyrie reaffirmed his concerns after the latest episode. He said: ""Episodes like today's bring a great deal of uncertainty, and sometimes disruption and distress to customers. ""Bank IT systems just don't seem to be up to the job. This leaves bank customers with a substandard service. Every bit as concerning, it could be leaving the banking system, and with it the economy, exposed to the risk of systemic failures. ""Incidents like these are unacceptably frequent, and sometimes serious. Until this is sorted out, the public will remain more exposed than necessary to the risks of IT banking failures, including delays in paying bills, an inability to obtain their own money, and unauthorised access to their accounts."" This latest outage will be particularly inconvenient for those who are due to be paid, while Sunday is the deadline for self-assessment tax returns. HSBC pledged to waive any fees racked up by customers as a direct result of the latest incident. The bank, which has 17 million personal and business banking customers across the UK, has not said how many people have been affected. The latest episode follow the high-profile cyber attack last year involving telecoms firm TalkTalk, which resulted in 157,000 customers' personal details being accessed. Earlier this week, Information Commissioner Christopher Graham told MPs that hacking a company's website had become so simple that even a three-year-old could do it."

So far Egypt has said it has found no evidence that the Metrojet flight, which took off from Sharm el Sheikh airport and crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in October with 224 people on board, was brought down by terrorism. A senior security official at EgyptAir denied that any of its employees had been arrested or were under suspicion, while an Interior Ministry official also said there had been no arrests. But Reuters' sources, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation, said the mechanic had been detained along with two airport policemen and a baggage handler suspected of helping him put the bomb on the plane. ""After learning that one of its members had a relative that worked at the airport, Islamic State delivered a bomb in a handbag to that person,"" one of the sources told the news agency, adding the suspect's cousin joined IS in Syria 18 months ago.

""But there is a possibility that they were just not doing their jobs properly."" None of those arrested have been prosecuted so far, the sources said. In the aftermath of the crash, an IS affiliate has claimed responsibility for bringing down the Airbus 321-200. IS' online magazine later carried a photo of a Schweppes can it claimed was used to make an improvised bomb that brought down the jet. The photo showed a can of Schweppes Gold soft drink and what appeared to be a detonator and switch on a blue background. :: IS Posts Photo Of 'Bomb That Downed Plane' Russia and Western nations have long said they believe the flight was downed by a bomb smuggled on board. But Egypt has so far publicly said it has not found any evidence of foul play. If there are formal charges or official confirmation from Egypt that a bomb brought down the plane, Cairo could potentially be required to make compensation payments to the families of the victims. The EgyptAir official said state security police had investigated all of the workers at the airport and did not find any evidence implicating them. The official added state security traced the family connections of all the employees and they were cleared. ""Any employee who shows sympathy to militants is prevented from going to work in any airport,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters. An Interior Ministry source also said no one had been arrested in connection with the crash and they were waiting for the results of the investigation."
2016-01-30,Tesco is ending round-the-clock opening at almost 20% of its 24-hour stores as demand for night-time shopping wanes and online purchasing grows.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160130213711/http://news.sky.com/story/1632113/tesco-calls-time-on-24-hour-store-shopping,"Tesco is ending round-the-clock opening at almost 20% of its 24-hour stores as demand for night-time shopping wanes and online purchasing grows. The country's largest grocery chain said there would be a ""minimal"" impact on jobs as a result of its decision to limit trading hours from 6am to midnight at 76 of its 400 24-hour stores. The move was to take effect from 14 March, Tesco said. :: See The List Of Affected Stores Here  Tesco said: ""The move to reduce hours means more Tesco colleague time will be freed up to replenish products on the shelves overnight, which will mean better availability of products and better looking stores when they open their doors to customers each morning."" It argued that it was being ""responsive"" to the way customers wanted to shop and making ""more efficient use of Tesco time and resources"", resulting in savings which could be passed on to customers at the check-out. Tony Hoggett, the company's retail director, said: ""We’re always thinking about how to serve our customers better in each of our stores and with the growth of online grocery shopping, these stores saw very few customers during the night."" The UK's grocery industry remains locked in a fierce price war as they battle the march to heavy discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Despite the 'big four' enjoying a stronger Christmas season, they remain under pressure to cut costs and enhance their offerings to lure back shoppers amid an erosion in their market shares. While Tesco continues to dominate, its business was previously dented by a lack of investment in its stores as it spent aggressively abroad and on meeting changing shopping habits - including a greater focus on convenience. It was accused of taking its eye off the ball in its core market as sales fell, allowing competitors to steal a march on it. UK like-for-like sales rose 1.3% in the six weeks to 9 January compared to the previous year, handing its new chief executive Dave Lewis a morale boost following a torrid tenure dominated by legacy issues since he took the role. He is still handling the fallout from the FTSE 100 firm's massive profits' overstatement which has left it facing the prospect of action by shareholders and forced Tesco to completely overhaul the way it handles its suppliers."

Sean Toner has provided a DNA sample to police investigating the death of a pensioner-aged man in the remote area of northern England last December. His father, Hugh Toner, from Newry, walked out of Craigavon Area Hospital in the early hours of Monday, 7 February, 1994, dressed only in a vest and pyjama bottoms. Despite an extensive search at the time, which included the use of police divers, no sign was ever found of him. His bank accounts were untouched and his family never heard from him again. Police in Greater Manchester have said they are keeping a ""completely open mind"" on the identity of the dead man, who was found carrying only cash and train tickets. He had travelled up from Ealing in London on 11 December and asked at a pub in Greenfield for directions to Indian’s Head on Saddleworth. His body was found on a track used by walkers the following day. DS John Coleman said: ""We are investigating many possible avenues, one of which is missing persons. The body of the unidentified man was found on Saddleworth Moor ""With that in mind we have requested DNA samples from the family of Mr Hugh Toner. ""There is a resemblance between him and the man whose death we are currently investigating and they will allow us to either eliminate him from our enquiries or identify him."" Mr Toner's son told Sky News: ""The description that was given by Greater Manchester Police matches the description of my dad right down to the gentleman that was found apparently has a broken nose, my dad had a broken nose. ""He's of slim build. Age wise he seems to be around the same age."" CCTV footage of the man taken at Manchester Piccadilly train station also resembled his father, he said. Having provided a DNA sample, Mr Toner is hoping to know the outcome in the next few days. He said: ""It's stirred up a lot of emotions and feelings from back then. ""Part of you wants it to be him and part of you doesn't."" He added: ""When my dad went missing it was quite emotional at the time. ""It's a bit like a death in the family. ""When it first happened there was a lot of emotion, it was very intense. ""As the years go by it gets easier but your thoughts were always there. ""I think about my dad every single day. I always wonder what happened to him, where did he go?"" Mr Toner, who was an only child, said: ""My mum and my dad's mum died not knowing what happened to him and I am sure that was difficult for them."" Prior to his disappearance, Mr Toner said his father had worked in the construction industry throughout England for many years. It was during a visit to Northern Ireland in February 1994 that he was admitted to hospital but disappeared days later. Mr Toner said: ""When he went missing he walked out the hospital in a vest and pyjama bottoms. He had nothing on his feet . ""It was quite a cold night, there was snow on the ground, there was a gale blowing, it was quite icy. ""That's the way he went out and that's why I think he had to have help to get away."""

Labour and the Liberal Democrats said it was a ""small step forward"". Many charities working with asylum seekers said the same thing. But now, after the chance to scrutinise the Government’s plans in more detail, LibDem leader Tim Farron has revised his opinion. :: PM 'Heartless' To Reject Syrian Orphans The Prime Minister is ""heartless and foolish"" he says and has employed ""clever media management"" to distort the facts. Or at least the way they have been presented.    Why? Because the Government’s plan is confusing. To everyone. We are still no closer to knowing exactly how many children who have been separated from their parents will be allowed into the country. Not even an approximate number. :: PM Under Fire For 'Bunch Of Migrants' Jibe Immigration Minister James Brokenshire says the UK will work closely with the UNHCR to identify children in camps on the Syrian border who will benefit from resettlement in Britain. That could be dozens or even hundreds but certainly nowhere near the 3,000 child refugees that Save The Children is urging Britain to rehome. That’s because these 3,000 are already in Europe. The Government does not want to let these kids into Britain because it fears the country would be seen as a ""magnet"" encouraging more desperate people to risk their lives on the perilous journey fleeing from war. There are thought to be around 24,000 of these children in Europe at present. They are separated from their loved ones and facing a freezing winter alone. Some reports reckon 1,000 of these children have disappeared in Italy in the last year alone. Child protection agencies fear these kids are exposed to human traffickers ready to exploit their vulnerability. Announced at the same time - and further adding to the confusion - is a £10m aid package to help with the crisis.   It is separate but connected.  This money will go to the Greek and Italian authorities who have been overwhelmed by the numbers arriving on their shores. It is specifically for unaccompanied children."

The 26-year-old fled her home in Birmingham in October 2014, telling her family she had booked a holiday. Instead, she took her baby son to Raqqa, the de facto capital of the terror network. She is believed to be the first British woman to stand trial accused of joining IS in Syria. Prosecutors argued in court that she went to support the terror group and also encouraged terrorism through her Twitter account - both charges she had denied. Shakil had said she ""had made a mistake"" travelling to Syria but had done so simply to find a better life in the caliphate for her and her son. Up to 2,000 messages and social media updates were analysed in the court case, which the prosecution said proved she was supporting and encouraging terrorism. In one image found on her phone her young son was pictured wearing a balaclava with an IS logo. In another, sent from her Whatsapp account, the toddler is shown next to a weapon with a slogan that translated meant ""the father of jihad from Britain."" Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale, of West Midlands Police, said: ""He was put in substantial danger in a chaotic war zone. That is no place for a young British citizen to be. ""He is now back in the UK. He is safe and we wish him a long, successful life."" ACC Beale appealed to people who are concerned that friends or relatives are about to travel to Syria to get in touch with the authorities.

""To do so before we have to go through a crown court case and potentially send someone to prison for a long time, there are alternatives."" ""Travel to Syria is not illegal, but joining proscribed organisations or supporting those organisations is."" After two and a half months living in a house for unmarried women under a restrictive regime in Raqqa, Shakil told her trial that she decided to escape and took a bus and then a taxi towards the Turkish border with her son. After running across the border she was picked up by Turkish soliders. She flew back to Heathrow the following month when she was arrested by counter terrorism officers."

Glasgow East MP Natalie McGarry accused Rowling of defending trolls who post misogynistic tweets online on Thursday night. She claimed the writer had ""tweeted support"" for a user called Brian Spanner. Ms McGarry said it made her regret queuing up to buy Rowling's books. Ms McGarry has since made her Twitter account private But her comments provoked an angry response from Rowling who replied: ""You aren't some random hater, Natalie. You're an elected politician and you've accused me of supporting abuse and misogyny."" She asked Ms McGarry to provide some evidence for her comments and to apologise. .@NatalieMcGarry This screenshot proves that I support and defend misogyny and abuse... how? Ms McGarry accused Rowling of ""bullying her"" and did apologise. However, she then retweeted another users image, which appeared to have been altered, to suggest she had said ""you're a good man"" to Brian Spanner after he wrote an abusive tweet. Rowling said her response actually followed a donation he made to her children's charity Lumos. ""This 'proof' is cut and pasted. I assume you want to retract the apology you made 3 mins ago?,"" she wrote. .@NatalieMcGarry You don't appear to understand how Twitter or defamation works. I'm going to help you out with the latter. She then hinted that she is considering legal action against the MP, tweeting: ""You don't appear to understand how Twitter or defamation works. I'm going to help you out with the latter."" Rowling told another user she would give all of the damages to Lumos. The Scottish MP has now made her Twitter account private. Ms McGarry had the SNP whip withdrawn in November after she was named in a police investigation into allegations of missing donations from the campaign group Women for Independence."

Mariusz Krezolek and Daniel's mother Magdelena Luczak were convicted of the boy's murder in 2013, and jailed for 30 years. A judge said the four-year-old was the victim of an ""incomprehensible cycle of cruelty and violence"" which left him looking like ""a concentration camp victim"" before he died of a head injury in 2012. Krezolek was discovered unresponsive in his cell at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire on Wednesday morning. A Prisons Service spokeswoman said: ""Staff immediately attempted resuscitation but he was pronounced dead shortly after."" An investigation will be carried out by the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. Luczak, 29, was found dead at HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire in July last year - two years into her sentence. The cause of death was recorded as hanging. During his final month, Daniel was denied food, forced to perform punishment exercises, confined in a locked box room, poisoned with salt, and subjected to water torture. He weighed just 1st 9lb when he died. The medical evidence, the judge said, showed that Daniel's emaciation was regarded by experts as ""unprecedented"" in Britain."

It comes after police said on Thursday they believed Bellfield could be linked to around another 20 attacks, including the killing of his school friend Patsy Morris on Hounslow Heath in 1980. He would have been just 12 at the time. Earlier this week, Bellfield finally confessed to the murder of Milly Dowler, 13, who was abducted on her way home from school in Walton-on-Thames in March 2002. Her body was found in a wood 25 miles away. Bellfield has also been linked to the 1996 hammer killings of mother and daughter Lin and Megan Russell in Kent. His other victims, Marsha McDonnell (2003) and Amelie Delagrange (2004), were murdered in a similar way - hit over the head with a blunt object. Ann-Marie Bellfield, his paternal half-sister, wants police to look into the disappearances of student Elizabeth Chau, 19, in April 1999, and US-born computer graduate Lola Shenkoya, 27, in January 2000 - who were both last seen in Ealing, west London. ""At that time, Levi Bellfield had a clamping business in West Ealing, which was in the area that they disappeared from, and I do believe somehow he is linked to those cases,"" she told the Daily Mirror. She said he rang her while on remand in prison for the murders of Ms Delagrange and Ms McDonnell and said the police were trying to pin the other two cases on him, but insisted he had nothing to do with them. Describing him as a ""monster"" and ""cruel and unfeeling"", she continued: ""I do believe he is capable of anything.""

""He was fearful of getting a smack in the gob or worse,"" she said. Colin Sutton, a former Metropolitan Police detective who sat in on interviews with Bellfield, told Sky News he wanted him to take responsibility for the series of other offences he has committed. ""He travelled extensively and committed crimes wherever he was,"" said Mr Sutton. ""I think what's important to me is that there may be a chance for him to confess and for him to get to the bottom of what went on in lots of other cases."""

2016-01-30,"The daughter of the cult leader who kept women captive for decades using violence, cruelty and sexual abuse has described him as a ""narcissistic psychopath ... obsessed with controlling people"".",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160130213711/http://news.sky.com/story/1632263/cult-leaders-daughter-he-was-a-psychopath,"By Afua Hirsch, Social Affairs Editor The daughter of the cult leader who kept women captive for decades using violence, cruelty and sexual abuse has described him as a ""narcissistic psychopath ... obsessed with controlling people"". Waiving her anonymity for the first time to speak to Sky News, Katy Morgan-Davies explained how Aravindan Balakrishnan cruelly deprived her of any contact with the outside world for three decades, and of even knowing which of the cult's members was her own mother. Balakrishnan, who has now been sentenced to 23 years in prison for two counts of cruelty and false imprisonment for his treatment of Ms Morgan-Davies, and for the indecent assault, rape and assault of other women in the cult, kept her a virtual prisoner in the various homes the group occupied around south London. Aravindan Balakrishnan kept his daughter captive for decades ""My earliest memories are of him being violent towards me and other people in the cult,"" Ms Morgan-Davies said of Balakrishnan, whom she knew only as ""Bala"". ""He loved violence, and those totalitarian dictatorships. He wanted to be like that - one of those dictators like Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot. Gallery: Cult Leader Found Guilty Of Raping Followers Balakrishnan pictured with the collective ""(He wanted) everyone to listen to him - if they don't, he can kill them with impunity."" Now aged 32, Ms Morgan-Davies finally escaped from the cult in 2013 after she and two other members were rescued by the police and charities they had contacted after memorising a helpline number they had seen on TV. Others, who had joined the cult in the 1970s when it was known as ""The Workers Institute"", had escaped years before - including two who gave evidence against Balakrishnan at his trial. Two of the women died while living there, including Ms Morgan-Davies' mother Sian Davies, who died after falling from an open window in 1997. Ms Morgan-Davies, who only discovered her mother's true identity after her death, said one of the saddest parts of her life was the cruelty she experienced at her hands. Her mother, like the other women in the commune, was encouraged to spy on Ms Morgan-Davies and report to Balakrishnan, often resulting in violent punishment. ""There was no concept of father and mother. (Everyone in the commune) were just all comrades,"" Ms Morgan-Davies explained. ""Whilst my mother was alive, there was no affection between us. It was not like I missed her when she passed away. In a way when she fell through the window, things got better. ""Because she was one of the worst bullies, when she was not there things got better. There was less reporting, and so there was less violence."" Ms Morgan-Davies explained how her mother's family had described her as a ""very nice person"" - and she said Balakrishnan robbed them of any connection by turning Ms Davies into a ""shadow of her former self"". One of the ways Balakrishnan controlled the members of the cult was through the invention of an omnipotent mind-control machine, which they knew as ""Jackie"". She explained: ""He said if I did something wrong, others and me, we would be killed by Jackie. If he intervened by slapping us and beating us, then Jackie would think that enough had been done and not kill us. So we should be thankful that he is hurting us... because we would be saved from Jackie."" Ms Morgan-Davies said that as she grew older and developed an interest in men, she was forced to report her thoughts and fantasies to Balakrishnan, prompting further threats of retaliation from Jackie. Despite the threats, Ms Morgan-Davies attempted to escape almost a decade before her eventual rescue, running to a police station in 2005. However, the police sent her back to the commune. Gallery: Letters And Diaries Written By Cult Leader's Daughter The daughter of cult leader Aravindan Balakrishnan who was falsely imprisoned for 30 years wrote him a letter upon her release ""The police persuaded me to call (Balakrishnan) and to go back,"" Ms Morgan-Davies said. ""I had no choice."" Asked why her complaint was not taken more seriously, Ms Morgan-Davies shrugged. ""Why did they send me back? It was a bank holiday."" She described how other opportunities to help those in the sect had been missed, adding: ""The cult was very clever at hiding what they did not want other people to know."" Ms Morgan-Davies - wearing her hair in blonde curls and dressed in a bright blue jumper with a jewelled broach - said she is now learning the basics of ordinary life for the first time. ""Just being able to walk out the door on my own, walk down the street, make friends with people, talk to people without permission, say what I want without fear of being killed or cursed, wear what I want to wear, pierce my ears, dye my hair. Just small little things - it's so amazing."

Two years later Collins revealed he still loved his third wife, but that she was in a new relationship despite them enjoying a ""shared life"". But now the pair are an item again, as Collins revealed he had bought a house in Miami where Ms Cevey, a former interpreter, and the couple's two children live. The pair on their wedding day in 1999 He told Billboard magazine: ""I'm actually back with my third wife - I haven't really talked about it. ""We've been together for a while, and nobody's noticed."" The £25m payout was the most expensive divorce settlement in the UK entertainment world at the time, topping the £24.3m Paul McCartney paid to Heather Mills after their split. Collins also told Billboard he was attempting to recover from a dislocated vertebra, nerve damage and foot fractures which meant he is worried he will never be fit enough to play the drums on tour again. He said: ""But my kids want me to do shows so they can brag to their friends. I intend on doing some things.

The American star, regarded as the best-selling female artist of all time, is due to embark on her first tour of the UK in 13 years. And Ms Carey, who has just announced her engagement to Australian billionaire James Packer, says she supports those saying showbusiness is too white and male. She said: ""It is true. People have very valid points. There is not enough diversity. ""I don't think women get a fair deal on anything compared to guys. It is a difficult subject, I have my own opinions and I don't want to offend anyone but women and minorities have had to fight to get equal opportunities for ages so how can you not agree?"" She also gave her support to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She said: ""I'm just an entertainer but you know I'm a fan of Hillary Clinton and, of course, I would love to see a woman president."" On the subject of Republican front-runner Donald Trump though she was less forthcoming. ""I'd like to abstain from that question,"" she laughed. Carey with fiance James Packer The star's Sweet Sweet Fantasy tour will kick off in Glasgow in March and take in stops in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and the 02 Arena in London. She will also visit mainland Europe and South Africa. She says it will take fans on a journey back through the greatest hits of a career that has seen her sell 220 million records. And they will see a different performer to the one who visited in 2003. ""I think I'm a little bit more comfortable on stage. I've become a little more comfortable in my own skin if that makes sense,"" she said. ""It is much more fun when you just talk to the audience. Most people don't have the same relationship with their fans, maybe I'm wrong, but I talk to the fans when I'm on stage, like being at home, you want them to be excited, not sitting around the TV, for me it is all about the connection with the fans."" She said she wanted fans to feel nostalgic for hits like Fantasy and Vision Of Love, and added they ""should expect the unexpected"". She was a little less willing to discuss plans for that wedding, even as she showed off her now-famous 35-carat engagement ring. She joked: ""Oh yeah, let's just tell it all. ""No, I'm keeping it to myself until we have the actual ceremony because we want it to be private."""
2016-01-30,"Production of the iconic Land Rover Defender has ended following 68 years as a workhorse for the Army, farmers and fans alike - including the Queen.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160130213711/http://news.sky.com/story/1631947/land-rover-defender-at-end-of-the-road,"Production of the iconic Land Rover Defender has ended following 68 years as a workhorse for the Army, farmers and fans alike - including the Queen. After more than two million vehicles were created, the last model rolled off the production line at Solihull in the West Midlands this morning to mixed emotions for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) staff who have gathered for a party to mark the occasion. The first design was sketched on the sands of a beach in Wales and made its debut in 1948. It took its inspiration from wartime Jeeps - but with a hard top and permanent four-wheel-drive - proving so popular that Rover had to ramp up production after the first 8,000 sold out. The final Defender was painted in a traditional green shade While designs evolved over the years, it never lost the identity established in its roots - to be rugged, shy of luxury and bold in spirit. Its status and popularity has meant that models generally fail to depreciate in value at the same rate as most vehicles - with many sold on at a profit. Gallery: Land Rover Defender Through The Years 1953: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh drive down the lines of 20,000 youngsters who gathered to greet them in Sabina Park, Kingston, during their visit to Jamaica Independent enthusiasts have also made money out of a growing trend for restoration and conversion. Author Andy McNab, himself a former SAS sergeant, bought his own Defender last year after he learned production was coming to an end - and described the 4x4 as a ""basic workhorse"". He said: ""I love them. I learned to drive in one. They've always been there because it's the main vehicle for the military since about the Fifties."" However, the status and popularity of the 'Landy' has not been enough to stop JLR ending production. The decision is believed to have been taken because of continuing crash safety and emissions concerns. While the company is thought to be working on a replacement it has remained tight-lipped but still has the Freelander, Discovery and Range Rover models in its stable after the Defender's demise. A spokeswoman said: """"We've now got the technology, pioneering engineering capability and design expertise to evolve Defender."" But Jim Holder, editorial director of Autocar and What Car? magazines, was among those mourning its loss. He said: ""It's a classless vehicle. Anyone can drive it. ""You might be a farmer trying to get over the muddiest field or it might be the Queen driving around Windsor. ""Neither would surprise you if you saw it."" The monarch was first seen behind the wheel of a Land Rover in 1952 and is understood to have owned several. Mr Holder added: ""It's got that ubiquity where it can be at home in Chelsea but doesn't look out of place painted white in the middle of a war zone. ""It claims to do everything and to a degree it can do everything (but) the world has overtaken it to a point where they can no longer keep on the right side of emissions and safety laws."""

Judge Deborah Taylor told 75-year-old Aravindan Balakrishnan he had ""shown no remorse whatsoever"" for his ""grave and serious crimes"". When the Maoist commune called the Workers Institute, based in Brixton, south London, was raided in 1978, Balakrishnan dominated and imposed his will on a small group of women for the next 35 years. ""You turned into a largely house-bound demi-god or dictator,"" the judge said. Describing the full brutality of the abuse he inflicted on his victims, she said he ""engendered a climate of fear, jealousy and competition for approval"". The sentencing came as his daughter, waiving her anonymity for the first time, told Sky News how he cruelly deprived her of any contact with the outside world. Katy Morgan-Davies described her father as a as a ""narcissistic psychopath... obsessed with controlling people"". The court heard that at the age of 14, Balakrishnan told her she was responsible for her mother's death. Judge Taylor said his treatment of her amounted to ""a catalogue of mental and physical abuse"", adding: ""You deprived her of love."" Ms Morgan-Davies was terrified if she went out of the house that she would spontaneously combust or be killed by death squads. The court heard how he brainwashed his followers into thinking he had God-like powers. A doctor's assessment concluded he has a ""narcissistic personality disorder"" and a ""grandiose"" sense of his own self-importance. He invented a supernatural force called Jackie who he said could trigger natural disasters if he was disobeyed.

2016-01-30,"""Not good enough"" was the Prime Minister's top line verdict on the European Commission's manoeuvre to get him to accept a type of emergency brake.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160130213711/http://news.sky.com/story/1632519/schulz-signals-path-to-eu-deal-for-cameron,"""Not good enough"" was the Prime Minister's top line verdict on the European Commission's manoeuvre to get him to accept a type of emergency brake. But as with many things in this renegotiation, there were mixed messages and expectations management aplenty. There was no chance of a victory dance just yet. Of greater significance, for me, was the public reaction of the European Parliament President Martin Schulz. Not seeing eye to eye? Mr Cameron and Mr Juncker met in Brussels :: PM: Latest EU Migrants Idea 'Not Good Enough' I have been interviewing the influential German MEP at regular stages during the course of Mr Cameron's renegotiation. He was somewhat sceptical at the outset, and in December, about the PM's tactics. But on Friday he pledged the European Parliament's co-operation in helping the United Kingdom attain a legal underpinning for the political agreement likely next month. Some of the changes to EU migrant benefits envisaged in this deal will require changes to secondary legislation and therefore votes in the European Parliament. Tellingly, Mr Schulz also confirmed that the European Council President Donald Tusk will on Monday be circulating his written paper, the start of the final stage of deal making. Much will depend on the way Mr Tusk tries to build consensus in the coming weeks. He could present a version of Britain's ideas signed up to Mr Cameron, knowing different aspects will be struck out by different European leaders. Or he could jump straight in with an attempt at a workable compromise between the 30 players around the Council table, presuming the PM will compromise. This is what will be sorted out at a working dinner at Number 10 with Donald Tusk on Sunday. The PM is also expected to make a number of calls to European leaders over the weekend. As regards the Emergency Brake - the devil can never have been so firmly ensconced in the detail of a policy. The what, who, how and when of this policy could turn it from anything from a policy very close to exactly what David Cameron put in his election manifesto to something closer to an emergency airbag.  For now, ""not good enough"" also applies to the opinion of many influential backbenchers. The attitude of many in the Remain campaign will be that backbenchers only have one vote in the referendum. Number 10 was undoubtedly frustrated at the Commission over-egging the likelihood of a deal based on this policy. But it would be wrong to depict the differences as intractable. Progress has clearly been made. The Commission has conceded the concept that EU migrants should not receive benefits before contributing. Mr Cameron also has an opportunity to grasp in the form of deeply split Leave campaigns attacking each other against a backdrop of a lack of high profile leadership and attempted coups. The players in this game have started to show their hands. Mr Cameron has been offered something that sounds like his manifesto commitment, that he could begin to sell to swing voters. The path to a February deal may not be clear, but it is there."

The 86-year-old ran a beach bar in the town of Mojacar after serving time for the 1963 heist - one of the most famous in British criminal history. He died at his home on Friday morning, surrounded by friends, a statement from Mojacar's town hall said. Goody was released from prison in 1975 It paid a glowing tribute to him and did not specify the cause of death. ""All who knew him were struck by his friendliness, his love for his friends and family and the many pets he rescued from the street,"" the statement said.

""He was a complete gentleman, far removed from the image that those who didn't know him might have had from those difficult years that marked a large part of his life. ""We will always remember his smile and his big heart that was always open to those around him."" Goody, one of the last surviving members of the gang, was sentenced to 30 years for his part in stealing £2.6m from a Royal Mail train travelling from Glasgow to London. The former hairdresser was released in 1975 and set up a beach bar four years later in Spain. The gang, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the overnight train as it passed through the Buckinghamshire countryside near Cheddington. It was driven over a mile to Bridego Bridge, where the robbers unloaded £2,631,684 in used notes - worth around £46m in today's money.

Reynolds returned in 1968, and was arrested in Torquay and jailed for 25 years."
