2016-09-06,The Metropolitan Police has suspended plans to start using controversial spit hoods on people in their custody amid concerns from human rights campaigners.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160906222334/http://news.sky.com/story/met-police-to-use-controversial-cruel-and-degrading-spit-hoods-10567098,"Britain's largest police force had been given the green light for a pilot scheme to trial the mesh masks, which are used to protect officers from spitting and biting. A Met Police spokeswoman said the move was necessary to meet a ""duty of care owed to officers"" and the scheme had approved the use of spit guards in all custody units from October. However, there was anger from human-rights campaigners over the proposed scheme. They said police had enough powers to restrain suspects and branded the use of hoods ""far fetched"". Scotland Yard has said decided to consult further before committing to the scheme, saying in a statement: ""A consultation process regarding their use has taken place and involved community advisers from Newham's Independent Advisory Group, in addition to local magistrates and judicial staff. ""However with a new administration coming into City Hall since then, the MPS has listened to concerns and will consult further before starting any pilot."" Liberty campaign group director Martha Spurrier described the hoods as ""primitive, cruel and degrading"" tools ""that inspire fear and anguish"" and ""belong in horror stories"". She said: ""We have seen many cases where the police use them unnecessarily and without justification, including on children and disabled people. ""Police have the power to use force against citizens when they have to - using handcuffs, arm restraints, leg restraints, pepper spray, batons. ""The suggestion that officers need to be able to cover people's faces and heads is as far-fetched as it is frightening."" The hoods are already used by a handful of police forces across the UK and British Transport Police officers were filmed using one on a man at London Bridge station - an incident which is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). in June, Sussex Police came under fire after it emerged officers had used one of the hoods - along with handcuffs and leg straps - on an 11-year-old disabled girl. The girl was arrested three times and detained under the Mental Health Act once during a month-long period in 2012. The force failed to provide an appropriate adult to accompany her on the four occasions she was held in a police cell. IPCC investigators concluded that 11 officers had a case to answer over their contact with the girl, who endured a ""nightmare"" experience, according to her mother. But the Sussex Police Federation defended the officers involved in the case, saying that, despite her age, the girl ""displayed a high level of violence"" and restraint was necessary to prevent her harming herself or others."
2016-09-06,"Flights at London City Airport were severely disrupted after Black Lives Matter UK protesters crossed the Royal Docks and ""occupied"" the runway.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160906222334/http://news.sky.com/story/london-city-flights-delayed-after-runway-protest-10566897,"The Metropolitan Police said it was called to the airport at 5.40am to reports of protesters ""who made their way airside"". Nine demonstrators erected a tripod on the runway and chained themselves to it, forcing police to get ""specialist officers"" to cut them from the structure. All of the protesters were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, being unlawfully airside and of breaching London City Airport bylaws. The runway was reopened at around 12pm, the airport said. More than 120 flights were delayed or cancelled, while flights which were due to arrive at London City from Dublin, Rotterdam, Luxembourg, New York and Frankfurt were diverted to other London airports.  It is believed that activists reached the runway after crossing the Royal Docks in a rubber dinghy. Black Lives Matter spokesman Jacob Oti, 22, declined to explain how the protesters gained access to the site, but confirmed it was via the Thames. Runway is now open, we apologise for inconvenience caused this morning. Passengers are advised to check with airline for latest flight info. In a statement the group said that its activists carried out the demonstration ""in order to highlight the UK's environmental impact on the lives of black people"". It added that the planned expansion of London City Airport ""consigns the local community in Newham to further deterioration of their environment"".  The statement read: ""The average salary of a London City Airport user is €136,000 (£113,800) and 63% of them work in business, finance or other business services. ""It is an airport designed for the wealthy. ""At the same time 40% of Newham's population struggle to survive on £20,000 or less."" Speaking to Sky News, a Black Lives Matter UK spokeswoman said: ""Today we are saying all black lives matter and that includes the lives of those who live close to airports, people who are going to grow up with asthma and skin conditions.  ""That also includes the lives of people living in Guinea, Eritrea and Africa who are the most vulnerable and least resilient to climate change."" She added: ""This is an airport which is facilitating the travel and free movement of a very specific, tiny elite."" The protest comes a month after ten Black Lives Matter UK activists were arrested after a demonstration near Heathrow Airport. One of those caught up in the disruption was Eastenders actor Danny Dyer, who tweeted his thanks to staff for ""looking after me and my wife"". Passenger Casey Collins said customers were unaware of the runway protest until after 8am, and assumed the delays were related to IT glitches on British Airways' check-in systems. He said: ""The board was saying all BA flights were on hold, and that there would be updates at 8am, so we thought it was a continuation of the problems at Heathrow and Gatwick with BA. ""We then realised that things were more serious because all flights were being affected. ""It started to get a little bit out of control in terms of staff letting people know."" Another passenger, Chanel de Kock, added: ""I wish the airport would tighten their security as it's a bit worrying that people can access the runway so easily in the current state of our times, and also that the airport will be better at giving information to people at the airport. ""It was absolute chaos and really badly handled by what I thought was my favourite airport."" The airport apologised to passengers for the disruption, adding: ""It is extremely regrettable that a small number of people feel it is appropriate to protest in such a dangerous manner. ""A thorough investigation is now under way into the circumstances ... and we will take any actions identified as necessary as a result."""
2016-09-06,"A year after the Government promised to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees, some local authorities say people are not being processed quickly enough.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160906222334/http://news.sky.com/story/uks-syrian-refugee-resettlement-scheme-a-tragic-bureaucratic-failure-10567814,"The head of housing at Liverpool Council, which offered to take 100 refugees but is in the process of receiving just one, told Sky News that the scheme was a ""tragic bureaucratic failure"". In September last year then prime minister David Cameron said Britain would take 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years from countries neighbouring Syria such as Jordan and Lebanon.  Home Office figures show that in the first nine months of the scheme from October 2015 some 2,646 people were resettled across 118 local authorities. But a Sky Data poll reveals that 63% of people surveyed believe Britain should take fewer refugees, a 16% increase from a year ago, and 66% said they would not be willing for more refugees to move to their local area. Sky News spoke to a number of councils who said they wanted to take refugees but had not received any. Frank Hont, head of housing at Liverpool Council, said they told the Home Office they were ready, willing and able to take Syrian refugees a year ago and had made plans to supply accommodation and school places. Mr Hont said: ""We've met the Home Office minister on two occasions, we've spoken to officials on many occasions to say we've made the preparations.   ""It seems to me a tragic, bureaucratic failure that we can't get our act together as a government and local government to do something about it.  ""We'll quite often hear people in the general public saying 'why aren't we doing anything?'. Well, cities like Liverpool are ready to do something - just give us the opportunity to do it. ""It's a frustration that we've made the preparations and yet we still haven't seen any Syrian refugees."" :: Why Do Migrants Make The Risky Journey To Europe? We spoke to the Ejrf family from southwest Syria who were resettled in Coventry after fleeing their home and farming business that was caught in shelling between government and opposition forces. Hussein Ejrf, 40, was injured by shrapnel but failed to get medical help. By the time he reached neighbouring Lebanon it was too late and his left leg had to be amputated. His wife Hayat, 36, and their four children aged between 12 and 18, arrived in the UK in November of last year.  Whilst the family have had to make a huge adjustment moving to the UK, learning English and leaving their friends and family behind, Hussein told me: ""I love England because it's a safe country which has helped me and my family.  Thank you England."" :: Seven Migrants Dead As Packed Boat Sinks Off Libyan Coast Refugees are selected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which submits them to the Home Office for approval. The UNHCR's projected figure for the number of submissions for the whole 2016 is 7,300. The organisation's external relations officer, Andrej Mahecic, said good progress was being made on the resettlement of Syrian refugees.   ""This is a very demanding process,"" he said. ""It involves a series of interviews and checks. It shouldn't be taken lightly and it's important to get it right.   ""It does take time. Resettlement is a life-saving solution for the most vulnerable categories. We are talking about human beings. This is not about moving things from place A to B. It's a difficult process.""  The Home Office said: ""The scheme is voluntary and there has been a tremendous amount of goodwill from local authorities. ""Some of those authorities have not resettled people in the initial phases of the scheme, but will be resettling people in the future."" It is estimated that out of 4.8 million Syrians currently in neighbouring countries, up to 10% are in need of resettlement. :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,833 Sky customers online 26-31 August 2016.

It meant, Sports Direct said, that such workers had the option of selecting a permanent contract with a guaranteed number of minimum hours. The report showed the vast majority of the company's 27,000 directly-employed or contract staff were on casual contracts. In response, Sports Direct also confirmed it was ditching its controversial 'six strikes' disciplinary system - mired by allegations of bullying. It admitted the policy had ""contributed at times to a hierarchical model that placed workers in an uncertain and difficult position."" Sports Direct added that its HR operation would be bolstered at the Derbyshire site and supervisors given additional training to ensure ""no culture of fear.""

         The firm's report - and its subsequent actions - mark the latest stage of a gruelling public relations battle with unions, MPs and the company's own investors over working practices and wider corporate governance issues. It had previously admitted that workers were underpaid - blaming an administrative error. Today's report said founder Mike Ashley took ""ultimate responsibility for any aspects of the working practices that were unsatisfactory.""

         The billionaire, who also owns Newcastle United, has been under growing pressure ahead of Sports Direct's AGM - at the Derbyshire warehouse on Wednesday. Shareholder groups could yet inflict a bloody nose on the company through key votes amid calls for an overhaul of its board of directors. Sports Direct said it had asked the authors of the report on working practices to carry out further work on its corporate governance - looking specifically at the work of the board. Several investor groups have questioned the amount of power wielded by Mr Ashley, who owns 55% of the group and is deputy executive chairman. The company's share price, which is 40% down over the year-to-date, was 0.8% higher in early trading on Tuesday."
2016-09-06,Prosecutors are close to announcing whether they plan to charge former Tesco executives in relation to the profits overstatement that sparked the biggest crisis in the history of Britain's largest retailer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160906222334/http://news.sky.com/story/sfo-nears-charging-decisions-over-tescos-2014-profits-scandal-10567883,"Sky News has learnt that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) could announce whether it plans to pursue charges against individuals as soon as this week, close to two years after the agency launched a formal criminal probe into the affair. City sources said the SFO, which declined to comment, was also nearing a conclusion to its wider investigation into Tesco, which was forced to admit in the autumn of 2014 that profits had been overstated by more than £260m. The announcement of whether it will pursue charges against individuals will represent an important milestone in the SFO's Tesco probe, which it had aimed to complete by the end of last year. The SFO, which launched its inquiry in October 2014, could still delay formal decisions and a corresponding announcement until after this week, one insider said on Tuesday. A number of ex-bosses, including the former chief executive Philip Clarke, were interviewed under caution as part of the SFO's probe last year. Others reported at the time to have been questioned by the SFO included Chris Bush, the former head of Tesco's UK operations. Tesco's lawyers have held tentative discussions with the SFO about the company striking a plea deal called a deferred prosecution agreement, and such an outcome remains a possibility, according to legal sources. An announcement about the SFO's intentions towards Tesco itself is unlikely to emerge for a number of weeks, they added. The SFO's investigation has focused on a trading update issued on 29 August, 2014 which stated that trading profit for the six months ending 23 August 2014 was expected to be in the region of £1.1bn. Mr Lewis took over from Mr Clarke three days later, shortly after which a whistleblower highlighted concerns about Tesco's accounting practices relating to the recognition of revenue from suppliers. The ensuing crisis that engulfed Tesco led to a far-reaching overhaul spearheaded by Mr Lewis, with a number of subsidiaries since offloaded, its long-standing corporate headquarters closed down and a new strategy unveiled in order to win back disillusioned shoppers. Last week, Tesco's former finance director, Laurie McIlwee, was cleared of wrongdoing by the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council. Mr McIlwee, who left the company in early 2014 amid tensions with Mr Clarke, was never formally named by the FRC as being under investigation. The FRC's decision to clear Mr McIlwee has effectively left him free to rebuild his career, since he was only interviewed by the SFO as a witness, rather than under caution. The former Tesco finance chief had been absent from its headquarters for more than five months after his resignation when the profit overstatement emerged, after Mr Clarke had requested that he should not attend its offices during his notice period. The FRC's inquiry into PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tesco's auditor at the time of the profit overstatement, remains ongoing, the watchdog said last week. Tesco declined to comment on Tuesday."

Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, Head of the PSNI's Crime Operations Department, said: ""I am aware of the disruption this has caused to local residents and am extremely grateful for their co-operation and understanding. ""However, I am sure the people living in Larne will understand we will take no chances where their safety is concerned and, as a result of the significant terrorist material recovered, I am confident that the area, and Northern Ireland in general, is safer."" Gordon Lyons MLA, from the Democratic Unionist Party, praised police for the discovery and said the materials found ""would have caused a catastrophic loss of life"". Earlier this year, police made similar finds at two other locations near Larne: Carnfunnock Country Park and Capanagh Forest. Ciaran Maxwell, a Royal Marine, appeared in court earlier this week charged with a number of offences linked to those earlier discoveries. The 30-year-old, who is originally from Larne, denies the charges."
2016-09-06,"Black Lives Matter, which two years ago grew out of street protests in the US and a social-media hashtag, has arrived in Britain.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160906222334/http://news.sky.com/story/why-black-lives-matter-is-active-in-the-uk-10567069,"The group, whose international movement was set up following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida four years ago by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, calls for action against the marginalisation of black people. Activists in support of BLMUK #Shutdown London City Airport to protest the UK's environmental impact on black people pic.twitter.com/7LvFnB9Pv3 What began as a campaign calling for a response to racism and violence - in particular the police shootings of unarmed black people in the US - is now inspiring activists in the UK. Black Lives Matter UK first made the headlines in Britain when members brought traffic to a standstill outside Heathrow Airport - and carried out similar protests in Birmingham, Nottingham and Manchester - in a coordinated day of action last month. Black Lives Matter activist Adam Elliott Cooper, 29, from London, said the Heathrow location was chosen as ""many people are either being killed at our borders or being sent back to certain death"". The demonstrations and transport blockades took place on the fifth anniversary of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan by police in north London, which led to riots in several cities across England in 2011. Campaigners said Tuesday's action at London City Airport was taken ""in order to highlight the UK's environmental impact on the lives of black people locally and globally"". On its Facebook page, Black Lives Matter UK describes itself as ""a coalition of activists from across the UK who believe deeply that Black Lives Matter"". It includes numerous groups including UK Black Lives Matter (not the same) and regional city-based chapters with their own relationships with the original US campaign. The movement focuses on highlighting stop and searches in the UK and custody deaths. It now appears to be expanding its remit to include the environment - or is it? ""BLM UK is an amorphous movement with no central leadership,"" said Sky's Afua Hirsch. ""It has amalgamated a wide range of grievances from black deaths in police custody, to treatment of people in immigration detention and the deaths in the Mediterranean during the refugee crisis. And now apparently, climate change. ""Some of the figures who have emerged as spokespeople have backgrounds in the militant left and are not necessarily representative of the wider movement. ""There is a lot of internal dissent on their private forums about the role that militant students, climate change activists and white protestors should play - which seems to be unresolved.  ""One of the the sources of tension is between the families of people who have died in police custody, who have close relationships with BLM in the US and feel they should be at the heart of the movement in the UK, and others like those protesting today. ""Protests like these are not the result of any wide consultation and the protesters I have spoken to who organise marches around police deaths knew nothing about it."" Whilst BLM UK have claimed the London City Airport as a protest - and has clearly endorsed it - dissenting voices have come to the fore. One woman posted on BLM UK's Facebook page: ""Where are all the Black people in this BLM protest? Looks like the hashtags just been hijacked by nine people with their own agenda. Was this actually organised by BLMUK?"" Others voiced their ""massive respect and solidarity"" and hailed the protest as ""inspiring""."

Her death was assumed to be of natural causes and the 28-year-old was buried in a nearby cemetery. But a subsequent inquiry concluded Ms Shahid, who is of Pakistani origin, had been raped and strangled. A police report released on Tuesday accuses Ms Shahid's father, Muhammad Shahid, of standing guard while her ex-husband Choudhry Mohammad Shakeel raped her. The report said the men then committed a ""premeditated, cold-blooded murder"". The pair were arrested last month but have not been formally charged. They appeared in court on Monday in the eastern city of Jhelum and were ordered to held for 14 days pending charges and trial. The report also seeks the extradition of Ms Shahid's mother and sister from the UK. Muhammad Shahid and Choudhry Mohammad Shakeel were arrested in Pakistan last month. The initial inquiry into Ms Shahid's death was ordered by the Pakistani government after her second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazam claimed the woman had been the victim of a so-called honour killing. Mr Kazam said Ms Shahid's family lured her back to Pakistan by telling her that her father was critically ill. Ms Shahid's family were opposed to her second marriage, Mr Kazam has claimed. The couple had been married for two years and were living in Dubai. On Saturday it was reported the policeman who initially headed the murder investigation had been arrested over allegations he tried to conceal evidence relating to Ms Shahid's death. An estimated 1,000 women are killed every year by family members in so-called honour killings in Pakistan."
2016-09-06,"An hour or so after the British Medical Association announced strike dates for October, November and December, I was in Downing Street when Philip Hammond emerged from the front door of No. 11.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160906222334/http://news.sky.com/story/junior-doctors-dispute-is-theresa-mays-first-big-test-10562064,"""What are your going to do about the pesky junior doctors?"" I asked him cheekily. ""Not my department,"" the Chancellor replied breezily, before turning on his heels and disappearing through the gate at the far end of the street, clutching his red box. It would be unfair to say that the embattled Jeremy Hunt lacks support from Cabinet colleagues as he prepares for yet more hand-to-hand combat with the increasingly militant junior doctors. The Prime Minister, when she broke her silence on the latest strike threat, did give her Health Secretary pretty solid backing when she accused the BMA of playing politics. But she did then have to correct herself after beginning her declaration of support by saying: ""Jeremy has been an excellent Health Secretary…""  Has been?  She immediately realised her mistake and quickly said: ""He is an excellent Health Secretary..."" But there's no doubt that there is some frustration among Conservative MPs - including ministers - about just how long this dispute has dragged on.  The first strike, after all, was back in January. And if the BMA carries out its new threat, the strikes will have been going on throughout the whole of 2016. Prime Minister Theresa May may have backed Mr Hunt publicly during her visit to a car plant in the West Midlands, but after a chairing a Cabinet committee on social reform - which the Health Secretary had been expected to attend - Mr Hunt was seen arriving at No 10, apparently for a meeting with the PM. A crisis meeting? Well, there was a meeting and the junior doctors' dispute is fast becoming a political crisis. So in that sense it could have been a crisis meeting. Not so, of course, according to Mr Hunt and his allies. ""A regular planning meeting, nothing to do with the strikes,"" a Department of Health source claimed, in what must rank as the quote of the day. When I repeated this to a senior Conservative MP who had just been in No 10 for another meeting, he roared with laughter, though he insisted the doctors' dispute wasn't a crisis - yet! Several hours later, a Department of Health source contacted Sky News again and rejected suggestions that Mr Hunt had missed the social reform meeting - he presented on mental health, the source said - and said the second meeting 'wasn't with the PM'. Mr Hunt's officials aren't denying, however, that he and the PM discussed the doctors' strike during the day. Has Mr Hunt handled the dispute badly? His critics in the BMA and the Labour Party claim he has, of course. But was it wise for him to be so macho after the ballot in July threw out the deal reached in May and announce that he would impose the new contracts in October? With hindsight, it looks like a clumsy move that has backfired. Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Diane Abbott, a Corbyn loyalist and devotee, has accused the Government of treating the junior doctors like ""the enemy within"" - the phrase Margaret Thatcher provocatively used to describe the miners in the 1984-85 strike led by Arthur Scargill. The new junior doctors' leader, Ellen McCourt, may be more militant than her predecessor, Johann Malawana, who quit after the July ballot. But she is hardly an Arthur Scargill. And are the junior doctors like miners? Hardly. Most look and sound like the sons and daughters of middle class Tories from the shires. Which is one reason why Jeremy Hunt should be wary.  The Prime Minister on the other hand, will be wary about being seen to show any sign of weakness so soon into her time in Downing Street. The junior doctors may not be the Chancellor's ""department"", as he put it - yet, unless he suddenly has to find some money to buy them off.  But every aspect of government is the Prime Minister's ""department"". And the battle with the junior doctors is Theresa May's first big test."

At the moment its brief stretches back 60 years and covers institutions including the church, schools, councils and Westminster. :: The UK's Child Abuse Inquiry In Numbers It is expected to run for at least 10 years and cost around £100m. The Times said it had seen a memorandum from Dame Lowell, in which the New Zealand judge called for the inquiry to be ""remodelled"". ""With the benefit of hindsight, or more realistically the benefit of experience, it is clear there is an inherent problem in the sheer scale and size of the inquiry (which its budget does not match) and therefore in its manageability,"" she wrote. ""Its boundless compass, including as it does every state and non-state institution as well as relevant institutional contexts, coupled with the absence of any built-in time parameters, does not fit comfortably or practically within the single inquiry model in which it currently resides."" The inquiry will now be headed by Professor Alexis Jay, a social work specialist who is backed by a panel, victims of sex abuse and other expert advisers.:: Abuse Inquiry Judge Asked To Appear Before MPs Dame Lowell also criticised the inquiry's staff for being inexperienced, and when she quit she said there had been a ""legacy of failure which has been very hard to shake off"". Despite Dame Lowell's concerns about the scale of the inquiry, Professor Jay issued a statement announcing its scope would not be diminished but a review would take place to ensure it could be concluded without undue expense. ""I want to reassure victims and survivors that the panel will not be seeking any revision of the Inquiry's terms of reference or introducing any new restrictions on its scope,"" she said. ""To ensure that the Inquiry can meet the challenges it faces, I have already initiated a wide-ranging internal review of the Inquiry's ways of working and we are currently looking at different approaches to evaluating the information we receive."" Baroness Butler-Sloss and Dame Fiona Woolf also resigned from heading the inquiry, which has been described as the most ambitious public inquiry ever in England and Wales. It was set up in 2014 amid claims of an establishment cover-up following allegations that a paedophile ring operated in Westminster in the 1980s. After she quit, Dame Lowell was asked to appear before the Home Affairs Select Committee to explain why she had stood down, but it is unclear if she has agreed to appear. There had been reports she spent three months on holiday or abroad in her first year in the £500,000 job. Ms Rudd is due to appear before the committee on Wednesday. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""The independent inquiry has a vital role to play in exposing the failure of public bodies and other major organisations to prevent systematic child sexual abuse. ""Our commitment to this inquiry is undiminished. We owe it to victims and survivors to confront the appalling reality of how children were let down by the very people who were charged to protect them and to learn from the mistakes of the past.""

A rescue vessel operated by MOAS (Migrant Offshore Aid Station) was radioed by the Italian Coast Guard just after 5am on Monday. Over the following three hours, more than 1,000 people were rescued - including three babies - in an operation that involved numerous charities and the Italian Coast Guard. Three babies rescued and a number of older children. Cared for here by @moas_eu staff. @SkyNews pic.twitter.com/VXWKfBNEWy MOAS Onboard Operations Officer Marco Cauchi said: ""Today it was intense for the fact the rubber boats were jam-packed... they put as many people as they can... they put in 160 people it was incredible. ""These boats are built to only take 100 people. It was dangerously loaded. ""People were jumping out, fumes were coming up, people were fainting, so it was horrible."" :: Why Do Migrants Make The Risky Journey? The Responder vessel, operated by MOAS, began its rescue just after 5.30am (local time).  A small rescue craft was dispatched from the larger ship, heading out into the dark towards the dim single light of the migrant boat. As we approached, what at first looked like a tiny dinghy quickly revealed itself to be a large dinghy with 160 people on board. Initially, the rescue went to plan. The MOAS team distributed life jackets to the migrants, tried to calm them down and manoeuvre them towards the Responder ship. From the centre of the rubber dinghy we could see two babies being held high by their parents. As the Responder ship moved itself closer to the dinghy, the migrants panicked - brought on by a combination of the fact that it was dark, many of them can't swim and some had inhaled toxic fumes from low quality fuel on their boat. In seconds, a textbook rescue turned into a nightmare. The migrant boat, filled only with air and completely inappropriate for the open seas, partially capsized. At least 20 people fell into the water. It was impossible to count the precise number. The rescue team dived into the water - something they later told me they do only in extreme circumstances. Quickly we could see why. In their panic, some of the migrants overwhelmed one of the rescuers. He swallowed fuel from the migrants' boat and began to lose consciousness in the water. He was spotted by the rescue coordinator monitoring the rescue from the bridge of the Responder. He was rescued and has made a full recovery. But drifting out in the sea off our vessel, a number of dead bodies could be seen. With as much dignity as possible, they were recovered, brought aboard the Responder, placed carefully in body bags and laid in the ship's morgue. Over the next few hours hundreds more migrants, rescued on other ships, were transferred to the Responder, which will now sail back to Italy. There, the migrants will be processed and should have their asylum claims either accepted or rejected depending on which country they are from. However, this is a process which takes months and in some cases, years."

During the opening of the trial, the jury was told the victim went missing in January 2003, but nothing was heard from her until her body was found ""in a clandestine grave in a field in the middle of nowhere"" in March 2011. It was then that Halliwell told police he had ""taken a girl from Swindon, had sex with her and then strangled her"", before showing officers the site. He is accused of murdering Miss Godden between January 2003 and April 2008. Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC told the jury: ""You might conclude that it was plain Rebecca was murdered... but secondly, this defendant, Christopher Halliwell, confessed to the police that between 2003 and 2005, he couldn't be sure of the date, he had taken a girl from the streets of Swindon. ""He told the police he had sex with her and then he killed her by strangling her. He told the police he stripped the girl of her clothes and concealed her naked body. ""Not only that, but the defendant took the police to the location."" It was not possible to determine the cause of death as Miss Godden's remains had become ""completely skeletonised,"" the court was told. Relatives including her mother, Karen Edwards, and father, John Godden, sat in the public gallery for the opening of the case. The young woman's mother wept in court as the circumstances of her life and death were explained to the jury. Miss Godden had become addicted to class A drugs and was a sex worker, the court was told. Halliwell is already serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to the murder of Sian O'Callaghan, a woman who disappeared after a night out with friends at the Suju nightclub in Swindon in March 2011, the court heard. Her body was discovered buried semi-naked in a rural location. ""It was concealed by undergrowth in a remote location, not a great distance from the field where Rebecca's body had been buried,"" Mr Haggan told the jury. The court heard that when Halliwell was taken to the location where he had dumped Miss O'Callaghan's body, he told a detective: ""I'm a sick f****r, is it too late to get help?"" After a pause, he continued: ""Another one...forgive me"". Earlier, jurors heard details of the ""last reliable sighting"" of Miss Godden outside a nightclub in Swindon town centre in January 2003. The court was told she got into taxi despite having an argument with the driver. ""After that, nothing more was heard from her,"" Mr Haggan told the court. ""She quite literally disappeared. She was just 20 years old."" The prosecution told the jury Halliwell had used sex workers and had been a client of Miss Godden. A friend of hers said he had been one of her regulars, the court was told. The trial continues."

The maximum sentence was 10 years. When the sentence was handed down, there was a shout of ""Allahu Akbar"" from Choudary's supporters in the public gallery, before the court was cleared. Choudary became Britain's best-known Islamist preacher, and his followers were implicated in numerous plots around the world. During the trial, the jury were shown pictures of Choudary and Rahman at a demonstration outside the Lebanese embassy in central London in April 2014, before the so-called Islamic State group was proscribed. Some of the crowd were holding placards which had writing at the bottom which said: ""Islamic State Is Solution"" with the first letter of each word underlined to make ISIS. The Old Bailey heard he had used online lectures and messages to encourage support for IS.  Statements from Rahman in November 2013, under the Twitter name @AbuBaraaUK said: ""Re-establishing the Khilafah (Caliphate) is a compulsory duty on all Muslims."" Another, on Facebook, said: ""If anyone says martyrdom operations are not allowed ... do not take ilm (religious advice) from him."" Judge Mr Justice Holroyde told both defendants: ""You expressed contempt for the values by which we live."" He said Choudary, 49, and 33-year-old Rahman were free to support IS, but not free to invite others to do so. ""It is a crime,"" he said. And he added that the absence of any direct link with those carrying out acts of terror for IS did not mean their crime was not serious.  The judge described Rahman as a ""hothead"" while Choudary was more calculating and more experienced. ""You are both mature men and intelligent men who knew throughout exactly what you were doing,"" he said. ""You are both fluent and persuasive speakers."" Commander Dean Haydon, head of Anti-Terrorism Command, said the pair had radicalised others, and encouraged them to join terror organisations. ""If I look at both these individuals they are connected to and associated with proscribed organisations both here and overseas,"" he said. ""From what we know from the evidence presented, they were certainly in contact with terrorists, again overseas. ""So the sentence today is certainly welcome, and it's a credit to the hard work over many, many years that has gone into monitoring preachers of hate, here in the UK but also, their wider connections overseas."" He added that work must be done with communities to make sure that people don't step into their shoes and back fill their positions. Addressing the judge, Choudary's lawyer, Mark Summers QC, said ""I hope my lord will accept that the evidence in this case shows over the course of 20 years Mr Choudary has done his best, determined to stay within the law, acting on the boundaries of it but staying within the law. ""In the commission of these offences Mr Choudary believed he was still within the law, although ignorance of the law is no defence. ""But he has had time to reflect and on reflection would have done things differently had he known the boundaries of the law. ""He is determined not to cross those boundaries in the future."" Mr Summers said he feared for Choudary's mental health if he was held in solitary confinement in jail."

Posting pictures of himself carrying out the stunt, Nelson tweeted: ""Good of Sir Philip Green to rename his £100m yacht to something more appropriate. I was glad to help."" Sir Philip, former owner of the now-collapsed chain, is currently being investigated by regulators in a probe into BHS' vast pension deficit. Last month, Sir Philip reacted angrily to attempts by Sky News to question him about the closure of BHS and the loss of thousands of jobs. The former owner of the business was holidaying on his new yacht in the Greek islands. Also in August, Sky News revealed he was seeking assurances regulators will abandon the probe if he makes a ""voluntary"" financial contribution to the retirement pots of thousands of the firm's former employees. The precise sum Sir Philip will have to contribute remains subject to weeks or even months of further negotiations, although experts say it will be at least £300m based on talks so far. The tycoon promised to ""sort"" the deficit when he appeared before MPs in June, although he has since been criticised by parliamentarians over the lack of visible progress.

However, it does suggest only, ""once we have worked with existing grammars to show how they can be expanded and reformed in ways which avoid disadvantage those who don't get in"". Grammar schools are state secondaries that select their pupils by setting an entrance exam at age 11. There are currently 163 in England - out of some 3,000 state secondaries. However, under a law created by Labour's Tony Blair in 1998, no new grammar schools are allowed to open in England. Previously the Education Secretary Justine Greening has said she is prepared to be ""open minded"" about allowing new grammar schools in England. This document appears to show that the Government is actively working towards lifting the ban, with expectations that it will be announced at Conservative Party Conference next month. But such a move would likely face strong opposition from both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister Theresa May, who went to a grammar school, commands a majority of just 12 in the House of Commons, but the Conservative's have no majority in the House of Lords. Angela Rayner MP, shadow education secretary, said: ""The cat is out of the bag: behind closed doors the Tories are planning a return to the bad old days of grammars, ignoring all the evidence which has told us time and again that they do not aid social mobility.

Posting pictures of himself carrying out the stunt, Nelson tweeted: ""Good of Sir Philip Green to rename his £100m yacht to something more appropriate. I was glad to help."" Sir Philip, former owner of the now-collapsed chain, is currently being investigated by regulators in a probe into BHS' vast pension deficit. Last month, Sir Philip reacted angrily to attempts by Sky News to question him about the closure of BHS and the loss of thousands of jobs. The former owner of the business was holidaying on his new yacht in the Greek islands. Also in August, Sky News revealed he was seeking assurances regulators will abandon the probe if he makes a ""voluntary"" financial contribution to the retirement pots of thousands of the firm's former employees. The precise sum Sir Philip will have to contribute remains subject to weeks or even months of further negotiations, although experts say it will be at least £300m based on talks so far. The tycoon promised to ""sort"" the deficit when he appeared before MPs in June, although he has since been criticised by parliamentarians over the lack of visible progress. Approximately 11,000 people have seen their jobs disappear as a result of the collapse, with Sir Philip shouldering much of the blame in a critical report published by MPs last month."

It meant, Sports Direct said, that such workers had the option of selecting a permanent contract with a guaranteed number of minimum hours. The report showed the vast majority of the company's 27,000 directly-employed or contract staff were on casual contracts. In response, Sports Direct also confirmed it was ditching its controversial 'six strikes' disciplinary system - mired by allegations of bullying. It admitted the policy had ""contributed at times to a hierarchical model that placed workers in an uncertain and difficult position."" Sports Direct added that its HR operation would be bolstered at the Derbyshire site and supervisors given additional training to ensure ""no culture of fear.""

2016-09-07,Prosecutors are close to announcing whether they plan to charge former Tesco executives in relation to the profits overstatement that sparked the biggest crisis in the history of Britain's largest retailer.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160907063810/http://news.sky.com/story/sfo-nears-charging-decisions-over-tescos-2014-profits-scandal-10567883,"Sky News has learnt that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) could announce whether it plans to pursue charges against individuals as soon as this week, close to two years after the agency launched a formal criminal probe into the affair. City sources said the SFO, which declined to comment, was also nearing a conclusion to its wider investigation into Tesco, which was forced to admit in the autumn of 2014 that profits had been overstated by more than £260m. The announcement of whether it will pursue charges against individuals will represent an important milestone in the SFO's Tesco probe, which it had aimed to complete by the end of last year. The SFO, which launched its inquiry in October 2014, could still delay formal decisions and a corresponding announcement until after this week, one insider said on Tuesday. A number of ex-bosses, including the former chief executive Philip Clarke, were interviewed under caution as part of the SFO's probe last year. Others reported at the time to have been questioned by the SFO included Chris Bush, the former head of Tesco's UK operations. Tesco's lawyers have held tentative discussions with the SFO about the company striking a plea deal called a deferred prosecution agreement, and such an outcome remains a possibility, according to legal sources. An announcement about the SFO's intentions towards Tesco itself is unlikely to emerge for a number of weeks, they added. The SFO's investigation has focused on a trading update issued on 29 August, 2014 which stated that trading profit for the six months ending 23 August 2014 was expected to be in the region of £1.1bn. Mr Lewis took over from Mr Clarke three days later, shortly after which a whistleblower highlighted concerns about Tesco's accounting practices relating to the recognition of revenue from suppliers. The ensuing crisis that engulfed Tesco led to a far-reaching overhaul spearheaded by Mr Lewis, with a number of subsidiaries since offloaded, its long-standing corporate headquarters closed down and a new strategy unveiled in order to win back disillusioned shoppers. Last week, Tesco's former finance director, Laurie McIlwee, was cleared of wrongdoing by the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council. Mr McIlwee, who left the company in early 2014 amid tensions with Mr Clarke, was never formally named by the FRC as being under investigation. The FRC's decision to clear Mr McIlwee has effectively left him free to rebuild his career, since he was only interviewed by the SFO as a witness, rather than under caution. The former Tesco finance chief had been absent from its headquarters for more than five months after his resignation when the profit overstatement emerged, after Mr Clarke had requested that he should not attend its offices during his notice period. The FRC's inquiry into PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tesco's auditor at the time of the profit overstatement, remains ongoing, the watchdog said last week. Tesco declined to comment on Tuesday."

He said 20% to 30% of its 5,000-strong workforce in London could be affected. Multinational businesses are awaiting the details of what Brexit will mean as they assess how it affects them. A key issue for London-based banks will be what becomes of current ""passporting"" arrangements that allow them to operate across Europe. Mr Ermotti said UBS was ""well prepared for any outcome"". He added: ""We currently employ more than 5,000 people in London, and probably 20% to 30% of our workforce could be affected. ""We believe that London will continue to be an important financial centre, although maybe not as important as it is today."" The comments come after Lloyd's of London said it could be forced to move part of its business to the continent unless single market access is secured in a post-Brexit Britain.

Nine demonstrators erected a tripod on the runway and chained themselves to it, forcing police to get ""specialist officers"" to cut them from the structure. All of the protesters were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, being unlawfully airside and of breaching London City Airport bylaws. The runway was reopened at around 12pm, the airport said. More than 120 flights were delayed or cancelled, while flights which were due to arrive at London City from Dublin, Rotterdam, Luxembourg, New York and Frankfurt were diverted to other London airports.  It is believed that activists reached the runway after crossing the Royal Docks in a rubber dinghy. Black Lives Matter spokesman Jacob Oti, 22, declined to explain how the protesters gained access to the site, but confirmed it was via the Thames. Runway is now open, we apologise for inconvenience caused this morning. Passengers are advised to check with airline for latest flight info. In a statement the group said that its activists carried out the demonstration ""in order to highlight the UK's environmental impact on the lives of black people"". It added that the planned expansion of London City Airport ""consigns the local community in Newham to further deterioration of their environment"".  The statement read: ""The average salary of a London City Airport user is €136,000 (£113,800) and 63% of them work in business, finance or other business services. ""It is an airport designed for the wealthy. ""At the same time 40% of Newham's population struggle to survive on £20,000 or less."" Speaking to Sky News, a Black Lives Matter UK spokeswoman said: ""Today we are saying all black lives matter and that includes the lives of those who live close to airports, people who are going to grow up with asthma and skin conditions.  ""That also includes the lives of people living in Guinea, Eritrea and Africa who are the most vulnerable and least resilient to climate change."" She added: ""This is an airport which is facilitating the travel and free movement of a very specific, tiny elite."" The protest comes a month after ten Black Lives Matter UK activists were arrested after a demonstration near Heathrow Airport. One of those caught up in the disruption was Eastenders actor Danny Dyer, who tweeted his thanks to staff for ""looking after me and my wife"". Passenger Casey Collins said customers were unaware of the runway protest until after 8am, and assumed the delays were related to IT glitches on British Airways' check-in systems. He said: ""The board was saying all BA flights were on hold, and that there would be updates at 8am, so we thought it was a continuation of the problems at Heathrow and Gatwick with BA. ""We then realised that things were more serious because all flights were being affected. ""It started to get a little bit out of control in terms of staff letting people know."" Another passenger, Chanel de Kock, added: ""I wish the airport would tighten their security as it's a bit worrying that people can access the runway so easily in the current state of our times, and also that the airport will be better at giving information to people at the airport. ""It was absolute chaos and really badly handled by what I thought was my favourite airport."" The airport apologised to passengers for the disruption, adding: ""It is extremely regrettable that a small number of people feel it is appropriate to protest in such a dangerous manner. ""A thorough investigation is now under way into the circumstances ... and we will take any actions identified as necessary as a result."""

Activists in support of BLMUK #Shutdown London City Airport to protest the UK's environmental impact on black people pic.twitter.com/7LvFnB9Pv3 What began as a campaign calling for a response to racism and violence - in particular the police shootings of unarmed black people in the US - is now inspiring activists in the UK. Black Lives Matter UK first made the headlines in Britain when members brought traffic to a standstill outside Heathrow Airport - and carried out similar protests in Birmingham, Nottingham and Manchester - in a coordinated day of action last month. Black Lives Matter activist Adam Elliott Cooper, 29, from London, said the Heathrow location was chosen as ""many people are either being killed at our borders or being sent back to certain death"". The demonstrations and transport blockades took place on the fifth anniversary of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan by police in north London, which led to riots in several cities across England in 2011. Campaigners said Tuesday's action at London City Airport was taken ""in order to highlight the UK's environmental impact on the lives of black people locally and globally"". On its Facebook page, Black Lives Matter UK describes itself as ""a coalition of activists from across the UK who believe deeply that Black Lives Matter"". It includes numerous groups including UK Black Lives Matter (not the same) and regional city-based chapters with their own relationships with the original US campaign. The movement focuses on highlighting stop and searches in the UK and custody deaths. It now appears to be expanding its remit to include the environment - or is it? ""BLM UK is an amorphous movement with no central leadership,"" said Sky's Afua Hirsch. ""It has amalgamated a wide range of grievances from black deaths in police custody, to treatment of people in immigration detention and the deaths in the Mediterranean during the refugee crisis. And now apparently, climate change. ""Some of the figures who have emerged as spokespeople have backgrounds in the militant left and are not necessarily representative of the wider movement. ""There is a lot of internal dissent on their private forums about the role that militant students, climate change activists and white protestors should play - which seems to be unresolved.  ""One of the the sources of tension is between the families of people who have died in police custody, who have close relationships with BLM in the US and feel they should be at the heart of the movement in the UK, and others like those protesting today. ""Protests like these are not the result of any wide consultation and the protesters I have spoken to who organise marches around police deaths knew nothing about it."" Whilst BLM UK have claimed the London City Airport as a protest - and has clearly endorsed it - dissenting voices have come to the fore. One woman posted on BLM UK's Facebook page: ""Where are all the Black people in this BLM protest? Looks like the hashtags just been hijacked by nine people with their own agenda. Was this actually organised by BLMUK?"" Others voiced their ""massive respect and solidarity"" and hailed the protest as ""inspiring""."

However, it does suggest only, ""once we have worked with existing grammars to show how they can be expanded and reformed in ways which avoid disadvantage those who don't get in"". Grammar schools are state secondaries that select their pupils by setting an entrance exam at age 11. There are currently 163 in England - out of some 3,000 state secondaries. However, under a law created by Labour's Tony Blair in 1998, no new grammar schools are allowed to open in England. Previously the Education Secretary Justine Greening has said she is prepared to be ""open minded"" about allowing new grammar schools in England. This document appears to show that the Government is actively working towards lifting the ban, with expectations that it will be announced at Conservative Party Conference next month. But such a move would likely face strong opposition from both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister Theresa May, who went to a grammar school, commands a majority of just 12 in the House of Commons, but the Conservative's have no majority in the House of Lords. Angela Rayner MP, shadow education secretary, said: ""The cat is out of the bag: behind closed doors the Tories are planning a return to the bad old days of grammars, ignoring all the evidence which has told us time and again that they do not aid social mobility. ""As Michael Wilshaw said yesterday, with every grammar school you open you create three more secondary moderns with it.

A BA spokeswoman later said the airline was ""checking in normally across all of our airports,"" but added the process at Heathrow and Gatwick would be ""a bit slower than usual"" and customers were encouraged to check-in online.

Staff with clipboards were writing manual boarding passes for passengers, a delayed traveller at Seattle Airport said. Matthew Walker had been waiting for more than two hours to board his flight back to Heathrow. The 29-year-old financial analyst told the Press Association: ""People were lining up, some had already checked in and got through security, but others, when this thing happened, whatever it is, were stuck in the check-in queue. ""So they (the staff) have the problem that they didn't know who had already gone through the gate because all the systems literally just had a meltdown, basically."" The airline is not the only one to have suffered an IT problem in recent weeks. Last month, Delta Airlines ordered a ground stop after a power outage caused its IT systems to crash, leaving passengers stranded at airports around the world as scheduled flights were not taking off."

In September last year then prime minister David Cameron said Britain would take 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years from countries neighbouring Syria such as Jordan and Lebanon.  Home Office figures show that in the first nine months of the scheme from October 2015 some 2,646 people were resettled across 118 local authorities. But a Sky Data poll reveals that 63% of people surveyed believe Britain should take fewer refugees, a 16% increase from a year ago, and 66% said they would not be willing for more refugees to move to their local area. Sky News spoke to a number of councils who said they wanted to take refugees but had not received any. Frank Hont, head of housing at Liverpool Council, said they told the Home Office they were ready, willing and able to take Syrian refugees a year ago and had made plans to supply accommodation and school places. Mr Hont said: ""We've met the Home Office minister on two occasions, we've spoken to officials on many occasions to say we've made the preparations.   ""It seems to me a tragic, bureaucratic failure that we can't get our act together as a government and local government to do something about it.  ""We'll quite often hear people in the general public saying 'why aren't we doing anything?'. Well, cities like Liverpool are ready to do something - just give us the opportunity to do it.

Choudary became Britain's best-known Islamist preacher, and his followers were implicated in numerous plots around the world. During the trial, the jury were shown pictures of Choudary and Rahman at a demonstration outside the Lebanese embassy in central London in April 2014, before the so-called Islamic State group was proscribed. Some of the crowd were holding placards which had writing at the bottom which said: ""Islamic State Is Solution"" with the first letter of each word underlined to make ISIS. The Old Bailey heard he had used online lectures and messages to encourage support for IS.  Statements from Rahman in November 2013, under the Twitter name @AbuBaraaUK said: ""Re-establishing the Khilafah (Caliphate) is a compulsory duty on all Muslims."" Another, on Facebook, said: ""If anyone says martyrdom operations are not allowed ... do not take ilm (religious advice) from him."" Judge Mr Justice Holroyde told both defendants: ""You expressed contempt for the values by which we live."" He said Choudary, 49, and 33-year-old Rahman were free to support IS, but not free to invite others to do so. ""It is a crime,"" he said. And he added that the absence of any direct link with those carrying out acts of terror for IS did not mean their crime was not serious.  The judge described Rahman as a ""hothead"" while Choudary was more calculating and more experienced. ""You are both mature men and intelligent men who knew throughout exactly what you were doing,"" he said. ""You are both fluent and persuasive speakers."" Commander Dean Haydon, head of Anti-Terrorism Command, said the pair had radicalised others, and encouraged them to join terror organisations. ""If I look at both these individuals they are connected to and associated with proscribed organisations both here and overseas,"" he said. ""From what we know from the evidence presented, they were certainly in contact with terrorists, again overseas. ""So the sentence today is certainly welcome, and it's a credit to the hard work over many, many years that has gone into monitoring preachers of hate, here in the UK but also, their wider connections overseas."" He added that work must be done with communities to make sure that people don't step into their shoes and back fill their positions. Addressing the judge, Choudary's lawyer, Mark Summers QC, said ""I hope my lord will accept that the evidence in this case shows over the course of 20 years Mr Choudary has done his best, determined to stay within the law, acting on the boundaries of it but staying within the law. ""In the commission of these offences Mr Choudary believed he was still within the law, although ignorance of the law is no defence. ""But he has had time to reflect and on reflection would have done things differently had he known the boundaries of the law. ""He is determined not to cross those boundaries in the future."" Mr Summers said he feared for Choudary's mental health if he was held in solitary confinement in jail."

Just one in five boxes contain any vegetables or salad. Of all the lunchboxes examined, less than 20% met the standards for energy, vitamin A or zinc. Only 26% met the standard for iron. Between 52% and 60% contained too many sweet and savoury snacks, while 46% included sugary drinks. The research, commissioned by Flora, found that the quality of young children's lunchboxes has improved by just 0.5% in the last 10 years. Flora is working with MP Sharon Hodgson, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) of School Food. The Government is being urged to put packed lunches at the heart of its childhood obesity drive. Campaigners want to cut down on the amount of crisps, chocolate biscuits and sugary drinks being brought into schools. Jo Nicholas, head of research at the Children's Food Trust, said: ""We've got to do more to help parents and schools with this. ""Putting a packed lunch policy in place can be tough, but every school allowing packed lunches needs one if we're going to make life easier for parents and give kids a consistent message."""

During the opening of the trial, the jury was told the victim went missing in January 2003, but nothing was heard from her until her body was found ""in a clandestine grave in a field in the middle of nowhere"" in March 2011. It was then that Halliwell told police he had ""taken a girl from Swindon, had sex with her and then strangled her"", before showing officers the site. He is accused of murdering Miss Godden between January 2003 and April 2008. Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC told the jury: ""You might conclude that it was plain Rebecca was murdered... but secondly, this defendant, Christopher Halliwell, confessed to the police that between 2003 and 2005, he couldn't be sure of the date, he had taken a girl from the streets of Swindon. ""He told the police he had sex with her and then he killed her by strangling her. He told the police he stripped the girl of her clothes and concealed her naked body. ""Not only that, but the defendant took the police to the location."" It was not possible to determine the cause of death as Miss Godden's remains had become ""completely skeletonised,"" the court was told. Relatives including her mother, Karen Edwards, and father, John Godden, sat in the public gallery for the opening of the case. The young woman's mother wept in court as the circumstances of her life and death were explained to the jury. Miss Godden had become addicted to class A drugs and was a sex worker, the court was told. Halliwell is already serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to the murder of Sian O'Callaghan, a woman who disappeared after a night out with friends at the Suju nightclub in Swindon in March 2011, the court heard. Her body was discovered buried semi-naked in a rural location. ""It was concealed by undergrowth in a remote location, not a great distance from the field where Rebecca's body had been buried,"" Mr Haggan told the jury. The court heard that when Halliwell was taken to the location where he had dumped Miss O'Callaghan's body, he told a detective: ""I'm a sick f****r, is it too late to get help?"" After a pause, he continued: ""Another one...forgive me"". Earlier, jurors heard details of the ""last reliable sighting"" of Miss Godden outside a nightclub in Swindon town centre in January 2003. The court was told she got into taxi despite having an argument with the driver. ""After that, nothing more was heard from her,"" Mr Haggan told the court. ""She quite literally disappeared. She was just 20 years old."" The prosecution told the jury Halliwell had used sex workers and had been a client of Miss Godden. A friend of hers said he had been one of her regulars, the court was told. The trial continues."

Commenting on the figures, Britain's most senior prosecutor warned of a ""growing trend"" of offences perpetrated on or through social media. Figures published by the Crown Prosecution Service revealed there were 206 cases against defendants accused of so-called ""revenge porn"". They are accused of disclosing private sexual images without consent, says the CPS's Violence Against Women and Girls report. The offence- carrying a maximum sentence of two years - was introduced in April, 2015, after calls from campaigners. Previously, such cases were dealt with through existing copyright or harassment laws. The figures also showed that ""obscenity"" offences - including cases under the malicious communications act - rose 20% to just under 7,000. Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, said: ""There is a growing trend of crimes committed on or through social media. ""Since the new legislation came into force, there have been over 200 prosecutions for disclosing private sexual images without consent. ""We have also found that defendants in controlling or coercive cases rely on tactics such as GPS tracking and monitoring phone or email messages. ""The use of the internet, social media and other forms of technology to humiliate, control and threaten individuals is rising."" The report also showed that in 2015/16: :: There were record numbers of rape prosecutions (4,643) and convictions (2,689) in 2015/16. :: Nearly 12,000 defendants were prosecuted for sexual offences other than rape, a rise of 22.5% on the previous year. :: Child sexual abuse prosecutions rose by 15.4% from 5,387 to 6,217, with convictions up 16.8% from 3,975 to 4,643."

The system - which could be ready by the end of the year - would offer a new online triage system for the NHS's 111 service. It would allow patients to get tailored advice or a call-back from a health care professional, the Department of Health has said. The move will be announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt at an NHS Expo event in Manchester, which runs today and on Thursday. He said: ""We live in the age of the smartphone, and we want the NHS to reflect that. ""Our new plans will make it easier for patients to get medical support and information they need, and should encourage more of us to use the growing range of online NHS services available. ""This is a way of supplementing patients seeing their doctor in a more conventional, face-to-face setting, and crucially it will give people more choice and the opportunity to access healthcare in a way that works for them."" The triage system is being developed with patients and clinicians and will be trialled before it is made available to the public. People would also be able to compare how their local health services perform in key areas including cancer, dementia and maternity care. It comes as a review into IT in the NHS is published. Professor Robert Wachter, who was commissioned by the DoH to look into the approach to the implementation of IT in healthcare in England, made a series of recommendations. He said: ""The NHS is a gem - delivering excellent outcomes at costs well below other international systems such as those in the US. ""However, for it to continue to provide a high quality and accessible service for staff and patients it simply must digitise. ""The one thing that the NHS cannot afford to do is to remain a largely non-digital system - it is time to get on with IT."" Mr Hunt outlined plans to introduce a new academy to train NHS staff in digital skills. In 2011, a scheme designed to create electronic patient records for use in the NHS in England was shelved."

Patricia Yurena, who won Miss Spain twice and was runner-up in the 2013 Miss Universe, also announced in 2014 that she was gay.

Mr Vaz also offered to pay for a Class A drug and discussed using the party drug ""poppers"", according to the Sunday Mirror. The cross-party committee is considering a review of prostitution laws. Mr Vaz also opposed government attempts to criminalise poppers. Mr Vaz, who has publicly apologised to his wife and children for the ""hurt and distress"" caused, was under pressure to quit. Committee members had threatened a vote of no confidence in him if he did not resign. The Labour MP, who emerged smiling as he left his London home earlier, said in a statement: ""Those who hold others to account must themselves be accountable."" He said it was in the ""best interest"" of the committee for it to conduct its business ""without any distractions"". ""This is my decision, and mine alone, and my first consideration has been the effect of recent events on my family,"" he said. On his way to meet senior committee members behind closed doors, he was asked by Sky's Robert Nisbet whether he would be prepared to talk the media afterwards. Nisbet said Mr Vaz replied: ""Why would I want to speak to you when you say such nice things about me?"" and seemed relaxed. Senior Conservative MP Tim Loughton has been appointed interim chairman until a successor is elected, probably in October. He said Mr Vaz gave a ""very frank"" account of what had happened and would no longer be on the committee. Speaking to reporters at Portcullis House, the Conservative MP said: ""The committee listened, I think, in sadness to what Keith had to say and with a good deal of respect. ""Keith has clearly acted in the best interests of the Home Affairs Select Committee and the important work that we do. ""With sadness we all accepted that that was the appropriate course of action that he has taken and we also appreciate the many challenges facing him personally and his family."" Members applauded Mr Vaz as he left the room afterwards. Mr Vaz still faces a possible investigation by the Commons' sleaze watchdog over the allegations. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has indicated there is no need for Mr Vaz to stand down from the party. A decision on his future on the party's ruling National Executive will be discussed and ""partly made"" by the MP himself, Mr Corbyn said. Former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has been tipped to take over as chairman of the Home Affairs Select committee, given that he is the ranking Labour member. Speaking to Sky News' Adam Boulton, the MP said: ""I don't think today is the right day to be putting myself out there as a future chair of the committee. ""I will make my intentions known in due course. ""But it would be incredibly disrespectful towards Keith on the day of his resignation to start manoeuvring."" Along with the sex allegations made by the Sunday Mirror against Mr Vaz, the paper also claimed money was paid into an account used by one of the escorts by a man linked to a charity set up by the MP. There is no suggestion the payment was made by the charity or that its money was involved."

Her death was assumed to be of natural causes and the 28-year-old was buried in a nearby cemetery. But a subsequent inquiry concluded Ms Shahid, who is of Pakistani origin, had been raped and strangled. A police report released on Tuesday accuses Ms Shahid's father, Muhammad Shahid, of standing guard while her ex-husband Choudhry Mohammad Shakeel raped her. The report said the men then committed a ""premeditated, cold-blooded murder"". The pair were arrested last month but have not been formally charged. They appeared in court on Monday in the eastern city of Jhelum and were ordered to held for 14 days pending charges and trial. The report also seeks the extradition of Ms Shahid's mother and sister from the UK. Muhammad Shahid and Choudhry Mohammad Shakeel were arrested in Pakistan last month. The initial inquiry into Ms Shahid's death was ordered by the Pakistani government after her second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazam claimed the woman had been the victim of a so-called honour killing. Mr Kazam said Ms Shahid's family lured her back to Pakistan by telling her that her father was critically ill. Ms Shahid's family were opposed to her second marriage, Mr Kazam has claimed. The couple had been married for two years and were living in Dubai. On Saturday it was reported the policeman who initially headed the murder investigation had been arrested over allegations he tried to conceal evidence relating to Ms Shahid's death. An estimated 1,000 women are killed every year by family members in so-called honour killings in Pakistan."

Gordon Lyons MLA, from the Democratic Unionist Party, praised police for the discovery and said the materials found ""would have caused a catastrophic loss of life"". Earlier this year, police made similar finds at two other locations near Larne: Carnfunnock Country Park and Capanagh Forest. Ciaran Maxwell, a Royal Marine, appeared in court earlier this week charged with a number of offences linked to those earlier discoveries. The 30-year-old, who is originally from Larne, denies the charges."

A rescue vessel operated by MOAS (Migrant Offshore Aid Station) was radioed by the Italian Coast Guard just after 5am on Monday. Over the following three hours, more than 1,000 people were rescued - including three babies - in an operation that involved numerous charities and the Italian Coast Guard. Three babies rescued and a number of older children. Cared for here by @moas_eu staff. @SkyNews pic.twitter.com/VXWKfBNEWy MOAS Onboard Operations Officer Marco Cauchi said: ""Today it was intense for the fact the rubber boats were jam-packed... they put as many people as they can... they put in 160 people it was incredible. ""These boats are built to only take 100 people. It was dangerously loaded. ""People were jumping out, fumes were coming up, people were fainting, so it was horrible."" :: Why Do Migrants Make The Risky Journey? The Responder vessel, operated by MOAS, began its rescue just after 5.30am (local time).  A small rescue craft was dispatched from the larger ship, heading out into the dark towards the dim single light of the migrant boat. As we approached, what at first looked like a tiny dinghy quickly revealed itself to be a large dinghy with 160 people on board. Initially, the rescue went to plan. The MOAS team distributed life jackets to the migrants, tried to calm them down and manoeuvre them towards the Responder ship. From the centre of the rubber dinghy we could see two babies being held high by their parents. As the Responder ship moved itself closer to the dinghy, the migrants panicked - brought on by a combination of the fact that it was dark, many of them can't swim and some had inhaled toxic fumes from low quality fuel on their boat. In seconds, a textbook rescue turned into a nightmare. The migrant boat, filled only with air and completely inappropriate for the open seas, partially capsized. At least 20 people fell into the water. It was impossible to count the precise number. The rescue team dived into the water - something they later told me they do only in extreme circumstances. Quickly we could see why. In their panic, some of the migrants overwhelmed one of the rescuers. He swallowed fuel from the migrants' boat and began to lose consciousness in the water. He was spotted by the rescue coordinator monitoring the rescue from the bridge of the Responder. He was rescued and has made a full recovery. But drifting out in the sea off our vessel, a number of dead bodies could be seen. With as much dignity as possible, they were recovered, brought aboard the Responder, placed carefully in body bags and laid in the ship's morgue. Over the next few hours hundreds more migrants, rescued on other ships, were transferred to the Responder, which will now sail back to Italy. There, the migrants will be processed and should have their asylum claims either accepted or rejected depending on which country they are from. However, this is a process which takes months and in some cases, years."
2016-09-07,"An hour or so after the British Medical Association announced strike dates for October, November and December, I was in Downing Street when Philip Hammond emerged from the front door of No. 11.",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160907063810/http://news.sky.com/story/junior-doctors-dispute-is-theresa-mays-first-big-test-10562064,"""What are your going to do about the pesky junior doctors?"" I asked him cheekily. ""Not my department,"" the Chancellor replied breezily, before turning on his heels and disappearing through the gate at the far end of the street, clutching his red box. It would be unfair to say that the embattled Jeremy Hunt lacks support from Cabinet colleagues as he prepares for yet more hand-to-hand combat with the increasingly militant junior doctors. The Prime Minister, when she broke her silence on the latest strike threat, did give her Health Secretary pretty solid backing when she accused the BMA of playing politics. But she did then have to correct herself after beginning her declaration of support by saying: ""Jeremy has been an excellent Health Secretary…""  Has been?  She immediately realised her mistake and quickly said: ""He is an excellent Health Secretary..."" But there's no doubt that there is some frustration among Conservative MPs - including ministers - about just how long this dispute has dragged on.  The first strike, after all, was back in January. And if the BMA carries out its new threat, the strikes will have been going on throughout the whole of 2016. Prime Minister Theresa May may have backed Mr Hunt publicly during her visit to a car plant in the West Midlands, but after a chairing a Cabinet committee on social reform - which the Health Secretary had been expected to attend - Mr Hunt was seen arriving at No 10, apparently for a meeting with the PM. A crisis meeting? Well, there was a meeting and the junior doctors' dispute is fast becoming a political crisis. So in that sense it could have been a crisis meeting. Not so, of course, according to Mr Hunt and his allies. ""A regular planning meeting, nothing to do with the strikes,"" a Department of Health source claimed, in what must rank as the quote of the day. When I repeated this to a senior Conservative MP who had just been in No 10 for another meeting, he roared with laughter, though he insisted the doctors' dispute wasn't a crisis - yet! Several hours later, a Department of Health source contacted Sky News again and rejected suggestions that Mr Hunt had missed the social reform meeting - he presented on mental health, the source said - and said the second meeting 'wasn't with the PM'. Mr Hunt's officials aren't denying, however, that he and the PM discussed the doctors' strike during the day. Has Mr Hunt handled the dispute badly? His critics in the BMA and the Labour Party claim he has, of course. But was it wise for him to be so macho after the ballot in July threw out the deal reached in May and announce that he would impose the new contracts in October? With hindsight, it looks like a clumsy move that has backfired. Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Diane Abbott, a Corbyn loyalist and devotee, has accused the Government of treating the junior doctors like ""the enemy within"" - the phrase Margaret Thatcher provocatively used to describe the miners in the 1984-85 strike led by Arthur Scargill. The new junior doctors' leader, Ellen McCourt, may be more militant than her predecessor, Johann Malawana, who quit after the July ballot. But she is hardly an Arthur Scargill. And are the junior doctors like miners? Hardly. Most look and sound like the sons and daughters of middle class Tories from the shires. Which is one reason why Jeremy Hunt should be wary.  The Prime Minister on the other hand, will be wary about being seen to show any sign of weakness so soon into her time in Downing Street. The junior doctors may not be the Chancellor's ""department"", as he put it - yet, unless he suddenly has to find some money to buy them off.  But every aspect of government is the Prime Minister's ""department"". And the battle with the junior doctors is Theresa May's first big test."

Mrs May said the team's ""phenomenonal"" performance at London 2012 changed attitudes towards disability and that the athletes would again make Britain proud. The exploits of Paralympians such as Dame Sarah Storey, David Weir, Jonnie Peacock and Ellie Simmonds captured the nation's imagination in 2012 and the Prime Minister backed the team to inspire again. In a video message, she said: ""Among the many special moments of the summer of 2012, there was nothing more inspiring than the way our Paralympics captured the imagination of the world, fundamentally changing attitudes towards disability. ""At the heart of that success was our brilliant Paralympics GB Team. As people from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland stood together, lining the streets to celebrate your phenomenal medal haul, we did not see disability but the most inspiring ability, talent, strength and determination. ""You brought our country together and showed us the best of what our United Kingdom can be. ""This year in Rio, while you may not see those same British crowds around you, I want you to know that we will be there in spirit, watching on our televisions and willing you on all the way. ""I know that again, you will make our nation proud, delivering sporting success for Britain and inspiring generations around the world. ""So I want to wish all of our Paralympic athletes every success and I say to the whole country 'let's super-charge the team and cheer them on to glory in Rio'."" These games will begin amid uncertainty over budgets and finances and dismay over poor ticket sales, volunteer shortfalls and downgraded facilities. London 2012, it seems, certainly will not be replicated in Brazil, but some of GB's key performers are confident they can achieve every bit as much as they did four years ago on home soil. ""We'll just focus on controlling the controllables,"" four-time gold medallist Ellie Simmonds told Sky News.  ""The reaction from the public after London 2012 was just incredible and we want more of it!"" Eleven of the 264-strong British contingent have competed at the Invictus Games, which were organised by Prince Harry for injured and wounded service personnel.  The Prince has sent them all a personal good luck message."
2016-09-07,Hauliers have criticised plans for the UK to build a wall in Calais as part of arrangements to contain migrants.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160907063810/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-build-13ft-high-wall-to-contain-migrants-at-calais-10568369,"The 13ft high barrier, which would stretch for one kilometre, will be constructed along the main motorway to the port in northern France. It is expected to cost £1.9m and is being built as part of a £17m package of measures. The aim is to add a further layer of protection against attempts to delay or attack vehicles approaching the port. But Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said: ""This latest proposal ... would be a poor use of taxpayers' money."" He said the money to pay for a wall ""would be much better spent on increasing security along the approach roads"". Steven McIntosh from Save the Children was also critical of the move, saying: ""Desperate children and young people will try to escape the camp to reach safety and a better life. ""It's vital that we ensure any security measures put in place in Calais don't put their lives at risk by pushing them into the arms of smugglers and people traffickers."" Lorry driver Andrew Lavender told Sky News: ""Better than that (a wall), give us a few soldiers to protect us going into port, with a number to get help fast and a secure area so we can check our vehicles without the threat of being fined."" On Tuesday Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill confirmed plans to build a ""big new wall"". He told the Home Affairs select committee: ""The security that we are putting in at the port is being stepped up with better equipment. ""We are going to start building this big new wall very soon. We've done the fence, now we are doing a wall."" Earlier this week, lorry drivers, shopkeepers, farmers and police officers took part in a blockade of the main motorway in Calais. They demanded the ""Jungle"" migrant camp outside Calais be demolished. The camp is home to 9,000 migrants living in squalid tents and makeshift shelters. The migrants have been throwing objects at vehicles travelling to the port to slow traffic, so they can get on to lorries bound for the UK. A Sky Data poll reveals that 63% of people surveyed believe Britain should take fewer refugees, a 16% increase from a year ago.  A total of 66% said they would not be willing for more refugees to move to their local area. The announcement of the wall comes as figures released last month showed that net long-term migration stood at an estimated 327,000 in the year to March. Mr Goodwill insisted the Government remained committed to its target of reducing that total to the tens of thousands. He said: ""The big challenge is our target which is to reduce immigration to sustainable levels. Sustainable levels means in the tens of thousands."" :: Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,833 Sky customers online between 26-31 August 2016.

2016-09-07,One of Britain's most iconic nightclubs - Fabric - has been shut down after its licence was revoked amid concerns over drug use.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160907063810/http://news.sky.com/story/iconic-london-nightclub-fabric-shut-down-over-drugs-despite-150000-petition-10568361,"The news was announced early on Wednesday morning, despite a petition to save the club received 150,000 signatures. Representatives of Fabric nightclub had gathered at the council meeting to make their case for the popular venue to remain open. But the decision was made after police raised concerns about drugs on the premises and the deaths of two teenagers from suspected overdoses. Last month the Met Police applied to the council for the licence to be reviewed amid ""concerns about serious crime"" linked to the club. DJ Jacob Husley, who has worked at the club's Sunday night party for the past eight years, said he was shocked and angry at the decision. He said: ""We are in shock. I am feeling a mixture of disbelief and anger and sadness."" He added: ""It would be a devastating blow for London and culture, and clubs across the UK. It sets a precedent."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan had previously said he was ""determined"" to do more to protect London's ""iconic clubs"". But he said that City Hall did not have the power to intervene in licensing cases like this one. He urged everyone involved to ""find a common-sense solution that ensures the club remains open while protecting the safety of those who want to enjoy London's clubbing scene"". Mr Husley said he could not say whether the club's owners will appeal but added that he hoped ""we are not finished with this"". A spokeswoman for the Met said: ""Police felt the need to act due to concerns about the safety of those attending the club due to the supply of class A drugs in the venue and the recent deaths of two young men linked to the club. ""We support this decision made by Islington Council's licensing committee. ""London has a world-renowned night-time economy and people should be able to enjoy it safely, without concerns of serious crime. ""The Met is committed to working in partnership with those responsible for this sector to ensure that this happens."""

Jones was one of the original members of the ground-breaking Python comedy team, which first appeared on television in 1969.  The shows ran for 45 episodes through the 1970s. He directed the films Life Of Brian and The Meaning Of Life, and he co-directed Monty Python And The Holy Grail with Terry Gilliam. John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman completed the troupe, which reunited most recently in 2014 for a series of shows. Chapman died in 1989 at the age of 48. Jones has the distinction of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python history, as Brian's mother Mandy in Life of Brian. ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!"" is a line which has been voted the funniest in film history on two occasions. Bafta Cymru has announced Jones is to receive a special award for outstanding contribution to film and television. A spokesman for the comedian, who was born in Wales, said: ""Terry has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a variant of frontotemporal dementia. ""This illness affects his ability to communicate and he is no longer able to give interviews. ""Terry is proud and honoured to be recognised in this way and is looking forward to the celebrations.""

2016-09-23,"Banks must shoulder more responsibility for money lost by people tricked into transferring it into a fraudster's account, according to a ""super-complaint"" by Which?",https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160923140836/http://news.sky.com/story/money-transfer-scam-victims-need-more-protection-which-10588960,"The consumer group said victims of these types of scams did not have the same type of protection as those using other payment methods. It is calling for the Payments Systems Regulator (PSR) to investigate. Bank transfers by UK consumers have risen from 100 million a year a decade ago to 70 million a month now, Which? said. But it said protections have not kept up, and there was no legal right for victims of fraud by money transfer to claim their losses back from the bank. Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns at Which?, said: ""What most of us don't realise is that if you're conned into paying ​out money to ​a fraudster you stand to​ los​e​ ​all of your money​, unlike when you use your credit or debit card​."" New research from the consumer group showed that 60% of people did not realise they had no consumer protection from their bank if they were victims of such a scam. The poll found 84% had used bank transfers to make payments and 9% knew someone that had made a transfer to a fraudster's account. Which? said the increasingly sophisticated nature of scams made it more difficult for consumers to protect themselves. ""People cannot be expected to detect complex scams pressuring them to transfer money immediately or look-alike bills from their solicitor or builder,"" the consumer group said. Which? said banks should take more liability in the case of money transfer scams, just as they reimburse those who lose out via credit or debit card fraud, or fraudulent account activity. That way they would have an incentive to develop mechanisms to stop the scams. Which? is calling on regulators formally to investigate the scale of bank transfer fraud. It also wants them to propose new measures ensuring greater protection for consumers and liability for banks. The PSR said it would examine evidence supplied by Which? and gather its own ""to build a clearer picture of the issue and decide a course of action"". It must respond to the super-complaint within 90 days."
2016-09-23,It comes as no surprise to see Dave Forsey being unceremoniously hoofed out as chief executive of Sports Direct.,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160923140836/http://news.sky.com/story/ashley-role-is-first-step-of-sports-direct-shake-up-10589168,"Mike Ashley, the company's mercurial founder, was always going to seek someone to carry the can for the torrent of embarrassments that the retailer has faced in recent months concerning its working practices. Analysts who muttered that ""mark my words, Dave is going to get thrown under the bus for this"" were given encouragement to believe this when, two weeks ago, the Sunday Times reported that Peter Cowgill, the highly-regarded chief executive of Sports Direct's rival JD Sports, had been offered Mr Forsey's job. Sports Direct did not even bother denying the story. Mr Ashley's statement in the stock exchange announcement confirming Mr Forsey's departure, that he feels ""like I have lost my right arm"", is sincere. Mr Forsey has worked with Mr Ashley man and boy and has been a devoted servant to the company where he has worked for 32 years. You do not work for a company for more than three decades, particularly in such a senior position, if you do not have the support and loyalty of the boss. And Mr Ashley is a man who values loyalty. He built this company up from a single sports shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire, alongside a closely-knit cohort of executives that included Mr Forsey and Bob Mellors, his long-serving lieutenant, who stepped down as finance director in December 2013 on health grounds after many years of service. Mr Ashley has struggled ever since to replace him. He soldiered on for the next 18 months without a finance director before appointing the long-serving Matt Pearson on an interim basis. Yet things could not go on as they were. After the investigation by the Business select committee into Sports Direct's working practices and corporate governance, the humiliating vote against the re-election of Keith Hellawell as chairman by Sports Direct's minority shareholders and the chaotic tour around the company's distribution centre at Shirebrook in Derbyshire earlier this month, during which Mr Ashley pulled out a roll of £50 notes during a search being filmed by the TV cameras, something had to change. The replacement of Mr Forsey - a very likeable man - by Mr Ashley is the first indication that, at long last, this most rumbustious of entrepreneurs has realised that it is high time Sports Direct began to look and function like the public limited company it is. Mr Ashley was chief executive in all but name and now, at last, he has that role. The next challenge for the business will be to appoint a strong chairman who is sufficiently robust to keep Mr Ashley in line. Mr Hellawell is not that man. The question is whether there is a company chairman out there capable of doing so."
2016-09-23,It was a big morning for fans of The Great British Bake Off with news that one of its stars will stay and one will go.  ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160923140836/http://news.sky.com/story/great-british-bake-off-will-it-suffer-same-fate-as-top-gear-10588569,"Mary Berry has decided to remain with the BBC ""out of loyalty"".  Her fellow judge Paul Hollywood, cynics might imply, is following the dough and the show to Channel 4. In its current berth on BBC One, Bake Off is enjoying record figures and the public seem to love the programme more than ever.  So what will its future hold?   Shortly after it was announced that Bake off was moving channels, and that presenters Mel and Sue would not be going with it, various tweets speculated that Channel 4 had spent £75m on a tent. But it's unlikely that the channel's chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, did not have a plan. It may be that she values the format more than the ingredients involved. She's written of her desire to keep the show just as viewers like it: ""The Great British Bake Off will have a safe home.    ""The show of soggy bottoms and good crumb will be made by exactly the same team who have always made it. We love it just as it is."" But is this really possible without Mary, Mel and Sue? Part of the programme's popularity and appeal has been the chemistry between judges and presenters - as well as with the contestants.  So will this be just another cooking show without Mel and Sue's banter? Could Channel 4 and Love Productions be following Top Gear down the route of the disastrous relaunch? Or can they learn from Auntie's mistakes? Jamie Oliver has already said he'd happily appear on the show, and there's been endless speculation about who else might be in the mix - with past winner Nadiya Hussain a favourite, as well as Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith. But the wider and possibly more important question is what damage this could ultimately do to Channel 4. Critics say that by poaching a rival's hit, it has undermined its argument against being privatised.   Their case is largely based on the channel's public service remit of championing shows that focus on innovation, diversity and new talent. So they could have more to worry about than who's in charge of the bread."

The West Yorkshire seat has been vacant since the 41-year-old mother of two was shot and stabbed to death outside her constituency surgery in Birstall on 16 June.

It was controlled up until 2009 by Icelandic retail conglomerate Baugur before the stake passed to national banks Landsbanki and Gitnir on its bitter collapse. Iceland founder and chief executive Malcolm Walker later completed a management buyout in 2014. The company said on Friday: ""Iceland Foods has traded under the Iceland name in the UK since 1970, and is today one of the UK's most recognised brands. ""We have also traded as Iceland for many years in other EU countries, and in non-EU countries, including Iceland itself.

But the product is being blocked by ""morality police"" using heavy-handed EU and government regulations, says the Adam Smith Institute. 'Alcosynth' has been developed by Professor David Nutt, famously sacked as the UK drug tsar for his comments about the drug ecstasy. The drink is a derivative of benzodiazepine - commonly used to treat anxiety disorder - but does not cause withdrawal symptoms. It can be formulated to limit its potency, leaving drinkers only mildly intoxicated, rather than drunk.  Experts believe it could eventually completely replace alcohol and potentially save thousands of lives. Although much research has been conducted, it could still be several years before it reaches bars in the UK. Sam Bowman, executive director of the Adam Smith Institute, said over-regulation was preventing such products from entering the market. In a new report - Sinnovation: How markets can solve public health problems - the Institute calls for ""innovation"", not regulation. ""It's innovation not regulation that got us e-cigarettes,"" he said. ""They emerged and prospered in spite of regulation, proving to be the best way to get people to quit quickly that we know of. ""Other products like synthetic alcohol and reduced-risk tobacco products promise to repeat the success of e-cigs for new people, but only if we let them."" Public health officials are mindlessly pursuing abstinence campaigns, while ignoring life-saving risk reduction products, the institute says. Mr Bowman continued: ""It is crucial that the government does not stand in the way of hangover-free alcohol. ""Regulation must be flexible and encouraging of new products that are safer than the vices they're competing with. ""Britain can be a world leader in safe alternatives to alcohol and cigarettes, but we need regulation that foster those things instead of stamping them out."""

The youngster's mother Fiona MacKeown said she planned to appeal, saying: ""I am disappointed with the verdict and I will definitely move to the higher court."" The 15-year-old's bruised and half-naked body was discovered in shallow water on Anjuna beach in February 2008. A post-mortem examination showed there was ecstasy, cocaine and LSD in the teenager's body. It was claimed D'Souza and Carvalho had plied her with drugs, raped her and left her unconscious on the beach where she subsequently drowned. They denied the charges.  Police initially dismissed the teenager's death as an accident. But they opened a murder probe after Ms MacKeown pushed for a second post-mortem examination which proved the girl had been drugged and raped. Before her death, Scarlett had been at a Valentine's Day party while the rest of her family had gone travelling.

This would be greatest among poor children, who are already under-represented at grammar schools, the EPI said. :: PM unveils grammar school expansion plans The gap between children on free school meals (FSM) attaining five A*-C GCSEs, including English and maths, and other children is 6% wider in selective areas than in non-selective areas, the study found. FSM pupils in selective areas who do not attend grammars perform worse than the national average. But the EPI found that, at a national level, there did not appear to be a significant attainment penalty from not attending a grammar school. David Laws, EPI chairman, said: ""It is clear from our analysis that creating additional grammar schools is unlikely to lead to either a significant improvement in overall education standards or an increase in social mobility. ""Indeed, without far more success in getting poor children into grammar schools, the total attainment gaps between poor children and richer children could well increase."" Mr Laws added: ""Our analysis shows that there is a risk that in those areas with large numbers of selective places, more grammar schools will, on average, reduce the results achieved by poorer children."" Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, urged the Prime Minister Theresa May to abandon her plans to overturn the existing ban on allowing new grammar schools to open in the wake of the report. She said: ""This report could not be more timely, and its conclusions could not be more devastating for the Government - that there is no evidence that overall educational standards in England would be improved by creating additional grammar schools. ""Theresa May has embarked on a disastrous policy of re-introducing grammar schools without a shred of evidence that it will achieve her laudable aim to increase social mobility."" A Department for Education spokesman said that it would ensure new selective schools prioritise the admission of pupils from lower income households or support other local pupils in non-selective schools to help raise standards. ""We know grammar schools provide a good education for disadvantaged pupils, helping to all but eliminate the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers, and we want more pupils from lower income backgrounds to benefit from that."""

It also identified racial and other forms of discrimination alongside more isolated cases relating to physical harm, including once incident that required police action after a replica gun was held to her head. Shelter said its survey showed clear problems with a minority of landlords in England while a group representing the property owners insisted they were often victims too. ""Rogue landlords are causing misery to the lives of renters by committing these civil and criminal offences,"" Shelter said. The charity's helpline adviser, Danielle Goodwin, added: ""Every day at Shelter we speak to people at the end of their tether after a law-breaking landlord has caused chaos in their lives. ""These range from instances where the renter has been unaware of their rights, to cases where renters are exploited and subjected to terrible experiences by a minority of law breaking landlords."" ""Too many people simply don't know their rights as a renter.""

Items involved included lithium ion batteries - the kind that can be used as spares for mobile phones and tablets - as well as a small can of Dove deodorant and Tresemme hair mousse. Martin Goudie, prosecuting, told the court: ""Under the right circumstances the batteries, even new, undamaged batteries, could overheat, potentially causing burns, explosion or a fire."" Judge Michael Grieve said there were ""few and comparatively minor contraventions"". He said the jury verdict reflected ""findings of systemic failure, albeit as a result of human error"". The judge added that he had to take into account the ""massive resources of the company"".  Amazon UK Services - the subsidiary that was the subject of the prosecution - had turnover of just under £1bn in 2015, and made a profit of £38m. Charges covered four shipments between January 2014 and June 2015. Amazon was cleared of one other charge while a jury failed to reach a verdict on six others. The items were discovered when cargoes were screened by Royal Mail ahead of their intended departures and seized before they could reach the aircraft. Amazon UK Services was prosecuted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for breaching aviation regulations. The court heard Amazon tried to ship a lithium ion battery to Jersey on a day before 7 January 2014, and a flammable gas aerosol to Romania on a similar date. Another shipment, destined for Ireland on a day before 17 July that year, contained another aerosol, while Amazon illegally tried to send two more lithium ion batteries to Northern Ireland between 12 May and 3 June last year. From 2013, Royal Mail had sent letters to Amazon about possible breaches of the warning. Amazon said in a statement after the guilty verdict that safety was an ""absolute priority"", it was confident in the processes it had developed to detect potential shipping hazards, and would continue to work with the CAA. The company came under fire over its UK tax bill last year when it emerged it had paid just £11.9m in taxes while taking £5.3bn in sales. Last year, Amazon's global annual sales surpassed $100bn (£77bn) for the first time."

2016-09-23,A professional hunter and his client broke down in tears after needing seven shots to kill an elephant they had spent four days tracking. ,https://web.archive.org/https://web.archive.org//web/20160923140836/http://news.sky.com/story/namibia-trophy-hunter-says-he-is-helping-elephants-survive-10588781,"Sky News joined Jofie Lamprecht on a trophy hunt in the north of Namibia after two years of trying to get permission. His American client had paid for permits to hunt in three conservancies in the Zambezi Region - over woodland savannah with some open flood plains as well as thick forest near the Chobe river.   He wanted to hunt a range of animal including buffalo, zebra and leopard, but his priority was elephant. ""We will be hunting very selectively,"" Mr Lamprecht told Sky News, ""We will only hunt old or mature elephant bulls that have bred already and are near the end of their life."" He told us we might have to follow the tracks of around 100 elephants.  :: Prince William: A 'moral duty' to stop the trade in ivory It took four days of following elephant spore and tracks before he settled on one set which he hoped would be appropriate.  ""This is a big track and its in a herd of about 30 bulls,"" he said. ""It's potentially very good.""  When we finally caught up with the herd, one old bull was singled out. The drawback for the client was it only had one tusk, the left one had broken off.  ""It's got to be the biggest bull we've seen all year,"" Mr Lamprecht reassured him. They stood watching the elephants eating just 30 metres away, silent and unmoving. The aim was to kill the animal with one bullet - a quick death - but it didn't quite work out that way. The client fired the first shot and it struck the animal on the shoulder. Mr Lamprecht followed up with another shot which, he thought, struck its leg.  The animals reared up in startled fright, bellowing. The professional hunter let out a roar and the elephants backed up and ran.  The injured bull broke off on his own - and the hunters followed in close pursuit.  ""This is not what I would have wanted,"" Mr Lamprecht said. ""Now it is even more dangerous because the animal is wounded and frightened and they can become very aggressive. But we must find him."" ""To put him out of his pain?"" I ask. ""Yep,"" is the reply. More than four hours later we catch up with the wounded animal, but it takes a further seven shots to finish him off.  The last one is carried out by the client kneeling just feet away. ""Shoot him between the ears,"" Mr Lamprecht shouts. He seems anxious to end it now. Afterwards, both professional hunter and his client are in tears. ""We do it because we love them,"" Mr Lamprecht said.  His client is propped up against the elephant carcass, tears running down his face. He can hardly talk, he is so overcome.  The hunt came as Namibia - along with South Africa and Zimbabwe - fights for the right to trade in raw ivory, despite a far more drastic reduction in African elephant numbers than previously thought.  The Great Elephant Census, conducted by Paul G Allen's Vulcan Inc, found a decline of 30% in populations in 18 countries in just seven years - between 2007 and 2014. That is the equivalent of one elephant dying every 15 minutes. From Saturday, African countries will meet for the CITES gathering - or to give it its full title, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora - to try to thrash out a way forward in order to save the elephant.  A group of 29 countries, under the banner of the African Elephant Coalition, wants a permanent ban on the international trade in elephant ivory. But authorities in Namibia, in particular, are railing against the ban because their elephant numbers are increasing.  They also fervently believe their emphasis on trophy hunting as a business ensures the animals have a value which reduces the incentive for locals to take part in poaching or killing for meat. The latest government statistics indicated the contributions from trophy hunting to be around the $70m mark. The money is used to create jobs - usually in the hunting or tourism business, such as support staff in lodges, trackers, and trainee hunters or rangers.  The meat from the elephant is distributed to the communities living nearby. Half an hour after Sky News witnessed the elephant being killed, crowds of villagers arrived armed with machetes and knives to skin the animal and cut up the meat.  The head and tusks are loaded onto the back of a pick-up and taken away to be secret location where the ivory will be guarded until it can be cleaned up and shipped to the American's home.  The rest of the animal is butchered over several hours, loaded onto the back of three other pick-up trucks and we accompany one to be dropped off at a village community. By this time, it is dark. But the villagers are waiting outside excitedly.  ""This is the first time we have had protein in a year,"" one said. Mr Lamprecht said: ""We tracked this elephant past a village. ""No-one in the village will harm him because they know this is the hunting industry which is helping them - providing jobs, work, wealth and food.  ""Its called sustainable conservation and Namibia is a model for the rest of the world. We are helping our elephants survive this way. We put a value on them which means the whole population is anxious to preserve them. It's working here."" It is a controversial argument - and one which is going to be difficult to win."

Sightings in UK waters are rare, with the last significant strandings being in 2009 and 2012. The species is most commonly found in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Indian and Pacific oceans, but there was a spate of strandings in Ireland just a few weeks ago. MCS spokesman Peter Richardson said: ""We don't receive reports of Portuguese man-of-war every year, but when we do they can turn up in big numbers, usually around about this time of year. ""In the last couple of weeks we've received several confirmed reports of Portuguese man-of-war stranded on beaches around Cornwall and the Scilly Isles. ""With the earlier strandings in Ireland, these recent sightings could herald the arrival of more of the creatures as they get blown in from the Atlantic."" Contrary to popular belief, the Portuguese man-of-war is not a jellyfish, although it is closely related. The creature is actually a siphonophore - an animal made up of a colony of organisms working together as one. Its stings can be agonising and, in extreme cases, lethal. They have ""tentacle-like polyps"" which can be tens of metres in length, and it is these that give the sting, said Dr Richardson. ""A stranded Portuguese man-of-war looks a bit like a deflating purple balloon with blue ribbons attached, children will find it fascinating,"" he said. ""So if you're visiting a Cornish beach this weekend, it's well worth making sure you know what these animals look like and that no one picks them up."" One of the animals was discovered at Portheras Cove, near Morvah, Cornwall, by volunteers of the Friends of Portheras Cove environmental group during a beach clean. Group member Delia Webb said the creature was discovered lying among plastic debris. ""We find all sorts of strange and unusual items at our tiny Cornish cove, and we have had strandings of Portuguese man-of-war before,"" she said. ""They look amazingly beautiful, with hints of pink and blue, but thankfully we were aware of the potential danger lying beneath, and knew not to poke or prod it, just report the sighting to the MCS."""

Once Britain invokes Article 50 and informs the European Council it is leaving, it has a maximum of two years to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal.  Extra time could be granted, but only if the other 27 EU states agreed. But Mr Johnson said it was possible the process of leaving could be completed quicker than some expect.

Mr Johnson also revealed more details about the Government's Brexit plan and hinted there could be free-movement sweeteners offered to non-EU countries as part of any trade deal, such as more visas and work permits. Sky News Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said: ""He first said such an idea was 'cobblers' but quickly backtracked when it was pointed out that Australia's Foreign Minister told Sky News that a free-trade deal with the UK would mean more visas for Australians to live and work there. ""(MrJohnson) refused to say if this is a concession that might be offered to India - an economic powerhouse that is part of a growing number of nations looking forward to the UK leaving the EU and opening its markets to goods made in the subcontinent.""

Shelby had been on her way to a domestic violence call when she saw Mr Crutcher's SUV abandoned in the middle of a city street.

If convicted she could face a minimum of four years in prison. Mr Crutcher's family said he posed no threat. Police said after the incident that Mr Crutcher did not have a gun in his vehicle. Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said: ""The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community. ""It's important to note that despite the heightened tensions felt by all, which seemingly beg for an emotional response and reaction, our community has consistently demonstrated the willingness to respect the judicial process."" Arrangements are being made for Shelby's surrender."
